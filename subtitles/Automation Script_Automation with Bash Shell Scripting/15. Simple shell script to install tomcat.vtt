00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.000
Friends here we're implementing

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.110
a simple shell script to automate the installation of any Tomcat.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.890
First, I will go with the particular version of Tomcat offer that I will

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.435
modify our shells care so that it will work for any version of your Tomcat.

5
00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.385
Let me open my terminal.

6
00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.385
So here I'm creating a directory called Palm cats.

7
00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.095
So let me navigate into that.

8
00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:23.580
So in this location,

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.305
I will install my different Tomcat versions with the help of a shell script.

10
00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.260
Now, before writing your shell script,

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.350
always first get the manual steps for your requirement.

12
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.240
Means manual commands.

13
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.180
Suppose if you want to install your Tomcat firstly,

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.255
how to download or tar.gz file,

15
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:45.950
then offer that you have to extract it.

16
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.065
Then if you want to rename, you can rename it.

17
00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.270
Let me show you them step-by-step.

18
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.070
I need to get a URL first to download my required Tomcat Washington.

19
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.195
Then go to official website off your Tomcat,

20
00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:01.865
simply such with the Tomcat.

21
00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:04.445
Then very first link you'll get

22
00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.525
official website for your Tomcat in just click on download.

23
00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.835
On the left side you have download option.

24
00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.370
Then from that select your required Tomcat Watson.

25
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.650
Let me click on suppose Tomcat cat ate.

26
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.470
Then the right side just come down.

27
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.190
So somewhere choreographing here you have a tar.gz file.

28
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.405
Just to do the right-click on that and select the link location,

29
00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:29.555
copy link location, then come back to your terminal.

30
00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:32.540
Simply run W, get that,

31
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.075
copy the URL. No, see the result.

32
00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:39.920
It is downloading that particular Tomcat tar.gz file.

33
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.180
So once it is downloaded,

34
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.600
then we'll go with our next steps. Just wait for that.

35
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.670
Yes, it has been done.

36
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.995
Then simply run LSF analyte?

37
00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.125
Yes, it has been downloaded.

38
00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:58.025
But this is the downloaded file with the tar.gz that I want to extract it.

39
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:04.955
Simply write thought I fund you or Apache Tomcat tar.gz.

40
00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.135
And now see that it has been extracted with this name.

41
00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:10.130
But I don't want to keep this name simply.

42
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.500
I want to keep it as Tomcat eight.

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.695
Then you have to move it Apache Tomcat to Tomcat eight.

44
00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:22.910
Now see the result you are having only Tomcat 800 DO download tar.gz.

45
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.990
Now let me remove your downloaded tar file.

46
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.880
Now you're having Tomcat aid.

47
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.150
Right now, just runs history command and see the result.

48
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.710
What are the commands you ran?

49
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.870
Just to copy them and paste it into your file first.

50
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.070
And remove the remaining commands.

51
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.070
Actually we need only W get command,

52
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.470
then extract ping command,

53
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.865
then renaming, then remove the download tar.gz.

54
00:02:54.865 --> 00:03:00.970
So now if you want to install Tomcat ate only for Tom Catania, These are the steps.

55
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.250
Now let me write a shell script for this.

56
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.705
Before writing your shell script,

57
00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.240
Let me remove your Tomcat eight because I want

58
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.765
to install that with the help of a shell script.

59
00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:15.970
Now open shell script called install, Tomcat dot SH.

60
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.095
Then write very first-line us, shebang line.

61
00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:23.420
Then paste your four commands.

62
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.330
Let me remove that task spaces.

63
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.860
That's it.

64
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.930
Now savy and provide the exclusion permissions for your script.

65
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.200
Now run that so that it will download

66
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.430
your.tar file and it'll extract it and it will rename it.

67
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.335
And then finally it will remove the downloaded tar.gz.

68
00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:49.610
Those are the four steps.

69
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.915
Now these four steps,

70
00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:52.310
we are running through a shell script.

71
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.640
That's it.

72
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.065
Just wait. Once it is completed.

73
00:03:57.065 --> 00:03:59.870
Our requirement has been reached for concrete,

74
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.275
not for other versions than that.

75
00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.375
Only Tomcat eighties there.

76
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:11.075
Now if you see content in Tomcat eight,

77
00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:13.280
yes, content is there.

78
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.670
Now, if you open your shell script,

79
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.700
these four steps or four your Tomcat eight.

80
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.265
Suppose if I want to install Tomcat nine,

81
00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:25.955
then again I how to modify these Tomcat nine URL.

82
00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:28.970
And here also I need to modify some nine versions here.

83
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.940
Also here also I need to modify for steps.

84
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.505
But if it is a shell script,

85
00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:40.505
it should work for any Tomcat versions in such a way it has to develop.

86
00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:44.195
Now for that, I am working, observe that.

87
00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:48.275
So guys, now I'm modifying the script such that it will work for any Tomcat version.

88
00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:52.985
So I'm taking a variable called required Tomcat,

89
00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:55.295
where n equals 2.

90
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.175
First let me go through this butler version only.

91
00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:02.450
That is, let me take that is a washroom, right?

92
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.025
Washington is always a string.

93
00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:07.340
Eight dot phi dot 4-7.

94
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.085
Anyway, you don't have spaces in your string,

95
00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:11.480
then no need to take quotations,

96
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.700
but this is my practice.

97
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.490
Basically I will take quotations for your strings.

98
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.600
Fine.

99
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.500
Now, observe your URL.

100
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.929
This URL also I will store into some variable, let's say URL.

101
00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:28.880
I'm taking a variable name as URL,

102
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.670
And in that, I stored my URL.

103
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.125
But instead of writing a 2.5a dot for seven,

104
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:38.750
I can write this variable required.

105
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.840
Let me write simply REQ.

106
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.465
Now instead of writing a 2.5a dot 4-7 in terms of variable,

107
00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:54.695
I can replace this a dot-dot-dot 4-7 with the required Tomcat version.

108
00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:58.130
Now see that. Now I'm coming to here.

109
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.860
I'm modifying anti script in terms of variables.

110
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.320
Removed this H dot 47,

111
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.120
right, with your dollar.

112
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.620
Curly braces required, Tomcat,

113
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.605
Wusheng, close your curly braces, matching.

114
00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:16.925
And if you observe somewhere you are having once again a dot phi dot 4-7.

115
00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:19.685
Now let me remove that. There also,

116
00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:25.460
I am writing required Tomcat. What?

117
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.080
Fine.

118
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.860
Now, if you observe your URL except this remaining entire ease in terms of variables.

119
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.745
So that if I change this a dot for someone with a required version,

120
00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.200
automatically you are URL,

121
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.465
you are going to get for that particular version.

122
00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:44.135
Now let me try to modify these eight also.

123
00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:47.735
See if you observe what is the major version eight,

124
00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.145
that AD is there here.

125
00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:50.660
That means if you are watching,

126
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.285
the first character is you are writing here.

127
00:06:53.285 --> 00:06:57.215
Now that's why I'm going to get that in terms of variables.

128
00:06:57.215 --> 00:07:03.620
So Tomcat, I'm defining one more variable, Tomcat, measure version.

129
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.315
I'm taking singly major version to see guys, you know,

130
00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:14.600
if our aid simply echo dollar required Tomcat version,

131
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.470
you will display the content on that output playing cut command.

132
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.395
And we'd help A5 and see I'm getting first character,

133
00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:23.120
say from a previous concepts,

134
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.680
I am writing this current command.

135
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.540
And this entire thing is a command.

136
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.115
That's the reason whenever if you want to assign the command or put in the variable,

137
00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:33.995
you had to write that command inside of dollar parentheses.

138
00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:39.260
Or you can also use in place of dollar parenthesis backstage. Both are valid.

139
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.380
Now, just come to here 882,

140
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.600
number eight and remove that,

141
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.045
just that also write in terms of variables,

142
00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:54.890
that is Tomcat measure version, that's a fine.

143
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.859
Now, wherever you are having versions,

144
00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:00.650
further versions already we have in terms of variables, right?

145
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.250
C.

146
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:13.070
Now here also, I'm reading required Tomcat wash. And then here

147
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:22.145
also I will write dollar required Tomcat Washington and in the same lane, Tomcat eight.

148
00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:24.155
What is the eight hour major version?

149
00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:29.690
Just write that in terms of Tomcat measure.

150
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.080
Shen, latch it in last.

151
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.430
And also we want to remove the download tar.gz c a dot for dot a dot phi dot 4-7.

152
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.990
That is there in terms of a variable.

153
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.140
No, let me write Tomcat Washington.

154
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.810
That's a fine.

155
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.324
Now, except to first-line remaining all are in terms of variables.

156
00:08:52.324 --> 00:08:55.550
So whenever if we change this value automatically,

157
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.260
the remaining data will be changed.

158
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.950
Right? Then, see, you have written you are URL in the,

159
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:10.505
sorry, you have to remove this w get because there is only one.

160
00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:16.660
Now, I want to download that URL then simply write w get dollar URL.

161
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.200
The meaning for this is W get in place of dollar URL.

162
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.830
It will replace this entire line so that you are downloading W,

163
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.745
get that URL that say, now let me save it.

164
00:09:27.745 --> 00:09:31.945
And let me remove your existing Tomcat eight.

165
00:09:31.945 --> 00:09:37.165
Now see your script once. And I'm running back.

166
00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:43.575
Say there isn't. It is downloading.

167
00:09:43.575 --> 00:09:46.730
So first time verifying for Tomcat egg version,

168
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.720
then later we'll work with Tomcat any required version.

169
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.460
That's it.

170
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.980
Now verify that in the current location

171
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.605
where it has been created on contained or not, yes.

172
00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:02.750
You can see the content into that.

173
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.960
Yes, it is there. Now, same script.

174
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.685
Suppose if you want to work with the nine,

175
00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:12.215
just to go to first-line and modify your required version.

176
00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:16.505
Let me go to your URL page.

177
00:10:16.505 --> 00:10:19.560
Suppose I want to download Tomcat nine.

178
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.620
Sorry, I'll go onto documentation.

179
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.000
We want to download, right?

180
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.160
Yeah, Tomcat nine click on that.

181
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.465
Right-click.

182
00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:33.580
Copy link location. First, verify that.

183
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.530
What is the difference between your Tomcat 89 link only we have Tomcat eight link.

184
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.190
Now, I pasted it with Tomcat nine.

185
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.980
Verify these 22 lines are same except your versions see here,

186
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.170
here, eighties, they're here, nine is there.

187
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.305
You are complete version main.js B27 is there.

188
00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:55.330
And the many places you are,

189
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.075
except you are watching until you are the same.

190
00:10:58.075 --> 00:11:02.140
That's why simply I am replacing here that version.

191
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.550
That's it. Now let me save it and run our shell script.

192
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.720
Now see the result.

193
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.850
It has been done.

194
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.885
Right.

195
00:11:19.885 --> 00:11:21.715
Now. Check it.

196
00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:26.480
Go Tomcat nineties there and see the content in Tomcat nine.

197
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.420
Yes, it is there.

198
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.200
And here, I don't want to

199
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.180
provide the version of your required Tom get

200
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.150
inside of a script directly while running my script itself,

201
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.335
I want to provide the Washington.

202
00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:46.690
Yes, there is a possibility for that as of no.

203
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.910
Just observed that while going forward, we'll discuss that.

204
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.130
Let me come in the first line.

205
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.900
Then. Just I am writing some modification here as of no, don't worry about this.

206
00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.040
There is an option to provide your required Washington from command line.

207
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:06.820
Will discuss about this in detail in our further sessions as Huffman, just observe that.

208
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:12.115
So before that, I'm removing Tomcat a ton Tomcat nine.

209
00:12:12.115 --> 00:12:15.805
Naturally no need to remove before installing.

210
00:12:15.805 --> 00:12:20.680
You can also check whether Potter Watson is already there in your hosts or not.

211
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.930
So for that you need some advanced level concepts.

212
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.155
We'll discuss that further sessions. For time being.

213
00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:28.525
You just assume that there are no tom Get versions.

214
00:12:28.525 --> 00:12:33.690
Now I'm running our Tomcat script just by providing the required version.

215
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.235
Let me get Wusheng.

216
00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:43.355
Suppose nine version 99 dot-dot-dot 27.

217
00:12:43.355 --> 00:12:45.380
See simply I'm poverty.

218
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.320
Nine dot dot 27.

219
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.060
No need to open a script. No need to.

220
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.340
Eddie was kept directly while running your script itself.

221
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.820
Again, poverty we're washing. It will work.

222
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.740
And while running your script,

223
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.410
suppose if you are not providing the version number,

224
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.105
then how to handle.

225
00:13:02.105 --> 00:13:05.000
So for that also, you need some advanced level concepts.

226
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.270
We'll discuss that in our further sessions for timing and

227
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:14.310
just consider a simple shell script to install any Butler Tomcat versions.

228
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.360
Okay, yeah, once it is done,

229
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.400
we'll get our DOM, get nine bunkers.

230
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:27.155
That's a fine guys.

231
00:13:27.155 --> 00:13:29.370
Thank you for watching this video.
