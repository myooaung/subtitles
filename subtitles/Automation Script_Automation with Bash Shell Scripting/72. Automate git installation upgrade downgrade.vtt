00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.425
Friends here we're going to see how to

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:07.425
automate installation of gate through your shell script.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:11.250
Simply automate, get installation friends.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.215
Before coming to this video,

5
00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.600
please watch these two videos.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.140
First one is a video and this 1 second 1 is

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.905
simply a script for this video in terms of functions,

8
00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.500
the code is there within this document.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.400
So you know, what is the purpose of this just simple shell script to get

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.045
all the good versions from your official get SCM website.

11
00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:34.525
So in our current state,

12
00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:37.080
this is the off of the part then remaining party just

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.725
installation of gate based on required geared towards men,

14
00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:42.265
which has been provided by the user.

15
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:45.395
So first of all, let me open my script.

16
00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:50.975
So I have a script that he'd just to install your good.

17
00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.795
So what is the purpose of this script is,

18
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.465
First, let me run it once and see the result.

19
00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.895
Please run this script from root user.

20
00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:02.705
So actually I want to install Git using tarball.

21
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.735
Whenever if you want to install Git to using your thought ball,

22
00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:09.740
you should be the root user or you should our root privileges.

23
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.195
So I'm selecting the first one.

24
00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.905
So whenever if I want to run this bit,

25
00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.150
I should be the root user.

26
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.090
That's what I have given a condition inside of my script, no,

27
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.285
let me enter into root. Now I am the root user.

28
00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:24.155
Now I can run this script, right?

29
00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.630
So the purpose of this shell script is,

30
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.985
I assume that you don't have any Git on your host.

31
00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.905
Then your cell scriptable,

32
00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:33.695
install, fresh installation of your gate.

33
00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.510
If you have already a gate,

34
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.305
then it will ask update or downgrade your good fortune.

35
00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:42.215
Then based on the Washington which you want,

36
00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:46.520
based on that, it will try to upgrade or downgrade your deed version.

37
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.665
And you don't need to worry about the list of

38
00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:52.175
available GET versions which are there with your official website.

39
00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:53.615
Our shelf tube itself,

40
00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:58.625
it is going to get all the way to get Washington's.

41
00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.400
See, let me run it and see the output.

42
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.465
See, I included this shell script in terms of,

43
00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:09.095
I mean I implemented the shells could be in terms of functions.

44
00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:13.880
Now foster part is getting available graduations from your official website.

45
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.830
And as of now on my host I how to dot 6.25x1 Shen, right?

46
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.235
So do you want dot-dot-dot downgrade? Yes.

47
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:23.855
Suppose yes.

48
00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:25.775
Then what is your record version?

49
00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:31.040
So I want to go with the two dots six dot geo version downgrade.

50
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.700
If you wanted to go with any upgrade Foo.main dot four or whatever it may be,

51
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.629
you just select from your available good versions.

52
00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.735
Right now I'm entering, now see the result.

53
00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:43.730
It is going to download that file.

54
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.050
It is going to extract it,

55
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.280
it is going to configure it,

56
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.585
it is going to compile it.

57
00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:49.910
And finally it is going to install it.

58
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.640
See whenever if you want to install any tar ball,

59
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.640
you have some steps on your Unix-like systems.

60
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.995
So you need to download the tarball,

61
00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:04.710
then tar.gz file, then extract it.

62
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.005
After that, enter into that extracted file,

63
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:13.680
then CD extracted directory.

64
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.210
Then configure it, then compile it, then install it.

65
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.145
So these are the steps.

66
00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:31.210
So these are the steps you need to install any tar file on your Unix like systems.

67
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.200
Right now are shall keep performing those steps.

68
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.745
So once it is done,

69
00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:39.655
then you will get your latest are required.

70
00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:43.015
Guassian maybe don't get all upgrade based on your requirement.

71
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:48.040
Now, our shelf KP's having ease having capability to download and install,

72
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.240
fresh installation or upgrade any good version which is there on your host,

73
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.535
or downgrade any good version which is there on your host.

74
00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:59.645
So these three things PowerShell script will do.

75
00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:01.700
I'm going to show you only one step,

76
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.620
but you can run the same shell script on

77
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.385
your host by simply without having any existing gate,

78
00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:09.515
then your shells could. We'll install your good.

79
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.675
Again second time, just tried to run.

80
00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:14.510
Then it will show the existing version and it will ask,

81
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.340
do you want to update our downgrade?

82
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.040
Then if you want to upgrade or downgrade just to provide

83
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.795
your input with the required version so that it will downgrade or upgrade.

84
00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:25.880
Now see the result previously,

85
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.580
how something washing called 2.2x dot two, something like that.

86
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.630
But now you've got what's 0.6s dot-dot-dot, write.

87
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.800
See guys.

88
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.005
If I try to run our shelter, escape,

89
00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:38.840
if you already get Wusheng phosphate is

90
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.515
going to connect all the G20 actions from your official get esteem upside.

91
00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.330
Once it is done,

92
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.250
then it is finding on your current ghost What is the latest current gate toward shannon?

93
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.740
Now what I'm doing is I'm going to remove my git version on my host.

94
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.110
So how am I get here?

95
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.110
Just I am removing that.

96
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.325
No, I'm running.

97
00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:08.945
So if you run your PI,

98
00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:11.105
your shells could won't display this thing.

99
00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:13.385
So previously you how some Guassian,

100
00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.305
that's why D showing something like

101
00:05:15.305 --> 00:05:18.155
could R6 dot-dot-dot then you want to upgrade or downgrade.

102
00:05:18.155 --> 00:05:20.060
Now as of now, do we have any good version?

103
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.505
Now, just now we remove the hostilities that which get, let me check it.

104
00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:28.850
User local bin get removed this too as well.

105
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.360
User local. Who've been good.

106
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.835
Now, I don't have any intuition.

107
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.110
Now if I run our shells,

108
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.060
gives you that what is the output you're going to get?

109
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.240
So guys, for colors and date and everything,

110
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.940
I included some functions concept, it's very simple.

111
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.680
See that now you are getting select Guassian to install its means fresh installation.

112
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.950
But previously, if you observe here, current version is there,

113
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.135
but you want to upgrade or downgrade,

114
00:05:56.135 --> 00:05:59.765
but now you're not getting that message because I don't have any good on my host.

115
00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:03.875
Now you can set up any one of that 0.943c available.

116
00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.790
See that D it is they're only available for you to watch and see how to select.

117
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.850
Nobody's going to download and extracted,

118
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.500
then configure, then compile,

119
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.735
and then finally it will install.

120
00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:16.100
Right?

121
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.770
So guys, in this shell script I also taken

122
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.400
k. Suppose while installing if something goes wrong, then

123
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.460
I want to replace with incase.

124
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.620
If there is any wold washing which is there on your host,

125
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.590
then I want to replace that with old version.

126
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.030
So for that I have taken a backup.

127
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.900
And finally, I tick if it was I mean,

128
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.885
if it installing, you are required to get or not.

129
00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:43.580
If it is not installing, then I will replace with your old version with backup.

130
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.750
Right?

131
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.860
So once it is done,

132
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.000
then I will show you the script.

133
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.215
So guys, next, moving further in this video,

134
00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:55.115
please try to download our script from you are.

135
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:58.980
So I'm going to upload this here.

136
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.300
Okay? So here you will get a resource directly.

137
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.485
You can download your shell script.

138
00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:04.835
You just download this.

139
00:07:04.835 --> 00:07:06.020
Okay, once if I upload,

140
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.970
you will get option to download this shell script.

141
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:13.325
First download that shell script, then simultaneously practice.

142
00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:17.240
Along with this video, try to practice your shell script on

143
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.875
your host so that you'll get the idea how to implement this shell script.

144
00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.750
Right? So once it is done,

145
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.980
then I will go and do,

146
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.980
I will do the steps to practice how you can understand the shell script,

147
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.885
how you can implement the shell script.

148
00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:32.420
Anyway, it is going to install your good.

149
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.850
Meanwhile, let me show you here.

150
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.425
Just go top first.

151
00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.570
So guys, these are the,

152
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.690
this is some variable just to get the number of columns.

153
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.850
And these are the some functions.

154
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.330
First tried to copy these functions as it is.

155
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.925
So the purpose of first functioning just to get a date as per your required format.

156
00:07:55.925 --> 00:08:00.155
Then second is just to display information in terms of red color.

157
00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:01.910
If you call this function with

158
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.330
argument and that argument I am replacing here with a $1.1.

159
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.040
$1.1 means inside of a function,

160
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.220
the arguments which you are passing to this function.

161
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.870
So I want to print that.

162
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.775
So after that I am making default colors.

163
00:08:13.775 --> 00:08:15.410
Same way if you call this function,

164
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.185
you will get your color, your message in green color.

165
00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:18.860
That's it.

166
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.710
And then here if you observe this is for header purpose,

167
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.550
and this is if you call this function with some messages,

168
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.970
your message will be displayed in the center of a line.

169
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.215
You see that now you got to 0.943c version on your host.

170
00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.820
That's fine. Now, let me implement your shell script line by line.

171
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.800
So I'm not going to implement completely,

172
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.980
but I'm giving you a clue how you can understand this shell script, right?

173
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:48.845
See install Git, I'm taking installer upgrade and downgrade,

174
00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:55.910
install, up, downgrade, get dot SH.

175
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.890
So very first thing,

176
00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.990
try to copy this as it is.

177
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:06.695
Anyway, author, you can place your name, right.

178
00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:07.910
Copy foster these functions.

179
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.170
These are the minimum functions,

180
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.740
the tree you required to display your message in terms of colors and to include

181
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.880
some date message in your message, right?

182
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.790
So first thing is what I'm doing is I should run this shell script you with user as.

183
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.035
Root.

184
00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:26.120
User is a default variable,

185
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.305
environment variable which will capture the current running user.

186
00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:31.865
So if it is root then okay,

187
00:09:31.865 --> 00:09:33.020
if it is not rude,

188
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.180
then I don't want to run my shell script then what I am

189
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.955
doing is if it is not equals to root,

190
00:09:37.955 --> 00:09:42.230
then I am saying to the user,

191
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.570
print, let me print in radical level.

192
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.745
Print the red. We have that function here.

193
00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:51.950
Very first, print red color.

194
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.055
And if you have done here, we have one more thing, get date and time.

195
00:09:55.055 --> 00:09:58.370
So before printing your message, right,

196
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.110
I want to print your message before your message with the date and time.

197
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.080
That's why I'm calling that function in your printer red.

198
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.270
So there's because of this, what you will get 0s,

199
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.740
you will get simply date and time.

200
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.090
Then offer that.

201
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:17.510
Please run this shell script with root user, that's it.

202
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.950
Then offer that I don't want to run.

203
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.540
If the user is not equals to root,

204
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.100
then I don't want to run.

205
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.300
Then simply exit, exit with some error code that's done.

206
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.960
Now see whatever the script you how let me exit from root install app down.

207
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.295
See that what you are getting.

208
00:10:33.295 --> 00:10:36.085
Please run the shells taped with root user.

209
00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:40.210
Suppose if I run with the root node is not going to give anything,

210
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:45.475
because now you satisfy the required condition for your user to run your shell script.

211
00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:49.315
Then if you're running with the root user,

212
00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.625
then I want to call main function.

213
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:57.325
Let me take else block though here I'm going to call main street main function.

214
00:10:57.325 --> 00:11:00.620
So somewhere I'm going to define main function now.

215
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:07.270
Right now here onwards what you will these just simply write main, main function.

216
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.770
So the very first line in main,

217
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.885
What I'm doing is I'm cleaning my screen.

218
00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:14.620
And then after that, what I'm doing is while earning your shell script,

219
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.540
I want to do some header border so far that bring the header.

220
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:26.935
So this function will print your header based on the symbol which you hope given here,

221
00:11:26.935 --> 00:11:28.615
I am giving equal symbol.

222
00:11:28.615 --> 00:11:31.480
Then after that, print a center.

223
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.585
So I want to print some message at the center that is,

224
00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:36.580
suppose Welcome to get

225
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.785
installation gate instillation

226
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:47.050
through Bash shell script.

227
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.460
That's it, right?

228
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.380
Let me run it and see the output first.

229
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.990
So that is in this way you have to practice this shell script.

230
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.115
Something goes wrong end of the file or that.

231
00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:58.375
Let me check it.

232
00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:01.540
Yeah, else, fine then main,

233
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.540
main, Yeah, I need to close the function right with curly braces.

234
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.145
I forgot that. Let me close my function main function.

235
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.495
Now it's fine.

236
00:12:10.495 --> 00:12:12.880
Now let me run our shell script and see the results.

237
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.035
See you are getting some border.

238
00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:16.120
I'm header than Welcome to good insulation

239
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.730
through it by shells give you are getting in the middle of your line.

240
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.840
So offer this again.

241
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.205
I want to print this symbol.

242
00:12:21.205 --> 00:12:23.800
So that's why I'm using functions concepts so that I

243
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.280
can reuse the same function in different places.

244
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.800
So after displaying your message,

245
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.635
once again, call you or print a header.

246
00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:36.775
Now this time you can print your header with the different symbol.

247
00:12:36.775 --> 00:12:40.265
Let say I want to display with underscore.

248
00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:43.160
So you just to do one thing, step-by-step,

249
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.755
copy and paste your code in.

250
00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:48.440
Your required shall skip and then execute so that he

251
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.635
can see the purpose of each and every line,

252
00:12:51.635 --> 00:12:54.605
right, so far, so download this shell script,

253
00:12:54.605 --> 00:12:57.335
right, then come down.

254
00:12:57.335 --> 00:13:01.700
Then let me else,

255
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.410
I'm calling main function.

256
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.445
That's a right now main,

257
00:13:10.445 --> 00:13:14.720
Let me such Maine where man is there.

258
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.230
So somewhere you have main.

259
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.690
Just go to their main.

260
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.770
Clear.

261
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.860
So purpose of cleary nuclear command then print the header,

262
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.680
the purpose of print header in nothing but creating header.

263
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.800
Then print detect center V is a function which

264
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.565
will print your message in the middle of a line.

265
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:36.740
Don't forget about quotations.

266
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.860
You just private that without quotations and with quotations here and what will happen?

267
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.785
You just see that so that you can understand.

268
00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:46.310
Then I want to print something like printing color,

269
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.315
checking all the available good Watson's from official website, right?

270
00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:51.905
Just to copy this line.

271
00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:56.030
First, to do one thing, copy and paste it in your shell script,

272
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.710
whatever the script you are implementing.

273
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.865
So in main function you how to implement each and every line.

274
00:14:02.865 --> 00:14:04.105
Alright?

275
00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:07.345
So get datetime, is there already there to get your time?

276
00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:08.245
Right?

277
00:14:08.245 --> 00:14:10.990
Now let me run. You can save it, see the output.

278
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.595
So in this way, if you,

279
00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:14.170
if you exclude line by line,

280
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.000
you can understand Finally the concept.

281
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.250
So what is the concept I will give you?

282
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.530
And one more thing, offer this line.

283
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:25.045
What do you have inside of your original shell script which you are going to download?

284
00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:29.710
Download Git to wash shunts in full from official website.

285
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.750
So actually this concept I explain another was sed command, I mean here.

286
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.694
So very sed command, complete censored.

287
00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:39.775
Yeah.

288
00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:44.215
The concept of this video is nothing but whatever the function now we are calling,

289
00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:46.520
that is the concept of that video.

290
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.370
That's why you're forced to go through that video so that you can understand,

291
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.320
download good Watson's info.

292
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.025
Actually, this is a function as a phone nowhere we have that function to call.

293
00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:57.990
But if I run it, you'll get an error.

294
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.865
Let me run this and see the result.

295
00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:04.475
This function, actually it is a function.

296
00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:05.960
Functions are nothing but like a command,

297
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.470
command not found and then come here with your downloaded script,

298
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.475
such that by including parenthesis.

299
00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:15.185
Now the he's the function.

300
00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:17.840
Now copy this function and paste it in your script.

301
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.130
That's it.

302
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.760
And here, while copying,

303
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.820
right, tried to understand line-by-line in this function.

304
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.785
Let me write somewhere that main function.

305
00:15:30.785 --> 00:15:33.515
After that main, I'm writing this function.

306
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.540
So what is the purpose of this function?

307
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.095
Already, you know, in the, in our previous video, in this video,

308
00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:41.330
so that you can understand very easily if you go through this wheel,

309
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.175
I clearly explained here.

310
00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:44.360
That's it.

311
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.220
Now let me run it and see the output.

312
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.200
Yeah, you don't let it get washington file info.

313
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.405
So after that, what you have then come your main function where you, how Maine.

314
00:15:59.405 --> 00:16:03.890
So after this display all available gigawatts and signing to display this,

315
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:09.210
once again, open your shell script in your main function are this line.

316
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:15.590
Okay. You may feel hard while working with discrete,

317
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.360
but once you've successfully completed,

318
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.900
you will get lot of knowledge to work with your shell script.

319
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.630
Offer completion of the shell scripts of successfully.

320
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.205
Now if I run, you are getting another call,

321
00:16:28.205 --> 00:16:31.055
display all get Watson's command not found.

322
00:16:31.055 --> 00:16:33.710
Then whatever the file you downloaded in that just

323
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.830
such in this way by including at the end parenthesis.

324
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.510
Yes, you have a function here.

325
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.535
Just copy this function while you copy,

326
00:16:40.535 --> 00:16:44.070
try to understand what is the purpose of this function.

327
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:49.350
So in this way guys, you tried to understand this entire shell script.

328
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.870
Okay, just let me copy this function and then I will explain the final concept.

329
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.025
What is the, how am I,

330
00:16:55.025 --> 00:16:57.570
how I implemented this shell script?

331
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.430
C that it is going to collect all you are a good too watchin swarm of your,

332
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:09.245
from your official potassium website offer that it will display the list, right?

333
00:17:09.245 --> 00:17:10.190
That's it.

334
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.430
Now you need to add some more logic to read user request,

335
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.080
whether he wants to install or update our downgrade offer that right,

336
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.960
you need to install that package by downloading.

337
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:27.710
So what is my steps for these scripts is first I'm

338
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:34.850
getting all geared towards shuns from official website.

339
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.055
Then after that I am displaying them.

340
00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:39.350
So for display each and every step I am this,

341
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.060
I implemented like a function.

342
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.384
So display all get versions.

343
00:17:43.384 --> 00:17:49.580
Then next step is trying to read required a try to find existing get on

344
00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:56.240
your host if it if he were if we were host has any good find existing gate.

345
00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:02.180
If you hold then displayed that. After that.

346
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.000
If you already get on your host,

347
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.220
The meaning is, what is the purpose of your shells?

348
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:13.745
Companies try to display messages like already how so-and-so version.

349
00:18:13.745 --> 00:18:17.300
Now you want to, you want to upgrade or downgrade this,

350
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.415
then take information from the user.

351
00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:22.355
So downgrade or upgrade.

352
00:18:22.355 --> 00:18:24.934
So based on user request,

353
00:18:24.934 --> 00:18:27.570
See what I'm having here.

354
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.960
So display existing get info if phi how already existing info,

355
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.675
This function will give written code as 0.

356
00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:38.075
So if you don't have any existing gate,

357
00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:39.860
then this function will do it in code as

358
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.850
00 means you are trying to install new installation,

359
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.145
enter your required me to wash and to install.

360
00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:50.000
If you How then C that we wanted to update our downgrade,

361
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.560
great, that's what I'm displaying.

362
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.395
User will use some message conformation yes-or-no.

363
00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:58.205
I'm converting that the anterior thermo into lowercase with the syntax.

364
00:18:58.205 --> 00:19:00.680
Then after checking that, if user conformation is

365
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.290
yes means user wants to download all have great.

366
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.640
Then let me read that required git version from here.

367
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.440
Then I am reading that off the reading,

368
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.295
I'm comparing the given good question on other host.

369
00:19:13.295 --> 00:19:16.955
If both are equal, then I know I don't want to install I once again,

370
00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:21.965
because user is asking install the same machine which is already there with your good.

371
00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:24.635
That's why I just I'm stopping my script.

372
00:19:24.635 --> 00:19:26.420
If required.

373
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.540
Watson is less than which is there on your host.

374
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.725
That means you are downgrading, resisting the torsion.

375
00:19:33.725 --> 00:19:35.540
It's actually less than is the symbol,

376
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.940
but normally less than E know

377
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.155
redirection symbol to await that special purpose I included slash year.

378
00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:45.020
So if you take here parenthesis,

379
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.235
then no need to take slash.

380
00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:47.750
But if you take simply square brackets,

381
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.940
then you have to take slash less than symbol.

382
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.670
Anyway, or comparing given thing is less

383
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.165
than the existing Washington get on your host, then downgrade.

384
00:19:56.165 --> 00:19:58.850
Else means get whatever the user is given

385
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.250
that is higher than which is there on your host,

386
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.485
then that's why I want to update that Nazi.

387
00:20:03.485 --> 00:20:09.619
So for this, whether you want to downgrade upgrade procedure is same, yes or download.

388
00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:11.465
You are required to get the next started,

389
00:20:11.465 --> 00:20:16.905
then compile, configure, compile and installed. That's what I'm doing here.

390
00:20:16.905 --> 00:20:21.520
The quiet get I'm sending as argument and capturing that.

391
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.220
So before that, before proceeding with our get installation,

392
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.080
I am taking a backup of existing gate.

393
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.540
That's why I'm taking yet get installed location.

394
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.280
So here I'm taking a backup.

395
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.350
So this backup is nothing but just in case

396
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.180
if something goes wrong well, installing you are,

397
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.610
if you are unable to install the required Git on your host,

398
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.160
At least I need to keep adjusting good ASD.

399
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.515
That's why I'm taking this concept here.

400
00:20:41.515 --> 00:20:43.765
Then I'm checking.

401
00:20:43.765 --> 00:20:48.790
Then I'm finding automatically required git URL. Nothing is there.

402
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.320
If you go into any wash enough,

403
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.480
require good, then only this is that different one remaining you early same.

404
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.830
That's why automatically I am placing

405
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.640
the required gate to Washington which has been entered by the user.

406
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.145
Then automatically your shell script is going to form URL for your required intuition.

407
00:21:04.145 --> 00:21:05.690
Then I'm downloading that.

408
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.020
But before downloading, just I'm checking if it is already there.

409
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.925
I don't want to download. That's what I'm checking.

410
00:21:10.925 --> 00:21:13.549
If it is not there, then only I'm downloading,

411
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:15.320
then I'm going to extract it.

412
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.740
If it is all paid their executive file, I don't want to do it.

413
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.770
If it is not there, then only I am doing that extraction.

414
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.030
So finally, I'm checking DCC as well because you are downloading tar,

415
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.850
tar fall tar file,

416
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.750
you need to compile it to compare unity GCC.

417
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.580
If it is already there,

418
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.825
it won't execute yum install GCC.

419
00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:38.150
Fun way. If it is not there,

420
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.105
then only this line will try to install it.

421
00:21:41.105 --> 00:21:42.395
Gcc.

422
00:21:42.395 --> 00:21:44.780
After that you are moving into execute file.

423
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.569
Then you are configuring your compiling,

424
00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:49.265
then you are installing, that's it.

425
00:21:49.265 --> 00:21:51.590
So after doing all these steps, finally,

426
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.290
I want to display the latest Star current gate.

427
00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.645
That's what I'm doing here with the logic.

428
00:21:56.645 --> 00:22:00.665
If something goes wrong, then I am taking I am replacing with backup.

429
00:22:00.665 --> 00:22:01.745
That's it.

430
00:22:01.745 --> 00:22:04.850
So guys, what you'll do is take line by

431
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.105
line from the downward script and try to practice.

432
00:22:08.105 --> 00:22:09.395
If you have any challenges,

433
00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:11.990
please post your questions so that I will help you.

434
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.100
Okay?

435
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.560
Okay, guys, thank you for watching this video.
