1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,620
Prince here, our concept is connecting to a remote server or

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,795
simply how to login into a remote server from your local or working server.

3
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:13,215
Cup, go with any Unix or Linux systems.

4
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:16,095
By default, you have a command card,

5
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:20,430
SSH, or secure protocol.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,250
Using this command, you can connect with

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,660
your remote server or you can log in to your remote server from your local server.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,400
So simple meaning, let me take a simple example in this way.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,245
This is my local server.

10
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:40,910
Local server, and this is a Unix-like Unix or Linux system.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,440
And how some remote servers,

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,230
let's say remote server 100 to see if you know remote server

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,260
one username and password with

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,130
IP so that you can login into that by using multi terminal.

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,655
But my intention is I already login into one server.

16
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:01,910
And from here, I want to log into the server,

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,695
and I want to log into the server.

18
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:07,760
So now, who login from one Lennox or to other Linux?

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
I work from local solver to remote server.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,170
You have to use SSH.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,900
And here, we can use SSH in two ways.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,350
One is using password, password authentication.

23
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,385
Second one is using SSH keys are possible less authentication.

24
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,900
Let me go with one by one.

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,215
The very first one is using password.

26
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,449
I'll simply password authentication.

27
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:36,845
C, if you want to login with your remote server from your local server,

28
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:39,485
then how to use command in this way, SSH,

29
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:41,420
you're remote server username with

30
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,910
what user name you want to connect with your remote server.

31
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,725
So simply username and then remote server, IP.

32
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:51,110
And after that, if you enter it,

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,270
we prompt for password.

34
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,880
You have to provide the password for this username.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,090
Anyway, remote server, so that your SSH,

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,020
using SSH, you can able to login into that server.

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,595
Let me show you that.

38
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:07,070
So before going to execute this command first,

39
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,830
let me take my remote server support.

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,540
This is my remote server.

41
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,880
So let me manually logging into that.

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,880
I am opening some separate Git Bash and null data.

43
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,140
I'm logging in to what?

44
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,910
Remote server point.

45
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,550
Now, if you observe on my remote server,

46
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,695
suppose I'm having these many users.

47
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,700
Now I want to log in with this test user from my local server.

48
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,625
So now come to your local server.

49
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,625
If you want to login with your remote server,

50
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,765
SSH, with what user name you want to login with your remote server.

51
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,865
At the rate IP of that.

52
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,445
Let me take IP on my remote server,

53
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,980
that is public IP for AWS or worse,

54
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,060
then take it and nobody showing permission denied.

55
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,305
Why you are getting this permission denied.

56
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,075
And one more thing before going into that,

57
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:09,030
let me clear my old older data.

58
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,520
Go to whatever this link you will get.

59
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,470
Okay, now other than I want to log in with my remote server using SSH command.

60
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,575
Ssh SCU's are, are the rate you are, the more sever IP.

61
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:32,960
And whenever if you are trying to login with your remotes,

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,140
our very first time you are current server will ask,

63
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,345
are you sure you want to continue connecting?

64
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,655
You have to provide and this is called

65
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,745
fingerprint adding fingerprint to your local server?

66
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,745
Yes. No.

67
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:50,315
Yes. But you were remote server saying that permission denied,

68
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,565
you are not allowed to connect to the remote server.

69
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,700
There is some problem with your remote server.

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,315
Some setting, some configuration details, you have to modify that.

71
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:01,850
But in your real time, most probably you wouldn't get this error.

72
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,990
Because already by default that configuration is enabled Inuit remote servers,

73
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,405
I mean in US realtime.

74
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,375
Now, let me open your remote server.

75
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:18,410
Let me log in and do who see you are using SSH to connect with your remote server.

76
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:26,945
That's why you have to open SSL service related configuration file called SSE 2D config.

77
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:31,830
And if you search in this file with the password authentication,

78
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,035
you see that password authentication.

79
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,350
That means, even though you know remote server,

80
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,225
I mean this remote server.

81
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:52,085
Now if you want to connect from your local server using SSH on a remote server,

82
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,855
this value should be yes.

83
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:58,055
Otherwise, why using your SSH to connect with the remote server,

84
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:02,195
your remote server service doesn't allow to connect with your remote server.

85
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,795
That's why you have to make it this value as yes.

86
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:07,610
You can comment this line.

87
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,605
And if you come about two lines,

88
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:11,960
there is already by default password authentication, yes,

89
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,080
is there just enable it by deleting that comment line Hashim.

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,555
But now when you are remote server,

91
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,070
password authentication has yes,

92
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,860
that means now your remote server is ready to

93
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,655
connect to allow the connection using password for you,

94
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,455
for any particular user.

95
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:31,625
Now come back to your local server and let me try with once again.

96
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,710
But still you are getting permission denied.

97
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,800
That isn't whenever if we change

98
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,020
any configuration detail on

99
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,780
your remote server Related to that service, you have to restart.

100
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,360
You see system CTL, restart, SSH.

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,505
In case if you are using an HL7 or less than or equal to less than seven,

102
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:55,445
then you have to use Service command,

103
00:05:55,445 --> 00:06:02,475
simply Service, associate ED, and then restart.

104
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:05,185
So this command will work with your body

105
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:08,440
slotted shell less than seven and greater than or equals to seven,

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,255
but four greater than equals seven.

107
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:13,165
There is a new command called system CDL.

108
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,235
Use that. But for less than seven,

109
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,800
just use service, then service name restart.

110
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,885
But here while working with system CDMA,

111
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:22,375
system CTL, then your option than last service.

112
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,850
See they're very aware I'm writing, sorry.

113
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,379
But service will work with the wood all versions of Linux.

114
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,535
Fine.

115
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:34,285
Now, I restarted that SHE D Service on my remote server.

116
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:39,100
Now come to your local server and Cantor. Nobody's allowing.

117
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,750
Now you remote, somebody's allowing,

118
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,715
not just provide a password for your test to user on your remote servers. So that.

119
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:48,560
You can login with you or in more server.

120
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,425
Now am on remote servers.

121
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:52,325
Previously our IPs were not due,

122
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:56,300
these two for private IP new enemies, don't worry about this.

123
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,770
We are connected with the,

124
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,125
I mean, using test user.

125
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,360
Now we are on a remote server.

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,275
This is our local server from debt by using SSH,

127
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:10,010
some user and that it out host name or IP of your server.

128
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,440
We login with your remote server.

129
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,140
And in real time mission of providing IP anyway,

130
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,260
you fully qualified domain name for your server.

131
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,030
You just probably that instead of IP, you know,

132
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,580
some southern names are there in your real name.

133
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,265
You can provide introductory this IP address.

134
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:27,000
That's fine.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,925
Now, let me come out from your remorse at our local server.

136
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,785
I am using SSH,

137
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:38,155
some user at the red, you are more than one IP.

138
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:42,190
Suppose if I don't provide the user name here, it will work.

139
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,510
But conditioning that SSH will take

140
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,370
the default user name as the user which we are using on your local server.

141
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,150
See, let me remove this test user at the rate.

142
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,480
And I'm running without the providing end user name C

143
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,070
that it is taking by default user name for your remote server as the server,

144
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,915
which is data on your local server.

145
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,465
So that's why whenever if you want to work with partner user,

146
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:10,095
just provide SSH user name or the host name.

147
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:12,890
And if you want to login with your remote server by

148
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,740
taking the current server locals our username,

149
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,450
then no need to provide the user name.

150
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,660
But still you can also provide local server using them. No problem.

151
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,480
Whether it is automation you that are new user, you can probably,

152
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,300
that's where I log in with my lunch.

153
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,805
It will simply SSH.

154
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,460
I can also write in this way remote IP.

155
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,970
But make sure that here the mod user name is same

156
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:51,620
as local terminal user.

157
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,490
But always the better options in this way so

158
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,060
that you are having clarity with what user you are connecting with you anymore server.

159
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,345
And these two are asking password and you are providing password.

160
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:05,210
And before that in case whenever if you're trying to connect with

161
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,470
your remote server and in case you forget any error like permission denied,

162
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,135
then foster manually login with your remote server and see the content off.

163
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,870
You are essentially config file.

164
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,145
You just opened this file and somewhere you are having.

165
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,690
Let me do the steps.

166
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:32,190
So in this file, just to make it password.

167
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,370
Yes. Otherwise you are more sorrow

168
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,220
doesn't allow to connect with it from your local server.

169
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,585
That's fine.

170
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:44,150
So the the first way to connect with you anymore?

171
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,930
No, let me go into the second way that is using password list.

172
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,880
I'll simply possible less authentication.

173
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,050
As of now, we are using password to Canada with your remote server,

174
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,210
but there is a possibility to avoid

175
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,135
your password while connecting with your remote server.

176
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,115
It ODE using password you can connect.

177
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:09,320
But for that, you need to do some settings that sirtuins cost on your local server.

178
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,225
First, let me log in into my local server.

179
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,310
So this is our local server.

180
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,595
And a c as of now, these are the bad actors.

181
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:21,830
There is no directory called dot. That's fine.

182
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,985
I'll see there.

183
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:27,995
First I am generating the keys on my local server simply by using SSH key.

184
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:32,240
Jen, just under four times you are key.

185
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,590
No.

186
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,300
Such with LSI or not,

187
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,775
there is a directory called dot c. Whenever if you create a keys on your local server,

188
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,565
it will create it that it recalled dot SSH.

189
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:49,890
And in that if you see there are two files called RSA and ID, RSA dot pump.

190
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,005
Now this is called private key,

191
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:55,805
and this is called public.

192
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:59,015
If you want to work with your remote server.

193
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:02,240
First, you need to exchange this key with

194
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,540
your remote server with respect to your required usernames.

195
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,275
Suppose I want to work with test user on my remote server.

196
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:14,540
I mean, I want to log in with my remote server using test user without password.

197
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,005
So before that, you need to exchange this key with your remote server.

198
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:21,480
First, let me take my remote server IP from here.

199
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:28,535
Then SSH, hyphen copy ID on anybody more server.

200
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:30,455
I want to connect with the test user,

201
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,840
then at the rate that IP.

202
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,280
And whenever you do that first time we will ask password,

203
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,755
then test user I'm giving possible.

204
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:43,405
So your key as adequate or remote server, go to worry more.

205
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:47,660
Server. Ya know, our user is let me switching to test

206
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,340
user and may just say this is what our verification LSA.

207
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,175
So whenever you've seen your video remote server,

208
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:59,930
on your remote server also not SSH and editing midi creator, move into that.

209
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,615
See that authorized keys are there.

210
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:04,970
Now this is the key,

211
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,335
probably key which we share from a remote server.

212
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:13,025
Now, once you've shared your keys with your remote server,

213
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,805
now if you use SSH with your particular user,

214
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:20,300
then you need to provide password directory login and you

215
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,990
will see that now we are under more sorrow without asking password.

216
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,270
It is able to login to a remote server.

217
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,130
So for that what we did simply,

218
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:34,970
we generally keys and we exceeded them with your remote server, right, fine.

219
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,670
So what can we do this server,

220
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,170
I'm using this user.

221
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,855
But if you try to login with this username,

222
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:52,520
sorry, SSH automation or the rate.

223
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,015
Now it, when it won't work,

224
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:58,150
it will ask a password because singular keys

225
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,600
with testes or not with automation user on your remote server.

226
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,255
Now see that it will ask password.

227
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:06,025
You have to provide password simply,

228
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,665
whatever the password for that user.

229
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's say.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,580
But Cmd key you can exchange with any number of

231
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,790
servers are on the same salary exchange with any number of users saw.

232
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,815
So let me do that.

233
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,510
Exit from your remote server.

234
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,945
As of now we are on a local server. Let me do this.

235
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:26,035
Ssh hyphen copy ID,

236
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,865
theology on the server,

237
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:30,780
we exchange our propability Batiste user,

238
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,210
but same public-key can also share with automation user also on your remote server.

239
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,320
Nazi.

240
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
Sorry,

241
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,460
sorry, we're on remorse a 100.

242
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,100
Let me come all come to mozzarella.

243
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,150
Now, SSH icon, Copy ID,

244
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,745
automation with automation user,

245
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:00,650
I'm sharing my key.

246
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,215
See previously, for the same server,

247
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:06,095
you exceeded your public key with a test user.

248
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,545
Now Amex ending with automation user, yes.

249
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,930
But when sharing you will get very first time.

250
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,045
It will ask password. Once it is done.

251
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,380
Now from second time onwards,

252
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,295
whenever you try to login with your remote server with your partner username,

253
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:22,530
it won't ask possible, let's say.

254
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,125
Fine.

255
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:28,625
So this is the way how we can connect with your remote server using password.

256
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:33,470
And we told password simply password authentication and password less authentication.

257
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,460
Okay. Thank you.
