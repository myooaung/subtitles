00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.225
Friends here our concept is input and output commands for Shell script.

2
00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.625
Let me explain them with a simple shell script.

3
00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.850
So I'm taking a shell script called input-output dot SH.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.650
Let me open that and let me write the very first line as our shebang line.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.885
Then I am giving you a name called suppose arguments, something like that.

6
00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.050
Now my requirement is whatever the string is there in

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.205
your variable that I want to convert into uppercase and then I want to print that.

8
00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:36.390
So you know how to convert your data into uppercase directly.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.660
You can convert on display with the help of the echo command,

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.460
or you can take one more variable,

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450
let's say my name in uppercase.

12
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.425
Then you have a syntax for this promoter string operations,

13
00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:51.485
my name to cap symbols.

14
00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:54.230
Then let me display that.

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.210
You are name in uppercase. Ease.

16
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.730
Now I'm displaying our variable,

17
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.275
that is my name Upper,

18
00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:10.220
because in that only our converted data is there.

19
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.354
Our uppercase data is stored in my name uppercase?

20
00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:18.140
No, let me see you this and provide the execution permissions for this.

21
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.555
And now let me run that, see the result.

22
00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.790
So yeah, before running, see your code.

23
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.140
Now. See that is an Yes.

24
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.585
You are getting your data in terms of uppercase.

25
00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:32.530
And if you observe, you are getting your output by using echo command.

26
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.380
That's way. Ico is called output command for

27
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.540
your shell script allele we know about yet go in detail already we have seen about eco.

28
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.545
Fine.

29
00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:45.160
Now, if I run our shell script any number of times,

30
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.995
always you are getting output as Narendra only.

31
00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:50.020
But I have a small requirement.

32
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.795
That is, whenever if I execute my shell script,

33
00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.075
it has to ask enter your name.

34
00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:57.430
So whatever the name we are entering that name,

35
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.595
it has to convert into uppercase and it has to display.

36
00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:02.920
So already to display your data,

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.410
your name into uppercase, we have a lousy.

38
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.215
But only thing is whenever if you run your shell script,

39
00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:15.080
it has to read some data with the help of a keyboard while running your shell script.

40
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.820
Then how we can perform that,

41
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.335
how we can achieve that.

42
00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:19.655
Very simple.

43
00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:21.980
Let me open my shell script and I'm going

44
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.145
to comment or let me remove that very first line.

45
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.775
Now I am writing a command called read.

46
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:31.490
Read, then some variable name I'm giving.

47
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.685
So first upsell your core.

48
00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:37.835
And if I run that, see the result.

49
00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:39.680
It is waiting for something.

50
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.970
Your cursor is waiting because the very first line is shebang line.

51
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.840
Then next line is you have something called read, some variable.

52
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.940
So because of this, read,

53
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.390
your cursor will wait on your command line while running your screen.

54
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.055
And if you provide some data and,

55
00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:56.975
and if you press Enter keyboard,

56
00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:58.685
enter key on your keyboard.

57
00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:01.175
Then whatever the data we are providing here,

58
00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.680
that data will go and store into this variable.

59
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.620
And this variable we are converting into

60
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.235
uppercase on data and that data we are storing into these variable.

61
00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:14.750
Now see that I am giving suppose shell and I am pressing Enter key on my keyboard.

62
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.965
Now see there is a.

63
00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:18.650
Now if we run any number of times.

64
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.050
Each time you can provide different data.

65
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.285
That's it. But whenever if you run your shells kid,

66
00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:32.435
first let me open your script and I'm running our shelves to simply it is waiting.

67
00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:33.800
So if it is waiting,

68
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.590
we can't understand that what we have to do next step.

69
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.345
Then in that case, you can modify your read command in this way,

70
00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:47.614
simply read hyphen p. You can prompt some message.

71
00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:49.460
Enter your name.

72
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.230
You can add any message which is required for us to display on your command line.

73
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.940
Now, let me say this.

74
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.950
Now run this and see the output.

75
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.880
Now instead of giving empty line,

76
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.030
nobody is giving some information so that by using this information,

77
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.160
we can understand that we have to enter something.

78
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.755
So that's what is the by using hyphen p option,

79
00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.210
hyphen p in quotation,

80
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.790
just write some strings so that that string will display

81
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.685
on your command line while excluding read command.

82
00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:25.010
Now whatever the data we are entering here, again,

83
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.515
the data will go and store into my name.

84
00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:31.340
Suppose I am entering here shell scripting.

85
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.240
Then enter, see that you're getting in terms of capital letters.

86
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.905
So this is the simply input command for your shell scripts.

87
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:42.125
And here you need to remember one more thing.

88
00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:46.360
Suppose be clear.

89
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.705
If I don't take any variable name,

90
00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:52.645
I will do one thing I will comment entail core.

91
00:04:52.645 --> 00:04:54.970
So you know how to come into multiple lines,

92
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.475
less than, less than some name.

93
00:04:57.475 --> 00:04:58.660
You can give it any name.

94
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.205
So I'm taking my comment,

95
00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:02.500
then end with my command so that

96
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.335
the lines which are there between these two lines will come antenna.

97
00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:09.475
Now, there are no lines to execute a new shell script because we commented them.

98
00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:10.255
Fine.

99
00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:15.565
Now simply I am using read hyphen p, enter your name.

100
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.190
And I'm not providing any variable name.

101
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.200
If you don't provide any variable in your read command by default,

102
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.150
whatever the data we are reading with the help of

103
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.865
read command that will store in the variable called Reply.

104
00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:35.690
Now see that Berkeley, I'm displaying replay.

105
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.175
So replace the default variable for a read command.

106
00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:44.165
Now see that I am writing something. You are getting that.

107
00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:50.150
If you want to display some space in the output after giving this prompt message,

108
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.540
enter your name, you can write some space inside of your condition,

109
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.830
then that is actually clear.

110
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.975
Cat, say that there is now this code is commented, this won't execute.

111
00:06:02.975 --> 00:06:05.060
The very first line in your query is read.

112
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.255
So and read in that read we have hyphen p, some message.

113
00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:10.055
So whenever it is executing,

114
00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:12.200
it will just let this message first on

115
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.500
your command line so that we can understand what we have to end up.

116
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.140
So I had to enter, suppose some name, let's say shell.

117
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.850
And if there is no variable in read Command Line, by default,

118
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.025
there is a default variable called reply in that your data will store.

119
00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:30.485
That's why I'm displaying replay variable value.

120
00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:32.705
Mostly that isn't or getting that.

121
00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:37.175
So be clear, it is very important for interview question says, well,

122
00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:39.695
what is the default variable for a read command,

123
00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:43.250
capital letters replay is the default variable for a read command.

124
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:50.315
That's it. Let me do a very simple use case for a read command.

125
00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:51.590
So in our previous video,

126
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.455
we have done install Tomcat dot SH.

127
00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:57.560
And here, whenever if you want to change the Tomcat version,

128
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.780
we are opening the skip and we are editing the version number here.

129
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.880
Now instead of that, what I'm doing is I'm commenting the, this line.

130
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.880
And without buff read command, be clear guys,

131
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.445
I am writing v hyphen p,

132
00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:15.260
end there you are.

133
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.595
You can write any message here.

134
00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:23.390
And terroir required Tomcat to install git version to

135
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:33.335
install and take variable as required Tomcat version.

136
00:07:33.335 --> 00:07:37.160
So that while you're running your core and the way this is the first line,

137
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.795
you are going to do good by your shell.

138
00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:42.800
Then we'll display, and by seeing this information will enter some number.

139
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.290
And that number will store into this variable and

140
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.665
this variable we are using inside of our script so that your script will work.

141
00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:50.870
Now no need to empty your script now.

142
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.990
Just a run. So this is your shell script.

143
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.835
Just run your shell script.

144
00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:58.985
Then it is lasting enter your required Tomcat wash. And to Install.

145
00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:02.810
Now I'm entering suppose nine dot dot B27.

146
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.580
If you want to install any version,

147
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.325
just thought that version name here and enter.

148
00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:08.990
So that's it. It will work.

149
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.355
So that is the uses of read command, very, very useful.

150
00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:14.570
Okay?

151
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.030
So it will download and it will extract, and we have,

152
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.650
we know the steps from our previous video,

153
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.240
what is doing this script?

154
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.105
So here our concentration is only unburied command.

155
00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:26.970
Be clear about your read command.

156
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.870
Simply read hyphen p. You are

157
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.860
require misses what you want to display on your terminal while executing these commands.

158
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.640
And whatever the data you are entering on your personnel with the help of a key word,

159
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.175
that data, how to store into some variable,

160
00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:46.040
that variable we are writing, we are taking here.

161
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.470
That's right. Okay.

162
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.970
Okay guys, thank you.
