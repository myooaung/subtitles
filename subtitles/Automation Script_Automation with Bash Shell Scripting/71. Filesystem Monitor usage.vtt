00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.475
Hey, hi friends. In this video,

2
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:08.310
we are going to see one realtime script,

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.930
that shell script to monitor file system uses this agenda.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.395
You are having some n number of file systems, right?

5
00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:24.345
So here our requirement is in case if any file system reaches more than 60% US is,

6
00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.420
then I want to identify them.

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.465
So I want to identify, at the same time,

8
00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:37.920
I want to send a mail alert saying that so and so files or some sort of reached 60%,

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.955
more than 60%, right?

10
00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.105
I assume that you have some file systems, right?

11
00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:48.080
So whenever, if file system uses is

12
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.375
more than 60%, those file systems or how to identify are the same time.

13
00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.345
Whatever the file systems are reached,

14
00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:03.515
more than 60% those file systems information.

15
00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:05.210
I want to send a mail alert,

16
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.340
I wanted to send it as a male alert.

17
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.075
Right.

18
00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:09.980
So then how you can implement that.

19
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.020
So guys, just absorbed,

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.670
uh, let me open my ten ml here.

21
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.190
See, suppose on a Unix-like systems, right?

22
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.755
If you want to find the file system usage, right,

23
00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:22.145
you can run simply df, iPhone ph command.

24
00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:24.620
No, you just to consider what are

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.175
your valid Phi systems or whatever we were invalid file systems.

26
00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:30.575
In my case, I don't want to wonder this.

27
00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:32.255
You've got to adjust header.

28
00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:34.790
And I don't want to wonder these and these,

29
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.605
so I want to skip these 23123.

30
00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.005
Then suppose in my case I'm having

31
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.280
only one main

32
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.525
hyphens.

33
00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:17.255
In this video. We are going to write one,

34
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:23.310
a realtime script and that ease shell script to wonder PFI system usage.

35
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.400
C, Just agenda, you're having some N number of file systems.

36
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.270
So whenever, if any one of you or file system reaches,

37
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.990
suppose more than 60% usage ordered me based on your requirements.

38
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.710
Sometimes suppose if you want to monitor the file systems based on,

39
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.195
suppose if the file system reaches more than 20% also, right?

40
00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:46.925
It's based on your requirement, right?

41
00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:48.605
So nothing is there.

42
00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:53.900
If file system uses is reached more than your required value, right?

43
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.580
At the time, I need to identify all those who are file systems.

44
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.120
And at the same time I want to send a mail alert saying that so and so

45
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.120
file systems or reach this more than this percentage, right?

46
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.200
Okay, let me go and implement this script surveys on any Unix like systems, right?

47
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.140
If you want to see the file system information,

48
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.575
I mean its usage, you can then simply be of HIV-1 ph command.

49
00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.390
So in my case, if you have low,

50
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.295
suppose I'm having only one file system. Suppose route.

51
00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:30.065
One, just loginData in your realtime you how number of file systems.

52
00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:34.250
So in my case, I am going to assume this also suppose one file system,

53
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.430
okay, anyway, this is Main your file system, right?

54
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.870
So in my case, just for

55
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.660
your understanding purpose because I need at least two file systems.

56
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.610
That's why I'm concerned. This has your file system.

57
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.320
I mean, this also your file system.

58
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.655
And anyway, if you hear this line and this line on remaining these lines,

59
00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:53.495
you know, need because the amount of suppose you are required to file systems, right?

60
00:03:53.495 --> 00:04:03.365
See, what I'm doing is gripped hyphen v. Suppose I don't want to monitor this line.

61
00:04:03.365 --> 00:04:06.785
Then I don't wonder this line.

62
00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:09.785
Even I don't do wonder these lines.

63
00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:13.430
So that is what just I am removing them while running my command.

64
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.190
Now you are getting only these two file system suppose.

65
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.485
So even if we don't do wonder, wonder this right?

66
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:23.000
You just apply in this way. That's it.

67
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.330
So, but here I'm going to get only one file just on me if I do that,

68
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.340
you do also if I keep,

69
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.565
That's why just I am using that as one file system.

70
00:04:31.565 --> 00:04:34.220
Right? So just assume that now you have to

71
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.560
monitor these two files systems in your realtime.

72
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.020
You've run the same command as it is in this way.

73
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.295
Suppose, right, you will get your required file systems first.

74
00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:46.340
And if you observe here, this is uses, uses, right?

75
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.265
Usage 1%, 14 percent.

76
00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:51.650
So as of now my file system, you say z.

77
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.310
Suppose for this file system I'm having 14%.

78
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.210
Okay?

79
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.935
Now just assume that if you're filesystem is reaches more than 10%.

80
00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:02.180
So actually near real time,

81
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.890
you don't consider like 10% minimum.

82
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.480
We will consider suppose some 60%,

83
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.670
70, 80% percent likewise,

84
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.590
but here, suppose as of now,

85
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.740
our file system reaches more than a ten person.

86
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.580
So in that case, I want to use that threshold limit

87
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.945
as 10% So that I can write a script and I can show you how to get mail alerts.

88
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.835
But in your real time, right,

89
00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:27.560
you'll get you'll take the threshold value or your required uses.

90
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.610
A file system is at least minimum 60%, you will take it.

91
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.840
Fine.

92
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.910
So first the thing guys.

93
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.385
Let me run this command.

94
00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:38.900
So because of this command, right,

95
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.015
you're getting, suppose you are required to file systems.

96
00:05:41.015 --> 00:05:43.205
Now, I want to read one by one line.

97
00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:44.975
So I wonder, right greed this ln,

98
00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:46.595
and then I want to read this line.

99
00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:49.565
So after reading one by one line from this line,

100
00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:50.960
if this is the file system,

101
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.790
then this is the usage, right?

102
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.580
So if you conduct these foster field, second,

103
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.900
third 450 field is your usage, right?

104
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.295
Suppose if this is the line,

105
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:04.230
just assume that, right?

106
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.665
So I suppose if I want filesystem name than what I have to do,

107
00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:15.305
suppose I can use a RAW KR cut command.

108
00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:17.120
So here I'm going to use a doubly K command.

109
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.880
It's your wish. So printed $1.1.

110
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.975
What I am getting, yes,

111
00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:27.620
at the same time I want to get the uses of that file system.

112
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.979
Suppose let me take 5p, 1%,

113
00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.985
but I don't want to take here percentage than what I'm doing is with sed command.

114
00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:40.415
Alright, so I'm going to replace that percentile with nothing.

115
00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:41.960
So percentile.

116
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.659
Right. But it is percentile.

117
00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.995
So nothing globally that checked, right?

118
00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:51.635
So first tried to use this syntaxes.

119
00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:54.590
Let me write a shell script to get first of all,

120
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.765
your filesystem name on its usage.

121
00:06:56.765 --> 00:06:58.745
Then offer that I will explain you.

122
00:06:58.745 --> 00:07:08.345
Monitor file systems dot SH, right?

123
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.650
So you've been bash.

124
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.400
So guys, this command or put,

125
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.620
I wanted to go to my while loop.

126
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.275
Why read line.

127
00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:21.550
Right?

128
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.900
So let me do that.

129
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.075
Do done.

130
00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:28.090
So you can use your while loop in these wells, right?

131
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.225
So if you have a information file you can read from here.

132
00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:33.760
Otherwise, if any command is that you can run in this manner.

133
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.220
You can read line by line from the output of this command

134
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.010
using your Y look in this way, right?

135
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.455
So first thing just for your understanding,

136
00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:45.325
I am writing dollar line and then just I am giving sleep command,

137
00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:47.350
just non-interview e asleep command.

138
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:53.485
Actually you should not use, but just to use some idea for you, just, I am taking that.

139
00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:55.390
Let me run this script and see the output.

140
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.690
Yes, you are getting one file system offer that you are getting second system.

141
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.790
That's a, that means whatever the script you are having as

142
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.180
of now through which you are able to read your line-by-line.

143
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.340
Now, on each and every line,

144
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.330
I have to know the filesystem name on its usage percentile.

145
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:20.105
Like see, what I'm doing is filesystem name first-time taking equals to.

146
00:08:20.105 --> 00:08:23.795
If you remember, this is right.

147
00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:28.535
Echo dollar line filesystem name,

148
00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:35.480
a WK, print $1.1 in that line.

149
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.805
Foster Field is your filesystem name.

150
00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:40.559
For the same file system.

151
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.455
Usage.

152
00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:46.240
I am taking uses variable.

153
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.045
My if we take same thing.

154
00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:53.215
Fifth two field is the uses of the filesystem name.

155
00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:58.060
And then I want to replace whatever you have Person tail, right?

156
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.550
I want to replace that with empty.

157
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.290
That means I want to remove actually my percentile symbol from that.

158
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.125
So what I'm doing is I'm doing in this way.

159
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:14.005
Now, see that a co filesystem name,

160
00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:15.280
whatever the file system name is,

161
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.500
your file underscore name,

162
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:23.635
comma, then filesystem usage.

163
00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:26.915
I am writing file underscore usage.

164
00:09:26.915 --> 00:09:30.215
So guys, just I am fetching the information.

165
00:09:30.215 --> 00:09:33.200
I'm not, I included original logic.

166
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.315
Now. I will include a for some time.

167
00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:37.790
Now, whatever the code we have here, right,

168
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.400
let me run this and see the output what you are getting.

169
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.800
So my intentions from each and every line,

170
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.825
I want to get the filesystem name.

171
00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:49.130
So I can get now filesystem name from the foster field in the same line,

172
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.465
50 field, if we consider,

173
00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:54.350
you'll get usage, but in that you are getting percentile Now I am removing that.

174
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.175
I'll see the output, say file system named Tao and its uses one.

175
00:09:58.175 --> 00:09:59.480
Now if I just, I'm naming something,

176
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.680
then its usage is 14.

177
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.705
Yes. Now I'm able to get my file system names under their usage, right.

178
00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:13.295
Now what I'm doing is let me take file usage thresholds.

179
00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:15.950
Eco. Suppose in my case I'm taking ten days

180
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.535
because as of now my maximum faeces and mutations 14%.

181
00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:22.610
That's why I'm taking file system uses threshold value as ten,

182
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.685
but in your real time you will have minimum 60.

183
00:10:25.685 --> 00:10:26.570
Okay?

184
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.665
Now see, what I am doing

185
00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:38.330
is nondescript wonder,

186
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:38.765
right?

187
00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:46.680
Yeah, descriptor, Let me take filing system uses threshold.

188
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.925
Let's say suppose ten.

189
00:10:52.925 --> 00:10:53.765
Okay.

190
00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:58.535
Now what I am doing this, if, see that?

191
00:10:58.535 --> 00:11:02.930
If what toward the uses you hold in your hand.

192
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.100
Right?

193
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:11.490
If that uses these guerrilla band file usage threshold,

194
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:18.665
then what the time what I'm doing is I'm sending the information,

195
00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:24.605
I mean filesystem name, filename.

196
00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:26.310
If condition is satisfied,

197
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.755
it means whatever the file system you are getting, right,

198
00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:34.670
that file system uses is greater than threshold means if it is greater than

199
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.170
ten at that time, that information, right?

200
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.400
So what I'm doing is I'm going to store

201
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.920
this information into one file. So let me do that.

202
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:59.120
So some file system info dot TXT, close, right?

203
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.130
So before starting your script to,

204
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.160
because if all of the information is there that will be appended to this,

205
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.780
that's why I want to remove that.

206
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.835
So or simply I am doing this one.

207
00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:11.460
Now. See that as of now,

208
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:20.910
you don't have any file system uses dot TXT file right now I'm running monitor script.

209
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.540
So actually you should not include sleep command raise here,

210
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.510
but here just I included for you or understanding purpose.

211
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:35.000
So in now you got a file called file system info.plist observed that?

212
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.645
Yes, whatever the file system which is reached uses percentages greater than ten,

213
00:12:41.645 --> 00:12:45.920
then you are able to store that file system information to this file.

214
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.865
Right?

215
00:12:46.865 --> 00:12:50.570
So if something is there in this file means now, if,

216
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.740
if something is there in this file means there is a file system

217
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.925
which are reached more than your threshold value, right?

218
00:12:58.925 --> 00:13:02.780
So that is why what I am doing is I am including one more logic in your script that

219
00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.905
is less now let me remove your sleep command.

220
00:13:06.905 --> 00:13:11.615
What I'm doing is first let me find out content anywhere.

221
00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:15.634
File cat, file system,

222
00:13:15.634 --> 00:13:19.730
WC hyphen L. I'm counting if any number of lines or their,

223
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.710
right, if WCF and it'll count lambda of lines in this file.

224
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.090
If it is at least one,

225
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.885
then definitely you some file system which reach greater than ten.

226
00:13:29.885 --> 00:13:30.845
Right?

227
00:13:30.845 --> 00:13:33.290
So that's why I'm taking one more if condition.

228
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.315
If dollar.

229
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:39.770
Count value. If it is greater than 0, right?

230
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:46.710
Then I can say that a poll, I go.

231
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.495
Maybe sometimes many number of file systems are one file system, right?

232
00:13:53.495 --> 00:13:59.810
So some file systems usage

233
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:06.050
is more than threshold, right?

234
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:12.125
If you want to display what is that file system than simply combined here?

235
00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:16.740
Cat, you are filesystem info.plist.

236
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.225
I'll see that. Let me run this and see the script.

237
00:14:22.225 --> 00:14:25.610
Omen. No such file.

238
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.935
Let me open a cat.

239
00:14:35.935 --> 00:14:41.240
Files is infinite dxdy? Yes.

240
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.445
Okay.

241
00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:51.460
So initially you don't have that. That's why you are getting.

242
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.130
But note, although I don't want to display that in C,

243
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.645
for first file system,

244
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:59.560
you are not, I mean your file system is not reached the threshold value ten,

245
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.740
that's why there is no content in the file.

246
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.650
So after completion of while loop,

247
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.090
I will take these then that's better.

248
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.385
So after completion of your all while loops, right?

249
00:15:10.385 --> 00:15:12.005
I mean for all lines,

250
00:15:12.005 --> 00:15:13.700
then if you run your if command,

251
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.370
then that would be good.

252
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.975
So first I am wondering all file systems, and then after that,

253
00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.330
I'm checking if any filesystem is there in the file

254
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:30.215
means one of the file system or some other file systems or reach,

255
00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:34.115
you are more than the required threshold value.

256
00:15:34.115 --> 00:15:36.815
Now let me run. This is perfect.

257
00:15:36.815 --> 00:15:39.500
See that some files you,

258
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.230
some usage is more than threshold and what is their file system?

259
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:47.245
This one. Right? So again,

260
00:15:47.245 --> 00:15:50.830
this is just simply a cell script just to monitor

261
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.465
your file system usage and to monitor that you are running your shell script.

262
00:15:55.465 --> 00:15:59.440
But I don't want to run and I don't want to

263
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.890
observe my filesystem usage by running the shell script automatically,

264
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.375
I want to execute this script.

265
00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:06.790
Suppose for every one minute or every one hour

266
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.150
or every ten minutes each based on your requirement.

267
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.935
And if any file systems or reached more than your threshold value,

268
00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:17.560
I mean, usage of your filesystem there automatically.

269
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.090
I one-percent mainly not to send your main, right. See that?

270
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:27.880
What I'm doing is I'm writing as male command, send mail command.

271
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.090
Ok, I go, let me write.

272
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:38.140
Subject is suppose alert, right?

273
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.585
Let me do it in this way.

274
00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:43.180
Then I'm reading that.

275
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.720
So guys, why I'm using the CAD file system means I

276
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.320
want to read that file system and I want to send that content to my mail.

277
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:56.830
And then pipeline send email is the command I already installed

278
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:02.150
that LU with scripting to this male.

279
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.650
That's it. Let me save it.

280
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:13.075
And before going into that,

281
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:17.440
let me open my mail id and see that the asthma,

282
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.315
you don't have any mailers here right?

283
00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:22.270
Now, I'm going to run my script.

284
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.605
If something goes wrong,

285
00:17:23.605 --> 00:17:30.470
then we're now you've got some mail just waited and observed outwardly.

286
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.150
Just wait.

287
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.540
Is this

288
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.540
do with the scripting available gmail.com?

289
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:14.395
With scripting, sorry, invalid selector.

290
00:18:14.395 --> 00:18:17.630
That is, let me,

291
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.390
let me save it and run it.

292
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.565
Light.

293
00:18:35.565 --> 00:18:44.405
Not just refresh your mail and see the output.

294
00:18:44.405 --> 00:18:47.820
C, You got something, right?

295
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.345
So for this, right,

296
00:18:53.345 --> 00:18:54.470
for this file system,

297
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.660
you have reached more than 10% are

298
00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.390
actually whatever the required threshold you fixing your script.

299
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:08.795
Right? Oh sorry, not this right.

300
00:19:08.795 --> 00:19:13.200
So we monitor file systems, right?

301
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:27.940
So now, okay, you've done your script.

302
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.100
Like what the thing is.

303
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.080
I don't want to run the script and I don't want to

304
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.150
get mail alerts manually, automatically.

305
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.485
I want to run this script, suppose for every one minute or whatever it one hour, right?

306
00:19:38.485 --> 00:19:47.950
So for that, what you do is you need to schedule lip cron job for your script.

307
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:57.595
Right? So this is my complete descriptive path.

308
00:19:57.595 --> 00:20:01.930
So guys, you have crontab, right?

309
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.850
Let me read that file.

310
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.120
So just to go down and here you have five fields guys.

311
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.905
First is minute, second is Howard's, then month,

312
00:20:11.905 --> 00:20:18.310
then day, then date of the week, then days.

313
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.400
I want to run my shell script so it's better to provide you

314
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.600
are complete the bass line and the complete path.

315
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.910
So whereas here the syntax for cron W,

316
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.035
You have five fields.

317
00:20:29.035 --> 00:20:33.535
If I write all our star than your script will then for every one minute automatically.

318
00:20:33.535 --> 00:20:35.845
And based on your script, right?

319
00:20:35.845 --> 00:20:37.885
Whatever the script you how.

320
00:20:37.885 --> 00:20:40.915
So this script will run automatically for every one minute.

321
00:20:40.915 --> 00:20:42.985
And if this condition is satisfied,

322
00:20:42.985 --> 00:20:44.740
then you are sending e-mail alert.

323
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.880
So what you are sending, if something is there in this file when you will have something,

324
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.340
then this file when you will have something in his file,

325
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.305
if some of the,

326
00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:54.520
if any one of the filesystem,

327
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.410
which is greater than your threshold,

328
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.660
suppose ten, I have taken murder in real time.

329
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.145
You have to take more than that.

330
00:21:00.145 --> 00:21:03.430
I mean, num 60% you will take.

331
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.920
Right? Now guys, one more thing.

332
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.640
Whenever if you are scheduling it jobs, right?

333
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:16.540
So it's better to provide always complete path for your commands.

334
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:23.335
I mean, whenever, if your scheduling a job through contact,

335
00:21:23.335 --> 00:21:24.985
right at that time,

336
00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:27.120
it's bad to provide complete,

337
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.750
I mean, path for the word sendmail command,

338
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.850
otherwise, it may or may not work.

339
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:39.840
So now what I'm doing is I'm mentioning complete path, right?

340
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.260
See here guys, just now we edited your filesystem.

341
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.880
Now it has been installing new contacts.

342
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.595
Now if you want to see con tab my phone list,

343
00:21:52.595 --> 00:21:55.505
this is the contact US scheduled.

344
00:21:55.505 --> 00:21:57.140
This is the expression for a contact.

345
00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:02.730
The meaning for 5-stars is For every one minute automatically scriptable run.

346
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.970
Now, let me refresh it.

347
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.550
Let me remove this Popper one-minute automatically,

348
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:31.315
you will get your new mail alert.

349
00:22:31.315 --> 00:22:33.710
Ok. Just wait.

350
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.670
See that alert Yogi got right. See what is that?

351
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:49.120
Elect a 22.

352
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.670
Just know you got just under here.

353
00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.890
Now, again, after one minute automatically you will get one more mailer at I mean,

354
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.955
it was company is automatically I mean, through contact,

355
00:23:04.955 --> 00:23:09.155
you are monitoring your file system usage automatically for every one minute.

356
00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:11.930
So if you want to wonder for every one hour, right,

357
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.380
you need to modify your conjugate expression here, right?

358
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.600
It's very simple to understand your conduct anyway,

359
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.665
we'll post that crontab information as well.

360
00:23:21.665 --> 00:23:24.410
Okay. Meanwhile, if any idea,

361
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.240
you can easily understand contact.

362
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.630
So you, our intention is for every one minute automatically you are running

363
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.860
your shell script and you are monitoring your file systems, right?

364
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.050
Software every one mint automatical, Yes.

365
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.585
And now you've got one more main right?

366
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:43.085
Now what I will do is, yeah, it's hidden.

367
00:23:43.085 --> 00:23:46.100
If you want to suppose in your real time, Right?

368
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.370
It just scheduled this I mean threshold as

369
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.640
suppose minimum not by you if based on requirement.

370
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.680
So suppose in my neutron went,

371
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.310
we are monitoring all file systems which are reach

372
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.809
greater than 70% of usage at the time automatically,

373
00:24:02.809 --> 00:24:05.240
I want to, we want to get mail alerts.

374
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.640
So in that case we use this type of script.

375
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.040
Right?

376
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.065
So now if I save this, now,

377
00:24:12.065 --> 00:24:16.370
you wouldn't get now from now onwards you won't get any mail alerts because you

378
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:21.065
schedule your job and use Schedule the threshold limit as 70%.

379
00:24:21.065 --> 00:24:28.660
And as of now, no file system rage 70% because magnesium is 14%,

380
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.235
it is less than your threshold.

381
00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:34.075
That's why you won't get now mail alerts, right?

382
00:24:34.075 --> 00:24:35.740
So automatically based on usage,

383
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.530
if if your file system uses is greater than this,

384
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.620
then definitely you'll get an email alert based on your job.

385
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.120
Okay.

386
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.830
So guys, there is the simple script just to monitor some file system usage.

387
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.300
Okay. Okay, yes.

388
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.950
Thank you for watching this video.
