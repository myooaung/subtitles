1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,485
Friends here our concept is Windows subsystem for Linux,

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:08,070
or how to install Linux on Windows operating system.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,465
Let me start that.

4
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:14,265
Basically, Windows subsystem for Linux is an optional feature on Windows ten.

5
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:15,810
That means based on our requirement,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,790
we can enable or disable this feature.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,885
That's fine.

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:22,110
But why we need this window subsystem for Lenox,

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,685
There are so many advantages.

10
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:26,070
Let me go with one of the simple example so that you can

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,325
understand the uses of Windows subsystem for Linux.

12
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:34,875
Just assume that you are practicing it Python scripting on your Windows operating system.

13
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,490
And we know that Python scripting is platform independent,

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,310
that means same Python's cubic and execute what other operating systems as well.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,055
Now, I have a requirement that is,

16
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:50,150
whatever the Python script ve written on Windows operating system.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,120
Same script I want to verify on my Linux as well.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,055
So as of now I have windows.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,470
Now to get my lennox, We have different ways.

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,460
We can go with VMware or we can go with cloud and we can get your Linux operating system.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,190
Yes, I assume that I am going with cloud and I'm getting a Linux operating system.

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,730
Can now i how windows as well as Linux from

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,600
my job and I how my Python script on my Windows operating system,

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,940
not to verify my Python script on my cloud Linux operating system,

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,370
how to copy my script to cloud instance.

26
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,965
And once if we copy, you can verify that.

27
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,645
So here the problem is,

28
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:31,510
each time whenever if you want to verify your Python script,

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,900
you have to copy your script into your required operating system and then you can verify.

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:44,380
And second problem is suppose if you go with cloud instance, suppose.

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,360
So that is a command line.

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,810
I mean, we are going to connect with your cloud Linux system through terminal.

33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,745
So you don't have any GUI.

34
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:58,915
Know, suppose if you want to write your script using GUI tools,

35
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:02,635
you don't have feature, that feature with your terminal.

36
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:05,865
So anyway, you how your native operating system has windows.

37
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:10,010
Now, if you go with Windows subsystem for Linux,

38
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,485
on the same Windows operating system.

39
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:15,170
You can also install Linux operating system so

40
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,265
that whenever if you want to verify your Python script on your Linux,

41
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,145
you no need to copy your script from Windows to Linux,

42
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:25,250
whatever the CPU written on your Windows operating system.

43
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,475
Same script directly you can access from your Linux.

44
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:31,625
And the second one is any value or Windows operating system.

45
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,755
Because the reason native Windows operating system,

46
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,225
you have some GUI tools,

47
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:37,040
editors to write your scripts.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,625
So using your GUI tools on your Windows operating system,

49
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,020
you can write your Python script.

50
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,250
Not only Python's will begin right?

51
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,430
Even in shell script, unsaved script directly you can access from

52
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,720
your Linux just for practice purposes,

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,265
it is very easy.

54
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:55,585
So that is the advantage with Windows subsystem, Right?

55
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,780
So using Windows or Windows subsystem for Linux,

56
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,910
you can install and run open to Fedora and some other Linux distributions.

57
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,650
And more Linux distributions are coming through that are under development.

58
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,045
And this feature does not work on Windows 32-bit operating system.

59
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:17,290
So you have to go with a 64-bit Windows operating system only.

60
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,035
So at one end you simply we can access Windows files in Bash and batch files in Windows.

61
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,870
I mean, Windows files directly can access from

62
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,135
your Linux and Linux file directly can access from Windows mana to copy.

63
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,105
No need to access your files.

64
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:34,855
All right, let me go with installation. So very simple.

65
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:37,105
You have to open start menu,

66
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:41,620
then just simply such four ton ton windows features on and off,

67
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,075
on, off, click on that just to maximize the screen.

68
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:51,445
Scroll down somewhere in the last you how Windows subsystem for Linux.

69
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:55,840
You just enable it and just click on working.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
So it will take some time and ask for reboot.

71
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,710
You just reboot your system once. Just wait for that.

72
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,320
So after applying, nobody's asking,

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,470
windows needs reboot your PC to finish installation,

74
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,125
installing the required changes, just restart it.

75
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,130
Just click on it.

76
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,550
Yes, I'm doing restart.

77
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,380
Once it is come back from base dot,

78
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,885
then we will see how to install open to.

79
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,510
So this is the first step you have to perform before going to install

80
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,525
your Linux operating system on your windows.

81
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,330
Okay, we enable windows subsystem for

82
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,450
Linux and we restarted our Windows operating system just to verify

83
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:35,225
it ones go to simply start then such four ton windows features on or off.

84
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:38,855
Just click on that and maximize the screen.

85
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,450
Then go scroll down.

86
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,310
So here tick mark is there,

87
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,195
that means windows subsystem for Lenox has been enabled us to cancel it.

88
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,760
Then now again, opening will start.

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,730
Then such for Microsoft Store.

90
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,865
Then open that. And here,

91
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:59,630
just such, in such a bar just type line.

92
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,780
And as of node, these are the Linux distributions

93
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,495
are available under the windows subsystem for Linux,

94
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:11,015
you just go with any one of the required Linux distribution.

95
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:16,385
Suppose as of now I'm going to install Linux. Open distribution.

96
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,420
I'm installing.

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,610
So just clicky here, installed.

98
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,695
So we'll ask for signing, just cancel it.

99
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:26,600
So now it is going to install.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,035
It will take some time based on your internet speed, it will take time.

101
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:33,590
So here, if you observe nulliparous tools,

102
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,520
basically this window such system for Linux is helpful for dollar per.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,885
So here. Yeah. So it will download and install within three minutes.

104
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,460
Just I'm passing this video.

105
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:55,820
Once it is done, then I will be back. So it is almost didn't.

106
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,640
Just wait for remaining three more nb mb.

107
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,090
Nowadays installing urban to once known loaded equitable installed.

108
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,025
So it has been installed.

109
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,530
Just click on Launch here or go to again,

110
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,770
start, then here in the start minute will appear.

111
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,720
So just I'm clicking on and to now installing this may take few minutes.

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,650
Just wait for that.

113
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,740
So it is very first-time it is opening.

114
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,925
We are opening this open two terminal windows operating system.

115
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:46,325
So it will take some time, just wait for that.

116
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,050
So I'm pausing this video.

117
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,570
So once it is done, then I'll be back.

118
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,580
Okay, it has been done.

119
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,010
So now just to give some user name for this.

120
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,030
So here I'm giving username as suppose automation.

121
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,620
Then probably the password here.

122
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,055
And confirm it. So password I'm, we're successfully.

123
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:14,065
Now if you want to switch to rule,

124
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,675
you can use simply sudo SU.

125
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:18,760
Then provide the password here,

126
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,505
whatever the password you are given for your user.

127
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:25,990
Nazi can now am under user.

128
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,810
If you want to switch to a root.

129
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,060
That's fine.

130
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,950
So now you are having,

131
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,675
you are open to operating system on your Windows.

132
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:41,530
Now let me show you how we can access the files which

133
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,040
are there in your Windows operating system with your open tube.

134
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,675
See if you go and see the,

135
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:52,900
if you link to the file it showing total JRuby.

136
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:01,885
Right? Now, suppose I am directly moving into slash moment.

137
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:06,310
Now see here. So on my Windows operating system or how

138
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,285
to directly see and anybody sees for Windows installation that.

139
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:16,105
Now let me go with E. Not so now these are the files,

140
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:19,750
directories, so are there under my Windows operating system.

141
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,030
Now just create some directory.

142
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,280
You can go with existing directory are created

143
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,085
one directory in this location, slash mount,

144
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,700
slash URL required directory,

145
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,870
I mean your required return of your windows.

146
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,905
So Dr. slash moans less E.

147
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:45,390
So suppose I am creating a directory called Windows and Linux practice.

148
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,490
Now let me move into this.

149
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,965
So here as I've no, I don't know any files.

150
00:08:51,965 --> 00:09:00,510
But what I will do is I will open my any editor on my Windows.

151
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:11,640
Let me open my ATM editor, Atom editor.

152
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,210
So what I will do is I will create a new file.

153
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,420
Let's say some file name is,

154
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,555
and I'm, I'm saving that file.

155
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:34,280
You can save it anywhere on that part you can access directly from 012 inch loved that.

156
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,535
We already created directed right under the directory.

157
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,850
Under E, we created Windows Linux practice.

158
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,795
So here I will save my file using my Windows operating system,

159
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:47,015
let's say demo dot i section.

160
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:50,790
So simply here I'm writing supposedly been Bash.

161
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,880
Simply I am writing. This file is created on my Windows,

162
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,640
but we can access on.

163
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,600
Let me save it.

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
Now I'm going to my urban two-terminal.

165
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,620
See that we have a file.

166
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,275
So simply provide the execution permissions for this and simply run that, that's it.

167
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:26,270
So this is very simple way for developers to test

168
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,030
their scripts on Windows as well as on

169
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,855
Linux without copying your files from Windows to Linux.

170
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:36,630
If you go with Windows subsystem for Linux, let's say.

171
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,710
Okay, thank you for watching this video.
