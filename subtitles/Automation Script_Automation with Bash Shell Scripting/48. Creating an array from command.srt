00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,335
Hi friends.

2
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:14,970
In this video, we are going to discuss about creating an array with

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,880
command or storing the output of a command into an array.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,405
Or why are you storing the command output into a variable?

5
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:27,420
I want to make it that variable as an array.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,375
So this is the concept here and case before going through this video,

7
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:36,275
don't forget to follow our previous videos, right?

8
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:39,590
Just to go through that all call this reuse first.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,045
That's fine.

10
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:45,275
Now guys already we know that if you want to store the,

11
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:48,185
any one of the command output into a normal variable.

12
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:50,150
For that already we know the syntax, right?

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,730
So suppose if I want to run command called data,

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,015
I am getting some output and I want to store this into a variable.

15
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:59,915
Yes, I can take suppose my today's date.

16
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:02,165
Something like, you know,

17
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:04,250
already we know this syntax.

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,910
And if I try to display the value of the security date,

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,290
yes, I can get it.

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,445
Today. Underscore date value.

21
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:15,560
Yes, I am able to see that.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,650
Now my intention is I want to store

23
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,990
the command output into a variable and I want to make it as a very RA,

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,070
I want to make it this variable as an array.

25
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,580
Then how can I do that? So before doing that,

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,960
you have to understand one more thing.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,640
Suppose if you want to display one,

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,305
sorry, if you want to define one array,

29
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,965
how you are defining, right?

30
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,735
Some array, these, right.

31
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,150
So here between two elements,

32
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,429
there is a separator as a space.

33
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:55,014
That means R a will take separated off your elements which are there in your array space.

34
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,610
Based on space, you'll identify the elements.

35
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,260
So that is anyway, by default,

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,885
the internal fields operate on your Bash shell scripting.

37
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:03,340
If you want to change it, yes,

38
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,280
we can change it and we will see that while going forward.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,825
That's fine.

40
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:09,265
Now if you observe,

41
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:11,845
they'd come and outward, right?

42
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:17,180
Sunday support as of now some space may then some space, right?

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,305
So that means if in case if you stored this output into an array,

44
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:26,560
then RAB will consider this as one value,

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,110
second value, third, fourth,

46
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,340
you have there is no spaceflight.

47
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,975
Fourth, fifth, sixth, C that I am going to

48
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:39,905
create an array by storing the output of date command into my variable.

49
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,260
Let's say our aid date.

50
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,230
Any variable, nothing is there guys, actually,

51
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,475
this is the format to store the output of a command in t variable, right?

52
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:54,215
So just to assign one more parenthesis outside, that's it.

53
00:02:54,215 --> 00:03:00,425
Now see you are RA. So I want to display all elements at a time.

54
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:02,550
So I'm taking this.

55
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,660
Yes. But you don't know whether it is RA or not,

56
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,260
right? Yes, it is.

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,500
Because you are falling one syntax because

58
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,020
of that you are getting output means there's definitely that is array.

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,365
Let me count how many values are there so that at least you can understand,

60
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,480
yes, this is RA, six.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,590
Why you are getting six means first value space second value,

62
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,290
third, fourth, fifth, sixth,

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,535
6 elements are there in your array.

64
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:28,280
So we know that because we have space is there

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,920
because of space here we are creating six values.

66
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,940
Now those six bytes are there in your created array.

67
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,840
That's it.

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
Not only that command C,

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm going to take ls array.

70
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,910
So in the current location,

71
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,110
suppose I'm having this many number of files.

72
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,035
I want to take all values into one variable.

73
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:52,535
And that means I want to take this all values into an array.

74
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:57,340
Yes, list off RA equals two.

75
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,660
I can write something like biosynthesis, dollar LS.

76
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,120
That's it.

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,035
No, echo. Dollar ls.

78
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,070
Sorry.

79
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:19,340
This is what we did.

80
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,590
We Mr. Carlin risks, right? That's it.

81
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,730
So suppose if you run simply first thing on your local, I mean,

82
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,100
on the server I less than I,

83
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,935
I'm going to count how many values are there here,

84
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:35,080
20 right? Now, see same thing.

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,945
It should be there even anywhere.

86
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:40,170
I also let me count it.

87
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,975
Yes.

88
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:46,565
That means, you know, you created an array with the help of a command, right?

89
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:47,210
That's it.

90
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,740
So guys, nothing is there.

91
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,870
If you want to store the output of a command output into one variable,

92
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,190
I mean one normal variable,

93
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,975
just to remove these parentheses.

94
00:04:56,975 --> 00:05:00,230
If you want to create the command output as an array

95
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,560
just to provide extra parenthesis in this way.

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,170
That's it. Okay?

97
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,980
Okay. Yes.

98
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,390
Thank you for watching this video.
