00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.080
Hi friends.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.450
In this video, we are going to discuss about AWPA script simple concepts.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.705
And they are like How to initialize a variable,

4
00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:14.970
how to display a variable value,

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.210
and how to execute multiple statements.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.290
Right?

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.885
See from our previous videos,

8
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:26.700
we know what is the AWS AWPA syntax, right?

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.250
This is like, this is like a command,

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.840
edit wiki command, or instead of writing your logic from begin to end, right?

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.340
You can include in some file,

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.965
and you can call that script with your AW k

13
00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:41.185
using the AWPA hyphen IAAF option your script to them.

14
00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:42.965
What are the input unit?

15
00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:47.375
Or in general in your AWPA on your command line,

16
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.640
you can also include air WK, I funny,

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.555
IF option right inside of your biblical script,

18
00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:56.615
like a shebang line, right?

19
00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:58.610
And in these three formats,

20
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.565
foster two or helpful to include your AWPA command or script initial script.

21
00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:07.895
And this is like separate shell script.

22
00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:11.660
And you can also call this script in this place also no problem.

23
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.845
Right?

24
00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:16.790
So guys, for time being, we are going to see how to work with the Adobe casted.

25
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.800
Then later while going forward,

26
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.790
we will see how to include your Duplicate command or script inside of a shell script.

27
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.720
All right, that's fine.

28
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.045
And already from our previous videos, right?

29
00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:30.745
We already know this concepts.

30
00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:36.100
So from this concept we can say that A10 advocate command or script,

31
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.975
These three portions, right?

32
00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:41.470
These three parts begin action,

33
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.515
actual action, and then end up Chen.

34
00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:46.764
They all like optional.

35
00:01:46.764 --> 00:01:48.730
You can use any one of them.

36
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.615
All of them.

37
00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:51.010
Some of them.

38
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.495
Right?

39
00:01:52.495 --> 00:02:00.115
Fine. Now, first I'm going to discuss about your AWPA script with our required concepts,

40
00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:05.955
like, you know, how to initialize a variable, SC.

41
00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:09.440
Nice as of now, I am going to take only begin action

42
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.665
because if I include actual action and reaction,

43
00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.135
I need to provide some input.

44
00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.175
So as of now I don't bother about input.

45
00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:18.725
I mean, your file, standard input.

46
00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:22.520
So that's why I'm taking simply a WK, Right?

47
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.725
Begin action, I'm going to mention.

48
00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.650
So whenever, if you do begin only beginning if,

49
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.175
in that case you don't need any input.

50
00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:31.985
Right?

51
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.990
Now this is the simple AWPA command with only begin.

52
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.640
So actually how your actual action block and then end action block.

53
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.780
Right?

54
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.960
And as of now you are going to discuss how to initialize

55
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.650
a variable among all these three places, right?

56
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.780
Begin is the best place to initialize your variables.

57
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.090
Of course, you can also initialize here and here.

58
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.210
But this is the best place to initialize your variables

59
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.125
actually begins is called to initialize your variables.

60
00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:08.585
Right? You can also write some logic,

61
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:12.635
but because it's the best place to initialize your variables, right?

62
00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:16.325
Now, as of now I am going to take only this one, right?

63
00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:18.530
There is no error. That's why you're not getting any error.

64
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.435
I mean, this syntax is valid.

65
00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:22.970
Now let me define some variable called,

66
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.120
let's say a goes to some number five.

67
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.260
That's it.

68
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.680
We've defined our variable in your AWPA command.

69
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.285
Right, then what is our next step?

70
00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:37.505
How to display variable value?

71
00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:41.435
So guys, I'm going to display a variable value,

72
00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:43.160
it including this concept also,

73
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.589
I mean how to execute multiple statements.

74
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.200
See simply if you want to print

75
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.710
any variable or any messages you can use either print or print off.

76
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.465
As of now I am going to use only print,

77
00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:55.610
print TEA. First see the output.

78
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.415
You're going to, you're getting an error.

79
00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:01.400
So whenever, yeah, first thing,

80
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.240
equals to phi is one statement and print DAs one more statement.

81
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.250
That means you are having two statements.

82
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.430
Now, not only in your begin block, right?

83
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.710
You how in our actual block and then blog.

84
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.480
So whenever if you are using multiple statements in your blocks, right?

85
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.559
So multiple statements you want to separate with colon.

86
00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.390
That's it.

87
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.680
Now you are able to execute your multiple statements.

88
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.450
Right? Now, the same thing, right?

89
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.105
I want to use a second format.

90
00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:39.980
I mean, like this one,

91
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.845
AWPA, I find f subscript, right?

92
00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:44.495
So in that case what you have to do,

93
00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:50.195
the thing which is there inside of your quotations that you had to write in one file.

94
00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:55.430
Let me write some simple dot-dot-dot WK, Right?

95
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.540
That's it.

96
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.575
Nothing is there.

97
00:04:57.575 --> 00:05:03.140
Begin a cos two phi, then print.

98
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.440
Yay. That's it.

99
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.160
No, you weren't logic. You mentioned inside of your file.

100
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.085
Now how you can execute that logic.

101
00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:19.230
Simply AWPA hyphen if your simple dot a WK, That's it.

102
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.370
So if you want to write some AWPA script, so this,

103
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.760
these guys simply or writing your logic inside of your one file and you

104
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.375
are executing that file with the help of iPhone f option in your advocate comment.

105
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:35.885
But I don't want to mention this format outside.

106
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.285
This also I want to mention inside of your script.

107
00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:42.755
Yes, you can mention it simply by writing as it's shebang line.

108
00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:47.720
Let me write it. So actually our Arabic is there in bin location.

109
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.740
That's it.

110
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.280
See whatever you're doing on command line that I'm going to write in,

111
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.460
in, inside of your script.

112
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.685
And I'm giving excretion permission. Now let me run this.

113
00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.470
What happen?

114
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.050
Unexpected token, let me check it.

115
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.065
You been AW k.

116
00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:10.280
Okay.

117
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.240
I didn't mentioned elementary symbol. Yes.

118
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.070
That's it. Right?

119
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.665
So this here, what we discussed,

120
00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:24.740
how to define your variable and how to display

121
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.445
that variable value on how to execute multiple statements.

122
00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:33.035
So that is why we are writing multiple statements on your command line.

123
00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:36.499
You need separator between two statements has a semicolon.

124
00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:38.960
But whenever you write a script, actually, you know,

125
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.920
need off this semicolon because you are going to separate lines with

126
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.495
the slash n because you're writing a cause to find one line and printing nextLine.

127
00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:48.785
So already use operated.

128
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.230
You don't, you don't need to provide this colon, right?

129
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.330
Let me remove that unexecuted same output.

130
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.740
There is no error even though if you don't mention semicolon, right?

131
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.690
You are getting same output.

132
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:08.675
So already you are separating these two lines by writing in a separate line.

133
00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:13.235
These two statements, your mentioning in two different lines that were already separated.

134
00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:16.970
But of course here also you can write all statements in single line.

135
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.020
Right?

136
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.430
Now if you write in this way,

137
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.410
you need to provide called Semicolon.

138
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.165
Let me execute it first.

139
00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:25.400
You are going to get an error.

140
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.020
See that?

141
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.355
Why you mentioned two statements in a one single line.

142
00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:34.650
That's why Jati include semicolon.

143
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.890
That's it. Ok.

144
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.520
So whereas here you learn how to define a variable to display

145
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.860
error variable value on how to execute multiple statements.

146
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.895
Right?

147
00:07:49.895 --> 00:07:56.930
So same syntax you had to follow even in your actual block and your end the block.

148
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.835
Right?

149
00:07:58.835 --> 00:07:59.945
Okay.

150
00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:03.240
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
