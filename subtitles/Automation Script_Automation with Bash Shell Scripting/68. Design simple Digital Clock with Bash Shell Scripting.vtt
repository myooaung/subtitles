Hi friends, welcome to realtime practice for your shell scripting.

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.080
Friends.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.085
In this video, we are going to design one simple digital clock with your shell scripting.

4
00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.450
So you know how the digital clock will be.

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.490
Something like email any different structures for your digital clock output.

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.620
But suppose I am going to take this way,

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.585
hours, minutes, and seconds.

8
00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:33.440
And if you want to display in colors,

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.065
you can display it, right, that is the origin.

10
00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:37.430
And again, if you want to display,

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.635
we're Howard in one color,

12
00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:42.095
minutes in one colored and seconds in one color,

13
00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:45.065
and Colin's in different colors. You can do it.

14
00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:46.445
Right?

15
00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.705
That's fine. First thing, distill clock Mains.

16
00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:52.370
What would be the output?

17
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.010
So this is the format. To get your output.

18
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.215
In this format you have to get your output.

19
00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:58.940
So it's not only here,

20
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.930
whenever if you get some tasks could to write

21
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.175
your shell script first unit to understand what is the output,

22
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:09.860
how will be the output?

23
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.040
Then you ought to think for inputs.

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.580
Right?

25
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.805
Now, in our case, simple digital clock.

26
00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.475
This is the output I want to get.

27
00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:23.140
Right?

28
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.075
Then for this outward,

29
00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:31.735
what you need as an input, right?

30
00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:36.010
So there's actually, you need input is nothing but your time only, right?

31
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.720
Actually you have a dead command.

32
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.345
If you observe date command you are having.

33
00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:42.219
So for your date,

34
00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.440
you have different types of formats.

35
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.270
Suppose I am taking directly,

36
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.085
you are required format.

37
00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:53.660
So you can search about your date command complete formats, you can get it.

38
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.805
Yes, this is the format.

39
00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:59.210
If I run this, see what you are getting.

40
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.895
Minutes, colon, sorry, hours,

41
00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:04.370
colon, minutes, colon seconds.

42
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.405
So this is first time I won't display immediately after 1 second, right?

43
00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:11.180
I want display after 1 second.

44
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.265
I want to display after 1 second.

45
00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.275
I want to display after 1 second I wanted.

46
00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:19.235
That means same command.

47
00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:22.490
I need to run after every 1 second.

48
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.375
Right?

49
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:23.930
See that?

50
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.235
Suppose sleep 11 second.

51
00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.290
Then again I introns same command, right?

52
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.945
See now two outputs, 3132.

53
00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:41.420
So if we wanted to get one more clock,

54
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.680
I mean digital output,

55
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.080
then again, I need to run Same thing, right?

56
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.610
So if you observe here what you are doing. 42.

57
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.615
43

58
00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:54.410
Sorry, maybe I didn't date date two times immediately.

59
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.220
Yeah.

60
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.650
Let me delete this and see the output once again.

61
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.160
Observe the output First.

62
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.695
55, 56, 57.

63
00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:09.230
Yes, you are getting diesel clock output you are getting right to get this output,

64
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.435
what you are doing first-year running some date command,

65
00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:12.890
then you are waiting for 1 second.

66
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.440
Again, you are running dead command and you're waiting for 1 second.

67
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.210
And again you're running debt command again,

68
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.790
you are going to wait 1 second and again you run your debt command.

69
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.125
That means if you observe.

70
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:25.535
These two commands you are running again and again and again.

71
00:03:25.535 --> 00:03:27.335
But anyway, if it is a digital clock,

72
00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:31.170
you have to run this for infinite number of times.

73
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.930
Right?

74
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.949
Now I'm going to write a simple shell script to get this output VI digital clock.

75
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.005
Not as such.

76
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.825
So very first line is a shebang link.

77
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.130
Right?

78
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.920
Now first I'm going to run your date command in this format.

79
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.085
Then I'm waiting for 1 second.

80
00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:00.965
Then again, I want to run this.

81
00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:07.040
See. So actually I want to repeat this many number of times up to infinity.

82
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.200
But if I want to do a to infinity,

83
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.880
I need to write keep on infinite times,

84
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.250
but I don't want to write up to infinite times, right?

85
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.870
So what I will do is,

86
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.890
so first I will run this and we'll see the output once.

87
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.310
C 331314151617 ID.

88
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.570
So you are getting your output, digital clock output.

89
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.655
But if you observe digital clock output after getting this right,

90
00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:36.470
you will get up for 1 second this output,

91
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.760
but this won't appear right?

92
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.780
This will disappear.

93
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.880
And then you have to display this thing only.

94
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.250
And once if we get 15,

95
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.775
then you delete distinct or clear your screen.

96
00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:50.705
So you have a command called clear in your shell script, right?

97
00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:57.365
So what you will do is just after getting clear,

98
00:04:57.365 --> 00:05:05.340
clear, clear, clear.

99
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.790
That's it. So by this,

100
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.470
just observe that what he's going to do.

101
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.140
So for you to use some clarity,

102
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.730
just I am writing these many number of times,

103
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.800
but I don't want to write in this way.

104
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.205
Right? Will go and write exact code.

105
00:05:27.205 --> 00:05:29.210
After some time.

106
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.750
Let me

107
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.370
write at least four sometimes.

108
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.650
Not say, no, let me run this script and observe the output.

109
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.050
46474849505152

110
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.200
Right now it is like a digital clock.

111
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.965
But I want to run this for infinite number of times.

112
00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:09.310
But your telescope is not running for infinite number of times as of now.

113
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.450
Now if I want to run some logic for infinite number of times,

114
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.795
first of all, if you observe your shell script,

115
00:06:16.795 --> 00:06:21.010
you are repeating these three lines again and again and again.

116
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.190
Immediately that to immediately or repeating whenever,

117
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.645
if there is a chance to repeat some logic again and again immediately,

118
00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:35.410
then what is the concept of how to use loops?

119
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.145
Right?

120
00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:39.800
Now let me delete these lines.

121
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.330
Now what I will do is first I'll

122
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.010
clear my screen and then I'm writing infinity loop called while.

123
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.610
You can also use this one noble than do.

124
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.350
Done. That's it.

125
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.600
No, let me run the shell script and observe the outputs.

126
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:17.350
45678910. Right?

127
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.720
Now, even shell script is able to produce output as Z.

128
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.860
What digital clock?

129
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.720
Right there is here I usually logic.

130
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.800
Simply do display your output.

131
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.230
I mean date command output, offer that.

132
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.620
I am waiting for 1 second off for the time cleaning my screen.

133
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.180
And these three steps,

134
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.120
actually I'm repeating for infinite number of times.

135
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.235
So if I want to write infinite number of times,

136
00:07:46.235 --> 00:07:50.315
then I cannot end by writing them.

137
00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:55.940
Because I, I need to write keep on those three lines for an even number of times.

138
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.580
But I don't want to write, but I want to execute

139
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.340
those three lines as infinite number of times.

140
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.180
Then whenever if you want to repeat first three, I mean,

141
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.605
not only three, any logic within the number of times you have to use loops.

142
00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:11.465
And that too in even number of times,

143
00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:12.950
just take in-video loop.

144
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.770
You are having different types of loops, right? For loop.

145
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.960
And while you can take any one of that here,

146
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.050
I selected YOU, right?

147
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.550
And one more thing in case if you want to display your output in terms of colors,

148
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.575
right, you can do this thing.

149
00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:31.235
So you know, echo command with colors, echo,

150
00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:36.080
hyphen e. Let me take flood erodible three,

151
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:44.465
some mind two to m. So now I am executing my command inside of echo command.

152
00:08:44.465 --> 00:08:47.255
Then you have to use this syntax.

153
00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:49.560
Right?

154
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.500
Just Upworthy or putting out.

155
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.770
See MIT colors I am displaying.

156
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.809
So based on your requirement.

157
00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:09.370
So if you want to display even hours in one color and minutes in one colour,

158
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.620
and it was seconds in one column.

159
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.145
Yes, you can do it. So if you want, you can just try.

160
00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:16.690
Right?

161
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:25.150
So guys, this is the simple digital calculator designing with your shell script, right?

162
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.605
So while going forward,

163
00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:30.744
we will see lot of real-time practice.

164
00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:35.475
And one more thing is we'll start with low-level and we'll go with advanced level.

165
00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:39.365
So that's what I want to do so that you will be good with your shell scripting.

166
00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:40.445
Okay?

167
00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:43.620
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
