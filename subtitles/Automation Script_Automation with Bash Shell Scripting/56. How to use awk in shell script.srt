00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,225
Hi friends. In this video,

2
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:10,260
we are going to see a shell script with a duplicate Command or script.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,130
That means how we can use NLTK command

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,615
or a biblical script inside of shell script, right?

5
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:23,490
See already we know the syntax for our NW k,

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,755
right, from our previous videos.

7
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:29,495
You know, this is like a WK, some options.

8
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,595
And then in quotation you are logic.

9
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:35,239
So that logic consists of a begin action,

10
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,110
actual action, and inaction, then your file name.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,960
Now of course we shall find limit can also provide command as

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,770
input for your ELL obligate command with the help of pipe wrench symbol.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,295
Or instead of writing this logic here, we can write this,

14
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:54,500
begin, actual, and end the logic in one file.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,240
And you can include that file in your AWPA command in this way, right?

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,095
Of course, you are also having a WK script in this way.

17
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,410
But whenever if you want to include your AWPA,

18
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,695
you can follow any one of these two syntaxes to write your shell scripts.

19
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,775
I mean shells get width here, Duplicate command.

20
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,625
You have to follow any one of these two syntaxes.

21
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,640
Right? Fine.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,875
Now, let me open my terminal.

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,855
First guy is simply,

24
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:31,120
I'm taking your WK command without any options.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,415
Simply I am riding begin.

26
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:36,940
Let say simply print hi.

27
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,670
So I use only begin, right?

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,535
Just for simplicity, right?

29
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,830
Easily you can understand if i go with the begin,

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,775
we're displaying some high output, right?

31
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:53,190
Or instead of that,

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,490
you can also write this into one file.

33
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,040
Let me write high dot AWPA, any filename, right?

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,485
Simply I'm copying and pasting that logic.

35
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:07,040
And of course you can also write in one straight line,

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,869
but that is not a good practice.

37
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,730
It is somewhat clear.

38
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,110
Right?

39
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,870
Now, this is just your AWPA command.

40
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,480
Know what our the logic you need to

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,615
display your high that is there with the high dot AWPA.

42
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,415
That's why I am writing in this way.

43
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:27,695
That means you can exclude your command either in this way or AWPA iPhone f,

44
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:32,285
the logic, whatever you need that we mentioned inside of high dot AWPA.

45
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:36,320
Now, our next step is right,

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,570
how we can include these things inside of your shell script. Right?

47
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,385
So it's very simple.

48
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:46,370
So this is like one command for your shell,

49
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,580
or even VC's also one command for your shell.

50
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,780
See inner shell script if you want to use any commands,

51
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,075
right? If you want to.

52
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,375
If you want to include any commands inside of your shell scripts,

53
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,810
or if you want to execute any commands with your shelf,

54
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,980
skip what you are going to do.

55
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,095
Let me take simply PWD command and some ls command or PWD for date command,

56
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:13,550
right, let me write symbol shall scape them or order SH, right?

57
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,230
I am going to write my shebang line.

58
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:26,150
Sorry, bin bash, right?

59
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,550
So simply I am writing PWD than ls.

60
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,020
Then how you are going to execute it.

61
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,970
You mean the execution permission for that?

62
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,320
Yes, you're getting PWD and ls command output.

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,645
And if you want to include one more command,

64
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:51,125
let me write it instead of a less simply, I want to take debt.

65
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,945
Of course it can take any command, that frontier problem.

66
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:58,400
Right now I'm running. Yes, you are getting your output.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,310
And this is tight forward if you want to execute

68
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,970
your command with using your shells can be, you can do in this way.

69
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,595
Now what I am doing is the same way.

70
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,280
This is like a command for your shell.

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Now what I'm doing is I'm going to open my shell script and I am going to

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,765
place right here you are. Edible K command.

73
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:18,725
That's it.

74
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,960
Now let me run it and see the output what you are going to

75
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,040
get sick because of your AWPA command, right?

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,810
Whatever you are having here because of this,

77
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,720
what you are displaying high, yes, you are getting.

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,700
So now you can able to execute

79
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,470
your AWPA command also as you are Linux commands inside of your shell script,

80
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,875
of course, edible K is also one of your Linux command.

81
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,120
Right?

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,545
Or instead of this,

83
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,450
we also followed this syntax.

84
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,750
So where high dot AW cases script, I mean,

85
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,120
inside that you, how your logic,

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,460
not that Fermat also I can use it.

87
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,520
Let me open you are demo dot SH.

88
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,940
All right, so what I will do is instead of

89
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,580
for your high dot already we included that, right?

90
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,325
Let me first observe your shell script.

91
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:10,715
A WK hyphen. If your,

92
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:12,155
these like a command,

93
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:13,730
Yes, you are getting some output.

94
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,830
Now even though if I include that inside of

95
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,260
your shells group same output you're going to get using that.

96
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,730
There is no difference.

97
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,860
So like a normal command,

98
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,350
you can use your advocate command inside of your shelf.

99
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,435
Stepped, right?

100
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:27,380
Fine.

101
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,500
Now we know if you want to assign the command output into your variable, right?

102
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,935
How we are going to do, let me take supposed to rate date

103
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:42,065
some variable equals $2 or it was singular 100 quotation.

104
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,360
You can also follow this syntax.

105
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,370
Now inside of you are you how could a date?

106
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,220
The same way, this AWPA,

107
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,635
that this syntax or this syntax,

108
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:58,805
this port you can assign into some variable using in this way,

109
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,230
let me open your shell script.

110
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,055
What I am doing is here I am taking,

111
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:07,790
let me take yj equals $2.

112
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,675
You can use this syntax to assign command or put into a variable.

113
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:14,150
Let me take b equals two.

114
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,080
You can also use single or double quotation write software that just I'm

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,890
displaying dollar gay or simply let me write.

116
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,100
Value is not 4a.

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,900
And let me write p value is dollar B.

118
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,320
So we are using dollar yen dollar b because this is shell script not

119
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,530
you're edible ticket in Arabic in order to write Dollree and dollar b,

120
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,060
if you write simply yea and B,

121
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,810
you will display the values of your a and B NEW right?

122
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,600
Now let me run the script transit output.

123
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Yes, you're able to get E-value is high and B values,

124
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,685
I write why you are getting that.

125
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:52,970
Because you are assigning this command output into

126
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,580
this variable and this command output into be

127
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,400
wearable and you're displaying them using your echo command.

128
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,475
Yes, you are able to get the values of your a and B,

129
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:05,345
which is from your end WK, right?

130
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:07,745
Not only this command guys, so I'm in this simple,

131
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:11,630
whatever, maybe AWPA command you how that command output.

132
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,355
If you want to assign it to a variable,

133
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:15,770
you have to use some variable.

134
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,265
It goes to dollar, parenthesis symbol, right?

135
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:22,130
So here's the, here's the simple way how we

136
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,215
can use a duplicate Command or skip inside of a shell script.

137
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:28,745
Right?

138
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:32,280
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
