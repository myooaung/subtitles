00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,750
Hi friends.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,165
In this video, we are going to discuss about a public key that is simply introduction to

3
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:18,990
replicate command or script c. You can use ada became like a command or like a script.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,020
So we are going to see the intellection part for edible,

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,575
okay, in this video.

6
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:25,895
Let me start that.

7
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:30,460
See what is edible became less basically AW case

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:36,440
a programming language and which requires no compilation, right?

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,405
In order to compile your programming language's written by a duplicate.

10
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,525
And allows the user to use variables,

11
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:48,230
numeric functions, trig functions, and logical operators.

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,000
Right there.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,855
Most of the guys know only Arabic is like a command,

14
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,690
but he can also use that as a programming language.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,220
And while using that,

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,200
you can define some variables.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,855
You can use some numeric functions and string function,

18
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,299
and also you can use the logical operators.

19
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,695
That's fine.

20
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:09,620
But coming to a Unix-like systems, right?

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,160
The air Duplicate command in Unix is just like

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,745
a scripting language and which is used what extra processing?

23
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,130
What is this text processing?

24
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:26,195
Let me take one simple example is suppose I'm running system CTLs status, HTTPD.

25
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:28,550
So I'm getting the status of equity, equity.

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,920
Now on this entire text,

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,810
I need to get only the status exactly where these inactive or active.

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,435
Right now I need to process this data.

29
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:40,010
I don't want to play anti data.

30
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,080
I want to display only in third line,

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,735
second column, or second field.

32
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,545
Right?

33
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:48,920
Now you need to do some processing to get that so that you

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,610
can achieve easily using your integral k command.

35
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,255
So as afford, Don't worry how to write in this syntax, right?

36
00:01:56,255 --> 00:02:00,230
While going for, you will come to know how to use your delicate command.

37
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,205
So actually the meaning here is on this entire output,

38
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,540
get a third line,

39
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,000
and in this third line gets second tree.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,820
So you are processing With Your arabic a command.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,760
Right?

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,365
That's fine.

43
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:19,040
Now, wiki is used like, you know,

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,970
already we know that as a command and other scripting language.

45
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,700
So sometimes if you want to use like a command,

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,920
you can use R and if you want to use like a scripting language,

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,600
yes, you can use it based on requirement.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,975
You can go with a command or a scripting language.

49
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,225
Right? Both are very similar.

50
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:39,245
I mean, the uses of income and I'm stripping is very similar.

51
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:41,060
You can easily understand that.

52
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,355
Ok, so as of now in this video,

53
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:47,885
I am going to do a brief introduction to like it command,

54
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:51,560
how you can use this as a command, right?

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,250
Busting. Advocate command in Unix like system is

56
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,060
most important command and it is used to find and replace the text.

57
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,210
So as of now we did the how to find a text, right?

58
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,665
So if you observe here,

59
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,870
we find that texts require thing.

60
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,515
And you can also replace this information with other information.

61
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:12,520
Right?

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,375
That means you can replace the text also, will feel them.

63
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,225
Then how we end up with git command works.

64
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:22,990
Okay, so before going to work with the biblical command,

65
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,920
just assume that if you have a SAM file,

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,630
let's say I'm going to store my command output.

67
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,005
This command output into some files.

68
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,135
Some demo dot TXT.

69
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:42,765
Right? Now observe that you can take a the command output or some file information.

70
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:43,805
Right?

71
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:46,115
So here, how many lines are there?

72
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:49,265
12345

73
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:55,955
Now while we're King with the replicate command on this file or on this command output.

74
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:57,980
You can consider any one of that.

75
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,655
Because by you can give to you are going to provide input for your text,

76
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,740
for input for your enemy can command.

77
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,545
Now while working with your Edit Wiki command,

78
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:11,600
yet obligate command will treat each line is like one record.

79
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,490
Now you have filed records as per your enemy can't command.

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,955
And each record consists of some fields.

81
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:24,410
Feel some nothing but columns or words.

82
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,805
Right?

83
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:31,235
Now, first-line consists of dot is one field, second feed,

84
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:37,025
third field, 4567, right?

85
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:41,509
So by default you are Ada replicate command will subgrade

86
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:47,240
p lines or records as a pre is based on space at the separator.

87
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,700
Now here, there is a space notes that it's separator.

88
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,395
Now based on this space,

89
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:54,920
Your arabic AT command is treating disease first field, the second field.

90
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,130
This is third pill for the grip like that.

91
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,435
Right?

92
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:01,385
In case if you don't have space,

93
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:05,240
then how you can convert your recording to freeze of columns.

94
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,560
We will see that.

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,860
Okay, now, come here.

96
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,560
Yet public-key reads the data from your file or from standard input.

97
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,270
That means you can provide like standard input c.

98
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,010
Here.

99
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,630
I mean, let me thank Neil,

100
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,495
is command in this command for your edification command,

101
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:29,900
you are providing input from some command output.

102
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,140
Or let me take one more way.

103
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,360
So if this is some comma and bright,

104
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,915
and for this command, you can also provide some file as input.

105
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:42,860
In this way.

106
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,215
Both the ways are possible.

107
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:49,745
Some command or political directly process with your inelegant command.

108
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:53,390
Repl sound file directly can provide that file as

109
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,485
input for your arabic a command in this way, both thought possible.

110
00:05:57,485 --> 00:06:03,080
Then edible gave US a text to file as a Records countries.

111
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,020
Now you know the call is nothing but each line is one record, right?

112
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:16,175
And the columns which are there in lines are called fields, right?

113
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,650
The columns which are there in your records because is

114
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,365
nothing but a line are called fields.

115
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:27,185
So by default, the fields or separated based on space,

116
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,110
right, in this file, right,

117
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,575
spaces or the separator to separate your works.

118
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:39,590
If you are of them that let say suppose with example, password file, right?

119
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,345
So you don't have spaces here,

120
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:46,010
but to separate your fields you have with colon, right?

121
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,055
So you can use that also as a separator

122
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:53,450
by mentioning hyphen yep option in your enemy can command.

123
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,485
We will see that.

124
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,055
Right?

125
00:06:57,055 --> 00:07:02,215
And yet on the GET command works on each line individually.

126
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,645
Write c.

127
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:08,650
We have taken some command in this way, right?

128
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,230
So you are running this command.

129
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,025
So your intention is from the line number three,

130
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,675
you have to get the second green.

131
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:20,179
But if you don't mention this line number,

132
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,420
now what you are going to get the output from each line,

133
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,285
you are going to get second field or second column.

134
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:33,205
But don't say column. You have to say that that has a field, right?

135
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:38,475
So that's why you can say that edit bigger command works on each line individually.

136
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:39,665
Right?

137
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:43,790
And in Africa has its own predefined variables like dollar, euro,

138
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,635
$1.1 dollar Guanzhong Darwin,

139
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:47,810
and some number of records,

140
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,460
a number of whales hands-on you having

141
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,250
different predefined variables to work

142
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,430
effectively with your end of the GET command or with your arabic script,

143
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,205
you have to know all your predefined variables.

144
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:02,825
We will see what going forward right now.

145
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:06,695
And the way, you know that in the VLOOKUP command,

146
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,875
we can use like a command or like a script.

147
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,275
And here we are discussing about like a command.

148
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:17,315
Now, whenever if you are going to use your arabic a command as a command,

149
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:20,645
then what is the syntax of your WK?

150
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:26,029
See a WK options, single quotation, patron,

151
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,175
curly braces inside that action,

152
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,560
then close that single quotation,

153
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,835
then you are filename or you can also use some command output.

154
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:39,245
It can provide some command output to your enemy K command industry. But Syntax is same.

155
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,495
Instead of providing your file name here.

156
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,820
First you are running some command that output you're

157
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,595
providing as input for your Edit Wiki coming.

158
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,305
Both are valid things.

159
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:53,225
So these are the basic syntax to work in public as a command.

160
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:57,274
Alright, then what about this pattern action options?

161
00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:00,440
All right, let me go with one by one pattern.

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,480
So this pattern is like the matching word or some condition.

163
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,965
If there is no pattern or act condition,

164
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:14,195
then by default, you are end of the cut command will work on each and every line.

165
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:20,690
For example, again, see previously we have taken line number three in this command.

166
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,080
So at that time it is going to work only on line number three.

167
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,960
But if you remove this, then you're like a pattern equation

168
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,470
or that is called pattern position or condition equation.

169
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,680
If you remember this, it is going to work on each and every line.

170
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
That's it.

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,525
Right? That's fine.

172
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:41,725
Then. What about these options?

173
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:44,245
So we have different types of options here.

174
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:50,275
Hyphen F, like you freely separator to specify your fields operator.

175
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:56,590
Then hyphen v to define some variable values C.

176
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,200
And you now one more thing that is called iPhone5.

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,160
It is useful in your scripting as of now, forget about this.

178
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,815
Only consider iPhone5, 1B.

179
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:09,070
Then what about this hyphen ever say I have taken

180
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,580
one of the example called cathode EDC password.

181
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:19,690
So here, suppose if I tried to display a second field with your end replicate command S0,

182
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,705
the output, what you are going to get.

183
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:28,160
I can feel what you are

184
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:37,100
getting in

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,515
your EDC password, right?

186
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,540
You don't have a second field actually.

187
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,695
I mean, in each and every length, only somewhere, right?

188
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,215
If you observe here, here you have some secondary

189
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:52,220
and here you have some second because there is a separate of space.

190
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,480
Right?

191
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,945
So in which'll anyhow a space based on that it is going to get.

192
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:58,250
But my intention is,

193
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,845
suppose let me display first and then you can easily understand.

194
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:06,860
Let me take first if we'll meet in each and every line,

195
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,255
what is the first word?

196
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,700
I want to display that, but you're getting entire thing.

197
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,605
No. The reason is by default,

198
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:18,620
a duplicate Command will work based on space.

199
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,655
If there is a space, then it is able to identify phase.

200
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:23,870
If there is no space,

201
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,405
their entire land will treat as a one field.

202
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:29,045
Now here our intention is based on colon.

203
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,785
I want to separate my fields.

204
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:34,775
Then you have a hyphen IAAF option than just mentioned,

205
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,335
hyphen f, then colon.

206
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:38,060
Now see the output.

207
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,580
Sorry something wrong.

208
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,365
I have to provide some space here.

209
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:47,090
Now see there are no you're getting only first to fill in each and every line.

210
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,720
All right, so that is the purpose of hyphenate option.

211
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,815
Okay, so again, this is just introduction to your Edit Wiki command.

212
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,425
We will see in detail while going forward.

213
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,880
Thank you for watching this video.
