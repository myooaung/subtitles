00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.985
Hi friends.

2
00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:08.070
In this video, we are going to discuss about sed command and that too.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.900
That is very basic introduction to set.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.900
Let me start that.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.720
So what is said? So you know,

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.824
cities like a command in your Unix-like systems.

7
00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:22.770
And sed command stands for stream editor.

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.155
That means it is an editor which is used to work on the stream of data, right?

9
00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:32.880
That means the data may be from a file or from the output of any command.

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.155
Right?

11
00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.855
So you can use sed command,

12
00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:40.335
like an editor to work with.

13
00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:48.410
Any output comes from a command or on a file, right?

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.960
And you can do some operations,

15
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.070
some functions on your file using your set command.

16
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.745
And they are like, you know, viewing file content.

17
00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:05.180
That means you can view the content of your file using set command.

18
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.520
Or you can say that you can use sed command like a cat command also.

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.235
So what is the purpose of cat command, right?

20
00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:15.200
The same way you can use sed command also.

21
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.565
That is the very first of function of your set command.

22
00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:23.300
Then searching, just assume that you have

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.800
some file or some output from any command, right?

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.945
Simply hasn't already how some file.

25
00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:32.420
Now what I want to ease in general,

26
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.905
printing all lines instead of viewing the content of your entire file,

27
00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:40.460
I want to print or view

28
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.990
the lines which are having some particular word or some particular pattern.

29
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.175
Right?

30
00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:49.115
So in that case, just assume that somebody, how you're required,

31
00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:52.520
some XOR here, some x Word or year, some Export.

32
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.405
Now, I want to print the lines which are having X world.

33
00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:58.190
I don't want to print this line.

34
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.910
I don't want to print this second line and I don't want to print the last length.

35
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.725
So I want to print the lines which are having particular pattern or a particular word.

36
00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.165
That means something.

37
00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:11.330
Yes, you can use your set command in that way also.

38
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.425
Okay.

39
00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.585
Then find and replace.

40
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:15.800
So whatever you are searching,

41
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.375
no, in that case,

42
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:21.830
you can also replace your particular word with some other world.

43
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.030
Right?

44
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.315
That is fine and replace insertion or deletion.

45
00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:29.600
So if you want to delete some lines, right?

46
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.255
Or if you want delete some content of your file,

47
00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.355
yes. You can delete.

48
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.500
Or if you want to insert a new data, yes,

49
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.730
you can insert your data using new sed command in your file.

50
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.900
Right?

51
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.120
So these are the main functions of your set command.

52
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.590
Okay?

53
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.060
And set also supports regular expression, which allows eight.

54
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.435
Perform complex pattern matching, right?

55
00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:00.955
You should have something with a normal words.

56
00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:02.485
You can write some pattern.

57
00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:05.530
Pattern going is going to represent multiple words.

58
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.425
So in the, in that way also you can use sed command.

59
00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:10.570
Anyway, we will see well going forward about

60
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.155
this regular expression and all those things, right?

61
00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.240
Fine. No.

62
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.520
See we are already some VaR,

63
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.085
VaR Mater's on your Unix-like systems.

64
00:03:21.085 --> 00:03:21.745
Right?

65
00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:25.030
Then why we are going with said editor?

66
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.650
Right? What is the unknown days offset over VaR, VaR murders?

67
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.155
So studies also want to read or write.

68
00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:35.125
Then already we have VA, VA omega.

69
00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.450
Then what is the advantage?

70
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.430
Simple.

71
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.310
If you want to work with any file using via yada,

72
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.160
open your files, then you have to work with that file.

73
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.975
But using said in only to open edit your files without opening it.

74
00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:55.175
So that is the advantage of said over you or VaR, VaR editor's, right.

75
00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:56.015
Fine.

76
00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:58.730
Now, whenever if you want to work with, you know,

77
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.280
like AWPA or cut command,

78
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.990
you have some syntax for that.

79
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.220
The same way.

80
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.255
You have some basic syntax of a set command.

81
00:04:08.255 --> 00:04:12.005
So that is like I said, some options.

82
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:15.965
Then commands means whatever the action you want to perform that you heard right here,

83
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:21.485
then file to work with your set command, right?

84
00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:24.755
Of course, you can also run in this way.

85
00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:26.390
I mean any command,

86
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.550
any command and that output.

87
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.090
You can also pipeline with your sed command.

88
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.745
So this is also possible.

89
00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:37.970
I didn't mentioned here, but it is also possible, you know,

90
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.620
you can run some command and

91
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.755
that command output you can provide as an input for your set command.

92
00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:47.255
That is also possible. Anyway, we'll see that again while going forward.

93
00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:49.130
Right? Fine.

94
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.895
So there is, first of all, just remember this is the basic syntax for your sed command.

95
00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:54.995
Set some options.

96
00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:59.075
Then commands means whatever action you want to perform on your file,

97
00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:02.900
then your file to work with your set command.

98
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.875
Right?

99
00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:05.705
Then how said works?

100
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:09.379
So Ks c, that is the symbols a diagram

101
00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.220
to represent your sed command I'm in how to work with your set command.

102
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.080
So said we will read line by line from your input on each and every line,

103
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.550
whatever the command D Hall,

104
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.185
right, that command will execute.

105
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:22.340
And based on that command,

106
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.990
whatever the result you are going to get,

107
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.330
that result will display on your output stream by default on your terminal, right?

108
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.760
If you want to redirect that into any file, Yes,

109
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.850
you can read on it with the help of your redirection symbols.

110
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.410
So nothing is there.

111
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.565
Already we know a WK cut commands, right?

112
00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:46.300
So edible again, cut command or also you're going to work on each and every line.

113
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.180
And then based on whatever the commands or actually you

114
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.895
are providing your applicant cut command.

115
00:05:51.895 --> 00:05:54.100
Based on that, you are going to get your output.

116
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.245
That output is going to display on your terminal.

117
00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:59.395
Or you can also redirect that into any file.

118
00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:04.390
Right? So that, that is the sed command working operation.

119
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.405
So same as you are cut and the replicate command.

120
00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:10.540
So guess what I'm saying is yes,

121
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.405
are you me how some file number of lines.

122
00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:16.105
So whatever the option you are giving,

123
00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:18.670
but all the commands you are giving based on this,

124
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.810
these action will work on each and every line, right?

125
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.725
Based on this logic or command or action.

126
00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:27.455
If this line is satisfying,

127
00:06:27.455 --> 00:06:32.180
then that line will display on your terminal, right?

128
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.895
And based on some options,

129
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:38.285
you can also directly edit

130
00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:42.890
your content inside of your file without displaying anything on your terminal.

131
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.835
Okay?

132
00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:47.330
So for time being, you just remember you will set command is going to

133
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.275
work on each and every line of your input. That's it.

134
00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:52.505
Ok.

135
00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:54.515
So here's while we're going forward,

136
00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:59.570
we will work separately on each and every functions like this one.

137
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.480
So next video use like viewing file content,

138
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.460
offer that searching, offer that find and

139
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.980
replace and then after that insertion or deletion.

140
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.665
Then finally we will go with the regular expressions.

141
00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:12.680
So next, gee, how this four,

142
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.170
this one video for this concept, one video,

143
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.260
then 345 videos you have, right?

144
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.650
Just to go through that phi videos so that you'll be good with your sed command.

145
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.545
Okay?

146
00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:28.170
Okay. Thank you for watching this video.
