00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,785
Friends here our concept is scheduling jobs with at and crontab.

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:10,410
See at and crontab both or commands to schedule a job based on your required time.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,560
But there is a small difference between attend crontab.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,600
Just assume that I have a small shell script to take a backup for some log files.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,295
Now, my requirement is automatically a how to run that shell script at tomorrow morning,

6
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:34,485
09:00 AM, or automatically how to run that shall scape everyday morning at 09:00 AM.

7
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:37,200
Then there is a small difference, right?

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,025
Do you want to run your shell script only tomorrow?

9
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,355
Every day?

10
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,250
So if you want to run only for tomorrow,

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,490
then go with at but means onetime task.

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,130
But for everyday go with crontab.

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,685
But thing is that just scheduled job with either at or current out.

14
00:00:55,685 --> 00:01:01,145
So here we are discussing about how to schedule our jobs using at command.

15
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:04,010
So in next video we will see about contact.

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,940
So I'm giving just some simple examples.

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,705
Now, let me give a syntax for your at command.

18
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,100
So before going to give syntax,

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,065
let me show you on your terminal.

20
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:19,220
So however, some shell script in my route,

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,810
so I'm switching into root.

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,270
So here there is a shell script.

23
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,540
No, first let me show you the backups.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,610
So how some back-ups here.

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,005
Let us do one, something,

26
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:33,560
some data is that now,

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,110
as of now suppose what is the time?

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:43,025
156, I want to run at 157.

29
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,965
Then let me schedule our job.

30
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:49,040
Simply act you how to write you what time?

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,735
One colon, I mean,

32
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,695
you are a hover. Then colon 57.

33
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:58,475
Then it will enter into your HAT prompt.

34
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:01,670
Then he there you how to do the shells kit,

35
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,955
which you want to automatically run at a given time.

36
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:08,855
Suppose I'm implementing a shell script by using Bash shell.

37
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:11,060
So that's why I'm taking simply bash.

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,580
If your, if your script is, I mean,

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,430
if you are using any other shell just mentioned,

40
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,980
that shall only then enter,

41
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,030
then press Control D so that the job will be saved.

42
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,405
And it is displaying, it is job number seven.

43
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:28,640
So already I introduce some jobs.

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,085
That's where it is giving job number seven and Friday number so and so date.

45
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:38,090
So what is the time now? 157.

46
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,170
Yeah.

47
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,500
Your your backup has been done. Let me verify.

48
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,365
C. Let us to backup 157 previously, some 1729.

49
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:54,125
Now you're having at one hundred fifty seven

50
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,705
twenty nine the day he had been the eighth day.

51
00:02:56,705 --> 00:03:02,600
So this is a simple way to schedule you what jobs are to execute only one time.

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,255
Now, that is one syntax.

53
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:08,075
So what is the syntax for syntax you had to run at?

54
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:12,575
Then you are to provide at what time you want to exclude that time you had to mention.

55
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:19,260
Then simply suppose I want to execute out too.

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,145
That is the time you mentioned enter.

57
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:29,525
Then you are shell script, but all the shell script you want to mention execute,

58
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,195
then control D, but is the syntax.

59
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:36,755
One more way is also that echo, Bash,

60
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:40,325
shell script, then pipeline,

61
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:42,920
then provide you what time.

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,020
Suppose I want to exclude that.

63
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,145
Yeah, you now see that there are now nine jobs.

64
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:58,700
Now, you can see your list of jobs which are q, which are pending.

65
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,265
So these are the jobs.

66
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:07,100
Now you can also remove your scheduled job by using 80 RM.

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,945
Suppose I want to remove this job.

68
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:11,300
Let me provide a job number here.

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,040
Nine.

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,020
Now see the list of jobs.

71
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,275
There is no nine, just know we delegated that job.

72
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,495
That's it. Okay.

73
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:25,055
So here, not only these are simple way to provide your timing,

74
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,100
your different formats, to provide your timings,

75
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,265
to run your jobs using at command.

76
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:35,120
Then let me show you them, some of them.

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,575
So tomorrow at ten AM supposed Today I want to run at 10:00 AM.

78
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:45,830
Then on coming Sunday at 10:00 AM,

79
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,130
then at 10:00 AM, then you ought to mention sunday.

80
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,180
So these are the, some of the examples to schedule

81
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,085
your jobs by using a command to run your job only once.

82
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,695
I attach this document to this video,

83
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:03,590
you just don't know this and go through that.

84
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,990
That's it. Thank you.
