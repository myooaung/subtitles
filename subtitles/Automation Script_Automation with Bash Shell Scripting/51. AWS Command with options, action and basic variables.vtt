00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.005
Hi friends.

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:09.195
In this video, we are going to discuss about Ed obligate command with options,

3
00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:11.940
action, and basic variables.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.700
C. In our previous video we have seen in

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.985
obligate command with action and basic variables.

6
00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:22.425
Now we are adding one extra part that is called with options, right?

7
00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.230
And even before going to enter with this concept already

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.170
we know basic syntax of your Oedipus hit command.

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.670
That is simply an obligate options in single quotation,

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.595
pantheon and in curly braces action,

11
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:36.895
then you are filename.

12
00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:41.705
Of course, we can also provide input from command also in this way, right?

13
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.630
So now we are going to discuss a boat,

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.545
a replicate command with options and action.

15
00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:51.020
We're going to put pattern as of now.

16
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.590
I'm not going to Guzman pattern as of now, will discuss it later.

17
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.820
Right.

18
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.945
Fine.

19
00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.315
So you know, there are different types of

20
00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:01.385
options are there for your end obligate comeback,

21
00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:06.125
that is hyphen F. That is just to mention what is your field separator.

22
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:10.264
Then hyphen v to define some variable value.

23
00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:17.360
Then hyphen f file to specify a file that contains a public-key script, right?

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.980
Let me go with one by one step.

25
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.555
See here.

26
00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:27.650
First the thing. It may take some simple file.

27
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.695
So there's winnow that by default,

28
00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:35.135
AWPA will assume field separator as a space.

29
00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:39.785
That means to separate your columns in a file, right?

30
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:43.745
It will assume separate drug space as a separator.

31
00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:45.380
So now in this file,

32
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.900
suppose if I want to print a third column, right,

33
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.640
you don't need to mention any fields operator

34
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.905
automatically your end obligate command will

35
00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:56.705
identify your fields based on space.

36
00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:03.964
Now I'm going to print the third field or column from each of your a record.

37
00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:07.190
That means from each of your line of your file.

38
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.420
Yes.

39
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.240
But the same way, suppose if we take already,

40
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.795
we note this simple concept we have seen somewhere, right?

41
00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:19.970
So in this file, suppose I want to display first to field.

42
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.315
Actually this entire thing is one record, right?

43
00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:25.130
Like without number of records.

44
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.450
So how many records are rubbing?

45
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.380
Quantum nine records are having in your file.

46
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.230
In each record, I want to display first to feel.

47
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.994
So here, space is not the separator,

48
00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:48.710
then your ID implicate command will not able to identify what is your field.

49
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.725
That's why it is going to pick entitled record as a one field.

50
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:58.100
But here, the field separator,

51
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.425
if you observe here there is a corn is there.

52
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.660
Now externally you heard to mention for

53
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.970
rebirth and replicate command about your field separator.

54
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.985
That is simply with the help of iPhone f option.

55
00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:12.305
Now.

56
00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:16.895
Parade my fields in a myfile based on this column.

57
00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:21.080
Now, this is first a field and then the second field.

58
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.130
Third field for Dave six.

59
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:35.480
Likewise, Now I want to display faster than simply print $1.1.

60
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.995
That's it.

61
00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:39.510
From your file.

62
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.230
What happened?

63
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.720
Sorry, spelling mistake.

64
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.320
Pete. Alright, empty. Nothing.

65
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.045
Not only that. Suppose if you want to get this field, right,

66
00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:05.909
1234550 feet first and then write comma.

67
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.710
And then 53.

68
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.490
That's it.

69
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.595
Right?

70
00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:20.825
So that is the way how you can specify

71
00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:25.145
your required field separator for your enemy K command.

72
00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:29.345
Suppose, let say you have some part, right?

73
00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:32.060
Yes, I assume this is also one data ROA,

74
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.080
let me save this intent to find or you can also use in this, right?

75
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.340
So these data, you can probably follow AWPA command.

76
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.750
No, I want to get first appeal in this record.

77
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.565
That is home I want to get.

78
00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:50.410
So what is this operator here?

79
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.430
If you observe slash, then use Flash.

80
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.830
So now based on your requirement,

81
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.135
you can provide anyone of that character as you are, please Operator.

82
00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.070
Right.

83
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.625
Let me take now $1.1.

84
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:08.125
Knocks it.

85
00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:09.740
Sorry.

86
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.895
Okay.

87
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:14.770
You how feels operator heroes, right?

88
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.645
So before that we didn't have anything.

89
00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:22.280
Let me take two because this is one separate.

90
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.885
Alright? So you guys,

91
00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:27.840
if this is a line, let me highlight this part.

92
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.935
See if this is a line.

93
00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:32.255
If you separate here,

94
00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:34.385
then this is Foster Building second field.

95
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:35.630
Same way, very firstly,

96
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.430
how fields operators slashed.

97
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.430
So if we separate that before that empty fields operator,

98
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.545
then the second piece of bread and oh,

99
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:45.270
that's why you have to take dollar.

100
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.335
Right?

101
00:05:48.335 --> 00:05:53.360
Now. Suppose I want to take EC2 as this operator.

102
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.615
Yes, you can take it C that you could take easy to add this operator.

103
00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:00.875
Then what is the second field?

104
00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:03.215
Iphone user P, The second freedom.

105
00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:05.300
What happened?

106
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.195
I remove hyphen m.

107
00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:12.995
You have to mention, I'm going to see that.

108
00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:16.790
Hope I mentioned slash Also, sorry.

109
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.770
Only one separate, right?

110
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.435
Yeah, I found m.

111
00:06:20.435 --> 00:06:24.230
Then you're feels operator value C, that that's it.

112
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.970
So it may be a character or it may be a spring, right?

113
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.505
That is possible with your delicate command.

114
00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:33.065
So based on your requirement,

115
00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:35.630
actually my intentions in this path,

116
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.795
if I feel these are the fields operator,

117
00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:40.445
then this is faster fail,

118
00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:43.085
this is remaining is secondary, right?

119
00:06:43.085 --> 00:06:45.245
So that's what we are getting here.

120
00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:48.545
So that is about your hyphen yep, option.

121
00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:56.510
Now let me take suppose hyphen v option, right?

122
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.320
C hyphen v is used to define some variable.

123
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.200
Say suppose x equals to five.

124
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:11.030
Now I want to print you are $1.2 as well as what is the x value?

125
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.295
C that fight.

126
00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:15.950
So I defined x equals to five,

127
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.265
then that value I can use in actions.

128
00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:21.890
So if you want to define one more variable i and you want to

129
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.620
take hyphen v. Suppose let say y equals to some six.

130
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.560
Suppose if you want to print x and y, that's it.

131
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.590
So I can VIV useful to declare a variable value in what initially came.

132
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.655
Right?

133
00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:44.285
So if I funnier for knife and we both it can include right now.

134
00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:47.420
Now one more thing called hyphen.

135
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.500
Yep. What is this?

136
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.750
I am nothing is there.

137
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.360
Whatever the logic you are having here mode that logic,

138
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.480
just try to write inside of a pipe, right?

139
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.430
Suppose let, let say or not is one.

140
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.515
Plus let me write.

141
00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:05.705
You can use IFF option also here.

142
00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:07.400
Let me take simple thing.

143
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.230
And we're all those things we are going to

144
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.445
discuss completely with the edible stripped apart.

145
00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:16.290
This is Arabic at command port, right?

146
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.350
Second Will you are getting is right.

147
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.660
My intention means the logic,

148
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.795
whatever you are using here, right?

149
00:08:29.795 --> 00:08:37.680
I'm going to write that logic into my logic dot AWPA or my action naught AWPA.

150
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.130
Simply I'm using undertake parentheses,

151
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.715
just simply take that action.

152
00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:48.635
Curly braces.

153
00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:51.500
Now, a WK, iPhone f,

154
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.460
action dot-dot-dot AWPA than you or them 0.2x didn't see that.

155
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.490
So nothing is there.

156
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.725
Whatever you're writing inside of your single quotation,

157
00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:03.155
that logic you can write into one file.

158
00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:06.545
And that file you can mention with iPhone5 option.

159
00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:10.070
Okay, so whereas we will discuss in detail with

160
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:14.585
ICANN IAAF option while working with the scripting part of your NLTK command.

161
00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:18.720
As of now we are working with only AWPA command part.

162
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.350
Right?

163
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:27.200
Okay guys, this is simply about your enemy git command using options.

164
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.395
So most important openings hyphen, yeah.

165
00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:32.645
Okay, even Ivan via Microsoft,

166
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.945
both are helpful by lighting scripting bug actually.

167
00:09:35.945 --> 00:09:39.875
By so for your automation siding using shelf scripting, right?

168
00:09:39.875 --> 00:09:41.840
Iphone app is the most important one.

169
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.665
So try to practice and practice with hyphen yep. Option.

170
00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:47.240
Okay.

171
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.080
Okay.

172
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.850
Yes. Thank you for watching this video.
