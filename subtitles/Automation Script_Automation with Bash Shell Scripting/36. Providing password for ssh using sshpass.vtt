00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.315
Friends here our concept is providing password for SSH using SSH pass.

2
00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:10.095
C SSH pass is a utility or command.

3
00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:15.255
Using that we can provide password for your SSH in non-interactive way.

4
00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:21.390
Simply as a such paths is a non-interactive to SSH password authentication.

5
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.245
We'll just assume that your environment is password authentication.

6
00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.265
I mean, whenever if you are trying to login into remote server from your local server,

7
00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:30.810
it needs a password.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.235
Suppose here we have some list of remote servers.

9
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.790
Now I want to execute a command on one-off my remote server.

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.305
Then you are using SSH,

11
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:44.420
hyphen T. Then strict hosting hitchhiking equals to know.

12
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.110
Then what is the user you want to connect with your remote server.

13
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.810
Then after that, you are providing your server,

14
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.390
remote server IP or host name.

15
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.000
Then you are come and come and maybe any command.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.065
What happen?

17
00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:02.615
Sorry, hyphen war.

18
00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:06.905
You have to provide your option with hyphen Wu, hyphen wall.

19
00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:08.750
Now it is asking a password.

20
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.460
Let me provide password here.

21
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.035
So I'll give it a password.

22
00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:14.120
Now you are getting output for your command.

23
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.955
Suppose you want to run some ten commands separately through your SSH.

24
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.520
Then each time you have to provide password.

25
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.010
And if you want to automate or to run your ten commands through a shell script,

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
then while running shell script also you have to provide ten times your password.

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.985
But it's somewhat, of course,

28
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:36.680
you can provide your password,

29
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.025
but unnecessarily how to interact with your shells could whale running.

30
00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:41.930
So in that case,

31
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.620
our associate you pass will help us to provide

32
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.300
password to your SSH in a non-interactive way.

33
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.565
Let me show you that simply.

34
00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:56.465
First, SHE passed SSH,

35
00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:57.980
we have different options here.

36
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.709
Let me go with one-by-one SSH.

37
00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.470
Your command, you have to take as it is and use SSH pass if you're Enron mentees,

38
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.195
password authentication, suppose if you are,

39
00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:10.310
any moment is possible. Less authentication.

40
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.585
You know, need your SSH bus,

41
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:20.060
SSH pass hyphen p in quotations just to provide password.

42
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.855
So I'm providing password for my remote server.

43
00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:26.765
Now see that without asking password,

44
00:02:26.765 --> 00:02:30.905
now your SSH is executing your commands on your remote server.

45
00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:34.800
Any command you can execute now on your remote server.

46
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.830
That's it. So now basically whenever if you run

47
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.190
your SSH command in a password authentication,

48
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.120
anyone meant it prompt password

49
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.820
null to avoid that automatically to provide password for your SSH,

50
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.280
SSH pass utility is useful,

51
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.000
that's it. Right? Now.

52
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.410
See not only that command,

53
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.760
you can execute any command.

54
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.665
Suppose simply I'm running.

55
00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.555
That's it.

56
00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:07.550
So be clear.

57
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.460
So here I'm using SSH pass hyphen p directly.

58
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.705
I'm providing my password here,

59
00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:16.700
but I don't want to provide my password on your terminal command line.

60
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.370
Instead of that, you can store your password in your file.

61
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.455
Let me store in any file name you can take any file I'm taking simply pass.

62
00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:28.370
So here just provide your password, then save it.

63
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.115
Now in shut off hyphen p,

64
00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:34.649
just to take hyphen IAAF option.

65
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.925
Then provide the file name in which we how your password for your remote server.

66
00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:42.125
That's it.

67
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.120
There is one more way.

68
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.270
There is a variable called SSH to pass.

69
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.365
Otherwise simply if you're an SSH pass C there is a variable called SSH.

70
00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:57.080
You pass, you can export that variable with your password. Let me export it.

71
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.730
Simply export.

72
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.120
You want a variable inside that just provide a password.

73
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.280
Now run your command using SHE pass, SSH pass.

74
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.690
Just iPhone.

75
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.730
You now see that isn't.

76
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.100
Now if you take hyphen e option,

77
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.190
you have to provide SSH a path variable,

78
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.860
unit export, SHE pos variable that only when I have

79
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.830
any option will work in your SSH pass.

80
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.015
That's it.

81
00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:32.645
So anyway, we'll get more practice are to work with your SHE paths.

82
00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:36.290
But before that, whenever if you want to use SSH to pass,

83
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.630
you hardly check it whether it is dead or not.

84
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.540
See by default you may not have this SSH,

85
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.245
a POS utility on your index like Unix, Linux like environment.

86
00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:46.340
If it is not there,

87
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.220
then what you have to do simply you how to install it by using yum install SSH pass.

88
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.360
But I am not the root user.

89
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.350
That's why you had to provide sudo if you're currently user is having root privileges,

90
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.660
are switching to route from there to just run yum install SSH to pass and see the result.

91
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.560
See already, we have led us to washing off essentially pass.

92
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.985
That's where it is not installing.

93
00:05:07.985 --> 00:05:09.560
But for your demo purpose,

94
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.130
what I will do here, I will log in into one of my remote server data.

95
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.885
We'll show you how to install as a two-pass,

96
00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:19.670
same steps you can follow on your server.

97
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.370
Simply let me log in into my remote server.

98
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.330
So first time switching into root, that's better one.

99
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.300
Now I am running yum install.

100
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.740
She passed. But there is no match for your SSH paths in your configured ribose.

101
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.170
In that case, what you have to do is just

102
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.140
open a browser and based on your operating system,

103
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.285
suppose my knees originated,

104
00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:53.205
such for EPL, for our HGL eight based on your way.

105
00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:59.330
Then just opened this anyone of the link.

106
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.940
And they will give directly the link for your EPL package.

107
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.945
Otherwise, you can also directly go to this website, official website,

108
00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:19.010
HTTPS, CPL. See that?

109
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.790
So here you will get based on your questions either at 45678, based on your version.

110
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.200
If you open that there,

111
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.820
you'll get your EPL package.

112
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.710
It is six by 64 packages. Go to A0.

113
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:45.905
So you now such for EPL Control F EPL.

114
00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:49.865
Now say that based on your ways we hope,

115
00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:51.620
but little EPL packages.

116
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:59.555
So now simply what I will take this copy that link, come to your host.

117
00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:02.120
Yum install directly provide

118
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.885
the EPL rpm so that it will add that repository to your host.

119
00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:10.505
So once it is add it,

120
00:07:10.505 --> 00:07:18.650
now you can install it simply by running yum install SSH pass.

121
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.810
That's it.

122
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.265
Provides, yes. Now it is downloading, uninstalling.

123
00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:27.665
That's it. Now, check it.

124
00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:31.160
It is that now I'm exiting from root.

125
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.770
Now we are on automation user on your remote server.

126
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.765
Now I am taking here also, yes, it is there.

127
00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:40.655
So that is the simple way to install your SHE pass on your coast.

128
00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:46.020
So we will do more practice in your later sessions. Thank you.
