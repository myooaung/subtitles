00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.305
Prince, in our previous video,

2
00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:14.310
we created some patterns with the help of some special characters like space tab,

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.805
dot.me for any character matching.

4
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:26.760
Then star, star means 0 or more characters for your preceding letter.

5
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.910
Then slash question mark,

6
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.875
none or one matching.

7
00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.805
Then slash plus one or more matching.

8
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:38.940
Then finally we have seen slash also means to

9
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.775
escape your special purpose of all these characters.

10
00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.830
Right? Now the thing is,

11
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.140
you have so many special characters.

12
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.640
Now we discuss only some of them.

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.690
Now here we are going to discuss two more special characters on these are very,

14
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.760
very important in your realtime.

15
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.940
They are like carrot symbol.

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.895
So what is the use of carrot and dollar symbol?

17
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:02.825
Right?

18
00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:09.110
See, basically carriage is used to match any word at this starting off your given line.

19
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.275
Let's say I have a file called in this way.

20
00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:13.550
Right?

21
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.170
Now I will do one thing.

22
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.145
Let me modify this file.

23
00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:23.825
I'm going to write something like put this there.

24
00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.435
This line.

25
00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:27.290
No way.

26
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.405
Suppose I am going to such a line which consists of put.

27
00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.915
I want to print the, the lines which are having put, right?

28
00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:37.340
Let me do this first.

29
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.810
So how many lines you are getting?

30
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.920
Two lines.

31
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.295
But what I am doing is I want to get the line

32
00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:47.150
which are having put only at the starting of your line.

33
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.520
Now see the output what you are getting.

34
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.955
Put word is there in two lines,

35
00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:56.840
but in Firstly, anyhow, somewhere in secondary heart very first.

36
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.875
Now carrot means whatever the worry or searching.

37
00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.815
If that word is there at very first in a given line,

38
00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:05.915
then only that line will print.

39
00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:11.180
I mean, you are searching for the lines which are having a word or the starting.

40
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.760
Not only would worry, you can go with any word.

41
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.430
Right? Now, same way.

42
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.270
Let's say firstly, if you have your final, okay,

43
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.250
now I'm going to such a line which consists of suppose pot.

44
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.075
I'm going to print the, the lines which are having pot work.

45
00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:31.130
Let me print them first.

46
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.440
So you have two places pot that we are getting two lines.

47
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.055
Now.

48
00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:43.925
I want to get the lines which are having pot word at the ending in the given line, right?

49
00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:49.520
To get the lines which are having pot word at the end, right?

50
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.640
You have to take your searching board at the end.

51
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.005
You have to take dollar,

52
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.420
then see the output, what you are getting.

53
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.780
You are getting the line which is having pot at the end.

54
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.385
So that is the usage of dollar.

55
00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.940
If you are looking for some word, right?

56
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.600
You're, you're looking for some lines which are having pot word,

57
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.190
especially at the end,

58
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.465
then you have to use pot.

59
00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:14.045
You are searching what then dollar symbol.

60
00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:15.515
Right?

61
00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:17.340
Now, fine.

62
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.500
Now said CA.

63
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.365
So let me show you your file first.

64
00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:27.755
So yeah, let me open this file.

65
00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:30.650
So I want to create some empty lines, man.

66
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.050
Because my intention is to find out in empty lines.

67
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.760
Let me create, suppose some 34 empty lines.

68
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.220
Now see that as of now,

69
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.845
whatever the file you are having, this is the file.

70
00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:53.285
Now my requirement is I want to print the lines which are empty.

71
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:59.180
So there is a shortcut like start with nothing and nothing.

72
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.700
That is a meaning with the symbol.

73
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.130
Now if you observe the output C,

74
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.270
this many gaps you are getting means that many empty lines in your file.

75
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.910
Now generally new real time, right,

76
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.050
while working with some files,

77
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.660
if there are any empty lines, you want to delete them.

78
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.805
So if you want to delete any line, you know,

79
00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:19.730
what is the syntax for that based on searching Word?

80
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.605
Or suppose if I want build first line,

81
00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:23.735
I have to use this syntax right?

82
00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:26.465
Then it will delete your first line.

83
00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:32.120
But I want to delete the lines which are empty, which are empty.

84
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.679
So delete these lines.

85
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.505
Now see the output, what you are getting,

86
00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:40.400
you are getting output without any empty lines.

87
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.685
If you want to delete permanently the empty lines in your original file or source file,

88
00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:48.725
just use eye for an eye option.

89
00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:49.790
Right?

90
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.830
Now, open your file and see the content.

91
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.160
What is there? Now you don't have any empty lines.

92
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.805
That is the very, very important one in your real time.

93
00:04:58.805 --> 00:05:01.895
Deleting empty lines permanently.

94
00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:06.095
These syntax simply, this is the meaning to find out empty lines.

95
00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:09.245
So you are searching for empty lines and that lens you are deleting.

96
00:05:09.245 --> 00:05:14.135
So I, if I means permanently or deleting, right?

97
00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:16.400
So that is the usage of your carrot and

98
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.520
dollar symbol and the combination of keratin dollar.

99
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.840
No. Let say I will do something.

100
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.590
I'm going to add some thin somewhere.

101
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.215
No, let me print the lines which are having carrot symbol.

102
00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:40.520
Suppose if I want to do that,

103
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.965
what I can do hyphen n,

104
00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:48.860
carrot, printed the lines which are having carrot symbol, but see what you are getting.

105
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.030
You are getting all the lengths.

106
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.030
So basically the purpose of Kennedy's whatever,

107
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.190
those searching body, how that word should be there at the starting,

108
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.270
you don't have anything, right?

109
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.920
That's why all lines are matching.

110
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.130
But if you want to match it with the carrier itself,

111
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.884
carries a special character.

112
00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:12.130
So you need to remove that special purpose by using escape symbol.

113
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.960
Now see the output.

114
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.445
The same way.

115
00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:18.370
I wanted to get the lines which are having only dollar symbol,

116
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.170
not for ending with something,

117
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.600
only the lines which are having dollar.

118
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.399
So dollar purposes.

119
00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:26.800
Such something at the end of your line.

120
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.895
I mean, such the lines which are having some Butler what at the end.

121
00:06:30.895 --> 00:06:32.815
But I don't want to go in that way.

122
00:06:32.815 --> 00:06:36.050
I don't want to use my special purpose of character.

123
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.415
I want to just match like a equals B equals to B. I want to match like that.

124
00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:42.590
Then you have to remove your special-purpose off

125
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.515
your dollar by placing your escape symbol.

126
00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:47.060
That's it.

127
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.140
Ok, so it's already we discussed about in our previous video,

128
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.205
escape symbols, same purpose we are using here, right?

129
00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:56.210
Ok.

130
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.090
We'll see some more special characters to create

131
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.515
your patrons and to use in regular expressions of your set command in later videos.

132
00:07:03.515 --> 00:07:06.390
Ok, thank you for watching this video.
