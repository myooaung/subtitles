1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,165
Friends here, our concepts or if

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:07,004
an if-else statements say before going to work with these two concepts,

3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:10,110
let me recollect our known concepts from logical and,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,685
and logical or operator.

5
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:13,950
Let's say how two commands,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,930
command one and command to.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,095
And I wanted to club them by using logical and operator.

8
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:21,015
Then you know how this result works.

9
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:24,705
Command you too will execute if command one is success,

10
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:27,870
suppose you've come in, one is fail commander to won't execute.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,510
That means command to is depending on command one.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,180
No, let me club with the one more command,

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,260
let's say command three.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,900
Now command three will execute if command to his success.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,710
I mean command threes depending one command to un-comment,

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,500
it will execute if command one is success.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,645
Now if you observe clearly,

18
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:49,025
command three legs, good.

19
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,990
If Foster two comments or success.

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,555
But now my requirement is if command one is executing successfully,

21
00:00:56,555 --> 00:01:00,665
then I want to exclude commander to and command three,

22
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:03,095
unwilling scooting command to run command three.

23
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:07,700
I don't want to depend command three on command to exit status.

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,160
I wonder, and these two comments independently,

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,735
if command one is success,

26
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:14,930
then this index is not a valid one for your requirements,

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,550
then you have to modify in this way,

28
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,750
if whatever the first command you want to validate that command,

29
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,810
then there is a syntax close with their Phi.

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,550
And between these then and FA,

31
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,640
you can write any number of commands or logic.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,285
Let me write command two, command three,

33
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:34,715
or maybe some variable declaration,

34
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:38,570
or maybe some echo command, whatever it may be.

35
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,790
Now, compared to this syntax, the syntax,

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,695
you are commanded to comment three,

37
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:49,475
all these commands will execute independently.

38
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:53,720
And these commands, all these commands will execute if command one in success.

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,175
Be clear.

40
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:58,595
In this syntax, command threes depending on comment too.

41
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:01,640
But here command three and commend you are executing independently.

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,130
Only conditioning. If first command is success,

43
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,309
then these all commands will execute in imminently.

44
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:08,495
That's it.

45
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,240
Now let me explain that with a simple example.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,125
Suppose let me define a simple cell scribbles,

47
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,540
simple, if not SH.

48
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,450
Let me read the very first line as she mainland bin bash or user bin bash.

49
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,455
Now I'm trying to such which HTTPD,

50
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:29,270
if Hetchy deputies there,

51
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,615
I want to run some commands independently,

52
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:39,060
then then UNCLOS with their fight.

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,030
Friends here, then an f phi or the syntaxes.

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,205
And whatever the lines you are going to write,

55
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:47,950
what are the commands you are going to write between then and FA?

56
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,490
You can start from coastal space onwards in this line,

57
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,680
but it's better to provide at least two spaces just for looking purpose.

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,275
Say I'm not starting with the fastest pace in that lane.

59
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,595
I'm giving two spaces.

60
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:02,650
Then I'm starting a co,

61
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,855
HTTPD is present on this host.

62
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:14,365
Then I am finding system CTL status, HTTPD.

63
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,195
And I'm running that command.

64
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,570
I mean HTTPD service, ACO.

65
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,435
Now, starting.

66
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,365
Judy PD, I'm running some number of commands.

67
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:29,585
Then sudo, system CTL, start HTTPD.

68
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,070
Be clear.

69
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,080
If HTTPD is there,

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,975
this will return exit status as 0.

71
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,110
That means this will get success if it is success.

72
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,680
Now all the commands which are there here, all the logic,

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,490
all the statements which are there between then and if phi,

74
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,980
those will execute independently.

75
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,725
Suppose while executing these four commands,

76
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,705
suppose this command is getting fail,

77
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:55,760
but it doesn't disturb.

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,385
It won't disturb to executing remaining two commands.

79
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:04,275
That is the advantage here whenever if you use if condition. Now let me save this.

80
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,730
And one more thing here,

81
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,945
actually reach puberty will view the output as some user bin hetero AD BD.

82
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:14,800
I don't want to display either error or success output.

83
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,560
Then, you know the shortcut to hide that output error or success,

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,455
or it can redirect that internal file.

85
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:28,390
That's now give me the execution permission for that.

86
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,950
Now I am running that.

87
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,845
See there is a yes.

88
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:35,589
All commands are executing.

89
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:38,935
C, whatever the command we used here.

90
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:42,625
That is HTTPD, not only that you can use any command,

91
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,335
let me take one more example.

92
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:48,950
I'm commenting this with the multiple line comments concept.

93
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,625
Now, if you can also write some test to comment that is also a command.

94
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:59,920
Let me take in this way four equals 24.

95
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,650
If it is success, then foster close with their fight.

96
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,290
Now write your logic between then and f phi.

97
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,615
So that is ACO,

98
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:21,490
they are equal. Those are 44.

99
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,400
Let say for setting this entire thing is a one command.

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,035
And if they are equal it will return

101
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:33,335
exit status are 0 means that is success, this is success.

102
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:36,245
Then these two commands will execute independently.

103
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:40,925
That's it. Now let me save this and run that.

104
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:45,270
Before that, simply see the corps and I'm running.

105
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,235
Yes, those are equal.

106
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,439
And those are 44.

107
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,215
Suppose if your condition is getting fail,

108
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:58,700
then it doesn't allow to execute the lines which are there between then and F phi.

109
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,580
Let me write it here and we have 44 are equal,

110
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,340
but I'm reversing that result by using elementary symbol.

111
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,680
So whenever, if use exclamation symbol,

112
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,525
whatever the status you are getting,

113
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:15,240
actually this is success, that success will become fail.

114
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,950
That's why it is not allowing to execute your lines which are there between your yf,

115
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:27,275
then an f phi, these two lanes now they are not going to see that.

116
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:31,624
That's a, that is the simple uses of if condition.

117
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,430
Now let me explain one more thing.

118
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,525
Suppose if we have a requirement in the if command one a success,

119
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:42,650
then I want to execute only one command called comment too.

120
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,400
Then in that case, you don't need to write if condition already we have

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,630
this syntax clubbing with

122
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,840
two commands with the logical and operator that is the best one.

123
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,589
But whenever, if you want to execute multiple commands independently,

124
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,760
if command 1is success,

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
then only use if condition.

126
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,320
So here what we're doing if command one is sexist comment

127
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,050
to we're executing further Dean only direct this logic simply,

128
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,120
you can use this one only that is the best one.

129
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,035
That's it. That is simple if condition.

130
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:16,370
Now, let me once again go with your core.

131
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,535
If this is failed, then you are not.

132
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:24,050
I mean, you are if condition is not allowing to execute these two lines.

133
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,330
But if this is fail,

134
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,270
I want I want a to some other lines.

135
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,390
Then in that case you can extend your code in this way.

136
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:39,920
Let me write if L dot SH script, bin bash.

137
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
See what I'm doing.

138
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:49,670
If I'm testing like four greater than four greater than phi.

139
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,395
Anyway, that is false.

140
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:53,510
If it is success, suppose if you,

141
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,040
if you are four is greater than 5x,

142
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,005
then I want to execute some number of lines.

143
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:59,585
Then those lines you have to write.

144
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:02,510
First let me syntax for you or if and else.

145
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,055
If, then, else, then close with phi.

146
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:09,590
Now here you can write some number of

147
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,200
lanes on here also you can add some number of lines.

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,525
But if this condition is getting, I mean,

149
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:16,550
if the command is getting success,

150
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,660
then if will allow takes good the lines which are there between then and else.

151
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,995
If it is failed,

152
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:27,290
then it will skip this part and this part that is advantage with f and l.

153
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,015
Now let me write.

154
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:31,040
Now here I'm writing two commands.

155
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,515
Let's say echo.

156
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:38,720
We are comparing 45.

157
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,210
In case if you are command is getting success means four is greater than phi.

158
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,375
At that time, the lines which are there here, they will execute.

159
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,535
Now I'm writing a CFO.

160
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,865
Four is greater than fight anyway, that is not correct.

161
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,175
It won't execute these two lines.

162
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:57,230
Now if it is failed,

163
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,040
then you will allow to execute the lines which are there within el Santo phi.

164
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,630
Then I am writing some lines here also.

165
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,895
As you can also start even lend from here onwards.

166
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,950
But it's better to provide at least a two spaces

167
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,530
are four spaces just for looking purpose.

168
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,140
Aco, we are comparing 45.

169
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,820
So else will execute if the condition is false or if your command is getting fatal,

170
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,590
getting failing means, in our case,

171
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,985
four is not greater than five.

172
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:32,070
Then I can display four is not greater than five. That's it.

173
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,295
Now let me save it.

174
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:37,505
Let me provide the execution permissions for that.

175
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:39,950
Now, see your core.

176
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,410
Now I'm running that code.

177
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,875
We are combining 454 is not greater than five.

178
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,925
This block is executing the lines which are there between Elson,

179
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:53,840
FAA, or executing because your command was failed.

180
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,815
Why does fail?

181
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,480
Because we are comparing four greater than phi,

182
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,700
that is not correct that way this is fail Nazi.
