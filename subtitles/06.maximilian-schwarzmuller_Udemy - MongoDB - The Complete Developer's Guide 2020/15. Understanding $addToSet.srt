1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,180
Now there's one more command I want to show you, for that let's cycle through the past commands to the

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,490
command where I pushed a single hobby to Maria

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,270
and let me change this to hiking.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,080
Now here I push a single object, the command I'll show you will not work with each with that array

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,470
but if you push one object which I can do with push of course, you can also use addToSet instead.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,330
If I hit enter, you see one document was modified

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,710
and if I find them all, you see hiking is there.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,910
The question is what is the difference to push? That should become clearer once I try the exact same

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,710
command again. Previously with push,

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,220
we were able to push duplicate values.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,550
Now you see modified count is 0,

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,410
we get no error but you see nothing was changed

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,680
and indeed if we look into the data, there is still only one hiking hobby.

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:07,210
The difference is that addToSet adds unique values only,

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,040
so if you try to add a value that's already part of the array, it will not be added again

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,710
and that can of course also be helpful in some situations.
