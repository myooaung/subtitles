00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:09.690
In the previous module, I showed you how you can build a real application using a mongodb driver and

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.110
therefore interacting with your mongodb database. In this module, I'll show you a totally

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.130
new set of features

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.170
the mongodb company also provides, these features are loosely also related to their database solution,

5
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.700
so to mongodb but they basically enter a new realm,

6
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.950
so these features are not directly connected to the database at least, these are brand new features as

7
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.840
you will learn. And therefore everything you learned thus far about the database is not really touched

8
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.340
by this

9
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.230
but the things you learn in this module can help you with building modern web or mobile applications

10
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.700
in general.

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.360
So what's inside this module?

12
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.900
I will explain what stitch is,

13
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.570
mongodb stitch is the name of that service offering

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560
and I will explain what's behind that,

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.720
which services can be found in the stitch environment and what these services do for you.

16
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.900
And after understanding what stitch is, we will also use stitch,

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.230
so we'll basically take the application from the last module and we'll use stitch to transform it a

18
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.900
little bit and

19
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.450
as you will see, we'll be able to get rid of our own node restful API which is a big deal because it

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.100
allows us to basically focus entirely on our user interface and our core business logic

21
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.580
and we don't have to write the boilerplate code of setting up a rest API, of doing authentication on

22
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.340
our own and so on.

23
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.940
So that is pretty exciting,

24
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.720
let's dive in.
