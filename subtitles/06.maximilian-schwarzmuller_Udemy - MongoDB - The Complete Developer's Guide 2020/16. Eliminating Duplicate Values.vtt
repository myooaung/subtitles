00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.380
You might not want duplicate values and to avoid that,

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.680
you can use an alternative to push. Instead of push, you can use add to set, add to set does almost the same

3
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.770
but if I run it, you see now we have no duplicate values because add to set essentially also pushes

4
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.440
but avoids duplicate values. If it finds that an entry already exists,

5
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.690
it just doesn't push the new value,

6
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.780
this is what adds to set does.

7
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.090
So with that, with unwind, with push in the group stage and with add to set in the group stage, you

8
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.330
get powerful features that should help you manage your array data efficiently and transform it into

9
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.580
whichever format you require.
