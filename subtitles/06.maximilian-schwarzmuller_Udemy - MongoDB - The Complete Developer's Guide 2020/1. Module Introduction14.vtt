Welcome to this module. In the previous modules, we already worked a bit with the mongod instance,

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.030
so with this mongo server we started and with the mongo shell started with this mongo command. In the first

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.310
course module, you learned how you install these things and how you generally use them, in this module

4
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.560
I want to dive a little bit deeper and show you some things you can configure and most importantly,

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.660
where you can find more options and how to think about these options.

6
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.100
So to be precise, you will learn that you can start your mongodb server in two different ways, as

7
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.560
a process and as a service and I will show you how that works in this module of course. You'll also learn

8
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.800
a bit about configuring your mongodb server or the the way it runs

9
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.960
to be precise

10
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.150
and you will also learn how to fix issues or find some help, find out what you can actually configure,

11
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.100
what you can do. With that,

12
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.020
let's get started.
