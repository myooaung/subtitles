00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.550
Throughout this course, we always worked with the mongo shell for a good reason because it's a neutral

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.700
instrument which we can use to practice the different aspects of mongodb, the different operations you

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.110
can execute and all that stuff in a way that is well independent from the application you're building,

4
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.200
no matter if you're building a python, a C++ or a javascript nodejs application,

5
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.460
you can work with the mongo shell to practice mongodb.

6
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.710
Now obviously it's important for you to be able to transition from the knowledge you learned here with the

7
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.980
shell to your drivers and therefore in this module, I will show you how to generally find out how to

8
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.380
use the drivers for the different languages you might be using for your application

9
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.730
and we will actually work on an entire project built with javascript and nodejs and implement the

10
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.230
official mongodb driver there so that you can see how that would work, how you then connect to

11
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.800
your mongodb instance and how you then well write operations or execute operations from inside

12
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.470
your

13
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.320
in this case, javascript application.

14
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.000
Now important for this module,

15
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.420
we will build an application with react,

16
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.530
node and mongodb

17
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.590
but even if you're not a nodejs or react developer, you should still go through this module because

18
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.430
you'll still be able to follow along and understand the general philosophy behind connecting mongodb

19
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.660
to an application and you'll still be able to understand how you use a driver with mongodb,

20
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.360
so you'll still get all the important information out of this module.

21
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.060
So in this module, I'll show you how shell commands can be translated to driver commands and how you

22
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.870
find out how to use the driver of your choice.

23
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.050
I will also show you how you can then connect to mongodb servers from inside your driver and we'll

24
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.470
use mongodb

25
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.510
atlas for this in this module

26
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.110
and I will also show you how to perform crud operations from inside your driver,

27
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.750
so from inside the application you are building via the driver

28
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.680
I should say. That is what's inside the module,

29
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.180
so with that let's get started.
