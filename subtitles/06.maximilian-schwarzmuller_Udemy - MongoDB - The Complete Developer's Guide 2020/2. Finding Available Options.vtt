00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.160
Now a good way to get started if you want to learn more about any of the features mongodb provides is

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.750
to dive into the official docs,

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.940
even though that sounds a bit cheap, it indeed is a good way to learn about all the available options

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.000
and things you can configure. In the official docs,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.400
you will find the detailed docs for the mongodb server which is what we're using right now and there,

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.460
most important for you are either the frequently asked questions at the bottom, you find of course docs

7
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.380
for all the features but we'll cover them in this course but you should also check out the installation

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380
docs to make sure you've got everything set up correctly.

9
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.900
We did this in a first course module though, so that should be the case,

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.130
so then the mongo shell docs are also interesting because here, you can learn more about how to use that

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.810
mongo shell and how to configure that.

12
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.080
Now the documentation is one good place but obviously, there also are some important or interesting things

13
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080
that I want to show you right away.

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.900
So let's do that and for that, let me open your terminal, here

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.510
I did open a brand new terminal or on windows you would open the command prompt and I currently have

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.130
no mongodb server up and running,

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.900
so no mongodb process is running in any terminal window.

18
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.490
Now you learned that on Mac, you can start a new server with sudo mongod,

19
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.060
on Windows it was just mongod and you can start the shell and connect to a running server with the mongo

20
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.710
command

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.550
assuming that you did follow the setup steps in the first course module where we also configured the

22
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.860
path variables.

23
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.440
So this is how you can start these processes,

24
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.360
now the mongod command actually can be configured with a couple of flags.

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.530
We already saw the --port flag for example to change the default port,

26
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.860
now there are more flags and you can see all flags or options with the help command, --help.

27
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.640
This is quite a long list because the server can be configured in various ways and we'll dive into some

28
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.430
of the features like authentication in a separate module of this course but you can definitely go through

29
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.850
this list to get a feeling for what you can generally configure

30
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.500
and now there are a couple of options which I will walk through together with you in the next lectures.
