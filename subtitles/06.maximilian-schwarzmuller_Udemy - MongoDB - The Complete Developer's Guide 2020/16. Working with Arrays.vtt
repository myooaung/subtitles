00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.930
So we saw embedded documents,

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.020
let's now have a look at arrays of data and for that, let's go back to our passengers.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.000
So remember we got our passengers collection, if we find all entries there,

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.920
this is how a passenger looked like.

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.150
Now let's say we also record the hobbies of our passengers, 

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.880
for this I'll edit Albert Twostone here

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.900
with updateOne,

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:38.280
so by selecting the passenger with the name Albert Twostone, like this and I'll update it by setting

9
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.340
a new field

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.780
there, hobbies which is an array marked with square brackets, so this is important,

11
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.180
now it's an array.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.900
And here we can have any kinds of data there,

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.810
we could have multiple documents in here, that would be fine but we can all have multiple numbers or

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.970
simply strings like sports and cooking,

15
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.920
these are just strings not documents.

16
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.080
So any kind of data you can have in a document can also be in an array in a document.

17
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.300
If I hit enter and I output my passengers, you see Albert now has hobbies,

18
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.080
he's the only passenger with that because we filtered for him and hobbies now a list of data.

19
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.150
It's not a nested or embedded document,

20
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.520
it's a list of strings in this case

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.440
and as I said, this could be numbers, this could also be other documents, so you can also have documents

22
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.260
in an array and you can have arrays in documents,

23
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.280
this is possible.

24
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.180
You can even have arrays in nested documents,

25
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.730
this is all possible.
