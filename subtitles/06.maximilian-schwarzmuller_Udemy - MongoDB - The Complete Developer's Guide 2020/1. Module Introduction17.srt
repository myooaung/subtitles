1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,390
In the last module we had a detailed look at how you can get data into the database.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,500
Now often, that is only useful if you have the means to get data out of the database

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,830
and that is exactly what this module is about,

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,740
it's about reading data that is in your database.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,700
Now we already used find quite a bit in this module but find as we used it always gave us back all the

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,120
data essentially. You can of course filter for specific documents, you're not limited to getting all the

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,630
data all the time and you can also transform the documents you get back to some extent.

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,180
Additionally, we'll talk about that cursor thing again which I touched on earlier in this course, so in

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,250
detail we'll have a look at methods, filters and operators, what all of that is and how it works together.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,150
We'll then have a look at query selectors,

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:58,030
so findOne and find and how we work with filters there and add projection operators which will help us

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,550
with well transforming the data we get back

13
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,400
you could say. This is in a nutshell what we'll do in this module and for this module, we'll use the

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,490
dataset or at least we'll start with the dataset we imported at the end of last module,

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,410
so make sure you watch that video to see how that dataset, the movies dataset there

16
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,790
got into the database, we used mongo import for that and we did it at the end of the insert module.

17
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,690
If you know how to use mongo import, you'll find that dataset attached to this video again,

18
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,450
you don't need to re-import if you already did it in the last module but if you skipped that module

19
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,670
but you know how to import data, the dataset is attached.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,960
So with that let's dive into reading data.
