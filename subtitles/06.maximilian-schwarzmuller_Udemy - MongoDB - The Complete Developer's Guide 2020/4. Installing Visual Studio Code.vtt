00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.770
Now you might already have installed it because we used it throughout the course from time to time,

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.070
you now will also need an IDE, an integrated development environment to work on the code to add mongodb.

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.170
So to download visual studio code, simply choose your operating system

4
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.970
if it's not selected correctly anyways, click download and walk through the installer which this will start.

5
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.370
Now you can also use other editors and IDEs if you got your favorite editor or IDE, that will of course

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.300
all work

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.990
but if you don't know which to use, this is a great free way of working on a node react application.

8
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.750
Now once you installed visual studio code and you opened it, you can adjust it to your requirements,

9
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.000
for example under code preferences, you can choose your color theme,

10
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.760
I'm using the dark plus theme,

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.620
I also installed a special extension to have the material style icons but that is it.

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.420
Besides that, I got the default setup basically and with the visual studio code open, you should simply open that

13
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.310
folder which you extracted where you also ran these commands in the terminal, 

14
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.520
well that folder is what you should open here and you'll get this setup or this file directory.

15
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.020
Now this is the setup we'll work in,

16
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.710
this holds the source code we'll work in and there, you basically have the top level folders which are

17
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.200
related to your react application,

18
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.890
so source and public, these are important for react. In the backend, you find the code files related to

19
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.690
our simple node restful API,

20
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.190
there I also have the images folder with the dummy images I'm using.

21
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.120
So with all of that set up, we can now get started, work on that code, connect it to mongodb and so on.
