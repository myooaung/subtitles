With text indexes, you get also not just search for words but you can also rule out words,

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.130
let me show you what I mean. If I would search for awesome

3
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.450
and I pretty print that,

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.420
we find both the book and the T-shirt.

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.840
Now let's say I only want to find awesome products which are not T-shirts, so I could do this by adding

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:34.580
awesome and then minus T-shirt. If I do this I only find the book because the minus in front of a word

7
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.810
means that this word should be excluded

8
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.160
and this is really helpful of course because it allows you to run narrowed down queries like this one

9
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.580
where you only find awesome products which are not T-shirts or which at least don't have T-shirt in

10
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.520
the title or in the description.
