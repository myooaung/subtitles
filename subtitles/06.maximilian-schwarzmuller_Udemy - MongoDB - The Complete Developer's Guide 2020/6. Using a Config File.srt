00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,020
Now that we talked about the different options you can set and you can use to run your mongodb

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,860
server,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,450
it's also worth mentioning that you can save your settings in a configuration file.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,610
If you google for mongodb config file,

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,910
you should find this article from the official docs and there, you can learn that you can create a

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,370
mongodb config file and you might also get one by default

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,340
after your installation but I for example did not get one on Mac. So you might get one

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,100
otherwise you can simply create one and you can create it anywhere you want and I will do that too.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,000
I will create a config file here in my bin folder let's say, I actually did already create one

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,920
I name it mongodb.cfg,

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,730
so you can simply create this with a text editor. And here I'll edit it with Visual Studio code because that

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,630
is a nice editor for this and makes well reading that file really easy.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,170
Now you see I already have a file where I added some settings and this is how you do add settings and

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,960
you find detailed instructions in an article I just pointed you at,

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,860
there you also find one example of config file

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,830
and if you google for mongodb example of config file, you also find more examples by other users.

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,590
Now this is a more comprehensive file,

18
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,330
I've got a very simple file here,

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,060
in the end I here only set the path to my database, so where all the database files should be stored

20
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,070
and to my log files

21
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:32,570
and I also explicitly need to tell mongodb that this path points at a log file and that is my

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,950
mongodb config file.

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,290
Now the question just is

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,620
how do I use that file when starting a new mongodb instance?

25
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,900
And it's not the case that mongod would pick up this file automatically because how would it know that

26
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,450
it should, that this file exists and where it could find this file. Instead

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:59,730
when starting mongodb, you can use the --config option or a shortcut for that, -f and then

28
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,280
pass a path to the config file,

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:11,850
so in my case that's in my mongodb folder /bin/mongod.cfg and you could also name this conf,

30
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,420
that doesn't really matter.

31
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,320
With that, you could hit enter and it should now still start

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,990
your mongodb server with the setting set up in the configuration file

33
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,340
and this is of course a very useful feature too because this allows you to basically save a snapshot

34
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,300
of your settings,

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:36,500
a reuseable blueprint all of your settings in a separate file which you can then always well use for

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,260
starting up your server and you can find all the information about all the possible options and what

37
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,890
they do

38
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,770
in this article I pointed you at.

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,350
So if you want to dive deeper into this, definitely check out this article. With that and with the settings

40
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,820
you saw in the other lectures,

41
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,940
you should have a solid toolset of working with the

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,810
mongodb server and starting it in the way you want it to start.
