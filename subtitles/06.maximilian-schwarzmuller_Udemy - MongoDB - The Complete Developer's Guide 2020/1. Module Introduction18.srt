1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,220
We learned how we can insert documents and how we can find them. Now

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,080
another typical use case obviously is that you want to change documents, therefore in this module

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:20,180
we'll have a look at how you can update documents and how you can use different operators to well, apply

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,820
different kinds of updates to your data because you will see there's more than just overriding the existing

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,940
data.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,750
You'll learn how you can update fields, for example by setting a new value or by incrementing a number,

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,520
there are different tools that help you with that and you will also learn how to specifically update

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,380
arrays, for example add a new element to an array or remove one.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,830
These are all things you can do with the update one and update many methods provided by mongodb

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,280
and before we dive deeper into the different update operators, let's simply start by having a look at

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,150
these methods really quick again and then,

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,630
well let's start updating.
