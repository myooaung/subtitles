00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.880
Now if you visit mongodb.com,

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.370
there is a chance you'll automatically see mongodb atlas there on the front page and then you can

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.410
just click on get started free.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.160
If you don't see it, you can click on solutions and then there, choose mongodb Atlas

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.390
and if you are on that page, you should at least have a get started free button.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.860
Now if you click on that button, you are required to sign up

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.300
and as you see, there is no credit card required

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.690
so you can absolutely start for free without any danger of getting charged.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.810
So make sure you do sign up here,

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.960
I already do have an account so I'll just sign in

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.410
and once you are signed in, you should end up on a page like this

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.900
or maybe you have to create a project first,

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.850
so simply fill out the project details, give it a name and then you should end up on this clusters page

14
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.280
here. Now clusters simply describe a mongodb environment,

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.980
a cluster contains all your shards, all your replica sets,

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.370
it's basically what you deploy, it's your deployed mongodb server.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.120
So here on the clusters page,

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.140
I can click build a new cluster and this is the page where you can now configure your mongodb

19
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.600
environment as it will be deployed for you,

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.680
now let me walk you through that page.

21
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.970
The things you see here might change slightly but in general, you have a global cluster configuration which

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.710
is not available for free,

23
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.390
you actually have to choose the M30 tier to which I'll come back once we dive into the tiers which is

24
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.350
a bit more expensive but there, what you can efficiently do is you can choose different parts on the

25
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.740
world where you want to deploy different clusters or shards you could say that then talk to each

26
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.870
other, which is not a trivial set up but you can do it with a couple of clicks.

27
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.550
The idea of course is you can also choose from a couple of templates here that your data is distributed

28
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.940
across the world so that your users have the shortest way to the data possible, so that if a user in Europe

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.000
requests something from your app, you can reach out and will automatically reach out to the closest

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.620
mongodb server in Europe

31
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.550
and if the user sits in the US, well then US mongodb distribution is used

32
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.800
and this happens automatically then.

33
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.650
So this is something you can enable but not something I will enable here. As a next step, you have to

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.030
choose the underlying cloud provider,

35
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.110
now you don't have to sign up with these cloud providers but mongodb,

36
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.920
the company does not host its own data centers, instead the mongodb solution you configure here

37
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.110
will be deployed in data centers of one of these free providers here.

38
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.460
Now I'll stick to AWS and there you can then choose the region where you want to deploy, in case you're

39
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.310
not using that global cluster configuration.

40
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.940
Now make sure to choose a region where free tier available is added, so that you can get started for

41
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.740
free

42
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.830
but of course if you are willing to pay, you can choose from all these regions and from the different

43
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.680
providers too. The next important thing is the cluster tier,

44
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.300
this defines the power you have and what you can do. Now for the free tier you have to choose

45
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.660
the M0 instance and you can follow along with that,

46
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.740
I will choose a slightly different instance because I want to configure something else which is not

47
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.050
available for free but which you also don't need to do as part of this course.

48
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.340
So you can absolutely continue for free,

49
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.090
I will choose the M10 instance here because that allows me to show you something else.

50
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.560
So I'll take the paid one and I added a credit card,

51
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.620
you should of course use the free one.

52
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.280
Now you can see how these different instances differ or how the tiers differ I should say, you get more

53
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.890
power basically the more you pay

54
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.230
and you got solutions for basically any kind of application you could build and this will only be

55
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.190
one server,

56
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.850
now I'll come back to how you can add sharding in a second.

57
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.750
You can also customize the available storage,

58
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.030
so how much data can be stored overall in gigabytes and

59
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.950
well you can use that slider to change it,

60
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.180
you can also check that to automatically expand the storage before you exceed it

61
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.660
and now under additional settings, you can choose the version you want to use

62
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.120
and if you're using the free tier, you can't choose that.

63
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.710
I want to show you something in the next module which requires version four and therefore I chose

64
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.290
the paid version, you don't have to do this on your own in the next section though you can follow along

65
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.680
by watching my videos, so you can go with the older version for now and not follow along,

66
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.740
I will need 4.0 or higher,

67
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.950
so I chose the paid solution and now I can switch to that version of mongodb. Wired

68
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.600
Tiger is the storage engine and you see only that is available

69
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.930
and it's also a pretty good storage engine.

70
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.720
You can also configure backups and there you got the choice between two types of backup,

71
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.990
continuous means that all your data is basically backed up all the time,

72
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.940
whenever you write something and so on, you've got a continuous backup history,

73
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.020
so it's not once every 24 hours,

74
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.230
basically you can always back up to almost the latest state you were in.

75
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.060
The alternative is a snapshot approach where you do have a 24 hour period, so you have the danger of

76
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.150
losing data for the last 24 hours or for the last 23 hours

77
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.220
if the last backup is that long ago.

78
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.650
So I'll go with continuous

79
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.040
but of course you can choose either of the two, that is also only available when you pay I guess, yeah you

80
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.080
can't set up a backup otherwise,

81
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.580
so I will go with paid

82
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.140
but of course if you deploy a production solution, you will probably also pay so that that should be fine.

83
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.450
And then you can set up sharding,

84
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.520
ok for sharding I need an even bigger instance, so I'll quickly switch to that, M30 so I can show it

85
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.560
to you for now.

86
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.620
You can set up sharding and then you can choose how many shards do you want

87
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.170
and that is how you then add even more power besides the tier you chose here.

88
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.360
Now I don't need sharding here so I'll go back to M10 for now.

89
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.020
You can also add a couple of other options like encryption at rest which is pretty self-explanatory here,

90
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.580
you should check the official docs in case you want to enable though so that you get everything right.

91
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.080
The additional options is something you can pretty much ignore,

92
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.650
you could say that you want to only allow queries that run against data,

93
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.360
you should know what you're doing here because again, creating too many indexes is not a good idea.

94
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.500
You can enforce an index key limit so that your index keys can't get too long and the default is that this

95
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.160
is turned on

96
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.200
and last but not least, you assign a cluster name and then with all these things configured, you can click

97
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.430
create cluster

98
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.210
and now mongodb will deploy this solution into the web, so onto a couple of servers and this will

99
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.340
take a couple of minutes but thereafter, you'll have a fully functional mongodb environment

100
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.270
running in the cloud, automatically secured, automatically configured according to best practices,

101
00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.220
it automatically also will be a replica set here as you see,

102
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.140
you automatically get a free nodes replica set here,

103
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.940
so this is already included,

104
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.940
you could add sharding and all these things and you can also reconfigure it after it's running,

105
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.150
check the official atlas docs for all the details.

106
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.000
Now whilst this is being created which can take a couple of minutes as I mentioned,

107
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:24.280
you can also dive into the security tab and there, you can now secure access to your mongodb database.

108
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.030
Now as you see, I already got a couple of users

109
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.260
and you definitely should add a user here, you can add as many users as you want.

110
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:41.270
Give them a username and assign a password and I'll just auto-generate one and copy that, I'll need

111
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.940
it later,

112
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.610
you can always regenerate it if you will forget it though,

113
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.650
so I'll just save it.

114
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.820
You can then set up the privileges for this user, get generally is the user admin, should he just be

115
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.890
able to read and write to any database and check out the security module if you want to learn more

116
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:58.690
about that,

117
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.860
you can also configure more and assign detailed roles to the user if you need to

118
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:10.950
but I will turn Max into an atlas admin here and click add user.

119
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.790
Now I got my user added, another important thing is the IP whitelist,

120
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.520
now here I got a bunch of IPs in there which I required in the past.

121
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.670
Now one thing you should do here is you should add an IP address and in the end, what you will add

122
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:33.240
here will be the IP address of the server that is running your application or during development, your

123
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.360
current IP address which you can automatically fetch here.

124
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.910
You can also allow access from anywhere but this is generally discouraged because of course it opens

125
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.700
up your database to everyone,

126
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.900
people will still need to log in so you still got the mongodb user as a security mechanism

127
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:55.560
but it's still more secure to lock it down to your IP address or the IP address of your application,

128
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:02.400
so now I add my local IP address. You can also turn on some enterprise security features like a different

129
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.760
kind of authentication, that is all beyond the scope of this course though,

130
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:12.540
so let's go back to the overview and wait for this to finish and let me just quickly talk about other

131
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.530
things you can do in Atlas in the next lecture.
