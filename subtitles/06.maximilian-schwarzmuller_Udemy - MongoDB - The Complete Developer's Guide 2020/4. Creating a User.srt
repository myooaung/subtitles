1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:09,480
Now after all the theory, let's finally start working with some users to get a feeling for how that works,

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,540
how we can create and edit users and most importantly, how we can then work as a user because right

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,040
now, we always worked with

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,200
we have all rights mode turned on,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,350
now we will shrink that down to be in a more realistic environment.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:31,710
Users are created by a user with sufficient permissions with the create user command.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,770
You then create a user with a username and a password

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,870
and as I mentioned, this user will have a couple of roles or one role,

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,550
so at least one role and then each role will typically contain a bunch of privileges.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,580
Now a user is created on a database, so a user is attached to a database.

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,640
Now this does not actually limit the access of the user to that database even though you might think

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,370
it does but this is the database against which the user will have to authenticate, the exact rights

13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,060
the user then has depend on the roles you assigned to that user

14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,960
and even if a user authenticates against the shop database, the user might still have the role to work

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,300
with all databases that exist in your mongodb environment

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,140
and whilst this sounds strange right now, it is something which will become clearer over the next lectures

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,870
and there, you will understand why we can assign users to different databases

18
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,760
if that doesn't lock down their access.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,610
Now of course we cannot just create users, if we ever need to we can also update users.

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,820
Now keep in mind update user here basically means that the administrator updates the user,

21
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,750
so of course you can use that to for example change the password but you should then tell your user

22
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,630
too.

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,530
So this is how we create and edit users,

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,730
now let's see that in practice. To see that in practice, let's bring up our mongo server again with the

25
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,470
same command we used in the past

26
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:07,590
but now I will add --auth here and --auth simply means that now you need to authenticate

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,960
in order to work with that database.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,440
Previously we did not have that setting and that meant that everyone who connects is allowed to do everything,

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,970
well now this ends,

30
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,940
now if we start a server with that, we have a server that will require users to authenticate.

31
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,160
Now with that server up and running, I switch to a new terminal window and now if I type mongo, you might

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,250
have expected that this fails but actually we're still able to connect here because there are two different

33
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,540
ways of signing in. You can now either sign in with db auth, this is a command which takes a username

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,900
and a password but of course I haven't created any users yet so this won't work

35
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,710
or you can indeed also sign in during the connection process,

36
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,850
so now I quit my mongo process,

37
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,580
you can add the -u key here or flag and then enter your username and -p for the password and

38
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,400
then try connecting like this.

39
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,920
Now I will show a couple of times throughout the lecture,

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,230
for now let's connect to mongo like this

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
and there is one problem

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
we'll of course face,

43
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,780
do you know which one it is?

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,500
The problem we initially face of course is that now we connect it to a database that requires authentication

45
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,830
and we got no user yet

46
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,440
and indeed, if I type show dbs right now, I see nothing,

47
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,050
the same for show collections, I get an error which basically is a cryptic way of telling me you are

48
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,700
not allowed to do that.

49
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,800
Now we got no user

50
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,430
and mongodb has a special solution for that called the localhost exception. When connecting

51
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,730
to your database

52
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:55,400
in this state where you haven't added any users, you are allowed to add one user and that one user should

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,220
of course be a user who is then allowed to create more users and to do this, you first of all should

54
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,610
switch to the admin database and then run db create user.

55
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,520
Now a user is created by passing a document into this function,

56
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,690
the first argument should be user, the value here will be the username and I will use Max,

57
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,500
you can type any name you want.

58
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,680
Then separated by a comma because it's a new key in that document, you add the pwd,

59
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,870
so the password

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,830
and that also is a string up to you.

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,470
Now you also need to add the roles and for that, you add a roles key which holds an array of roles.

62
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,760
Now you can add multiple roles in different ways,

63
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,740
for now there is one role you should add

64
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,260
and I'll talk more about the available roles in a second

65
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,570
and the role you should add is the user admin

66
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:55,140
any database role. This is a special built-in role which will grant this user the right to administrate

67
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,290
any database

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
in this mongodb environment.

69
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,380
Now if you hit enter, you should have successfully created that user, now if you type show dbs,

70
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,020
you will suddenly see a different kind of error.

71
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,810
Now what you will need to do is you now need to authenticate and you can do this with the auth command,

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,730
so type Max, Max here if that were your credentials or whatever you did use and hit enter.

73
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,700
Make sure you are in the admin database,

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,380
so use admin first in case you switch to a different database in-between.

75
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,430
So then you should be authenticated

76
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,560
and now after being authenticated, you should be able to run show dbs and show collections

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,350
but I got none

78
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,680
but I also get no error anymore.

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,590
So now we created one user and we created that user with this special role.

80
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,750
Now before we create more users, let's talk about this special role and which built-in roles exist

81
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,430
in general.
