00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:09,660
Now that we have mongodb solution up and running in the web with replica sets, we can dive into a certain

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,530
topic that was added with mongodb 4.0, transactions. And you need a replica set an environment

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,740
for transactions to work

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,220
and therefore I couldn't show this earlier in the course but now with the mongodb Atlas deployment

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,320
up and running,

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,230
you can dive into transactions. Now important, for this module

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,820
you need mongodb 4.0

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,350
and currently if you deploy mongodb Atlas and you are in the free tier, you can only use 3.6 there.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,600
So if you use that free tier, chances are high you are doing that,

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,840
you don't need to upgrade,

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,060
you can just follow along with the videos and then try this out on your own once you eventually make

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,420
the step into building a real app and you therefore are willing to pay something for that

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,130
or until the free tier also supports 4.0

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,000
of course.

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,300
So in this module, we'll dive into transactions and that of course poses one important question,

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,140
what are transactions and then how will we use them? Both will be covered here.
