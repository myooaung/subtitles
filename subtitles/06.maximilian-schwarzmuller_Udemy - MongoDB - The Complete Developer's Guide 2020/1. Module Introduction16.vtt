00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.540
Now that we covered the core basics or fundamentals of mongodb and what the data you store in looks like and how

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.230
we work with that data,

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.010
it's time to dive a bit deeper into these crud operations.

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.260
I already gave you an overview and you saw how you can generally insert, read, update and delete documents

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.790
but now it's time for some additional information starting with the c in crud, the create part.

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.840
So what's inside this module? Now

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.720
I'll not bore you by just showing you the two insert methods again,

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.710
I will show them to you but I'll also explain a bit more what they do and how you can configure them.

9
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.730
So we'll have a look at these document creation methods and since this is also kind of related to creating

10
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.110
documents, we'll also have a look at how you can import an existing set of data into a database because

11
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.360
that also is a common operation, that you don't just have an application that might be inserting new

12
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.320
documents but that you already have a set of data, maybe exported from a different database,

13
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.220
doesn't matter where it comes from and you want to get that into MongoDB,

14
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.360
so I'll show that in this module too.
