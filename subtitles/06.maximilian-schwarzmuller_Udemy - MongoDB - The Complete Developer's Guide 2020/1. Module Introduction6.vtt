00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.840
We already covered a lot of important things that you will need to work efficiently with mongodb.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
Now this mongodb course is built for developers,

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.920
therefore the things we're going to cover in this section are only partly important to you but well

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.210
they are at least partly important to you and security always matters.

5
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.950
So in this module, we'll take a look at something which is mainly the job of your database administrator

6
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.250
and not of you, the developer

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.930
but since you will play one important role in the overall picture of security and user authentication,

8
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.920
I find it important to guide you through the most important parts that are related to securing a mongodb

9
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.990
database.

10
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.200
There is kind of a security checklist which you also find in the official docs when it comes to hardening

11
00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.830
your mongodb environment and making sure that it's safe and can't be intruded from outside.

12
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.170
One of the most important things is authentication and authorization

13
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.160
and this is already one of the things where you as a developer come into play, where you will have to worry

14
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.600
about

15
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.880
and I will show you how you do authorize and so on throughout this module and also later in the from shell to

16
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.490
driver module.

17
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.520
So authentication and authorization will be one important part and this part here or this topic mainly means

18
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.320
that the database,

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.870
so I'm not talking about the application you're building but the database you're using to store data

20
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.120
will know users and you will have to authenticate,

21
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.050
so you means you as a developer,

22
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.610
so your code will have to authenticate with that database in order to insert data, get data or do all

23
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.750
kinds of stuff.

24
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.650
So authentication and authorization is one super important building block when it comes to securing your

25
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.540
mongodb environment. Another important building block is transport encryption,

26
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.000
this means that data that is sent from your app to the server should be encrypted so that no one can

27
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.710
sit in the middle and spoof your connection and read that data.

28
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.990
Additionally encryption at rest is an important topic and that means that the data in the database

29
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.910
also should be encrypted otherwise if someone somehow gets access to your database servers, well they

30
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.970
can read plain text information and that will make getting the data out of there

31
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.650
easier. If you do encrypt your data in the database, you are still protected a bit even if people get access

32
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.290
to your database server because then they might have access but the data is unreadable.

33
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.650
These are three very important building blocks,

34
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.880
additional important building blocks are auditing. We'll not dive into this in this module or in this

35
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.470
course because this is a pure server admin task but of course mongodb does provide features to audit

36
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.220
your service,

37
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.880
so to see who did what, which actions occurred and you can do a lot of stuff there to make sure that

38
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.220
you always control what's happening and you always are aware of what's happening in your database.

39
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.500
Additionally the server on which you run your database server and now I'm talking about the physical

40
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.590
machine which is running somewhere or if you're using a cloud provider like AWS, I'm talking about the

41
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.060
instances you booked there, the network you are using to host your mongodb environment

42
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.900
of course also should be secured

43
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.250
and now that is also far beyond the scope of this course and far beyond what you as a developer have to

44
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.680
do

45
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.710
but if you are administrating and setting up the entire mongodb environment,

46
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.370
this is also something you will have to take care about.

47
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.580
And last but not least, backups and software updates also matter.

48
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.650
You and now again I don't mean you as a developer but you as the owner of a mongodb environment, you should

49
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.610
regularly backup your data

50
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.600
and of course you should make sure that all the software you're running is up to date to fix any security

51
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.460
holes that might be in there.

52
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.740
So these are important things, in this module we'll have a look at these three blocks because these three

53
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.460
blocks kind of affect your work as a developer and you will see how they affect your work in this module

54
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.490
and later

55
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.430
as I mentioned in the from shell to driver module. So let's dive in and let's start with authentication

56
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.260
and authorization and learn what exactly that is and how you use it.
