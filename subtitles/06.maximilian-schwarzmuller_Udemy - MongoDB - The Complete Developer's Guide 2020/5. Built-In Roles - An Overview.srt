1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,720
In the last lecture, we created our first user with this special localhost exception and we assigned

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,130
a role to the user.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,630
Now we did never create that role,

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,470
instead mongodb ships with a bunch of built-in roles that basically cover all the typical use cases

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,240
you have.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,020
You can also create your own roles but that is beyond the scope of this course because this will be

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,480
a pure admin task,

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,170
you'll find a link in the last lecture of this module though which links you to the official docs where

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,970
you can learn how to create such roles,

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,140
it's actually pretty simple.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,650
So let's talk about the built-in roles though.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,150
We got a bunch of built-in roles in mongodb,

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,200
for example we got typical roles for users of a database,

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,410
so the people who work with the data in there

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,010
and there we got two roles, a read and a readWrite role and these roles are pretty self-explanatory.

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,480
You either got a role for users who only need to find data, so who can run all these queries, use the

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,060
aggregation framework but will not be able to insert or update or delete data, well or you got full

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,500
access.

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,170
You also get typical database admin roles, like the user admin or the db admin.

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,100
Now the db admin is for example a role for people who have that role are able to manage the database

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:24,790
obviously, to create collections, user admin is more geared towards creating and managing users as the

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,960
name suggests.

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:33,760
Now these roles will grant the user access to you for example readWrite data but only inside the database

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,800
to which you assigned that role and I will show you how you can assign roles to databases in the next

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,520
lecture.

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,560
We also have special roles of which we used one in the last lecture,

27
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:50,470
all database roles, you can assign all these roles on the left to users for multiple databases, so you

28
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,230
could give one user the read role for two different databases but of course sometimes you will have

29
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,810
a case where you want to give a user rights to do something

30
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:06,820
in all databases and also in all future databases and you don't want to manually add like the read role

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,180
to a user for every database manually and therefore, you have these all database roles. So we also have

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,760
read, readWrite, user admin and db admin, so all the roles we already saw on the left two boxes here

33
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:25,930
but now in a special set up that will always give the user access to all databases. And that is why we

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,630
use the user admin any database role in the last lecture because we want to have a user who is allowed

35
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,620
to create users for any database and in any database no matter if the database already exists or is created

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,310
in the future and so on.

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,400
Now besides these roles we also have cluster administration roles,

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,510
now we haven't talked about clusters at this point.

39
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:56,330
Clusters are essentially constructs where you have multiple mongodb servers working together,

40
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:03,020
this is used for scaling so that you can actually well have multiple machines running mongodb servers

41
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:09,020
and store your data which then work together and managing these clusters of servers is of course a meaningful

42
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,600
task, it is performed by people who know what they're doing and they have their own rights and you can

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,360
assign their own rights to let them do their job.

44
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,970
You also have special backup and restore roles in case you have some users who are only responsible

45
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,690
for that,

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,420
so these really are roles that just allow you to do that, backup the database or restore it

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,500
and then there are super user roles.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,370
Now these are also roles we saw before except for root,

49
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,970
now the idea here is if you assign the db owner or a user admin role to the admin database and I will

50
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,950
show you how to assign roles to a database,

51
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,200
so to a user and then to a specific database, if you assign them to the admin database, this will kind

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,680
of be a special case because the admin database is a special database and these users are then able

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,100
to create new users and also change their own role

54
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,800
and that's why it's a super user.

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,920
All these roles here basically allow a user to create new users and change users, so these users can create

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,970
whatever they need

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,070
and therefore these are very powerful roles.

58
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,540
The root role is basically the most powerful role,

59
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,830
if you assign this to a user, this user can do everything,

60
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,410
so basically that will then be a user who has the same rights we had previously in this course before

61
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,070
we started locking down the database with --auth.

62
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,240
So these are the built-in roles,

63
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,880
now you can learn way more about them in the official docs of course.

64
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,970
The quickest way to get there is to just google for mongodb built-in roles

65
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:48,600
and then there is a whole article in the official docs which talks about the official roles, also grouped

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,700
in different categories as I did it on the slide and there, you do not only see a description of the

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:01,900
role, you also see which actions this role unlocks because remember, a role is just a group of privileges,

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,950
so these are essentially the privileges.

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,970
So here you see the read role gives you access to the find command but also to the command to list

70
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,490
collections which you do in the shell with show collections.

71
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,390
So you can read through all the roles here and see what people who have that role are actually allowed

72
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:19,930
to do

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,940
which is of course a very powerful feature.

74
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,410
Now with that, we know which roles exist

75
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:32,110
but one thing I could imagine that is still unclear is how exactly you assign a role to a user and you

76
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,410
control to which database this role then applies.

77
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,600
So let's have a look at this in the next lectures.
