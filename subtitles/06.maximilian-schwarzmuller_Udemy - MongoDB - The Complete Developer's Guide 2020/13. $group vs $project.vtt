Now we worked a lot with group and project and it's really important for you to understand the difference.

2
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.640
Group is for grouping multiple documents into one document, whereas project is a one to one relation,

3
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.220
you get one document and then you will return one document, that one document we'll just have changed.

4
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.740
So for group, you have multiple documents and you return one grouped by one or more categories

5
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.800
of your choice

6
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.080
and then also with any new fields with some summary, well statistics or summary calculations, in projection,

7
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.620
you have a one to one relation.

8
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.160
So in grouping, you do things like summing, counting, averaging and so on, in projection phases, you transform

9
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.530
a single document, you add new fields and so on.

10
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.830
This is the difference and this is really important to understand and to get right.
