00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.400
So my Atlas cluster is starting, now

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:13.300
Atlas is a powerful tool for getting your mongodb environment up and running. Important for you is if you've

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.310
got backups turned on, you can restore them here once they are available of course,

4
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.310
you can also configure alerts,

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.700
alerts allow you to see what happened,

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.810
it also allows you to create new alerts here with add new alert where you can get an e-mail when

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.020
something happens, like for example when a user logs in or when the average execution time

8
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.230
for reads is above a certain millisecond value,

9
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.480
so somehow your reads are taking too long and you want to check in if something is going on. So you

10
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.030
can set a bunch of alerts here for all kinds of things to always keep track of what's happening in

11
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.820
your cluster which is of course super useful.

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.760
And in general, I encourage you to of course check out the atlas docs to learn everything about Atlas

13
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.530
when you plan using it in production. It is my strong recommendation to use Atlas as a managed solution

14
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.200
for getting your mongodb environment up and running unless you are a system admin and you absolutely

15
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.690
know what you're doing when you want to configure everything on your own which you also can do but which

16
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.860
is not covered in this course as this course of course is for developers.

17
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.270
Now let me wait for this to finish and then we'll see how we can connect to our cluster.
