1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,090
Now speaking of operators in the last lecture, we got a couple of different operators we can differentiate.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:16,150
We got query and projection operators, query selectors, basically the different operators like

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,220
$gt which you saw in the last lecture which allow us to narrow down the set of documents we retrieve

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:31,510
and projection operators that allow us to transform or kind of change the data we get back to some extent,

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,740
these are read related operators.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,890
Now we'll also learn about update related operators later, where we can also basically update fields and

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,070
arrays and there are different techniques for operating these things,

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,020
so normal fields or arrays in a document, we'll learn about this in the update module of course

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,040
and we also got query modifiers.

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,440
Now this allows us to change the query behavior

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,940
and this is deprecated now,

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,430
so this will not be covered anymore because what you could do with these can now be done with the normal

13
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,660
operators basically.

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:12,340
We also can do some aggregation which is also reading data from the database but allows you to do more

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,900
complex transforms

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,170
basically. This is a very interesting concept where you basically set up a pipeline of stages to funnel

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,120
your data through and you got a bunch of operators that allow you to shape the data you get back

18
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,220
to the form you needed in your app

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,420
and therefore we got a whole module for this where this will be covered,

20
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,810
the aggregation module.

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,640
So in this module, we'll focus on the read operators, in the update module,

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,010
we'll have a look at the update operators. Now for inserts and deletes,

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,950
there are no operators, for deletes

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,080
there are but these will be the same as the read operators because there you just need to find data

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,800
you want to delete

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,990
and that works in the same way you find data to output but for updating, we got some separate operators

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,620
and they will be covered in the update module.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,820
Now how do operators impact our data? That depends on the type, if we get a query operator like we'll

29
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,150
use in this module, we can use it to locate data,

30
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,370
it does not change our data and an example would be

31
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,740
$eq for equal or $gt which you saw before. Projection operators which we'll also see in this module

32
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,550
allow you to modify the data presentation,

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,830
so the data you get back, this will also not change the data in the database though, only change the look

34
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,130
of it which you get. Here, dollar sign is an example,

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,040
this will become clearer once we use projection operators,

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,040
so in the end we just got some tools to control the look of the data we get back.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,840
Update operators which we'll cover in the update module allow you to modify and add additional data and

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,070
this therefore does of course change the data. Inc,

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,660
$inc

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,900
is an example which will increment a field by one or any amount you specify

41
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,570
and this is also something we'll also see in the update module of course.
