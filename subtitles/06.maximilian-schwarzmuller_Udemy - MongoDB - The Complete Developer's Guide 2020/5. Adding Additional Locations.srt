00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,090
Now in the last lecture, we answered the question which points are near to our point.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,660
Now another common question you want to answer is, hey I get this area, could be a sphere, could be any

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,460
polygon,

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,930
so I got this area, which points are inside of that area? That is another typical question

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,960
and in order to answer this, let's add a bit more points to our database before we dive into that.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:34,060
So in our Golden Gate Park, we added the California Academy of Sciences, why don't we also add the Conservatory

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,060
of Flowers

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,460
and again, you'll find the coordinates

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,160
in the URL up here.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:46,890
So let me grab that longitude and then move over to our database and there, in my places collection,

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,310
I will insert one document and that'll have the same structure as the other document,

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll add a name here

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:02,780
and that is the Conservatory of Flowers and I'll add my location which is a geo json object,

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:13,230
where the type again is a point of course and where the coordinates are let's say my longitude obviously

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,180
and then I also need the latitude,

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,920
so let's grab the latitude from Google Maps and add this as a second value in the array.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,430
So now we added the Conservatory of Flowers,

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,660
now let's add two more and definitely feel free to pick your own ones of course.

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:38,840
Now I will also pick the Golden Gate Park Tennis Courts and again, it's the same game as before, pick

20
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,440
the longitude and by the way important,

21
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,810
what you see in the URL here of course is reflecting the center of your current screen, so if you're

22
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,060
not centering perfectly on an item as I did before with the Conservatory of Flowers, you'll actually pick

23
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,050
the center. For the purpose of this exercise here, this will be fine though,

24
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,470
so it only matters that you have some points from inside this area,

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,750
no matter if it's exactly that point or a little bit off.

26
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,730
So for the Golden Gate Park Tennis Court, I did focus on it so this should be in the center and I will add

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,960
this place therefore, simply edit my previous query,

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:25,350
Golden Gate Tennis Park and I will override my longitude and of course also add my latitude here

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,100
then. So let's replace that too, like this

30
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,240
and now let's add a fourth place and that is why it won't matter because that fourth place will be from

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,700
outside here.

32
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,460
So let's say we take Nopa, whatever that is,

33
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:48,020
so let's try to center on that and let's grab the longitude of course,

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,500
again let's insert that,

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,830
Nopa, let's replace the old longitude of the last query with the new longitude

36
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:06,730
and of course grab the latitude too, so grab that from the URL and we're good to go.

37
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,630
So now we've got four places in there,

38
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,650
I can quickly find them all to show them to you, pretty.

39
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,430
Now again the coordinates might be a bit off because I did not always center onto them but we got four

40
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,160
different places with four different coordinates,

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,660
that is what matters here and three of them,

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,190
the first three are in the Golden Gate Park and one of them is outside.

43
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,770
Now in the next lecture,

44
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,150
let's run this query to find all places that are inside of a certain area.
