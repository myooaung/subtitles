00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.740
Now let's dive into stitch and you do dive into it from inside your mongodb Atlas console. There

2
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.200
I got a running cluster as you can tell

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.990
and now we can also add some stitch apps by clicking on stitch apps here on the left.

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.860
Now there simply click on create new application and give your application a name, like my shop, the name

5
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.920
is up to you.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.460
You can link it to a cluster,

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:36.850
so here I'm using the only cluster I have and click create, whoops that should be one word without whitespace.

8
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.360
So now as it says here, this will take one, two, three minutes to complete,

9
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.660
so let's wait for this

10
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:50.680
and in the meantime make sure you download the attached slightly modified version of our application

11
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.930
we built in the last module. Simply download it, then in the downloaded folder, extract it, move it somewhere

12
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.340
where you want to store it and then navigate into that folder in your terminal there. And then

13
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.730
first of all run npm install again to install all dependencies,

14
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.740
this is required because the attached downloads does not include them to

15
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.450
well basically make it smaller. So make sure you install all these dependencies and thereafter, rerun

16
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.470
npm start.

17
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.460
You don't need to run the npm run start server which we used in the last module because we'll not

18
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.760
use our own server anymore,

19
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.360
oh and this is already done,

20
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.650
so here we are redirected,

21
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.450
that's great.

22
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.340
Now before we dive into stitch, let's finish the preparations for the project and when that app loads,

23
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.540
you should end up on the auth screen because I changed one thing,

24
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.930
we're not authenticated by default anymore,

25
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
we had a dummy solution in place there anyways but now I switch that and I also added something else which

26
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.120
becomes important later.

27
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.150
So this is the running application, with that we're now prepared,

28
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.930
so in the next lecture, let's dive into all of that and learn how we can work with stitch and what we can

29
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.340
see here.
