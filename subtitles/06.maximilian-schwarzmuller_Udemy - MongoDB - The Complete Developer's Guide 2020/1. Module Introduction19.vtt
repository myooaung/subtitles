00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.060
We covered the first three of the crud methods, creating, reading and updating documents.

2
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
Sometimes you also need to get rid of some documents and that is what we'll have a look at

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.930
in this module. Now this will be a short module because there's not much to configure about deleting

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.190
documents. So we'll simply have a look at the document deletion methods

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.390
and that is basically it.

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.130
I will also show you how you can delete entire collections or databases.
