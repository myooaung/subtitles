00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,300
This will be a fun module because in mongodb,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,510
you cannot just query text, booleans, number, states,

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,860
you can also query locations

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:19,820
and with this, I really am talking about queries like find me all restaurants in this radius or find

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,580
me the nearest location to my current location.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,900
So there are a lot of fun queries you can do with this so-called geospatial data.

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,420
In this module, we'll have a look at how we can store geospatial data in the special geo json format

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,900
and you will also learn how you can then efficiently query this geospatial data with the help of

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,300
indexes and a couple of special operators that are suited to work well with geospatial data.

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,870
So let's dive into this and let's start working with some locations and places.
