1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,970
So now that I introduced mongodb, what it is and how it roughly works,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,880
let me take a step back and go back to the mongodb company. As I mentioned, the company behind the

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,910
mongodb database solution is also called mongodb

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,440
and actually, they have a couple of other products too

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,720
and I will have a look at them throughout this course.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
So how does the mongodb ecosystem look like?

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,510
Obviously we got the mongodb database which is the core asset, the core feature and the core topic

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,910
of this course and probably the reason why you took this course.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,570
There you have a self-managed and an enterprise solution, we'll work with the community, with the free

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,230
community version in this course which has all the features we need

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:51,550
but of course I will also dive into deploying that and showing you a way of getting your local database

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,220
with which we'll play around in this course into the web and how to use it on the real app,

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,170
no worries. Then they have some tools that are related to managing that database, that is more of a system

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,300
admin database admin task, I'll not cover it in this course because this is a course for you as a developer

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,690
and they have a cloud solution, that is something I will cover because this is an amazing solution for you

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,400
as a developer, because all the managing a system administrator would have to do is done for you there

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,810
and you can focus on the data and your logic there,

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,770
so this is awesome and we will use that in this course too but we'll also work locally,

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,690
no worries.

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,800
They also have a mobile solution which basically means you can install mongodb on a mobile device

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,670
to store data there directly and even work without an internet connection.

22
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,970
They got a graphical user interface,compass which allows you to connect to your database and look into

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,960
it with a nice user interface,

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:50,320
we will also use that in the course but most of the time, we will not because as a developer, you of course

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,110
write code, you don't click around in graphical user interfaces and therefore, we will well write code

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,550
in this course. And we get also some other tools like BI connectors or Mongodb charts

27
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,300
if you're more on the data science area,

28
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,000
this is not really something where you will write a lot of code,

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,780
these are more tools that allow you to connect different analytics tools if you need that.

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,200
Now this is the entire database world and this is of course their core feature

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,290
hence they have a lot of products there as you can see. Now

32
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,540
they also got a relatively new offering which is called stitch and stitch is

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,090
basically their serverless backend solution,

34
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,080
so this is a bit decoupled of the database, still strongly connected but also it offers you more than

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,250
just data storage. Stitch for example gives you a serverless query API and you will see this towards the end of

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,210
the course where I have a whole module about stitch and where I introduced the core products I have

37
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,420
having the stitch environment.

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,010
So there you will see that this is essentially a toolset, a tool which you can use to efficiently query

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,420
your database directly from inside your client side apps,

40
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,260
so from inside your react app or anything like that but this will become clear in the stitch module

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,580
of course. You also have serverless functions which allows you to execute code in the cloud on demand

42
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,410
so now this is totally unrelated to the database, you can execute any javascript code in the cloud there

43
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,670
and if you know something like AWS Lambda or Google cloud functions, this is your equivalent.

44
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,700
We also have database triggers which is basically a service that allows you to listen to events in

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:35,140
a database, like document was inserted and then execute a function in response to that and that function

46
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,240
could then maybe send an e-mail to a user informing him about that document being inserted, something

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,000
like that

48
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:49,000
and there is a feature called real time sync which basically is built to synchronize a database in a cloud

49
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,420
with that mobile offline supporting database

50
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,850
you might have on mobile devices. This is the current snapshot of their ecosystem,

51
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,570
the focus of this course is on the mongodb database which we'll use locally and in the cloud with Atlas

52
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,060
and how you can work with that, how you can use crud operations, how you can retrieve your data efficiently

53
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,220
and all of that

54
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,360
but I will also dive in the compass.

55
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,630
I will also dive into the stitch world and introduce you to that in this course.
