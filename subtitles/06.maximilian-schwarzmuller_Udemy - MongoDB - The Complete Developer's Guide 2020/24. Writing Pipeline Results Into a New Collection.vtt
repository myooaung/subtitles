00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.560
I'm back to our pipeline we built earlier, you'll find it attached to this video.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.620
This pipeline here will return us persons in a restructured form where we also have the location.

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.580
Now if you want to use that location, we can do that inside of our pipeline here,

4
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.640
we do actually have a pipeline stage

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.480
for working with geo data but that has to always come first in order to take advantage of indexes.

6
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.110
Now what can we do?

7
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.620
Well the good thing is you can also take the result of a pipeline and write it into a new collection,

8
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.320
of course not just if you have geo data in there, you can always do that. For that you do specify another

9
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.570
pipeline stage, the $out stage for output and this will take the result of your operation

10
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.840
and write it into a collection, either a new one which is created on the fly or an existing one. I'll name

11
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.470
this transformed persons,

12
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:13.470
so I only added this stage. If I now copy that and I run it without pretty at the end by the way

13
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.560
but it should have still worked,

14
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:26.470
you see I have my transformed persons there. And if I look into transformed persons, you see the structure

15
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.130
in there is exactly the structure we created in the last pipeline.

16
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.610
So the out operator is great if you have a pipeline where you want to funnel your results right into

17
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.730
a new collection,

18
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.950
often you want to use it and just fetch it

19
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.620
but if you need to store it, you can do that with the out stage.
