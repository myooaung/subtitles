We're almost done with this module.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,740
Now let me show you two other important pieces of data you can put into your documents.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,170
You can use embedded documents and this is actually a core feature of mongodb and a core feature

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,430
I'll come back to in my data schema and relations module in this course.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,820
Let's imagine this box is one document, embedded documents then simply means that you can have a field

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,140
in your document like name

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,560
but then this could be another document, so the value of the field could be another document and

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,840
you can have multiple such documents and these documents can have other sub documents which can have

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:50,010
other sub documents, so you can nest your documents all in one overarching document in one collection.

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,150
So here we can have up to 100 levels of nesting in mongodb,

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,040
this is a hard limit but you can have a lot of nesting

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,960
and to be honest, you rarely need more than three or four levels and you always got another hard limit,

13
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,790
the overall documents size has to be below 60 megabytes.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,900
That might sound small but since you only store text in there, you don't store files in mongodb

15
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,710
for example, you would use your file storage for that, since it's only text, 16 megabytes is actually

16
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,500
quite a lot,

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,800
still these are arrays to keep in mind.

18
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,290
So these are embedded documents, another kind of data you can store are arrays

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,140
and this is not strictly linked to embedded documents, though it can also be documents,

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,780
you can have arrays in this case of embedded documents but arrays can hold any data,

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,080
this simply means that you have lists of data in a document.

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,350
Now this is of course very theoretical here,

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,670
so let me show you an example in the next lecture.
