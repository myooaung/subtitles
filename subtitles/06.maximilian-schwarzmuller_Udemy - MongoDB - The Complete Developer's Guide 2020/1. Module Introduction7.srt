1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,840
You learned a lot about mongodb and how to use it as a developer.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,080
Now it's time to talk a bit about the things that are not directly your job as a developer but still important

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,170
for you to understand and especially important to you if you're working alone on a project. You need

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,860
to understand what impacts performance of your mongodb server or your mongodb solution, how

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:33,570
you can improve the fault tolerance of it and how you can deploy your local mongodb database and

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,200
server which we used thus far in this course into the web,

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,860
so on a cloud machine or on a server in the web and not on your localhost of course because your web

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,010
application, your mobile application or whatever you're building will most likely also run well on some

9
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,740
server or on some smart device, whatever it is and will communicate to your server in the web and not

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,250
to your local machine you are developing on.

11
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,210
So what's inside this module?

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,270
We'll have a look at some factors that influence performance,

13
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:11,430
some important factors and how you can control them or what you have to know about them. We'll have a

14
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,600
look at a special kind of collection, capped collections that can be helpful in certain situations and

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,060
that you should at least be aware of.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,560
We'll then have a look at replica sets and I will explain what this is and we'll have a look at sharding,

17
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,900
I'll also explain what is this, these two things will be related to both performance and fault tolerance

18
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,770
.

19
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:40,620
And last but not least, I will talk about what it takes to deploy a local mongodb database and server

20
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,610
into the web and which solutions I would recommend there to get your mongodb solution up and

21
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,540
running in the web.

22
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,010
So with that, let dive in.
