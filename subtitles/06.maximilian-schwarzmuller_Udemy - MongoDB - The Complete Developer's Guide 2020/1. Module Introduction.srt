1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:08,440
Now that you learned a lot about general queries and how to store data and how to retrieve data, it's

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,780
time to also learn how to retrieve data efficiently.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,280
Now we'll have a look at indexes in this module and indexes are a feature that can drastically speed

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,800
up your queries, though if used incorrectly,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,070
they can also slow down some of your operations.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,220
Now we'll take a look at all of that and the different kinds of queries in this module,

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,580
I just want to highlight that in general, you as a developer will most likely not create that many

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,630
indexes but if you're working as a single person on a web project for example and therefore are the

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,190
single person using some mongodb solution,

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,390
you still will need to know how to create indexes and even if you never create them, it's still worth

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,820
understanding how indexes and queries work together.

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,250
In this module, we'll have a look at what exactly an index is and how it can help us,

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,300
we'll then have a look at the different types of indexes mongodb supports and we'll have a look

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,540
at how you use indexes and how you can optimize your queries for indexes or the other way around, how you

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,470
can optimize your indexes to support your queries.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,550
So with that, let's dive in and let's learn how indexes can help us.
