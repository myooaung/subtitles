When building applications with mongodb, you will most likely also work with some numbers.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:14,010
Maybe you're building an online shop where you store products, that obviously will have prices and where

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,520
you store orders which wIll have order volume or prices or whether you're building a database for

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,830
scientific data with which you or other people might run scientific calculations.

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,880
Numbers are everywhere

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,680
and of course you can store the numbers in mongodb too and so far throughout this course, we heavily worked with

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,920
numbers already.

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,660
Now actually, working with numbers can be more complex than you might think or there is more to it than

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,690
you might think

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:50,520
and therefore in this module, we'll dive into the different number types mongodb supports, how they differ

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,960
and when you might use which.
