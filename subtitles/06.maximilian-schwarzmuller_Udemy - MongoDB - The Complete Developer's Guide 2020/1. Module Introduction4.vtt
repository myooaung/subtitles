Sometimes you need a bit more power for retrieving your data.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.840
Now we're already extensively use the find and findOne methods and these are your default methods for

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.310
retrieving data indeed

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.660
but sometimes you want to do more complex transformations to your data.

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.670
Now of course we talked about the fact that you want to store the data in your database in the format

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.230
you need it in in your application

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.570
but this is not always possible.

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.420
You might have an online shop where the sellers can also generate detailed reports on their sales data,

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.170
now it will probably be hard to store the data in exactly that format because these reports might be

10
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.610
customizable by the sellers or let's say you have a customer facing application on which your data scientists

11
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.580
in your company also work, of course you will gear your data towards your customers and you will

12
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.370
store it in a way that allows your customers to quickly interact with your application and your data scientists

13
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.350
might not be that important for you from a data modeling perspective

14
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.760
therefore, hence you also need more complex data transformation capabilities.

15
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.760
And in this module, we will have a look at the aggregation framework which gives you just that. You'll

16
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.020
learn what exactly the aggregation framework is in mongodb and how you can use it to retrieve data

17
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.020
in exactly the format you need it in your application.
