Now one quick note about sorting in the last lecture. I sorted on the price and if you do that often,

2
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.590
it is of course a good idea to create an index on the price in your products collection.

3
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.210
Now as I mentioned at the beginning of this module, creating such an index is not something you would

4
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.370
do from inside your node code because you won't do that

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.170
upon an incoming request or anything like that,

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.740
this code is really for your application logic, not for managing your database.

7
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.230
So if you want to do something like create that index, you should do it from inside the shell. There

8
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:44.740
you can of course say db products create index and then simply create an index on the price in ascending

9
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.940
or descending order,

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.780
doesn't matter what you use in your node app because the index can be traversed in both directions by the

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.310
mongo client.

12
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.220
So if I do that, now you see the index was added, we get a bit of more detailed output there than we did

13
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.340
before because we're using a slightly different setup here

14
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.740
but in the end we now added an index and now, we don't need to change anything here

15
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.550
in our node code, we also don't need to restart our node server,

16
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.870
we now just have an index added in case we did want to sort and we can of course comment that back

17
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.040
in even if we're not using pagination.

18
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.300
So that's just a side note,

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.300
if you do change some configuration or add an index, you would do that outside of this application.
