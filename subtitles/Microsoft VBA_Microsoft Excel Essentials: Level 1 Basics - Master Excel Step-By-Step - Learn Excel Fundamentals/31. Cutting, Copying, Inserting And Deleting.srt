1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,530
righty ho guys,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,290
in this lecture,

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,870
we're gonna have a look at the difference between cutting and copying.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,590
And we're also gonna have a look a insert and delete.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,500
If you thoroughly oaf A with this already can probably hit complete lecture,

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,890
move onto the next one.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,940
But I know with regards to cutting and copying When I first began using excel,

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,620
it took me a while to grasp the difference between the two.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,560
So just so you don't have to go through that pain will just cover it here.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,990
So you have a thorough room to stand them from the beginning.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,670
Okay,

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm just gonna answer a bunch of data into these cells here,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,230
and I'm going to use our,

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,620
uh,

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,350
auto fill sequence unjust.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,380
Dragged down with the handle.

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:40,950
OK,

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,500
so now we have a column of data one through 10.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,250
Now I'm going to right click anywhere in this highlighted region,

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,250
and then they choose cuts.

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,100
You can see that we have our dancing and some.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,650
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select cell C two.

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,150
I'm gonna right click,

24
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,150
and I'm gonna hover over paste.

25
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,470
Now you can see that.

26
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:01,610
Oh,

27
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,540
menu box.

28
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,550
That was there a few seconds ago has been grayed out on in the background.

29
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,140
Next cell is giving us a clue.

30
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,430
So what it's gonna do so it's gonna paying stare values into columns.

31
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,020
See?

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,130
And you can see that column B where data used to live is now completely blank.

33
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,710
So when you hit the button,

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,430
you can see that our data is being cut from here on moved over to here and paste it in here

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:26,430
.

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,420
So cut essentially cuts the data that you've selected.

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,080
Okay,

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,830
so that's how cut works.

39
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,520
If we right,

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,880
click and choose copy.

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,770
When I'm gonna come back over to this Soldiers here,

42
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,100
right,

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,350
click and choose Paste.

44
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm just gonna do the first option.

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,530
And you can see again that our menu has been great out and in the background exiles going

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,460
to give us a hint as to what it's going to do.

47
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,870
So you can see this time that all about original data remains with the dancing ounce around

48
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,950
it.

49
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,130
Just there on that.

50
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,200
When we hit the button,

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,950
it's going to be copied into this range.

52
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,650
So no,

53
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,850
let me just escape.

54
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,060
So now we have our data twice.

55
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,110
We've copied it from column C on.

56
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,910
We've pasted it into column B.

57
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,640
So the essential difference doing,

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,300
cutting and copying is cutting.

59
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,940
Cuts it from your spreadsheet,

60
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,270
that is,

61
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,750
it removes it entirely.

62
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,430
And copying will just delay to pace the same data somewhere else.

63
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,190
So your original data remains okay?

64
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,740
Cutting and copying covered.

65
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,180
Now,

66
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,250
let's have a quick look at inserting.

67
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,210
Now.

68
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,860
What I'm gonna do at the moment is I'm just going to click one of the cells on going to

69
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,040
right click and choose in certain and just drag that up there so you can see it better.

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Now,

71
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,690
we have four options in here in the bottom to our entire wrote an entire column.

72
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,590
Now,

73
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,620
this is just another way to get to something we've already covered.

74
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,670
You'll recall when we inserted an entire row,

75
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,410
we just left click the road number on we chose insert and all of our arose moved down on

76
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,710
when we chose to insert an entire column.

77
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,560
We just left click the column head in and chose the insert and all their columns moved over

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,560
,

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,660
So we're not gonna cover them again here.

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,980
We're just gonna have a look at 1st 2 options so you can see by default that shift cells

81
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,380
down has been selected because it's got this little black dot in the in the radio button

82
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,600
that notice what happens to values fall through 10 when we click.

83
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,200
OK,

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,120
you can see that everything has moved down one cell.

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,350
So any data that was down here would also have moved down one cell.

86
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,830
They're just so it's apparent it moved down one cell because we only had one cell selected

87
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:34,830
.

88
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:41,160
If we chosen four cells and we chose right click insert on day shift cells down,

89
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,250
you can see that four blank cells were inserted because we had four selected earlier.

90
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,550
So it just it control and said to one day.

91
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,460
So however many cells you have highlighted is how many cells your data will move down.

92
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,320
Okay,

93
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,550
Now,

94
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,200
let's have a quick look at insert,

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,560
right?

96
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,980
So again,

97
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,320
I'm just going to slight one cell for now on the right click and insert on this.

98
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,760
So I'm gonna choose right now notice when I click OK,

99
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,520
that the four that we currently have selected will move over to the right just for

100
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,290
clarity's sake.

101
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:18,240
What's happened is the whole of lime Five from that point has moved over to the right and

102
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,700
side.

103
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,930
So four didn't get deleted and pasted into column day.

104
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,950
Everything here moved over one cell to the right.

105
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,610
Okay?

106
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,030
And we just take control and said to undo And that's how we do insert there to delete.

107
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,970
What we're gonna do is we're going to choose our first column here and we're going to right

108
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:37,970
,

109
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,940
click on and choose Delete Notice that we only have one cell selected.

110
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,770
So if we chose the default option of shift cells up,

111
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,750
notice what happens to 56789 and 10 when I hit,

112
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,450
OK,

113
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,610
you can see that four has gone.

114
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,480
It's been deleted and all of the cells below it have moved up.

115
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,430
One cell.

116
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,740
No,

117
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,330
again because we only had one cell selected.

118
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,650
They've only moved up one position.

119
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,500
So let's just hit control and sent to undo that on notice that if I selected three sells

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,190
right click and chose delete.

121
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:19,120
Onda had shift cells up that the data billow will move up three cells.

122
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,550
So we've deleted three cells on all of our data below that point has moved up by three

123
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,170
cells.

124
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,970
Okay,

125
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,640
so now we're gonna have a look at delete on.

126
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,600
We're gonna have a look at delete left.

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,180
No,

128
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,350
it is here that we have four in the column immediately to the right.

129
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,070
So when I click,

130
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,850
OK,

131
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:43,080
you can see that the four has moved from there to there hasn't deleted from here on being

132
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,990
pasted there,

133
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,910
the entire range over to the right here as being moved over one column to the left.

134
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,870
Okay,

135
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,110
so hopefully that makes it a little bit clearer than we just hit.

136
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,050
Boom do.

137
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,210
And there you go.

138
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,410
That's the difference between cutting and copying on.

139
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,380
That's Have you used the inserts and delete options right onto the next lecture?
