00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
Okay,

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.450
let's learn how to enter data into excel.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.630
We have two ways of doing this Primarily,

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.650
we can neither enter the text directly into the cell or we can enter the text into the

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.510
formula bar.

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.980
We're going to cover both options here on.

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.420
Firstly,

8
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.200
we're gonna select cell a one by left clicking it on.

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.340
We were just begin typing on a keyboard,

10
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.940
the title ever worksheet,

11
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.250
and we're gonna call it my fruit and veg shop again.

12
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.360
So my fruits,

13
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.940
Andi lips veg shop,

14
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.900
they go Now you may have noticed that the same text is also appearing in the formula bar as

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.890
we're typing it.

16
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.800
So if I just show you there and just randomly tope start type in some more techs,

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.810
you can see that it's also appearing in the former about the same time when we're happy

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.200
with what we've typed just here.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.000
Enter on your keyboard and they go,

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.100
The data is in there.

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.260
Okay,

22
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.290
so that's how you enter data into a cell.

23
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.390
Let's delete that on re do the same thing again.

24
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.850
But using the formula bar,

25
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.220
we're again,

26
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.730
we're gonna have cell a one selected by left clicking on it but this time going to come up

27
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.910
to the formula bar,

28
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.180
you can see the tool tip there has told us what that were in the formula bar left click

29
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:27.300
till we get the flashing cursor on and type again my fruits and venture up and you can see

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.740
that it also started filling in cell a one as we were typing in the formula Bar highlighted

31
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.550
just there again.

32
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.250
When we're happy,

33
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.280
press enter.

34
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.020
And there you go.

35
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.800
Very simple.

36
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.850
That's how you enter text into excel.
