00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
okay,

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:03.880
goes,

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.500
we're gonna have a little break from the screen casts to ever look at the order of

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.910
mathematical operation.

5
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.060
Now you may remember this from your school days depend on how old you are.

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.300
I know I'm certainly old,

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.090
but it's critical to your success in Excel.

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.350
So let's have a look at the order of mathematical operation.

9
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.800
Or,

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.280
as I sometimes like to call it when you're formula doesn't do what you thought it would do

11
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.280
.

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.390
Okay,

13
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.250
let's move on.

14
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.440
Now when we using Excel,

15
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.530
we are at some point going to use complex formulas.

16
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.860
Now we're going to worry about complex formulas because complex doesn't necessarily mean

17
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.340
that they are complicated.

18
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.410
All a complex formula is is a formula that has more than one mathematical operator.

19
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.160
No,

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.690
don't be worried by the term mathematical operator,

21
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.120
either,

22
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.390
because you probably already know most of the common ones they are plus for addition,

23
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.300
minus for subtraction,

24
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.390
multiplication and division.

25
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.050
Okay,

26
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.060
so far,

27
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.610
so good.

28
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.130
Let's move on first,

29
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.250
let's cover how you think it would work.

30
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.450
So far,

31
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.540
we've created simple formulas.

32
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.170
We've done basic addition.

33
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
We've done basic multiplication basic subtraction on basic division,

34
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.390
now at the moment,

35
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.330
even when we did it the old fashioned way,

36
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.000
and we did this plus this,

37
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.710
plus this.

38
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.550
Plus this.

39
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.000
It was fine.

40
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.170
And we got the Ansari expected because we only use a single operator in the formula.

41
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.270
Whether we use that same operator over and over again makes no difference,

42
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.620
because you will always get the answer that you want.

43
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.700
So one plus one will always equal to on one plus one plus one plus one plus one will always

44
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.770
equal five.

45
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.800
And this is because we use only one mathematical operator.

46
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:58.060
But if we were to say three plus three divided by two and we wrote the formula as we said

47
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.340
it,

48
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.450
that is equals because it's a Formula three plus three divided by two.

49
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.160
We may think that we already know that the answer should be three.

50
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.390
But in Excel it isn't the actual answer would be 4.5.

51
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.050
If that just blew your mind.

52
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.380
Don't more acres were about to have a look at how it actually does work in Excel now.

53
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.010
Since mathematics began,

54
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.370
mathematical operations have always been executed in the same order.

55
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.380
Anything in brackets is always done first.

56
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.400
Next comes any multiplication parts of the formula.

57
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.050
After that comes any division part of the formula.

58
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.160
Fourth,

59
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.830
we do any addition,

60
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.320
parts of the formula.

61
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.880
And finally we do any subtraction,

62
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.080
parts of the formula.

63
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.710
If you think that's going to be difficult to remember,

64
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.780
just remember the phrase Bless my dear Aunt Sally,

65
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.770
and you'll notice that that is the order of mathematical operations.

66
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.850
In the first letter of each of those words,

67
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.250
so be would be brackets.

68
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.720
M would be multiplication d would be Division a would be addition and s would be

69
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.670
subtraction.

70
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.740
So when in doubt,

71
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.700
just remember Bless my dear on Sally.

72
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.970
Okay,

73
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.060
let's have a look at how it works.

74
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.420
Now when we say a formula like three plus three divided by two,

75
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.460
this is what we do in our head.

76
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.770
We first say three plus three on we work out that that equal six So far,

77
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.350
so good.

78
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.740
Then we take care of six and we divided by two,

79
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.390
which gives us the answer of three.

80
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.140
Which is why you may have thought that the answer to the formula we just looked at would be

81
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.570
three.

82
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.600
But remember,

83
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600
bless my dear,

84
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.730
aren't Sally the order of mathematical operation now because the D for division comes

85
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.750
before a for addition.

86
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.990
In our phrase,

87
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.590
Bless my dear Aunt Sally.

88
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.310
We have to adapt own formula,

89
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.510
so it actually works in that order.

90
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.490
So in a formula,

91
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.640
the division will always be done before the addition.

92
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.850
Because D comes before the A.

93
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.930
So the way Excel will actually do it is it will do the division part first.

94
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.650
So what it will say is three divided by two is 1.5,

95
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.630
and then that's the division out of the way.

96
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.380
Then comes the addition parts of it.

97
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.700
So we already know the answer to our three divided by two is 1.5,

98
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.470
which we can see here on.

99
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.880
No Excel will execute the addition part of the formula,

100
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.550
which is the three plus our answer,

101
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.900
which gives us the answer.

102
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.390
4.5 on That is how excel will do it every single time.

103
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.440
It will always do anything brackets first.

104
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.390
It will then do It's multiplication.

105
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.010
Zit will then do.

106
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.400
Its divisions will then do it's additions,

107
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.900
and finally it will do the subtractions So ever.

108
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.430
Formula three plus three,

109
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.650
divided by two,

110
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.070
will actually be done as three divided by two and then three will be added to the answer.

111
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.680
OK,

112
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.770
so now let's look at a good habit to get into.

113
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.070
Now,

114
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.710
when you're planning your formula in your head,

115
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.180
it may help you to think about it in terms of brackets.

116
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.850
First.

117
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.210
If we looked at the three plus three in the formula we've just done,

118
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.990
we would know that that would be calculated first because B comes before everything else.

119
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.820
So three plus three would be six on Ben because we'd already bracketed that off and it's

120
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.900
already being calculated with them.

121
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.320
Divide the outside by three because everything comes after the brackets.

122
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.600
If in doubt,

123
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.150
just remember the phrase.

124
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.200
Bless my fear aren't Sally so our actual formula in Excel would be equals.

125
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.650
Open brackets three plus three divided by two on.

126
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.130
We could see that Excel would know Work out three plus three.

127
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.720
Give us our answer of six and divide that answer by two,

128
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.750
which would give us the answer of three.

129
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.010
And that's the way to structure your formulas.

130
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.710
So you always get the answer you expect now.

131
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.120
Hopefully,

132
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.030
that's made it a little bit clearer for you.

133
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.130
But when in doubt always remember the phrase.

134
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.730
Bless,

135
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.670
my dear,

136
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.660
aren't Sally.

137
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.410
So if the formula you just entered doesn't give you the result that you thought it would

138
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.650
always take a look at it and see if you can insert brackets around the things that you

139
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.410
thought would execute first.

140
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.010
Within a few days of writing your own formulas,

141
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.070
you'll be an absolute master of this.

142
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.750
Don't worry.

143
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.890
So when and does Just remember.

144
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.370
Bless,

145
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.250
my dear,

146
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.240
Aren't Sally on That gives you the order of mathematical operation.

147
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.970
Okay,

148
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.220
See you in the next lecture.
