00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
Okay,

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.910
guys,

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.060
in the next lecture,

4
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.570
I'm gonna have a look ahead to set up our worksheet to print.

5
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.120
But before yet,

6
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.210
there were going to come back to something I mentioned way back at the beginning of this

7
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.900
section.

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.040
Let's have to customize the quick access toolbar that you'll remember that the quick access

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.930
toolbar is this area at the top,

10
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.670
left hand side of the screen.

11
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.350
We can see at the moment we just have save,

12
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.790
undo and redo,

13
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.220
and then we're gonna add print preview,

14
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.150
toe that list.

15
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.570
So what we're gonna do is come up left,

16
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.150
click this little down arrow button just here,

17
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.330
and you can see that we have already have save,

18
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.580
undo and redo selected on.

19
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.210
We can also see that we have print,

20
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.470
preview and print.

21
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.200
So I'm just gonna hover over it left click,

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.860
and you can now see that that's been added to a quick access toolbar.

23
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480
And there may be other options that you want to add into this as you progress through excel

24
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.480
.

25
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.010
If you find that used in particular function frequently to save navigating through all of

26
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.200
the ribbons to get to it,

27
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.760
you could left click here choose more commands,

28
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.440
and there you can see that you have an entire range of different options and you can choose

29
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.090
popular commanders and you can pick a particular tab.

30
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.950
So if you said well,

31
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.260
actually,

32
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.380
I would like to have a look at the view tab.

33
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.380
Just click View,

34
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.760
Tamp and you could say,

35
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.080
Well,

36
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.990
maybe I frequently like to have a look at something at 100% so just click 100% click.

37
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.040
Add on 100% will be added to your quick access toolbar.

38
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.760
Let's go back to Popular Commandments on Let's Say that you frequently use email so you

39
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.940
just left click email.

40
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.950
Click add click OK,

41
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.030
and they go.

42
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.390
You can now see that you have these options added to your quick access to a bar.

43
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.820
If you want to delete them,

44
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.020
just left click.

45
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.580
Come back down to more commands.

46
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.560
Choose them from here,

47
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.060
so left click male and say remove left.

48
00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.850
Click 100.

49
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.000
Say remove and click OK on that.

50
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.950
Say you add and remove different options to your quick access.

51
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.210
Still,

52
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.510
bar easy is that.

53
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.800
See you in the next lecture
