00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
righty ho.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.910
We now know how to do sums the old fashioned way.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.710
At the moment,

4
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.430
we've only looked,

5
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.170
at addition,

6
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.010
which was the be five plus C five plus T five plus C five plus F five.

7
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.600
But they were going to use one of excels built in functions to make do in addition,

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
a little bit quicker.

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.010
But just before we get to that,

10
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.590
let me show you another useful tool that Excel has.

11
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.210
If you quickly want to adult rely on numbers or a group of numbers,

12
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.160
they can make column.

13
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.220
It could be a row,

14
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.540
or it could be any combination of the two.

15
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.520
Let's imagine that we want to find there what the sum of all the values and column D r.

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.080
If we slide toe first number by left,

17
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.510
click in drag down until they're all highlighted.

18
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.540
If we look down here at the bottom of excel,

19
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.850
we can see we have a couple of things instantly reported.

20
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.930
We can see that we have a count of nine,

21
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.760
and if we have a look,

22
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.470
we have 123 456789 cells highlighted.

23
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.210
Quite correct,

24
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.950
and we can instantly see that the sum is 59.

25
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.640
Now we have a few more options in here which are easy to get it.

26
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.310
If you just have your mayor Stan over this little bar at the bottom right quick,

27
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.430
this box will appear now just in this area.

28
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.730
Just here are all the things that we can instantly get feedback on these air.

29
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.840
Just tuggle on enough.

30
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.250
So if it's ticked and you don't want it left clicking it on ticks it,

31
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.640
There's hope we wanted C average.

32
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.850
We can click average.

33
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.450
We may want to see minimum and we may want see maximum.

34
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.240
So I've just selected those click off and now you can see instantly.

35
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.960
Excel will tell us the average of this range that you highlighted.

36
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.850
Just here is 6.555 lots of five and six.

37
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.010
The lowest value the men is to.

38
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.580
And if you have a quick look down,

39
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.170
we can see.

40
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.520
Yep,

41
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.310
absolutely.

42
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.000
That's too.

43
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.580
The maximum value is nine on.

44
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.060
We have a couple 23 nines and there,

45
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.210
but it is the highest value,

46
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.270
so quite correct in this almost 59.

47
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.630
So that works in the vertical plane.

48
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.770
You can also come across and Newt in the horizontal plane,

49
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.670
or you can highlight a range of numbers.

50
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.580
So we we selected all of our day to just here.

51
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.890
We can see that the lowest value is zero,

52
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.450
which it probably is.

53
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.950
We've definitely got there there.

54
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.720
The highest value is 15 which is there,

55
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.700
which is quite correct.

56
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.740
We have an average of 7.4.

57
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.150
I can't work that out in my head,

58
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.020
but I'm sure it's right on the total sum.

59
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.640
All of their sales for all of their item for every day is 333.

60
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.830
So they got very useful function for quickly finding land sums.

61
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.000
All the lowest values are the highest values.

62
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.560
Have a play around with it,

63
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.450
and I'm sure you'll find that very useful.

64
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.200
Okay,

65
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.990
let's look at auto sums.

66
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.330
Auto.

67
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.550
Some is a function that's built into Excel that speeds up a basic addition.

68
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.280
Now you'll recall from previous lecture that when we did our tradition,

69
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.700
we we hit equals that we click Selby five them,

70
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.680
plus that may click cell C five them,

71
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.820
plus then d five them,

72
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.900
plus nano moment on hit entering.

73
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.560
Eventually we got to our answer,

74
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.130
so it works.

75
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.160
But it's not quick.

76
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.340
So the auto some seeks to address that problem.

77
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.510
Now.

78
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.330
The thing to remember about auto some is it only sums columns,

79
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.460
so we couldn't use an auto some toe.

80
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.980
Add the this range of values here,

81
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.150
but don't worry.

82
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.500
We'll let we'll come to that in just a few seconds.

83
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.180
But what it can do is automatically add a column.

84
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.090
So what you'll do to use an auto some is left.

85
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.540
Click the column where you want the result to appear,

86
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.550
which will normally be the first blank cell below that,

87
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.810
the list of numbers that you want to add up.

88
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.300
We have two ways to get to auto Some.

89
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.720
We continue to see a hehe in the home ribbon just that or were actually going to go into

90
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.280
one of our other ribbons now and that's the formulas ribbon just up here.

91
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.270
So I'm gonna hover over it,

92
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.930
left click,

93
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.950
and there we can see that our formula ribbon is being displayed on The second option in Is

94
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.930
Auto some.

95
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.100
So if we hover over it without mouse,

96
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.750
we can see we get a little tool tip that tells what it does it automatically add stuff up.

97
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.250
So let's go right ahead.

98
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.620
Left,

99
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.940
click on We can see there that Excel has already written the formula forest.

100
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.270
It's included the equals to tell it.

101
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.120
It's a formula.

102
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.680
It's included the function,

103
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.480
some it's included.

104
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.540
The parentheses,

105
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.030
all the brackets which enclosed the arguments,

106
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.640
the arguments of just the range of data that the function is gonna act upon.

107
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.420
Don't worry about that.

108
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.840
Too much now will become second nature very soon on it's also highlighted the range of the

109
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.450
arguments,

110
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.870
and we can see here that we have cells.

111
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.950
Be five through B 13 highlighted.

112
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.740
And if we look at how that's expressed between the brackets,

113
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.240
we can see that we have be fighting and probably see it a little clearer.

114
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.340
In the formula bar.

115
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.630
We have be five coal on B 13 and all that means is from B five colon,

116
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.550
which means through to sell be 13 his center and they go,

117
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.350
we have our first auto some.

118
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.750
So there you go.

119
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.440
That's how you doing,

120
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.840
Auto?

121
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.060
Some very simple.

122
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.070
Just click it the boss Move your data.

123
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.940
Hit the auto,

124
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.370
some button press enter and they go.

125
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.060
That's how you do in auto some much quicker than select elite cell and hit in plus

126
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.460
repeatedly until you get to the right answer.

127
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.140
Okay.

128
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.460
Next,

129
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.610
we're gonna have looking where we can copy a formalist so we don't have to keep rewriting

130
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.200
the memory time.

131
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.250
We want to use them.

132
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.850
Okay,

133
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.940
So you in the next lecture.
