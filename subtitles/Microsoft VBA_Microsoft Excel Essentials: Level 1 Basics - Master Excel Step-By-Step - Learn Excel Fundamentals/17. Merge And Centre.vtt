00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
okay.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.480
How to deal with extra wide column wits when we use titles.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.550
Rare worksheets.

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.690
In the last lecture,

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.690
we covered how to resize cells,

6
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.450
and we can either do manually using the right click and column width.

7
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.450
Hoboken highlights all of the rows across the top,

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.760
so all of the columns across the top head until we'll click between any of the column

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.900
lettuce to automatically resize.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.250
And that works perfectly well unless you have a very long total like we have just appeared

11
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.720
and sell a one and then Excel has a built in function,

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.450
which is quickly visible in the home ribbon on that is,

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.440
merge and center on what merge incented us is.

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.730
When you highlight a group of cells,

15
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.880
it will automatically turn those cells from a bunch of individual cells into one,

16
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.600
merge,

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.390
sell and then sent to whatever Texas within the first cell.

18
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.060
That's an important point,

19
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.770
because when you merge in center,

20
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.700
only the data in the first cell that is the top left cell of the range you highlight is

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.300
kept.

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.400
Everything else is miss completely.

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.580
So if I just give you a quick demonstration if we select cell a one left,

24
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.690
click and drag over to be won without left.

25
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.850
Massport's I know we've highlighted a one and B one and hit Merge in center.

26
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.520
You can see that now.

27
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.160
There is no Selby one.

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.090
It has all become cell a one.

29
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390
So those two cells have been merged.

30
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.820
We can also see that the text has been centered.

31
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.160
Personally,

32
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.730
I prefer my titles aligned to the left.

33
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.130
So I'm just gonna hit the left alignment button,

34
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.270
which we covered in early.

35
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.850
A lecture.

36
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.780
And no,

37
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.580
if we choose to resize automatically by clicking between columns,

38
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.230
am be we can see that column A has never been shrunk down automatically to match the width

39
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.050
of item.

40
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.380
But we now have a different problem because my fruit and veg shop was only sent it across

41
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.540
sells a one and B one.

42
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.660
We actually can't see the full title,

43
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.330
and that's easy to remedy or we need to do Is left click out new merge sell drank over a

44
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.290
few cells.

45
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.830
So now we're highlighting a one through e one hit Emergence Center again,

46
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.060
which initially will undo the merge in center and then click it one more time to merge in

47
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.890
center again.

48
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.750
So no cell a one b one c one d one an e one have all been merged into one cell,

49
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.210
and now we can fully see our title.

50
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.200
We can automatically adjust our column widths by highlighting all the data in double

51
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.650
clicking.

52
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.370
No,

53
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.160
my worksheets,

54
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.590
Stansell,

55
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.280
look much better now.

56
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.280
We may decide to have these all the same width for now.

57
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.910
So let's just highlights all the cells choose format with.

58
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.750
I think we said in 11 they go and let me just left.

59
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.560
Click that and left the lying suffer.

60
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.250
Got to do that.

61
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.650
And there you go.

62
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.930
No table startle a good on there Were ready to start entering some data.

63
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.440
So you in the next lecture.
