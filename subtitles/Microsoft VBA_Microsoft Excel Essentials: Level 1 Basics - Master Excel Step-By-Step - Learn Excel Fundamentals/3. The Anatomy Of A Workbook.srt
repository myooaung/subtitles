1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Okay,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,670
let's talk about the anatomy of a workbook.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,360
And the first thing I want you to notice is that the name of the fall you're working on is

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:17,230
always displayed in the top center section of the screen right here they can see it.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,020
The moments is,

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,970
as we have opened a new workbook that Excel is called it Book won by default.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,460
If we were to open another workbook,

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,520
that book would be called Book to Shortly will be covering how to rename the workbook to

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,770
something more meaningful.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,190
Okay,

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,760
the next thing I want to draw your attention to is this large area right across the sub.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,550
Just here.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,800
This is called the Ribbon.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,430
Now the ribbon is a really useful tool that allows us to do some really cool things in

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,050
excel.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,790
And the ribbon is split into different sections.

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,450
As you'll see,

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,500
we have home.

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,060
We have insert insets.

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,260
We have page layouts,

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,890
formulas,

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,230
data and so on will cover each of these particular elements in more detail was,

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,570
of course,

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,240
progresses.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,180
But just for now,

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,140
I just want to remember that this section across the top is called the ribbon righty ho The

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,140
next thing we're gonna have a quick look at is the quick access toolbar.

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,680
Now,

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,540
that's this small area at the top,

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,970
left hand side of the screen.

31
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,670
Just here.

32
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,370
Now,

33
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,100
at the moment,

34
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,830
all we can see is the excel.

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,440
I come he save.

36
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,380
I can't the undo and redo buttons.

37
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,650
I'm gonna show you shortly,

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,940
Hagen it how you can add more icons to that.

39
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,430
The things that you use all the time to save.

40
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,050
You haven't to go and navigate through the ribbon to find them.

41
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,630
The next thing we're gonna look at is at the top,

42
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,350
right hand side of the screen.

43
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,350
Now we have five little icons.

44
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,840
Just up here on the 1st 1 is a question mark on that is the help function for Microsoft

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,450
Excel.

46
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,300
You will see from the little pop up box that's just appeared underneath it,

47
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,070
that it will give you a tool tip to tell you what this particular icon does on also in

48
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,150
brackets weaken C F one on for the keyboard shortcut junkies out there.

49
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,260
F one is the keyboard shortcut to save Yemen to scroll around with the amounts to get to

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,100
the help function.

51
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,560
Just say F one on your keyboard and you're straight into Microsoft's help in this first

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,540
section of lectures.

53
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,590
Will will briefly touch on Mark Soft Excel help and have a look here that can help us.

54
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,370
Okay,

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,300
next icon along is to do with the ribbon display,

56
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,520
and we can either auto hide the ribbon show taps,

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,320
show tabs and commands a recommend leaving that exactly as it is at the moment.

58
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,540
Just so you always have the exact view that I have on that will save any confusion a little

59
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,150
later on.

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,010
Okay,

61
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,240
the next button along is the minimize button.

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,540
Now,

63
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,270
at the moment,

64
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,550
we can see that this is expanded to fill the whole screen.

65
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,330
If we were to click the minimize button,

66
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,560
it makes it disappear down here to our menu bar down the bottom.

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
Now we have a lost our work.

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,610
We haven't closed Excel.

69
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,660
It's still there,

70
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,310
Andi,

71
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,760
If we hover over it there,

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,810
you can see that it's popped back up a little picture so we can either click on it to bring

73
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,080
it back or just double click on Beacon will get our work sheep back.

74
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,850
Okay,

75
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,610
The next one along is the restore down.

76
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:13,790
Now,

77
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,860
if we click this,

78
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,770
it will shrink the size of the screen that we're looking at.

79
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,730
So if you prefer not to work with Excel occupying the whole of your desktop,

80
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,610
you can use this and it will shrink it down.

81
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,350
Now,

82
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,350
if you want to make that a little narrower,

83
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,290
you can just come to the right hand side here till the arrow changes left.

84
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,100
Click on Dragon or drag out.

85
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,780
You can do the same from this side so you can left click Dragon drag out.

86
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,410
If you just want to make it taller or shorter,

87
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,700
come down the button here,

88
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,820
left click,

89
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,950
move down,

90
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,580
move up.

91
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,470
Or,

92
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,470
if you want to move in both axes at same time,

93
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,840
just go.

94
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,310
One of the corners on do that Now Excel will remember exactly that size and that position

95
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,190
on the screen.

96
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,870
So if we know,

97
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,450
go to maximize.

98
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,840
So we expand the view to our full screen on,

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,720
then we choose to restore down.

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,850
It will go back to exactly the settings we just so exit.

101
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,680
Okay,

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,860
let's go back to full screen and finally the little X up the corner is too close now Don't

103
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,140
worry.

104
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,510
If you've made any changes to your workbook and you hit close accidentally,

105
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,900
you'll get a pop up message that asked you,

106
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,870
Do you want to save this file?

107
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,740
So don't worry.

108
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,000
If you accidentally click it,

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,040
you'll have an option to get out of it.

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,650
In case you didn't mean to click it,

111
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,400
the next area of the screen will look at is the formula bar.

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,250
That's this area right here.

113
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:40,920
Now,

114
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,550
as its name suggests,

115
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,120
this is a place where you can type formulas,

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,810
but you can also use it to input your data.

117
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,840
Be dates,

118
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,910
text numbers,

119
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,800
whatever you want.

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,870
So there are essentially two ways of entry in data into excel,

121
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,850
either directly in the cell,

122
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,810
which will come to short length or in the formula bar,

123
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,510
which is this area right here.

124
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,570
Don't worry too much about what we're going to do with this at the moment.

125
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,660
Just remember that this area is called the Formula Bar.

126
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,700
Okay,

127
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,470
the next area is the worksheet area,

128
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,950
and that's this area highlighted just here.

129
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,290
This is the main area that will be working in an entry.

130
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,480
Now,

131
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,280
data and I have formulas into Andi.

132
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,780
It's made up of lots and lots of little cells,

133
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,960
and we'll cover ourselves now.

134
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:31,400
So cells Excel is made up of thousands and thousands of cells and cells are these little

135
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,450
rectangles that you can see just here.

136
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,920
Now a seller's referred to by its column letter,

137
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,640
and it's road number.

138
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,570
So if we were to select to sell at random here,

139
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,700
we can see that this cell is at the intersection of column K and wrote six.

140
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,210
And you can see that just here in the name box.

141
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,190
So similarly,

142
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,150
if we were to click over here,

143
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,330
we can see where at the intersection of column Double A and Row 29.

144
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:02,770
Now,

145
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,070
this is easy enough when Europe here and you can quickly see the intersex.

146
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,480
But if you move,

147
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,260
why over to the screen it becomes more difficult to look down the column and then look over

148
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,950
at the row.

149
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,140
So using the name box up here is a very useful way of finding out exactly which sell your

150
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,250
in Okay s.

151
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,970
So that cover sells next,

152
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,720
we're gonna have a look at the name box.

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,500
Okay.

154
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,350
We refer to the name box just a few seconds ago.

155
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,070
Andi,

156
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,970
that's this area right up the corner.

157
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,920
Just here that the name bucks has a couple of functions.

158
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,220
The 1st 1 is to identify which sell your in very quickly and very easily.

159
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,910
It has another really useful function which will come to later in the course.

160
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:52,470
The next thing we're gonna look at is how we actually move around the worksheet area.

161
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,450
Now we have several options.

162
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,230
To do this.

163
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,210
We can use the arrow keys,

164
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,470
which you'll find on your keyboard and look something like this.

165
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:07,060
And obviously you can use the up arrow to move up one line to time or the down arrow to

166
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,010
move down one arrow a two time.

167
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,990
Similarly,

168
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,520
you can use the left arrow to move left on the right arrow to move right.

169
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,370
If we want to move around a little more than that over to the far right hand side of the

170
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,750
screen,

171
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,650
you can see a scroll bar that's this area just here.

172
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,390
Now that the scroll bar you can either left click with your mouse on,

173
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,150
drag it down and up,

174
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,880
or you can use the little arrows at the top on the bottom,

175
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,830
the bottom area.

176
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,730
When you click,

177
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:40,860
it will take you down one row at a time on the upper will take you up.

178
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,560
One wrote a time now,

179
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,100
similarly at the bottom,

180
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,350
right hand side of the screen.

181
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,840
We also have the left and right scroll bar,

182
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,530
which is this scroll bar just here and again.

183
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,970
You can left click and drag left or right to move left,

184
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,550
all right,

185
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,850
or you can use the little arrows on the right hand side.

186
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,480
Moves you over one column at a time on the left hand side.

187
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,750
You could move over one column to the left each time.

188
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,350
Okay,

189
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,490
now Excel.

190
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,490
Workbooks are called work books and just like a normal book,

191
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,260
a book has multiple pages,

192
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,310
and so can an Excel workbook.

193
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,970
Now,

194
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,800
at the moment,

195
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,440
you can see that by default.

196
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,770
Excel when we open.

197
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,890
This file just gave us one and cheat.

198
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:33,810
In the olden days in Excel 2003 possibly 2007 and 2010 we had three sheets by default,

199
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,670
but at the moment in version 2013 we just get one sheet.

200
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,700
That's this one just down here.

201
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,580
You can see at the moment there is a little plus button at the side.

202
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,630
So if we want to and another sheet toe a workbook,

203
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,580
we simply left.

204
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,450
Click the plus button and we get sheet to on.

205
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,950
We can keep clicking this to get sheet 34 and five on.

206
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,910
That is simply have you add extra sheets to your workbook.

207
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,410
Now,

208
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,020
at the moment,

209
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,590
you may not see the need for multiple sheets,

210
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,750
but it will become clear little later on in the course of three progress.

211
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,720
But for now,

212
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,910
let's just delete those sheets we've added by right clicking choosen delete and we'll right

213
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:19,830
click Delete right click delete right click delete.

214
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,850
There you go and we're back to where we started.

215
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:27,930
A very useful thing to know is how to save your work in Excel on.

216
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,910
We're about to cover three different ways of saving your work.

217
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,640
Okay,

218
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,950
at the moment we have a workbook with no data in whatsoever.

219
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,970
So we'll go into the quick access toolbar just up here.

220
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,430
You'll recall we looked at it a little bit earlier on.

221
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,300
We'll click on the save icon.

222
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,720
So when we click this ah,

223
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,250
I come,

224
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,590
this box will pop up now,

225
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,150
At the moment,

226
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,050
it's a save as because we've not previously save this file.

227
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,990
So all we need to do is pick out path.

228
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,420
I'm not going to use one drive.

229
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,970
I'll go to computer,

230
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,650
I'll choose desktop.

231
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,030
And here this.

232
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,250
This meant this dialog box will ask us to pick a new name for our file.

233
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,550
So let's just call it something useful,

234
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,090
though my workbook isn't particularly useful will call it that.

235
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,310
Ignore the other options for a moment.

236
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,430
Just name the file,

237
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,390
something that you can recall hit safe and they go,

238
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,530
our file saved.

239
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,010
That's the first method the next method will use to save our work is using the ribbon that

240
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,570
we spoke about little earlier.

241
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,550
If we move up to the top left,

242
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,240
you can see by default.

243
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,340
The home ribbon is displayed on right next to it.

244
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,900
On the left,

245
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,020
you can see the foil ribbon.

246
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,970
If you left,

247
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,240
click with your mouse button.

248
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
You'll come back to this area just here.

249
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,090
What you want to do is scroll down to save left click amega.

250
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,700
Your work has now been saved on the final method for saving.

251
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,430
Our work is to use the keyboard shortcut.

252
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,640
Ctrl control button and s.

253
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,860
You can see if we hover over the save option just of here in the quick access toolbar.

254
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:11,690
It will cleverly tell us in the tip box that control and s is the keyboard shortcut to save

255
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,360
our work.

256
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,840
Now,

257
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,370
you won't actually see anything happen when I do this.

258
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,700
But when I hit control and s that slight flash of the screen just indicated the Excel

259
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,550
Understood what we said on our work has just being saved.

260
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,400
Next,

261
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,620
we're going to cover hair to save as that is renaming a workbook from one file name to a

262
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,150
different one.

263
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,450
Okay.

264
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,190
Save has as a couple of different functions.

265
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,710
No,

266
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,250
at the moment,

267
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,970
we've just saved this workbook as a workbook called my workbook.

268
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,570
Now,

269
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,850
we It could be that we continue working on this,

270
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:52,080
but we actually want to keep the original file and keep the new file under a separate file

271
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,450
name.

272
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,000
That way we can always go back to a previous version of a file if we find that something

273
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,690
has gone horrendously wrong.

274
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,670
So now we're going to cover save as now again.

275
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,660
We have a couple of different ways of doing this.

276
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,350
The 1st 1 will use is the file menu.

277
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,860
So come up to the top.

278
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,850
Left hand side,

279
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,250
left click file,

280
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,480
Come down,

281
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,900
choose save us again,

282
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,150
specify your path.

283
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,650
I'm gonna choose computer Desktop and we'll get this little dialog box and we can see there

284
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,290
that we already have my workbook,

285
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,580
the one we've just saved.

286
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,610
But this time,

287
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,170
what we're gonna do is we're going to call this my workbook to which is a very creative

288
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,050
name indeed.

289
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,810
Again,

290
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,360
don't worry about any other options.

291
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,700
For now.

292
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,850
Just change the name of the workbook and save as a different workbook.

293
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,680
Now we still have my workbook,

294
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,940
the original version still intact.

295
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,660
All the days that we entered in there,

296
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,820
even though we didn't enter any data in there is still there.

297
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,190
And it's fully protected and will stay there until you delete it.

298
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,760
But now we have successfully rename the file as my workbook to okay,

299
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,580
The next method will use to save,

300
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,650
as is the keyboard shortcuts.

301
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,420
Because at the moment,

302
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,430
in the current view,

303
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,940
we can't see a save as option.

304
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,190
We can't hover over it and have excel.

305
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,540
Tell us in a tool tip What the keyboard shortcut is.

306
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,910
So at the moment,

307
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,550
I'm just going to let you know that the keyboard short cook for save,

308
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,300
as is F 12 and that's the function key on the top of your keyboard.

309
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,050
So if I hit F 12 just now,

310
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,690
you'll see that we get the same vast dialog box pop up again.

311
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,890
We can just nip in here,

312
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,840
change the name of their worksheet,

313
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,410
ignore the other options from now click Save,

314
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,480
and we've no successfully saved as a new workbook name.

315
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,780
Okay,

316
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,040
the final thing I want to point out to you is you.

317
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,220
You may find that the cells are a little small.

318
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,600
It looks fine at the moment,

319
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,310
cause the data's completely that this spreadsheet is completely clear.

320
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,870
But as we progress and we get lots and lots of data in here,

321
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,550
it could become difficult to read.

322
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,320
So if you look down to the right hand side of your screen,

323
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,450
you'll see a little slide out with a minus button on the left on the plus button on the

324
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:06,860
right.

325
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,400
Now,

326
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,170
at the moment our view is 100% on.

327
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,470
We can see columns A through a C.

328
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,850
We can see lines.

329
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,250
Want to 39 down the side there.

330
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,560
If we want to zoom in to make the data a little bigger,

331
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,630
weaken just left.

332
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,900
Click on the plus button and you can see tells us zoom in,

333
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,290
and that will make each of the cells a little bit larger.

334
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,640
You won't be able to see as many columns or rows,

335
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,150
but it may make the date or a little easier to see.

336
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,460
Similarly,

337
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,960
you may want to zoom out just to see how big your data is on by left click in this bar,

338
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,550
you'll come out and out,

339
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,950
probably to a point where you can actually read the data anymore.

340
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,260
Alternatively,

341
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,610
you can left click this little bar in the middle and either move to the left to zoom out or

342
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,350
move to the right to zoom in and they go.

343
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,380
That should make it a little easier if you to see.

344
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,310
Okay,

345
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,010
there you have it.

346
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:05,590
That's the detailed anatomy of a workbook in the next short lecture.

347
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,420
We're just gonna have a couple of minutes just as a quick review.

348
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,830
So if you ever need to come back to it in the future.

349
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,160
Just go to the short version and you'll quickly be able to find all the different areas of

350
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,860
the workbook on what they're called.

351
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,820
See you soon.
