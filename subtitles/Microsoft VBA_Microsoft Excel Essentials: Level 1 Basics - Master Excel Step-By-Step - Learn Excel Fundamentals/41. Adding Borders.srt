1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
okay and go is what we're going to do now is have a look out to format the cells with

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,640
borders.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,040
Now,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,140
what I've done just now is I've copied the formula from here.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,250
Our total have copied it over two column B and have also extended over to J.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,420
K and L.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,960
So we have totals for all of our different data sets to change the border on a cell.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,250
All you're gonna do is left.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,800
Click the cell and we're gonna use the home ribbon on.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,730
We're going to use the front section of the home ribbon on.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,910
We're going to look at something we haven't looked at before.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,090
We skipped over it in an earlier lecture on that is the border option.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,730
That's this one just here.

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,720
They concede we hover over it,

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,660
that by default we get the bottom border selected.

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,350
So just so you can see what that does,

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,020
I'm just gonna left,

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,230
click it and move out of that cell and you can see now that we have a line across the

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,150
bottom of that particular cell.

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,940
So that's a bottom border.

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,260
So I'm just going to re select the cell.

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,820
But this time I'm gonna choose the little down arrow by left clicking,

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,630
and we can see here that we have a bottom order top,

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,830
border left,

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,390
borders,

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,700
right?

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,160
Borders,

28
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,930
no borders,

29
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,750
thick borders,

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,500
all sorts of it from borders.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,970
But what we're actually gonna do is we're gonna create our custom border.

32
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,850
So we're going to choose the option at the bottom,

33
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,570
which is more borders by left.

34
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,610
Clicking in this little box will pop up here.

35
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,700
Now you can change the color of the borders by just clicking the collapse down here.

36
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,450
We're gonna leave it automatic so it becomes black.

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,940
You can see because we had a bottom board run,

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,180
But it's actually there now,

39
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,140
so I'm just going to click to remove its Allegan.

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,480
Now what?

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,190
We have no borders in their cell,

42
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,080
and we're going to create one from scratch.

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,190
They're here,

44
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,090
the different styles that we can choose on because accountants like double lines over the

45
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,060
top of totals.

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,040
What we're gonna do is we're gonna select the double line by left clicking it.

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,800
We're just going to go to the top,

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,610
which is exactly where we want it,

49
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,650
and click there.

50
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,560
And now you can see that we have a double line over the top of our cell.

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,320
So when I click,

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,790
OK and just move out the way you can see that we now have a double over line across the top

53
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,010
of their first total.

54
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,970
So all I'm gonna do is left.

55
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,950
Click that cell,

56
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,740
copy the format in left,

57
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,190
click and drag along the way over an agency that we have the double overline across all of

58
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,110
their totals.

59
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,720
And just to make it a little tired,

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,670
I'm just gonna left click Insert a blank line between total Andi after inch.

61
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,880
I mean,

62
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,370
move down,

63
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,200
they go.

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,330
So that's how you change your borders.

65
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,630
See you in the next lecture.
