00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
Okay,

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:02.710
guys,

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.470
we're coming to the end of the first section Now on.

4
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.130
I just want to quickly cover off one of the options that we missed from the font section of

5
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.850
the home ribbon just up here.

6
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.120
And that's the highlighting option,

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.650
Which is this one just here.

8
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.430
Now,

9
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.300
what this does is it highlights the cell in a particular color.

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.790
Now,

11
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.230
there are a few reasons you can use this tool.

12
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.940
Some people just use it to make things stand out to make the data easier to read.

13
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.770
Personally,

14
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.070
I use it for two particular reasons.

15
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.920
Firstly,

16
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.250
if they have a lot of formulas where people could accidentally over type,

17
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.980
I will highlight the formulas to indicate that these are formulas and you shouldn't type in

18
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.800
these cells.

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.890
So at the moment,

20
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm just going to do that for all of their formula.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.110
So we can see here We have a formula.

22
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.040
We have formulas down to here,

23
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.180
so I'm just gonna highlight this range.

24
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.690
Now,

25
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.530
I'm also gonna hit control on the highlights.

26
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.370
How other formulas You'll remember that if you hit control when you highlight that will

27
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.150
highlight noncontiguous sets of data.

28
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.970
I'm just gonna hover over this left click the little down arrow and I'm gonna choose.

29
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.510
There's some really stand out.

30
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.190
Of course,

31
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.770
I tend to just use faint ones s.

32
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.130
So let's just say that blue accent and they go Now you can see that all of those cells have

33
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.020
been highlighting a different color to the plain white.

34
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.380
That's their by default.

35
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.140
So this is one of the reasons I would use them to highlight formulas.

36
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.030
So it's an indication to the use that not toe over type those particular cells on the other

37
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.860
reason I would use it is in a form to show that that's where a piece of data needs to be

38
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.350
entered.

39
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.290
You can use them for whatever you want to do.

40
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.200
If you want to remove the highlight in,

41
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.790
just literally select a few cells,

42
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.400
which have ones you want to remove the highlighting from Come back to hear hit.

43
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.470
No Phil and they go.

44
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.640
You can see that you're your for matins.

45
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.420
Be removed.

46
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.980
I'm just going to copy the formatting from here,

47
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.140
using format painter on Pace it over there and there you go.

48
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.580
That's how you highlight to sell
