1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Okay,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,640
guys.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,350
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,630
Question answered.

5
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,410
Now in level one of the course.

6
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,500
How the question says,

7
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,150
How can I make Excel right?

8
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,620
The first letter in a cell in capital letters automatically.

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,040
Now,

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,980
by default,

11
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,780
proper words automatically capitalized.

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,330
So the days of the week and the months of the year are automatically capsulized because

13
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,920
their proper words Beyond that,

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,830
what we need to apply is a formula to do that.

15
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,320
And then the formulas are very,

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,610
very straightforward.

17
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,830
So here and you can download this file from this lecture.

18
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,890
What we have are a few examples.

19
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,150
So when I have in cell a three is Mary had a little lamb,

20
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,760
and what we're gonna do is convert that from lower case,

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,100
toe up a case a woman do in B three,

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,550
you say equals and I'm going to say upper open brackets.

23
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,360
Then just point to that cell and closer brackets and it enter.

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,740
And there you can see we have Mary had a little lamb all in uppercase on just conduce.

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,310
Copy that.

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,500
They're going to paste special values here.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,370
So now I have Mary had a little lamb in upper case to convert it back the other way.

28
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,800
What I'm gonna do is say,

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,640
equals lower open the brackets,

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,270
point to that cell closer brackets and hit Enter.

31
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,890
And now you can see I have Mary had a little lamb back in Lo que So again,

32
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,620
I'm just gonna hit control and seeing Copy that click here and pay special.

33
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,370
So now I have it in lower case.

34
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,780
And I'm also going to copy that and put it in uppercase.

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:34,830
Oh,

36
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,040
no.

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,450
We have it both here.

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,840
One in lower case one in upper case there to capitalize the first letter of each word.

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,340
We're going to use the proper function,

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,510
so we just come type equals proper open brackets.

41
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,380
Point here.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,130
Closer brackets on hit,

43
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,600
enter.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,590
And there you can see that everything has its first letter capitalizing.

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,470
If I just hit control in D and copy that down,

46
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,240
you can see that it doesn't matter whether it's in lower case or upper case.

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,110
It will automatically capitalize the first letter off each word.

48
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,900
Now,

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,690
a mindful that the specific question says head,

50
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,230
I capitalize the first letter in each cell,

51
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,050
not in each word.

52
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,230
So here,

53
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,000
we're gonna use will use this as an example.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,080
I'm just gonna pace that in there.

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,050
So here we have.

56
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,420
Mary had a little lamb in lower case now to capitalize.

57
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,620
Only the first letter were really into Level two stuff here,

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,250
but I'm gonna wish through it anyway,

59
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,600
what we could have,

60
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,150
what we're gonna need to do is combine a few different functions.

61
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,050
Eso I'm just gonna wish through the so we can use the left function on what the left

62
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,550
function say's is point to the text that you want to extract the left most character from.

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,920
So we're going to be looking at D three and then we're gonna hit comma,

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,770
and it says in hair me characters Do you want to return?

65
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,600
So Mary has four letters,

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,880
So free hit four and closer brackets left four off this cell here returns Mary.

67
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,400
So there's the left here for completeness.

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,700
We're also going to do the right,

69
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,740
so it's gonna copy that.

70
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,380
Paste it in here.

71
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,960
Going to say equals right on.

72
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,180
No,

73
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,500
no,

74
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,180
we're extracting the right most character.

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,370
So getting an a point here on I'm gonna hit comma.

76
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,010
Let's let's just say three for a second.

77
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,750
So that should give us a M.

78
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,230
B.

79
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,380
So now we have a M beat.

80
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,810
But if I change that to four,

81
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,800
I would actually get the full word lamb.

82
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,430
Okay,

83
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,280
to complete this,

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,320
we're gonna have a look at the mid function.

85
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,910
We don't actually need to use that for the capital ocean of the first letter,

86
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,950
but just for completeness,

87
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,760
we're gonna cover it.

88
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,660
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna say equals made,

89
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,680
and there is one extra argument here again,

90
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,640
we're gonna point to the text that we want us extract the middle from.

91
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,080
So again,

92
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,450
we're going to say D 11 here,

93
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,250
comma start number will be the number of characters in that you want to start from.

94
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,710
So if we wanted to extract had A from this,

95
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,810
we would say Mary has four letters.

96
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,170
We have a space that's five.

97
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,770
And we want to begin at the sixth letter,

98
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,990
which is the h So six on hand A has a h a d three letters,

99
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,950
a space for andan I,

100
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,680
which is five.

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,850
So come up number of characters to extract five and enter May go.

102
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,740
We extract had a no finally,

103
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,230
on one thing that we are going to need to do to capitalize.

104
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,220
The first letter is working out what the length of the string is.

105
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,380
So what we're gonna do is just copy that there,

106
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,330
copy and paste it in here.

107
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,410
And what we're gonna say is equal Len,

108
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,550
which is short for length.

109
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,210
They're just gonna point that sell close brackets Nager.

110
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,370
Many had little lamb has 22 characters.

111
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,390
So here we're going to build a complex formula.

112
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,150
It's going to capitalize the first letter.

113
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,900
So we're going to Firstly,

114
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,850
we're gonna utilize the left so we can say left.

115
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,260
We're gonna point here on groups and say the first character,

116
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,980
Intesa.

117
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,460
And there we have the M.

118
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,470
But what we want to do is make that upper case.

119
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,480
So we're gonna enclose all of that in upper case.

120
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,650
So now we get capital M.

121
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,960
That's capitalized our first letter.

122
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,440
Now what we need to do is return the rest of the string in lower case.

123
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,920
So what we're gonna do on Bear with me here?

124
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,250
We're going to say andi,

125
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,550
which is the equivalent of a can Katyn eight.

126
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,650
We're going to say Andi on,

127
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,520
we're going to say,

128
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,360
right,

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,750
we'll do this in stages Were going to say the right off this string just here,

130
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,160
comma on the number of characters is going to be the length of the whole string minus one

131
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,750
because we've already captured that first letter.

132
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:57,630
So we're going to say length of this string close of rackets minus one on down.

133
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,330
We're gonna close that off.

134
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,220
So that's going to give us.

135
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,020
Mary had a little lamb,

136
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,500
but let's imagine for a second that the lamb was also capitalized.

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,110
So now what we have is Mary had little.

138
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,090
And with a capital M in the capital,

139
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,250
l full leme.

140
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:21,890
So what we're going to do here is just wrap a lower around that west part of the formula.

141
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,940
So there we have the capitalized first letter and everything else in lower case.

142
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,570
Okay,

143
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,900
I hope that answers your question.

144
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,590
As always,

145
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,410
any others just post them in and I'll be happy to help.

146
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,350
Have a great day
