1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,330
Okay,

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:05,790
guys,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,090
First things first.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,710
We need to open Excel so we can begin to learn about it.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:10,970
Now,

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,750
I find that the easiest method to do this is to have a short cut on your desktop already.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,010
Now I have one just here called Excel 2013.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,410
If you have one of these,

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,390
fantastic.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,530
Just hover over it.

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,170
Double click your left mouse button and you're good to go.

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,970
If you don't have one of those,

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,560
Don't worry.

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,260
I'm gonna show you how to add one to your desktop shortly,

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,440
right.

16
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,760
Method number two.

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,330
Now,

18
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,410
if you already have a workbook that someone has sent you,

19
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,280
the simplest method is so literally just double click on the icon of that workbook.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,210
You can see we have one down here that I have cleverly prepared earlier.

21
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,860
So if we double click this Excel file,

22
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,250
which is called a workbook,

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,650
Excel will automatically open and it will open that particular file.

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,580
The third way to Open Excel is using your start button.

25
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,880
So if you come down here to your start button left,

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,020
click your mouse button,

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,020
you may well find that you have Excel already appearing in this first menu here.

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,670
If you don't don't worry.

29
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,290
The more times you open excel,

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,720
the higher up this list that will become so if it's not there in the moment.

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,750
Don't worry about it.

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,850
It will be soon now method for also from the start menu.

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,710
If you If you didn't see excel in here,

34
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,410
don't worry.

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,740
You can always go to the all programs.

36
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,570
Let's go back a little.

37
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,220
You can go to all programs left.

38
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,440
Click and you'll find a little folder called Microsoft Office 2013.

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,320
Yours may say 2010 or at major same Microsoft office.

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,690
If you left click this folder,

41
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,600
it will expand and show you all the programs that you currently have installed in the

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,510
office suite.

43
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,320
Just go down to excel.

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,290
Double click with your left mouse.

45
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,190
Andi Excel will open for you now.

46
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,950
I did mention that if you didn't have a desktop short cuts already,

47
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,470
I would show you a Tad one.

48
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,050
We're going to do that right now.

49
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,250
So while you are hovering over Excel and it's highlighted,

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,550
click your right mouse button.

51
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,700
Choose send to choose desktop,

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,200
create short cut left click and then when we moved the menu.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,770
We'll see.

54
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,790
We have a shortcut icon for Excel there.

55
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,330
Now,

56
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:27,550
this is called on my screen Excel 2013 to the reason for that being that I already have

57
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,450
Excel 2030 in there.

58
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,440
Don't worry about the name of it.

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
If you hover over the icon,

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,740
right click,

61
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,960
choose rename.

62
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,980
You can call it anything you want from there.

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,460
So that's called in Excel Press enter.

64
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:40,990
And there you go.

65
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,890
You have a desktop.

66
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,390
I come.

67
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,890
Okay,

68
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,760
The final method,

69
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,640
if none of those have work for you yet is again using your start menu.

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,530
But this time we're going to choose the search programs and files.

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,420
So if you click your left mess button in there so you get a little blinking cursor on tell

72
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,690
effects cell the it will go away,

73
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,520
and it will find everything that references excel in your computer.

74
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,730
So you're gonna be looking under programs and you'll click it.

75
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,880
You'll find Excel listed just there.

76
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,550
Okay,

77
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,650
So let's open Excel.

78
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,490
We can go to our desktop short cut or our newly created desktop short cut double click,

79
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,470
and you'll be presented with screen that looks very much like this now,

80
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,320
in order to learn about the anatomy of a workbook,

81
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,030
We're just gonna choose blank workbook for now,

82
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,120
so hover over it.

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,220
So it's highlighted.

84
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,490
Double click with your left mouse button.

85
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,230
Andi,

86
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,260
you'll be presented with screen that looks very much like this.

87
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,580
Okay,

88
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,090
next,

89
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,970
we're going to cover all of the main areas of this screen and what they do.
