1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
right,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,300
Let's take a quick look it alignment now at the moment,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,460
just so it's clear what change in the alignment settings does.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,480
I've made column F wider than the other columns,

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,150
and I made Row three taller than the other columns.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,190
Xolo shy to help us as much as it can by using its default settings.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,840
Now it does this very cleverly when it comes to entering data in cells by looking at the

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,440
data type and automatically apply in the appropriate format.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,150
So for text,

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,980
it is always aligned to the left hand side of the sell by default.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,410
So we just talked some texting.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:35,930
Hey,

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,440
center,

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,190
we can see that it's on the far left hand side of the South.

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,250
Okay.

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,080
Similarly,

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,470
if we talked to number in,

18
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,660
although at the moment it's appearing on the left hand side of the cell,

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,130
assumes we hit Enter Excel will work out that it's actually a number on a line it to the

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,850
right hand side of the South.

21
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,810
These is the default settings,

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,370
but don't worry.

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,370
We can have the we can have the text appearing wherever we want in the cell and the way

24
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,590
we're going to do that is by looking at the home ribbon on the alignment section.

25
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,260
Just here.

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,810
Notice that the only option that selected by default is the bottom line,

27
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,990
Which is this highlighted?

28
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,250
One.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,910
Just here.

30
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,660
Now we may as well go across the top while we're here,

31
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,760
so if we click the next button across the middle line,

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,200
you can see the text jumps up to the middle.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,420
If we choose the next one across top,

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,900
ally moves to the top on below that we're dealing with the horizontal axis so we can move

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,970
over to the left.

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,520
We can have it in the center,

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,200
or we can move it over to the right again if we want to.

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,910
Text to appear dead center.

39
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:41,340
Just select center from the bottom and middle from the top and their text appears in the

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,880
center.

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,580
Okay,

42
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,930
let's go back over to the right.

43
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,430
Let's leave it there now.

44
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,250
At the moment,

45
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,570
you'll see that writer line has been highlighted.

46
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,980
So what that means is that we have just overridden the automatic default settings that

47
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,780
excel would normally apply.

48
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,890
So here,

49
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,460
if we type some text in normally,

50
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,300
it would leap over.

51
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,590
So the left hand side.

52
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,350
But no,

53
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,930
because we've overridden that default setting,

54
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,810
it's staying on the right hand side.

55
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,510
So that's the way to tell if you've actually selected the format or if it's the default.

56
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,950
If it's if all of these three are not highlighted,

57
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,600
you'll get the default options.

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,930
If you've highlighted one that will override your default,

59
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,850
okay,

60
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,810
that's how you change that use in the home ribbon on the alignment section.

61
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,200
The other two methods are exactly the same we talked about when we learned has a format of

62
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,660
found.

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,570
We have the right click option.

64
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:39,170
So click in the cell right click Choose Format sells the format cells box pops up on select

65
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,520
the alignment tab if it isn't already selected,

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,260
and you get mostly the same options here is.

67
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,650
Well,

68
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,550
I'm just gonna close that on.

69
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,530
You'll recall that the short cut to get to that is this little icon just up the corner here

70
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:52,530
,

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,000
which,

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,620
if you left click causes the same box to open,

73
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,860
have a play around with the different sentence.

74
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,950
Have a lot of fun,

75
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,180
as much fun as you can have with a line in text in cells,

76
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,650
and I'll see you in the next lecture
