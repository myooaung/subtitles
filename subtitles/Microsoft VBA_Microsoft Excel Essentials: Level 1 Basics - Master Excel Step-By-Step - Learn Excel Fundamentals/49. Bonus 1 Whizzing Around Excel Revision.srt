1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
Okay,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,010
guys,

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,370
welcome to part one of the bonus section.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,690
And in this lecture,

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,910
we're gonna have a look at how you was around Excel like a ninja.

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,050
No.

7
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,300
One of the first things that we looked at was the ribbon,

8
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,900
which is this area at the top of the screen just here.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,460
And you'll recall from earlier in the course to navigate between the different sections of

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,000
the ribbon.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We just hovered over each of the names and we would left click to get to insert would move

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,890
over with our mouths with left click to get to page layouts.

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,830
The same with formula.

14
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,680
Same with day to same with review.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,050
But there's an even faster way of doing this.

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,520
If you're looking of toe,

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,220
have one of those,

18
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,720
most with scroll wheel.

19
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,150
Just hover your mouse cursor anywhere within the ribbon on with your scroll wheel just

20
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,190
rolled down,

21
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,980
and you'll find that your move over one ribbon to the right,

22
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,730
and if you keep rolling,

23
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,090
you can keep rolling and you'll get all the way over to the right.

24
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,450
So I'm just moving one click with the wheel each time to move over one ribbon to the right

25
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:58,450
.

26
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,150
If you roll upwards,

27
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,520
you'll move over one to the left.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,310
If you want to move over multiple,

29
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,350
just give it a quick roll and you can scroll through all of the different ribbons.

30
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,830
That's one very quick way of navigating the ribbons.

31
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,400
If you couldn't be bothered with the point and click method,

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,300
Okay,

33
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,750
so there's your first tip.

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,180
Use your most wheel to scroll through the ribbons.

35
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,050
Superfast.

36
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,350
Okay,

37
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,610
the next thing we're gonna look at is how you navigate your way around this data table.

38
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,540
Now we know that we can instantly click on each cell by just left,

39
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,920
clicking it and getting around.

40
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,550
But let's imagine we want to get from here all the way over to here.

41
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,910
What we could do is just left click.

42
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,800
But you need fairly good marriage control to instantly do that,

43
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,840
which I'm sure you have.

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,780
But there are quicker ways you can hit the control button and hit your right arrow to

45
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,190
immediately go to the end of your data set.

46
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:55,010
You can also it the control arrow and hit the left to come right the way over to your left

47
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,010
.

48
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,890
Most column.

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,850
You can hold down the control and hit the up arrow to go to the top of your data set.

50
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,250
Or you can hit the control on the down arrow to go to the bottom of your data set.

51
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,790
That's a very quick way to immediately get to the far right,

52
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,050
the far left the top or the bottom of a particular day to set.

53
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,290
Now there's another way of doing this that I've only just learned about.

54
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,040
If you look closely,

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,650
you'll see that this sow has a green line around it now to move immediately to the top.

56
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,040
If you just hover on the top section of that bar,

57
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,740
you can see that the curse has changed.

58
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,380
Just double click with the left mouse button and you immediately go to the top.

59
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,530
And similarly,

60
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,950
if you just hover over the bottom line until the curse of changes,

61
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,240
double click.

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,980
You can see that your cursor immediately dashes down to the bottom of your data table.

63
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,830
Similarly,

64
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,630
if you click on the right hand side,

65
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,250
double click it was is over to the far right,

66
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,320
and if you have her on the left downside till the curse changes,

67
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,210
double click and you immediately zap over to the far left column.

68
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,280
Okay,

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,470
if you're anywhere in your data set and you want to get back to your home,

70
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,590
sell your home.

71
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,050
Sell is the top left hand corner of your data.

72
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:12,050
Just hit control and home on your keyboard on that will immediately wish you back up to

73
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,780
your home.

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,350
Sell.

75
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,400
Okay,

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,660
so that's how you move around the spreadsheet very,

77
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,470
very quickly.

78
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,260
Okay.

79
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,910
If we've got a large data set,

80
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,650
we may want to move down more than one wrote a time,

81
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,670
which is what we do when we hit the down arrow.

82
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,100
But and But sometimes you may want to move down an entire page at the time,

83
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,710
and that's really quick to do.

84
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,980
All you do is hit the page down button on your keyboard to move down a complete page at a

85
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,390
time.

86
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,930
So if I paid job,

87
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,210
I can go back up and see that we have visibility of lions five through 20 hit page down,

88
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,090
and now I can see lying 20.

89
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,750
So I can still see the bottom line of the data that was previously visible,

90
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,610
but no down to 35 so on and so forth is eight page down or page up.

91
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,010
Very useful if you have big data sets.

92
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,160
Okay,

93
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,720
so that's how we was around the table within this sheet.

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,450
But what if you wanted a quick way to flip between the different chiefs that we have Now we

95
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,550
know that we already have two sheets on this one.

96
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,460
We have sheet one on.

97
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,710
We have our charts on again looking like this.

98
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,720
A keyboard shortcut.

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,240
For that.

100
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,150
You just hold in your control button and hit page down.

101
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,040
So for every time you hold control and hit page down,

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,850
you'll move over one sheet to the right and similarly to move back.

103
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,970
Just hit control and page up and your turn the page back one.

104
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,120
So page up moves you to the left page down,

105
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,100
moves you to the right.

106
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,500
Just remember to hold down your control button.

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,680
So they go move to that page on,

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,050
Moved back to that page.

109
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,550
Okay.

110
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,040
Now,

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,680
if we wanted to highlight our entire range of data,

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,910
which is all of this here now?

113
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,950
Ex old defines a range of data.

114
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,430
If it's bordered by empty cells on,

115
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,130
we can see that we have empty cells all the way around this data set so we could left click

116
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,640
here,

117
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
dragged down to here,

118
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,990
and that's highlighted.

119
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,090
But there is a keyboard shortcut to instantly do that,

120
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,220
and that is control in a.

121
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,930
So if I hold them control and it's a you can see that that entire range has been

122
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,760
highlighted.

123
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,660
Now the easy way to remember control and a is that all begins with a so control and a

124
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,870
highlights all.

125
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,100
If you want to highlight the entire sheet,

126
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,650
you can hold down control and hit again,

127
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,830
and then the the selection will expand to cover the whole of the sheet.

128
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,420
Okay,

129
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,260
so it's just choose another self so control and a highlights all of your table control a

130
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,750
again highlights all of your sheet.

131
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,480
Just one more thing that I want to bring to your attention in this lecture,

132
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,890
and you'll remember when we used the format paint and that we copied the format in here.

133
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,660
We hit format painter on.

134
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,500
Then we copied the format in there.

135
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,480
But if you double click the format painter,

136
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,980
it retains the four matter that you've just copied until you hit the escape key.

137
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,260
So just to show you that I'm just going to randomly pick one of these cells which one sees

138
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,380
formatted differently to all of these.

139
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,160
I'm gonna double click the former painter,

140
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,740
and then I'm going to click there.

141
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,090
You see,

142
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,560
the formatting is being applied,

143
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,350
and you can see by the curse of the formatting is still being retained.

144
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,390
So I could click There,

145
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,810
There,

146
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,250
there,

147
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,810
there,

148
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,430
there,

149
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,850
There,

150
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,940
Anywhere I wanted to.

151
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,430
So if you have a bunch of data that you need to format in the same way,

152
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,870
but they're all over the place,

153
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,220
just double quick format pains that and it'll retain that format in until you click escape

154
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,220
.

155
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,790
Okay,

156
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,690
let me just undo all of that.

157
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,490
Hits escape on.

158
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,050
There you go.

159
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,770
That completes the first lecture in the next lecture.

160
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,030
We're gonna have a look at all the different keyboard shortcuts for cutting,

161
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,850
copying and all that kind of stuff.

162
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,490
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
