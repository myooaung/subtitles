00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
Okay,

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.790
guys,

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.150
welcome to the quick Review off the anatomy of a Workbook lecture.

4
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.570
Now the first thing you'll notice at the top center of the screen.

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.250
Just here is the Excel displays the name of our current workbook here.

6
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.560
Now,

7
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.910
you'll recall from that lecture that an excel file is referred to as a workbook.

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.450
And this is where you can see the name of the workbook you're currently working on.

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.760
Okay.

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.070
Moving over to the top left hand side of the screen,

11
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.850
we can see how quick access toolbar that's this area right here.

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.110
Now,

13
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.940
by default,

14
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.630
the quick access toolbar only displays a few icons.

15
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.070
We can see we have the Excel.

16
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.600
I come,

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450
we have the save icon,

18
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.400
which we can use to save our work.

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.560
We have the undo button,

20
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.530
which is very useful.

21
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.750
If you make a mistake when you're entering data or formulas on immediately to the right of

22
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.950
that,

23
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.470
we can see the redo button.

24
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.460
So if we decide that we actually liked what we just did and it wasn't a mistake after all,

25
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.010
just left,

26
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.480
click on the reader button on that will restore you to the state that you just undead.

27
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.160
From now moving over to the top right hand side of the screen,

28
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.980
you can see that we have five little icons.

29
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.560
Now.

30
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.700
It's worth remembering in Excel that whenever you hover over any particular icon,

31
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.880
a tool tip will appear just like this one here.

32
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.990
That gives you a clue as to what this Army can actually does.

33
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.760
Now,

34
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.290
if there is a keyboard shortcut that will also be displayed in the tool tip so we can see

35
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.970
here that the question mark is the Microsoft Excel help function.

36
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.550
And you can click on that any time you need help.

37
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.330
Next along,

38
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.690
we have the ribbon options you can left.

39
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.840
Click that auto,

40
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.470
hide the ribbon or show tab,

41
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.210
show tabs and commanders immediately to the right.

42
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.600
Of that,

43
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.090
we have the minimize button,

44
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.340
which,

45
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.110
if we left,

46
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.590
click without most will make this workbook disappeared and where toolbar at the bottom.

47
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.200
I'll just show you that now so we can click that we haven't lost their work.

48
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.150
It's still there.

49
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.410
Onda automatically weaken,

50
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.730
Weaken!

51
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.590
Just come down here to the toolbar,

52
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.450
hover over it without mouse.

53
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.760
We can either left click the little picture that's just popped up above the till bar or

54
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.330
double click.

55
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.860
The little icon in the toolbar on the workbook is fully restored.

56
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.390
Next to that,

57
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.520
we have the restored down and maximized.

58
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.400
But if we restore down,

59
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.250
you'll recall this shrinks excel so it doesn't occupy the full screen.

60
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.240
Andi,

61
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.370
immediately to the right of that is the close button on that closes Excel.

62
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.300
Don't worry if you hit that accidentally,

63
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.900
If you haven't saved your work,

64
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.830
it will give you an option to save your work before you actually close the file.

65
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.590
So you're not gonna lose any work at all.

66
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.350
Okay,

67
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.170
now onto the ribbon.

68
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.960
The ribbon is the place where you can go to find all the functions that you're going to use

69
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.670
most frequently their groups into different categories,

70
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.040
which you can see by the names of the tabs along the top There.

71
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.500
So we have file which will contain all the options relating to file,

72
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500
such as saving which we've covered,

73
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.310
and save as which we've also covered the home ribbon displays,

74
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.810
all the things that you're likely to use most often.

75
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.000
We also have insert page layout formulas at each of these contain things that are pertinent

76
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.560
to that particular title.

77
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.110
Now,

78
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.750
if you find that there is a particular function that you use in any of these ribbons and

79
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.480
you'd like to have instantly available,

80
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.880
we can always add that to the quick access to or by a little later on.

81
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.300
And we'll have a lecture that shows you just how to do that a little later in the course.

82
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.420
Okay,

83
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.130
immediately below the ribbon.

84
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.630
We have the formula bar,

85
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.470
and you'll recall that the Formula Bar is one of two places that we can end today to in

86
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.000
Excel became the main area of the workbook that we can see highlighted here is the

87
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.450
worksheet area,

88
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.690
and this is where we'll be doing most of our work in Excel and the word cheese area is made

89
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.650
up of multiple cells those of these little white rectangles that you can see just here.

90
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.370
You'll also remember that the cells are referred to by their column,

91
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.250
letter and row number so we can see here that the cell selected is I six.

92
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.060
Now that's pretty easy to see if we're working up the top left hand side of the work cheat

93
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.060
.

94
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.420
But if we work in way,

95
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.990
way over to the far side.

96
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.540
It becomes more difficult to see quickly,

97
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.300
which is why we have the name box just here,

98
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.850
which will instantly tell you which sell your in there to move around a workbook.

99
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.890
We can use the scroll bars on the far right hand side of the screen or the bottom right

100
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.170
hand side of our screen,

101
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.490
the right hander side scroll bar.

102
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.550
We can either left click to drag up and down.

103
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.980
We can click the little down arrow to move down.

104
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.350
One sat one row at a time,

105
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.500
the upper row to move one cell up at a time,

106
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.030
and to move left and right.

107
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.690
We can either use a scroll bar down the button just here,

108
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.020
or use the right hand arrow to move one column to the right or the left and arrow to move

109
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.420
one column to the left,

110
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.890
just below the left or right scroll bar.

111
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.000
We can see how zoom options now this will let us alter the number of cells that we can see

112
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.000
.

113
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.080
In our current view.

114
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.990
You can see at the moment we're at 100% but to increase this,

115
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.020
we hit the little plus button on the side there to increase our view so we can see less

116
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.350
cells or click in the other button the minus.

117
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.590
On the left hand side,

118
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.230
we can see more cells,

119
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.700
but that decreases our view.

120
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.870
Alternatively,

121
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.590
can hold this little bar here,

122
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.270
hover over it left.

123
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.430
Click with your mouse on dragon and abs until you get a view that you're happy with.

124
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.820
And finally we have a work sheet and we can see down here that we currently have one cheat

125
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.820
,

126
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.370
which is imaginatively named Sheet one on to add new sheets to my workbook.

127
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.590
We just left Click this little plus button just here,

128
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.950
and we can keep adding chiefs of the current workbook as many times as we want to.

129
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.130
So they go.

130
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.430
That's a quick review of the anatomy of a workbook.

131
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.170
Look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
