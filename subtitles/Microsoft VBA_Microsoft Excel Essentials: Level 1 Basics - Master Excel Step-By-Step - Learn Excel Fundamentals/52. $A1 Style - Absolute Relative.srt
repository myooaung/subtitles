1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
Okay,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:02,890
guys,

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,540
welcome back.

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,760
Never gonna have look at an absolute and relative cell reference.

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,630
That is one such as dollar A on day one.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,670
So what I've done is I've got a couple of columns of numbers in here morning and do is

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,920
write a simple formula that says equals this multiplied by this.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,700
But this time I'm going to do is his F four once,

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,710
and that gives us the absolute a absolute one.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,330
I'm gonna hit it again,

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,110
and then we get a absolute one,

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,730
and I'm gonna hit it 1/3 time.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,060
So this is F or three times,

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:46,230
and now we get absolute a one on What that's going to do is look all of our formulas when

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,380
we dragged them around.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,290
Two column A not necessarily lying one,

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,460
but it's gonna lock two column A.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,150
So let's just copy that down and we can see how that works.

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,410
So here,

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,920
when we hit,

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,930
have to we can see that we are multi playing,

22
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,940
be one which is relative relative to absolute,

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,430
a one on move down.

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,940
And it's doing exactly the same.

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,130
That pretty much looks like it did before,

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,960
but now you'll see when we copy that formula across that if we click in one of these at

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,370
random,

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,530
we're in some seriously big numbers over here.

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:30,380
What we have when we hit F to is that this cell has always stuck to column a so di three as

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,450
moved over as we've moved the formula.

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,850
But the second pass of the formula has been locked.

32
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,210
Two COLUMN A.

33
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:43,330
It will happily move down based on the line number so we can see here that we have absolute

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,490
a seven,

35
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,280
but it's always locked.

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,940
Two COLUMN A So they go.

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,450
If you type a dollar sign or hit F 43 times,

38
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,270
you will lock the column,

39
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,160
but not the rose.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,490
So you now have an absolute column reference on a relative row reference.

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,280
So they go.

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,270
That's what you do an absolute relative on.

43
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,420
You can probably guess what's coming in the next lecture,

44
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,640
but watch it through anyway and will cover the relative a absolute one.

45
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,050
I'll see you in the next lecture
