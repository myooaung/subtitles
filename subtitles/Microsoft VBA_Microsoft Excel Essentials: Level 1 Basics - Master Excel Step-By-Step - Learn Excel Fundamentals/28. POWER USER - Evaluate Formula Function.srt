1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
Okay,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,250
guys,

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,490
this later is the result of something that I learned only yesterday.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:07,670
Now,

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,960
I've been using Excel for 20 something years on.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,280
I've never even seen this function before,

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,660
but it's so useful.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,780
Had to squeeze it into the curriculum just so that you're aware of it.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,100
And it will really help to cement the electorate just on the order of mathematical

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,780
operation.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,740
Okay,

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,690
here goes.

13
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,450
Now what we're gonna use is a tool that I have I only discovered yesterday,

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,540
and you'll find it in the formulas ribbon.

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,460
So if you come up here to formulas just left click and this ribbon will open up now,

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,600
The formula we looked at in the order of mathematical operation was equal.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,060
Three plus three divided by two.

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,930
Okay,

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,910
so all we're gonna do is enter that formula in our cell on.

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,500
They were going to come up to the formula auditing section of the formulas Ribbon on.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,160
We're going to click,

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,550
evaluate formula.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,410
Let me just drag that into shot so I can ah,

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,280
consuming and you'll see clearly again.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,980
There this little window appears here on what this does is it will allow excel to walk you

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,770
through step by step every single part of your formula so you can see that Oh,

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,950
formula up here in the formula bar say's equals three plus three divided my to.

28
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,890
And if you look in the evaluation section of the evaluate formula box,

29
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,600
you can see that innocently Excel is underlined.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,380
Which part it's going to do first so you can see that it's gonna ignore the three plus for

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,000
the moment,

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
and it's underlined three divided by two.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,430
So now you can see instantly that that's the first part of the formula that's going to be

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,270
executed.

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,090
So let's go ahead and click the evaluating That's gonna left Click there,

36
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,370
and now you can see that it's changed the three divided by 2 to 1.5 because it's completed

37
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,750
that part of the formula.

38
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,550
And there we can see the wallets left with is three plus 1.5.

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,210
So if we click again,

40
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,170
they go on.

41
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,200
This is going to be 4.5 hit restart and it will go through it again.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,990
Okay,

43
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,140
now,

44
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,370
that's one way of doing it when we just use the values and what we're gonna do now,

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,540
rather than using a number in the cell.

46
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,990
We're gonna typo values into these cells here.

47
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,940
And then we're going to write a formula that references those middle That means is we're

48
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,750
going to click the cell rather than type the value in the formula.

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,500
So we're gonna type equals to tell Excel.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:40,670
It's a formula we're going to click that Plus that divided by that may be pressed to that

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,550
That plus that divided by that hit Enter Re select the cell and hit Evaluate formula.

52
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,350
Let me just move that down a little bit.

53
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,280
Okay,

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,500
Now,

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,780
let's quickly go through this right.

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,250
Okay,

57
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,670
Now,

58
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,530
because we didn't type of value into our formula,

59
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,270
such as three plus three,

60
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,310
divided by two.

61
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,190
And we use the cell references.

62
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,810
The very first thing that Excel needs to do is go to those cells and actually extract what

63
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,660
the value is.

64
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,140
So at the moment are formula,

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,550
Say's a one plus a two divided by a three.

66
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,270
Now we've got a new function that you can see in here,

67
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,030
which is called Step In and you can see that a one is underlying,

68
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,290
So the first thing excels going to do is retrieve the value from a one,

69
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,010
and if we hit stepping,

70
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:33,900
you can see that a one has been highlighted and it's being selected on our spreadsheet.

71
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,150
And it says that the value in a one is three.

72
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,610
Okay,

73
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,430
so step out.

74
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,460
If you want to step in,

75
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,310
that's what it does.

76
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,230
It will select the So it's just about to look at now.

77
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,290
You can see there that previously we had a one on.

78
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:47,490
No,

79
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,570
it says three,

80
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,270
cause it's retrieved the value there was going to take a look at a two.

81
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,050
So when we hit evaluate,

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,420
it will say in a two you have the value of three,

83
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,160
and finally it's going to have a look at a three to see what values in there.

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,500
So when we click evaluate,

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,540
it will say to and there is going to say OK,

86
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,340
I've retrieved all my values.

87
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,250
Now I'm gonna work on the formula itself and again,

88
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,490
just as it did before.

89
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,850
It's gonna look at the division part first,

90
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,980
so it's underlining three divided by two,

91
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,080
and when we click,

92
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,640
evaluated or calculate that and say three,

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,210
divided by two is 1.5 and they're the final part of my formula is toe.

94
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,980
Add three to that answer.

95
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,700
So when we hit evaluate,

96
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,760
they go 4.5.

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,550
That's how we get it.

98
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,770
And if you want to go through it again,

99
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,330
hit restart and just click your left mouse button on this button and it will go all the way

100
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,230
through and they go evaluate formula.

101
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,430
Very useful on gun.

102
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,640
I've missed it for as long as it's been in Excel,

103
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,370
but they go No,

104
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:46,950
you know bad.

105
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,930
It's enjoy.

106
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,210
See you in the next lecture.
