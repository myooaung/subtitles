00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
Okay,

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.640
guys,

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.570
we're progressing nicely now.

4
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.610
You may have noticed that all of our columns across the top here are all the same wits on

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.640
this with this perfectly fine when we look at words like item Monday,

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.460
Tuesday,

7
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.450
Friday and total because the words of fully visible Thursday just about scraping through

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.380
Wednesday completely hopeless because we've chopped off the last two letters.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.020
Now we have a couple of ways of re sizing the columns.

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.260
One method would be to hover over the letter right click with the old house,

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560
come down and choose column width,

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.430
and we can see that at the current column with this 8.43 If we were to just type 15 over,

13
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.490
that should be roughly twice as big on we can hit,

14
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.810
enter and they go.

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.260
All of column D is no being resized.

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.520
That looks much better,

17
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.150
but perhaps in their looks at just a little bit too white Now,

18
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.600
luckily,

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.510
Excel has a built in feature that makes this very simple to do for you.

20
00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.710
Currently,

21
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.190
if we because Wednesday looks too wide.

22
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.730
If we hover between columns D and E.

23
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.920
Until the cursor changes to this symbol here double click with your left mouse button.

24
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.590
Excel will look down the whole of Colin D and automatically resize to the most appropriate

25
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.150
width.

26
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.880
Okay,

27
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.660
so that's how you do.

28
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.300
One column.

29
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.050
It's time.

30
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.680
If you want to do two or three columns,

31
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.150
just literally left.

32
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.730
Click on the column heading.

33
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.580
Move over as many columns as you want to go.

34
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.090
Double click between any of these column letters,

35
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.180
and you can see that all of those columns have never been automatically re sized.

36
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.140
Okay,

37
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.620
so far,

38
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.250
so good.

39
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.660
There may be that you actually wants all of your columns to be the same wits,

40
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.930
but larger than the standard with which was 8.43 And the easy way to do that is to well,

41
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.270
first,

42
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.830
let's pick our widest column,

43
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.950
which is Wednesday.

44
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.420
We can right click,

45
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.050
choose column widths and see that we know a 10.86 Let's call it 11.

46
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.130
We can highlight columns,

47
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.080
a left clicking and dragging over two column G right click on any of the column Laissus

48
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.580
choose format wits column width.

49
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.960
Rather,

50
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.870
type 11 hits ends at they go now.

51
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.550
All of our columns automatically size to 11 and that looks much better.

52
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.920
So it's a personal choice thing,

53
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.540
whether you on your columns to be all a uniform size.

54
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.250
If you do,

55
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.810
just highlight all the columns.

56
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.050
Choose the column with that Smith most appropriate or alternatively,

57
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.550
if you want to have them size based on the wildest data that's in any particular Cullen,

58
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.550
you can just highlight all the columns and double click.

59
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.040
Or alternatively,

60
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.410
you can just click this let layer of the corner here on left click,

61
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.650
and that will highlight the entire worksheet.

62
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.570
And then again,

63
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.050
just double click between any of the column letters.

64
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.350
Onda Uh,

65
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.440
and everything is automatically resize for you.

66
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.270
It works exactly the same way with Rose.

67
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.970
That won't be visible at the moment because all of the data now rose looks pretty much OK.

68
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.480
Is it is.

69
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.490
It's exactly the same process toe.

70
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.270
Also the row height.

71
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.330
Just right.

72
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.450
Click on the number.

73
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.270
Come down,

74
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.360
choose row height.

75
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.810
Andi,

76
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.010
repeat the same process they go.

77
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.120
That almost looks really good,

78
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.900
but it looks a little odd because of out my fruit and Benschop title automatically.

79
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.810
Column A is being resized to fit my fruit and veg shop but we have a very clever way of

80
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.020
getting rid of that problem,

81
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.400
too,

82
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.350
which will come to in the next lecture.
