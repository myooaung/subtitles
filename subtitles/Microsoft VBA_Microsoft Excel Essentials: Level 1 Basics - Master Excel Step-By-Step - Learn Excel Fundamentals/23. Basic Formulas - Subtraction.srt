1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
right.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,410
We're moving along at a great pace now.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:05,950
Now,

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,080
the next formula we're going to look at is subtraction,

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,670
and it's very simple to do.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,780
What we're gonna do is that two more columns to our data we're gonna add an opening stock

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:25,230
opening stock on we're then gonna add Are closing stock closing stock again.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,760
OK,

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,490
let's just resize those.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,370
We've done this before.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,700
Just highlight the columns.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,390
DoubleClick in between.

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,240
And I wish I could type closing stock.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,600
They go.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,610
Okay,

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:36,780
now,

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,220
I'm just gonna randomly make up some numbers here.

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,230
So let's imagine that we started the week with 75 of everything,

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,100
So I'm just going to hit 75 enter re select the Cell DoubleClick,

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,300
which we know Phil's down.

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,470
So they go there.

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,340
We know that opening stock waas,

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,390
and now it's time to do out subtraction formula never could do this in one of two ways.

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,480
What we could say is equals.

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:09,790
It's a formula that less that less that less that left that less that an enter to find out

26
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,540
that we would have 35 left,

27
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,750
is over close in stock,

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,870
and we can do it in a much quicker way by utilizing something that we've already done.

29
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,590
So what we can do is win type equals opening stock on as we've already worked out.

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,860
What the total of all of these are in this formula just here.

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,420
We're just going to say opening stock minus total sales hit,

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:35,910
Enter.

33
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,540
And there you go 35 on again to copy that formula down.

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,440
We're just going to double click when our cursor changes to the black Cross to fill down on

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,440
.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,990
There you go.

37
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,910
We can see that we started with 75 of each of our items and we ended with 35 apples,

38
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,380
40 oranges and so on and so forth all the way down just in case it wasn't obvious to you

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,870
Excel will automatically re calculate.

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,440
So if we look at oranges,

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,780
we can see that I open stock with 75 Andi,

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,710
Once we subtract all of ourselves,

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,810
we have 40 left.

44
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,700
If we change that to 50 in his enter,

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,250
you can see that this result has also changed.

46
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,370
So excel automatically Recalculates.

47
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,910
You don't have to do anything again.

48
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
It automatically works it'll for you.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,750
And they go nice and simple onto the next lecture
