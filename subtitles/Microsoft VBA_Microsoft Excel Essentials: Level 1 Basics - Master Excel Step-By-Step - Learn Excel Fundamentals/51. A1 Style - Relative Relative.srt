1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
Okay,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,050
guys,

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,970
Welcome back.

4
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,200
No.

5
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,860
In the next four lectures,

6
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:12,260
we're gonna have a look at all the variations of absolute and relative cell reference in No

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,260
,

8
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,560
I'm no.

9
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,050
At the moment,

10
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,850
that probably doesn't mean much to you,

11
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,380
but it will become clear as you work through these four short lectures.

12
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,910
So I've created this Excel file which you can download,

13
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,150
and you can see that we have four tubs.

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,330
We have a one which in technical terms is relative.

15
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,940
A relative one.

16
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,520
We have dollar sign,

17
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,870
a dollar sign,

18
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,440
one which would be read as an absolute,

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,140
a absolute one.

20
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,410
We have dollar sign a one which is absolute.

21
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,430
A relative one and a dollar sign.

22
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,170
One which is a relative A and an absolute one.

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,650
No,

24
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,020
don't worry.

25
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,390
If you don't understand what that means,

26
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,120
just that the moment the easiest way to understand this is watching in action.

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,320
And then it will become really clear.

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,060
Okay,

29
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,670
so let's begin with relative a relative one or otherwise just referred to as a one.

30
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,290
So island do is write a simple formula to multiply this figure by this figure,

31
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:16,190
and you can see when we hit F two that the Blue sell a three is being multiplied by the red

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,350
cell B three on hit.

33
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,860
Enter.

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,080
If I copy that formula down by using that short cut,

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,370
just double click in the drag handle on,

36
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,850
we come down to here and hit F two.

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,820
Now you can see that the cell references the A's and the B's have moved relative to the

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,740
formula that we've just copied down.

39
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:43,940
So we copied it down one cell on the cell references of both moved relatively down one cell

40
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,400
to.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,770
So before we had a three B three and then we hit enter,

42
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,840
and now they have moved in relatively.

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,050
So we have a four b four,

44
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,600
and then as we move down,

45
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,890
we can see that as we've dragged the formula,

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,450
each of the soul references has moved down relative to where the formula lies.

47
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,620
So that's a relative relative cell reference in the legs,

48
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,900
like you're gonna have a look at absolute cell reference.

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,410
Okay,

50
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll see you in the next lecture.
