1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
OK,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,230
guys.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,420
Now we're gonna have a look a rapping text and soft enters the You may not have come across

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,220
the term soft enter before,

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,060
but it's very simple what it does.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,010
Basically,

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,650
whenever you're in their cell in excel and you hit,

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,610
enter whatever you've talked in,

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,250
the cell is automatically stored to the cell and your cursor will move to the next cell.

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,620
But it could be that you want to stick in an extra line of data in there,

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,680
just like when you tell him a letter room word.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,240
The way to do that is through a soft return.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,990
Okay,

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,690
at the moment I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna hide these last three columns.

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,760
Just so when you download the file there Still,

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,550
they just unheard them by left clicking l on dragging over to pay,

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,560
choose right click on a new height.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,310
But for now,

19
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,360
I'm just gonna hide them.

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,870
I'm also going to copy over these two formulas here by hitting control and are okay.

21
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,460
Let's have a look at wrapping text.

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,870
First,

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,040
we can see that closing stock makes a cell a little too wide for the two digit data that we

24
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,250
have stored underneath.

25
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,390
So what we're gonna do is left click the soul to select it.

26
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,030
We're gonna hit right click and choose format cells.

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,050
It's just dragged round up to that.

28
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,720
Now,

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,740
if your alignment tab isn't selected,

30
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,240
just click.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,310
The alignments have,

32
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,290
and you can see them here that we have the option to wrap text.

33
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,440
Just go ahead and click that little tick box there.

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,680
Click OK.

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,000
And you can now see that if I squeeze that column a little narrower that the Texas

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,730
automatically wrapped so it no occupies two lines we can see in the formula bar that the

37
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,220
Texas exactly as it was.

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,890
We still have the word closing space and stock immediately after it.

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,530
But when we get the enter,

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,420
we can see that it's now allows us to narrow the columns.

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:43,860
Okay,

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,880
that's how you do a wrap text.

43
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,450
Then the other way to do it is to use a soft return,

44
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,760
and you can do this while you're actually entering the data.

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,610
So there are two ways to do it.

46
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,340
We can either edit directly in the cell or edit in the formula bar.

47
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,330
I'm going to show you the formula bar first,

48
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,380
So I'm just going to click before the D on a hit backspace.

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,780
So I have no space.

50
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,910
Then I'm gonna hit old and enter.

51
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,480
No,

52
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,930
don't worry.

53
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,910
If you can't see what's happening in the formula bar,

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm just going to drag it down.

55
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,210
So if I just hover the bottom of the formula,

56
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,670
Bartle,

57
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,770
the curse of changes left,

58
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,290
click on,

59
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,190
drank down.

60
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,150
We can see that we've made the formula bar a little larger.

61
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,590
But now I'm gonna click before sales hit backspace his old and enter.

62
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,960
And now you can see in the formula bar that what we actually have is average a new line

63
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,660
daily.

64
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,010
A new line sales No.

65
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,940
When a center,

66
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,930
you can see that.

67
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,540
That's actually now move the data into three separate ones within the same cell.

68
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,990
And just to resize,

69
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,490
I'm just gonna hover between till the curse of changes.

70
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,270
Double click on Diego.

71
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,260
Never that looks much more appropriate for the width of the data that we have.

72
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,450
The second way to do it is to edit it directly in the cell.

73
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,790
So I'm gonna do monthly sales this time when they hit F two to lowers 20.

74
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,450
The data.

75
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm just gonna move my cursor in there.

76
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,630
Hit the backspace.

77
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,010
Hold bolt press enter.

78
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,790
And no,

79
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,860
You can see that monthly sales has become two separate lines,

80
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,960
which is reflected in the formula bar just up here.

81
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,630
Okay.

82
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,110
No one in the center resource column automatically.

83
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,300
Like clicking between K and L.

84
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,170
And they go l columns air more appropriate wits based on the data that sits underneath.

85
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,390
Um,

86
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,330
the only thing missing now is that we have this text lying on the bottom.

87
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,080
Andi,

88
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,440
this text of here moving open,

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,010
open up.

90
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,730
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna highlight all of those I'm going to,

91
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,160
right.

92
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,260
Click choose format.

93
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,460
Andi,

94
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,370
I am going to say in the vertical plane center,

95
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,650
and it's OK.

96
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,050
And there you go.

97
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,400
That looks a little bit cleaner.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,980
Okay.

99
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,170
See you in the next lecture.
