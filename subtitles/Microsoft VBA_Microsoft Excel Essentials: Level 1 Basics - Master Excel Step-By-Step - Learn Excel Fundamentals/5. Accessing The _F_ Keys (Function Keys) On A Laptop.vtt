00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Okay,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.780
guys.

3
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.680
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.000
Now,

5
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.250
this is gonna be a very quick lecture.

6
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.620
At some point throughout this course,

7
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.180
I'm gonna I'm gonna be referring to function keys or F keys on.

8
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.050
I know that some people struggle if you're working on a laptop.

9
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.130
So if you're working on the laptop,

10
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.500
you access the function keys by pressing and holding down the F N key.

11
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.250
That's this one here.

12
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.390
Eso press and hold that and then hit the buttons across the top that say F one F two after

13
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.180
a away through nice and simple.

14
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.650
So if you're on a laptop or you have one of these jazzy keyboards like I'm using,

15
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.010
just look down the bottom left hand side for the F m key press and hold that and then hit

16
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.100
the F keys across the top of the keyboard.

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.850
Okay,

18
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.650
I'll see you in the next lecture.
