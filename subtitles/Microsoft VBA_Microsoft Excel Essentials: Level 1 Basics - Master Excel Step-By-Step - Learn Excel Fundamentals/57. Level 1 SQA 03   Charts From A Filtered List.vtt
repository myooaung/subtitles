00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
Okay,

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.660
guys.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.350
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.560
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.050
Lecture.

6
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.760
Now,

7
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.750
this question comes from offer from what are for asks is is it possible to make a chart

8
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.630
from filtered data?

9
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.340
And yes,

10
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.280
it certainly is.

11
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.080
And you can you can grab this file.

12
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.750
It's called Level one Sq.

13
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.910
A three student questions answered.

14
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.150
Three charts from a filter list.

15
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.860
This is just data that I've ripped straight out of level one Onda.

16
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.640
What I'm gonna do is I'm just going to click line for and get that filter in there,

17
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.000
Some coming over to sort and filter from the home ribbon.

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.100
Choose filter Nager.

19
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.480
You can see that we've got all of our filters applied.

20
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.050
So here we can select anything.

21
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.940
I realize that slightly over two shots.

22
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.730
So what will induce click select all which once elects everything?

23
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.120
I'm just gonna pick every other one for the 1st 3 Someone say apple,

24
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.510
celery and cucumbers it slightly off screen brown clicking.

25
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.230
OK,

26
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.160
so they go.

27
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.210
You can see that just got out apples,

28
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.150
celery and cucumber selected.

29
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.630
The next thing I'm gonna do is select all the data,

30
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.080
including the heavens that I'm gonna head on over to the insert menu.

31
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.540
I'm gonna come to recommended charts.

32
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.320
You can see that we have a bunch of recommended charts here.

33
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.510
And I'm just gonna pick this one at random and click,

34
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.090
OK?

35
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.850
And they go.

36
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.830
Now you concede that we have our chart,

37
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.200
and it's only detail in the apples,

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.180
celery and cucumbers,

39
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.650
Which is exactly what we've felt it too.

40
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.350
Now,

41
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.880
here you can see that we have opened Stop.

42
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.080
Monday,

43
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.400
Tuesday,

44
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.660
Wednesday,

45
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.020
Thursday,

46
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.330
Friday,

47
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.950
Saturday total close and stop monthly on average.

48
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.710
No,

49
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.510
it could be that.

50
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.660
You just want to see Monday,

51
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.060
Tuesday,

52
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.450
Wednesday,

53
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.810
Thursday,

54
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.410
and Friday.

55
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.870
So I'm just gonna delete that child for a second and show you something else.

56
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.490
What we're gonna do is we're gonna site item and drag down.

57
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.350
So I'm left Quicken and dragging down That gives me this range here.

58
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.940
Then I'm gonna hold down the control key on the highlight Monday through Saturday and again

59
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.110
damn to cucumbers.

60
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.620
So I held that I selected this left click drank down,

61
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.460
hold down the control key,

62
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.980
left,

63
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.330
click,

64
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.050
and drag over until I get all of that data.

65
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.550
Now,

66
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.510
I'm gonna come back to the insert menu back to recommended charts,

67
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.760
and I'm gonna choose a set chest started.

68
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.520
I'm gonna choose the same chart.

69
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.010
Type on when I click.

70
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.790
OK,

71
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.190
you can see that now we have most of the data,

72
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.160
but only the bits that we've actually selected so we can skip out the opening stock even

73
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.460
though it comes before Monday.

74
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.860
Tuesday,

75
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.180
Wednesday,

76
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.530
Thursday,

77
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.840
Friday,

78
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.450
Saturday,

79
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.410
and we've also missed the end bits of data.

80
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.210
So there you go.

81
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.430
You can see that we have apples and orange,

82
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.550
celery in yellow and cucumbers in green.

83
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.550
Hopefully,

84
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.120
that helps have a play around with it,

85
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.630
and you'll be amazed at what you can do.

86
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.510
As always.

87
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.530
If there are any questions,

88
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.350
do let me know,

89
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.250
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
