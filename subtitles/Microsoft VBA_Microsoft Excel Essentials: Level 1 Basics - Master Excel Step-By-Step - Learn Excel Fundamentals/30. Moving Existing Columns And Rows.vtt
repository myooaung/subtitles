00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Okay,

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.950
guys.

3
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.920
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.260
we looked at how to insert columns and rows into a spreadsheet,

5
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.490
and then we're gonna have a look at moving on existing column to a different position.

6
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.140
Okay,

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.290
now,

8
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.050
this is very,

9
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.100
very simple to do at the moment.

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.480
Our order goes Item.

11
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.980
Monday,

12
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.460
Tuesday,

13
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.820
Wednesday,

14
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.220
Thursday,

15
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.000
Friday Saturday total opening stock closing stop,

16
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.950
monthly sales and average sales.

17
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.630
But we may decide we want to see the opening stock at the beginning of the week,

18
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.910
So what we need to do is essentially move column I just here on inserted betweens,

19
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.140
columns A and B So it goes in the middle,

20
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.430
just here now.

21
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.970
It's very,

22
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.090
very simple to do.

23
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.670
All we're going to do is left Click The column heading for column I we're going to right

24
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.300
click on.

25
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.380
We're going to choose the option cuts.

26
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.480
So just left.

27
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.770
Click cut now because we want to move everything from column B groups,

28
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.210
everything from column B over to the right.

29
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.850
We're going to select column B.

30
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.800
We're going to right click on.

31
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.430
We're going to choose the option of insert cut cells just here by left clicking Now at the

32
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.940
moment we've now had a warning that's popped up to say that actually,

33
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.840
this operation will cost submerge cells toe emerge on.

34
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.490
The reason for this is you'll remember we've merged and sentido title just here.

35
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.210
So for now,

36
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.310
just click OK,

37
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.320
and you can see that now are opening.

38
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.290
Stock has moved from over here on is being inserted between columns A and columns.

39
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.950
See,

40
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.520
so that's exactly what we wanted to do.

41
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.490
But now this is no longer merged in center.

42
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.880
That's very easy to remedy.

43
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.040
X.

44
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.850
We've done it before.

45
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.130
You just left click cell a one drug over with the amounts to column D,

46
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.460
just like we did before.

47
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.020
Hit,

48
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.250
Merge in Center Again and hit left the line again.

49
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.140
And it's a simple is that that's how you move one column to a new position on your

50
00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.900
spreadsheet.

51
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.500
It's exactly the same process with Rose just left,

52
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.350
click the row.

53
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.130
You want to move,

54
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.200
so let's imagine we want to move Rude seven.

55
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.150
Left click to select it,

56
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.650
right click,

57
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.290
choose cut and then whatever you want to insert it,

58
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.700
let's say,

59
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.990
want to insert it there Just hit cut cells and they go.

60
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.980
You can see how bananas have moved on.

61
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.950
It's a simple is that I'll see you in the next lecture
