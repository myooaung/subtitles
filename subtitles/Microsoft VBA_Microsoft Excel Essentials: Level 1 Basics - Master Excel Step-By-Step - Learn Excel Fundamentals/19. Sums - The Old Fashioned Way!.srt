1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Okay,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,890
now we're going to get to what?

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,820
X elders.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,430
Best maths.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,630
Now Exhale has a number of built in functions to speed up entering formulas.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,530
At the moment,

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,650
we're going to start at the very beginning on do sums the old fashioned way.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,670
So we're going to come over to sell G five and just left click to select it.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,100
Now,

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,030
the first thing to remember whenever you enter a formula in Excel is it.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,560
It always begins with an equal sign.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,700
So if you hit equals on your keyboard instantly,

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,510
Excel will know that what you're entering is a formula,

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,350
and this is true for every single formula you'll ever enter in Excel.

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,430
Okay,

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,280
at the moment,

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,520
what we want to do is add up a total sales of Apple's for the week on Monday,

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,020
Tuesday,

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,460
Wednesday,

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,740
Thursday and Friday.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,550
So what we can do is just simply left Click the first entry,

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,810
and you can see that it's been highlighted with the dancing ants hit.

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,360
Plus,

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:09,500
we can move on most over click Tuesday hit plus move and those over Wednesday plus Thursday

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,280
plus Friday and hit Enter and you can see that it's cleverly total everything up.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,050
So that's how you do something old fashioned Way now.

27
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,270
One thing to notice.

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,870
With this,

29
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,400
if if I hit F two on my keyboard,

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,350
you can see that it shows us the formula rather than the result.

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,020
Now,

32
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,450
one thing to pay particular attention to I'll just move the mouse out.

33
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:39,250
The way here is that you can see that each of the cell references that is the B five,

34
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,610
c five,

35
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,820
d five,

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,950
e five and F five,

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,000
all highlighted in different colors,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,480
and they correspond to the colors that highlighted in the cells themselves.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,750
And then this is very useful because he makes it easy to spot which part of your formula is

40
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,390
referring to which sell.

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:00,910
So,

42
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,730
for example,

43
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,610
if we wanted to change D five,

44
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,630
we can instantly see that that it's kind of a purple color on.

45
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,650
We can see that this is a purple color.

46
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,160
Well,

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,200
if we have around most over until our cursor changes to this pointed cross,

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,290
we can left,

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,040
click and drag,

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,070
and you can see that I have formula is changing accordingly so we could move it over to the

51
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,420
left.

52
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,440
We can move it to the right,

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,640
we can move it anywhere.

54
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,630
So if for argument's sake,

55
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:37,290
we accidentally clicked the wrong cell and let's just hit Enter on DA and hit F two again,

56
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,160
we can see instantly by this highlight in that we've actually selected the wrong cell when

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,750
we typed her formula in.

58
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,370
So it's easy to correct,

59
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,960
rather than having to retire the entire formula,

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,240
just hover over the part that's incorrect because he should be adding up all of their apple

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,530
sales left.

62
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,540
Click drag up and you can see that your formula is being corrected.

63
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:58,880
Hit,

64
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,050
enter and they go.

65
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,650
And that's how you do a some the old fashioned way.

66
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,190
In the next lecture,

67
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,480
we will be covering how to use the auto some function.

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,380
See you in the next lecture.
