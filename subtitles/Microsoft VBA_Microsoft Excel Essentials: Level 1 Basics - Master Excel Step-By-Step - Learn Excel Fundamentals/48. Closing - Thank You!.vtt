00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.990
There will be level two,

17
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.430
which will be for intermediate and advanced users.

If you really want to supercharge your excel skills on level three will be be be a

19
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.950
programming.

20
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.460
And this goes way beyond the simple recording of macros,

21
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.930

22
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.400

28
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.120
And to that end of created the next section,

29
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.670
which is the bonus section to this part of the course,

30
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.770
which will give you some simple ways to remember all of the keyboard shortcuts.

31
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.480
