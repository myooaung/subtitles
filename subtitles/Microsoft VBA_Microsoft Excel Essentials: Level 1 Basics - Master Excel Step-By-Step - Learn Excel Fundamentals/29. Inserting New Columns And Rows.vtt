00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
Okay.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.450
I hope you enjoyed the last lecture.

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.400
And you now have a new understanding of the order of mathematical operation.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.200
For now,

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.780
we're gonna have a look at how we insert new columns,

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.760
a new rose into our data.

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.540
So far,

8
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.300
we've set up Oh,

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.650
spreadsheet for our fruit and veg shop.

10
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.070
And we can see that we're only selling on Monday,

11
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.470
Tuesday,

12
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.940
Wednesday,

13
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.140
Thursday and Friday.

14
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.450
But business is good on,

15
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.170
we know want to open on Saturday,

16
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.680
too.

17
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.860
So what we need to do is add a new common after Friday.

18
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.100
Now there are a few ways to do this.

19
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.490
Firstly,

20
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.650
we could click the column that we want to move over.

21
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.850
So we just left click the column heading of column G.

22
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.190
Because we want to move everything over to the right.

23
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.640
We can come up to the home ribbon and have a look at the cells section just here.

24
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.960
And you can see that we have inserts now on the little down arrow just below there.

25
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.650
If we left click,

26
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.080
we can see that we have different options.

27
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.920
And what we want to look at here is insert sheet columns and you can see that that has just

28
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.530
moved all of our data.

29
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440
One column over to the right.

30
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.820
I'm just gonna undo that for a second.

31
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.520
And I'm just going to hit the control and said to him,

32
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.250
Do which is a keyboard shortcut for undo?

33
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.170
Okay.

34
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.720
And the other way of doing it is again left Click the column heading of the first column

35
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.310
that you need to move over,

36
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.800
right click.

37
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.010
And you can see down here that we have insert on when we left.

38
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.000
Click that because we've highlighted the entire column,

39
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.550
it will move all the columns over to the right.

40
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.550
So there you go.

41
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.480
Now we can enter undated for Saturday.

42
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.370
So set day and again,

43
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.450
I'm just gonna make up some random numbers in here.

44
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.250
So it's a 12345657 eight on and the total is in the bottom.

45
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.090
Okay,

46
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.320
now,

47
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.780
because we need a total and we have our total in these cells here because I'm in the first

48
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.450
blank cell.

49
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.240
You'll remember that to copyright.

50
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.910
I just hit control on our on.

51
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.570
That formula gets copied across.

52
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.370
So they go.

53
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.020
Now we have managed to insert a new common.

54
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.390
We've re titled it.

55
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.380
And we've put in our sales data No time for a quick sanity check of the formulas we've

56
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.450
already entered.

57
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.900
Okay,

58
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.060
Now,

59
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.820
you'll remember that the first formula that we did was the total column.

60
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.670
Just here in column H.

61
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.530
So if we click on that formula and have a look up here in the formula bar,

62
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.360
we can see that it says some open brackets.

63
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.500
Be five to G five now.

64
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.580
Previously,

65
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940
it only looked as faras f five.

66
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.510
So because we've inserted a new cell excels automatically worked out that,

67
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.200
actually,

68
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.720
no,

69
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.110
I'm just gonna hit F two now.

70
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.860
You want to add everything,

71
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.450
including your new column,

72
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.600
which is great,

73
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.380
because that means we don't have to Where the seller for me I excel is automatically worked

74
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.640
out.

75
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.350
You probably want to include this in that formula that we did earlier.

76
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.260
So there you go.

77
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.380
If we have a look down there,

78
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.210
we can see the every one of them has corrected itself automatically.

79
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.450
Fantastic stuff.

80
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.760
Okay,

81
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.920
Opening stock was just a number s,

82
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.580
and that's not going to change our closing stock.

83
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.320
We I think.

84
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.570
Yeah,

85
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.260
we referenced the total.

86
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.690
So that's still good a monthly sales.

87
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.340
Let's just have look at their monthly sales.

88
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.670
I'm just gonna get after two.

89
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.580
Yes,

90
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.140
our monthly sales are still good,

91
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.930
cause we're just going to divide the total by four on our average daily sales.

92
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.510
Now,

93
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.640
this isn't good,

94
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.110
because at the moment,

95
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.820
what we've done is we've worked out the average using the divide formula on we divided by

96
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.460
five.

97
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.660
And because we had the number five Excel wouldn't know to update that to six.

98
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.840
Now,

99
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.950
we have six days of sales.

100
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.420
So what we're gonna have to do with this one is just come in left,

101
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.570
click delete five,

102
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.760
hit six,

103
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.410
and then copy that formula down when the cursor changes at the corner,

104
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.450
just double clicking.

105
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.260
So if you use numbers instead of cell references in your formulas,

106
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.150
always take a quick look at your formula to make sure it's still looking at the right data

107
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.150
.

108
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.100
Okay,

109
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.580
that's so you insert a column.

110
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.240
Now,

111
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.020
let's do the same thing for Rose.

112
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.200
Now,

113
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.440
what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a new fruit and veg because we're wild and

114
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.000
adventurous.

115
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.540
That way I'm not going to do is just hover over one of the road numbers,

116
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.350
right?

117
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.540
Click and hit insert.

118
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.860
They go in and say Everything's moved down.

119
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.830
And then what are we going to sell?

120
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.040
That we don't curl?

121
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.390
So sell pineapples,

122
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.940
pineapples,

123
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.340
and I saw,

124
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.510
like,

125
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.700
quite pineapples.

126
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.620
So they go pineapples and again,

127
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.360
we'll just make up some random numbers in here Friday on Saturday.

128
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.600
Now you can see that Excel is automatically added the same formula that we have there and

129
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.050
that right there and there,

130
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.670
and automatically worked out that you probably want that formula in there,

131
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.150
too,

132
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.160
so it's automatically written it in.

133
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.200
And if we hit F to weaken,

134
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.490
see,

135
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.210
absolutely.

136
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.250
It's looking at the right data opening stock didn't do that.

137
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.120
No,

138
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.030
because this is just a simple entry that is retyped to number.

139
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.960
It's not a formula.

140
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.200
Excel wouldn't know what value we wanted,

141
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.280
so we'll have to add that manually.

142
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.660
Now,

143
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.650
here's an interesting thing that I want you to have a look at notice that in this column

144
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.140
here we have a bunch of formulas and that this formula is in there.

145
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.520
This Fortner is in there,

146
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.950
but for the new road that we've inserted,

147
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.210
there's absolutely nothing in there at all?

148
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.850
Never.

149
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.930
We added an hour open in stock.

150
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.970
Watch what happens to this cell.

151
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.590
Just here.

152
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.530
Assumes we hit.

153
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.740
Enter they go.

154
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.360
Excels worked out because you have the same form urinal these cells.

155
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.020
Chances are you're probably gonna want it in that cell to,

156
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.600
and it will automatically add it in there for us and they go.

157
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.420
It's done exactly the same thing with the monthly sales.

158
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.490
It's exactly the same thing with the average cells.

159
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.110
So they get very simply.

160
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.560
That's how you insert new columns of data into your table,

161
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.870
a new rows of data into your table.

162
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.720
Just remember,

163
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.140
have a quick 70 check of any formulas by selecting them,

164
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.830
hitting F two and just having a look at the range of data that it's looking at and you're

165
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.500
good to go.

166
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.970
Okay,

167
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.150
see you in the next lecture.
