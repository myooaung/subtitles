00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.570
Okay,

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.090
guys,

3
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.350
we just talked about formatting text in the last lecture.

4
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.890
But just to be clear,

5
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.860
what we've actually done is formatted the properties off the cell itself.

6
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.610
So we had to play around with cell a one on.

7
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.130
We made the phones.

8
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:16.860
Let's have a look.

9
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.050
We made the phone green.

10
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.350
We increase the font size to 22.

11
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.430
We made it bold,

12
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.110
and it looks very good indeed them at the moment,

13
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.270
we just have text in that.

14
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.660
But because we formatted that cell rather than the text itself within the cell,

15
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.370
if we were to go and select the cell now an over type.

16
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.310
So let's say we just put a bunch of numbers in there.

17
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.340
1234 five.

18
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.160
You can see that the numbers,

19
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.340
despite the fact that it's no longer text,

20
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.200
it's now a different data type,

21
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.660
has retained the formatting that we just set for that cell specifically.

22
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.500
So just one thing to remember when you format a cell B number,

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.650
speed funds or anything at all,

24
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.900
the cell itself retains that format in,

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.690
So if you ever over type and you change the data type from text to numbers from numbers,

26
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.840
two dates or any combination of those.

27
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.280
The cell itself will retain that formatting until you change it.

28
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.450
They go Now let's move on to lining text.
