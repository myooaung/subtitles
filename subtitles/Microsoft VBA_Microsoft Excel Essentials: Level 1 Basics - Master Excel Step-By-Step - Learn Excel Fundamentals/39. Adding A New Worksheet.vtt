00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Okay,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.830
guys,

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.720
this is probably gonna be the shortest lecture in the entire course.

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.370
If we look down the bottom left hand side here,

5
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.720
we can see that we only have one worksheet in a workbook so far on what we're going to do

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.550
now is add a 2nd 1 So all I'm gonna do is come down to this little plus button left click,

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.790
and you can see that we now have sheet to They were going to use this in our next lecture

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.280
for creating a simple chart from the data that we already have.

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.440
What we're also going to do is rename the sheet to something more useful.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350
So all I'm gonna do is come down,

11
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.810
right Click.

12
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.610
I'm gonna choose rename and you can see that the text has been highlighted there.

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.690
So all I'm going to do is type the name of our new sheet has ever chart hit,

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.980
Enter on they go.

15
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.260
We've successfully renamed our sheet.

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.050
Okay.

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.750
I'm just gonna go back to sheet one by left clicking it.

18
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.800
Okay.

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.680
Very simple.

20
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.140

21
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.070
