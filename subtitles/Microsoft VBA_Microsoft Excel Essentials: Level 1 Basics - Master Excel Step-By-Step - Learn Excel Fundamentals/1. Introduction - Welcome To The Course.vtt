Hello.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.920
My name's Alan on the creator of this course,

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.960
Excel from zero to hero of level one for complete beginners.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.510
Now,

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.310
you may be wondering what qualifies me to teach Excel.

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.990
I've been using Excel since way back in 1993 when version fibers release on dive,

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.690
using practically every day since not only have I used it,

8
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.230
I've also taught others have to use it on.

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.730
Many of my students have gone on to gain promotion,

10
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.000
earned more money using the skills that they have land,

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.670
and some have gone to create their own businesses.

12
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.800
So what you gonna learn in this first course?

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.320
Well,

14
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.720
like all good things,

15
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.460
the Masters master the basics first,

16
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.800
and that's exactly what this course aims to do.

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.370

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.710
Now,

19
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.990
I'm not gonna assume that you understand anything about it at all at the moment,

20
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.820
So don't worry.

21
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.150
You will learn everything in detail.

22
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.690
Andi,

23
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.330
there's a difference between copying what someone else is doing and actually understanding

24
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.350
what it is that you're doing on understanding leads to master race of.

25
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.790
That's the aim of this course to give you complete mastery of all the basics and trust may

26
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.790
.

27
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.980
Many people have been using Excel for years.

28
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.090
In my experience,

29
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.180
don't have the basics mastered.

30
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.010

31
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920
