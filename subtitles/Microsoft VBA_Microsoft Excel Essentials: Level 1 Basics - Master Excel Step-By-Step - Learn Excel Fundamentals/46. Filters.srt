1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
OK,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,290
guys.

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,670
Now we're gonna have a look at what I think is one of the most useful features in Excel.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,140
Now,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,680
at the moment,

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,860
we can see all of our data because their data set is comparatively small.

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,170
Bruce,

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,690
we have a massive set a day to say 100 lines or 1000 lines or 10,000 lines.

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,970
A filter will come into its own.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,250
Now it's done easy to apply fills that.

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,980
What we're gonna do is apply it at line four.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,140
So it appears here between their title on our data set so long,

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,960
then do is left click line for come over to this area just like the corn.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,230
And then we've already used a sort function before.

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,050
And we've looked at the 1st 3 options that we're gonna pick the fourth option,

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,950
which is filter.

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,850
Now,

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,570
when I click off,

19
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,390
you'll notice that we have these little boxes that appeared on the sides of each of

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,190
ourselves.

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,960
And these are our filters.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,510
Now we're gonna do is I'm just going to click on it with the left most button,

23
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,800
and you can see that all of their data has shown down here.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,310
So all of their fruits and vegetables have appeared.

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,910
They're One thing to note is that we know that we have two entries for coconuts,

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,990
but coconuts only appears once in the list.

27
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,020
Now that's because it filters out any duplicates.

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,080
So if I were to just want to see coconuts,

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,480
I can just left Click the select all,

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,410
which then blanks all of our data on re select Coconuts by Left Click in,

31
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,110
which takes it.

32
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,160
Click OK and they go.

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,220
You can see that all of our other sales have been hidden away,

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,350
and we're only showing our coconuts.

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,070
That sounds wrong.

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,150
Okay,

37
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,870
so let me just click that re select all.

38
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,080
And obviously you can pick any combination.

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,910
These So if we wanted to show everything except bananas on cucumbers,

40
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,080
just click bananas on click cucumbers.

41
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,840
Click OK on a go,

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,290
we can see all of their data.

43
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,480
Except for those two items,

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,170
you can have multiple filters applied,

45
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,600
so at the moment we have a filter over in column A there.

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,040
We may also want to filter out column D Tuesday,

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,090
we may say,

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,500
actually,

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,590
we just want to say anything that we sold 10 off,

50
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,230
so let's just select everything click 10.

51
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,620
So,

52
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,970
no,

53
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,770
we can see that those particular items have been filtered out on.

54
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,650
We're only showing items that we sold 10 off on Tuesday.

55
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,270
Now,

56
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,790
a very quick way to find out if you have any filters applied is to look at the road numbers

57
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:25,790
.

58
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,880
Now you'll notice that most of the Rhone,

59
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,100
um,

60
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,450
has just appear in normal black funds.

61
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,470
But where we have a filter applied,

62
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,350
you'll notice that the row numbers have gone blue.

63
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,800
Now that tells you instantly that you have a filter applied,

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,360
netted to find out which columns you have filters on.

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,980
If you have a look at the Icahn,

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,640
you'll know sis that the ones with filters applied have the little filter picture within

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,910
the ICOM itself.

68
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,090
There's a very quick way of removing all the filters that you have applied,

69
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,630
and that's to come back over to the sort and filter option just up here and hit the clear

70
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,190
option.

71
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,510
So when I hit clear,

72
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,270
you can see that all of their filters have been removed.

73
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,140
But we still have the option to filter on here because,

74
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,950
although likens air around now,

75
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,100
if we're talking about numbers,

76
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,040
it may be useful to find out what your top sellers are on locally.

77
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,860
We can also do that within the filter.

78
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,550
So I'm just going to click Friday.

79
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:27,930
You can see that our sales are either 012356 or seven Never going to this option just here

80
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:27,930
.

81
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,860
We can see that we have a bunch of other different options so surprisingly,

82
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,090
if you left clicked equals you would get the equal.

83
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,930
So you could say equals 10th and they go.

84
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,130
We have nothing with 10 sales on that particular day.

85
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,820
So let's click.

86
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,160
All we could say does not equal one.

87
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,720
Funnily enough,

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,160
that will display anything that does not equal whatever value we have on.

89
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,250
We also have our top 10.

90
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,110
No,

91
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,950
let's just say we want to see our top two items.

92
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,160
Let's just scroll then.

93
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,940
So we get to top to hit OK and they go our top two sellers on a Friday.

94
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,690
We're bananas and cucumbers because we sold seven of each of those items.

95
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,960
If we just select all again at up to settlers,

96
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,070
did have seven items sold.

97
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,880
Okay,

98
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,420
we can also let's just asset,

99
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,700
select all you could also look for any cells that above the average for that column.

100
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,310
So just left click above average on all of these sales for these items were above the

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,710
average for that day,

102
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,110
and equally if we wanted to have a look and everything that was below average,

103
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,480
we can just click below average.

104
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,960
And these are all the items below the average sales for that day that we can also create

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,440
our own custom fills that by choosing this option just here.

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,550
So if we click custom Filter,

107
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:55,900
what we could say is we actually want it to be greater than on Let's say to Onda,

108
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,810
We also want it to be less than six.

109
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,520
Let's say so here.

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,980
The thing to note is that we want Andi.

111
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,260
So this is going to show everything that is greater than two on and is less than six.

112
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,750
Okay,

113
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,020
so they go.

114
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,570
We can no see that Fire 553 on two.

115
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,990
Indeed,

116
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,190
Fit that criteria.

117
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,810
Okay,

118
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,560
clear fields from column G.

119
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,730
On they go.

120
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,400
You can have any combination,

121
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,010
as I say,

122
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,040
so you can fill trade anything that begins with Let's have a look.

123
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,320
A text filters create a custom filter.

124
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,720
We can say anything that begins with C on click.

125
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,310
Ok,

126
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:48,220
And then we can only see our items that have see in it We could say anything that's custom

127
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:58,660
fills there ends with on s so anything that ends with s so they go We can see Apple's been

128
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,420
honest Coconut,

129
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,120
cucumbers,

130
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,700
oranges,

131
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,950
plums and tomatoes All end with s And anything that didn't end with this has been filtered

132
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,930
out from our view.

133
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,550
Okay,

134
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,190
let's just go ahead on clear all of those filters and they go have a play around the

135
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,640
filters.

136
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,590
You'll find it's very,

137
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,260
very useful,

138
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,970
particularly when you're dealing with large data sets on.

139
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,350
I'll see you in the next lecture.
