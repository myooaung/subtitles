1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,090
Okay,

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,410
guys,

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,350
let's have a look in there.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,660
We adapt the auto,

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,760
some function that we've already used to work out the sum of a row of data.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,320
Now,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,820
at the moment in these cells,

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,980
we still have the old fashioned formula of this cell.

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,790
Plus that sell.

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,260
Plus that sell plus outsell.

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,590
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to delete that so we can start a fresh now if we

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,570
take a quick look at the auto some function,

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,620
the formula that was written for is automatically when we used auto some we can see that

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,840
the structure of the formula is the equal sign.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,180
Which means it's a formula.

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,540
The function name,

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,690
which is some the brackets that open the range that we want to some on the brackets to

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,180
close off the arguments.

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,650
Okay,

20
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,940
What we're gonna do is we're gonna copy that,

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,430
and we're going to use it over the side here.

22
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,850
No one quick way of doing this is if you come up to the formula bar and delete the equal

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,780
sign hit enter.

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,620
You can see that no excel is treated.

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,050
This not as a formula,

26
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,570
but it's a string that is It's just letters and numbers.

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,270
OK,

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,400
so now we've done that,

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,090
we can easily refer back to it so we can copy it.

30
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,780
Okay,

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,400
so we're gonna come up here and we're gonna type equals because it's a formula that we're

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,990
entering.

33
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,910
We're gonna type some because we can see here that the function iss some.

34
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,170
We're going to copy that cell again by entering a bracket on.

35
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,380
Then we can see that we have excels tool tip that tells us what we need to enter next is a

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,070
number than a comma,

37
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,300
then a number than a comma,

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,730
so we could do it that way.

39
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,130
Let's just do it that way for a second.

40
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,840
So if we hit that and hit comma,

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,060
you can see that number one has been highlighted in the tool tip.

42
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,010
When I hit comma the tools it will expand and say no,

43
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,430
you need to enter number two.

44
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,520
So if I left click the second cell hit comma,

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,850
it will then say number three and on and on and on.

46
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,890
We're not going to do that because that's almost the same as the long way of doing it.

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,400
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna highlight the range that we want to made up.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,950
So I'm gonna left click on Selby five,

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,710
keep my mess but impressed on drag over to Friday.

50
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,590
So now we can see that the format of the formula is being copied so we can see down the

51
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,220
bottom that we have some open brackets arrange and closed brackets.

52
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,940
So all we need to do now is let go The left mouse button hit,

53
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,480
shift closed.

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,800
Brackets hit,

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,270
Enter And there you go.

56
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,450
We now have over some affording.

57
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,980
Now let me just come back down here and reinsert are equal sign They go So now we have a

58
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,780
formula down the bottom And as we learned in the last lecture just to quickly copy that

59
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,050
down hover over the corner to the drag handle to you curse the changes to the black cross.

60
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,380
Double click and they go,

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,640
we know know our total sales for each of our fruits and veggies on.

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
We also know actually a better put tight total in the boat.

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,740
Nasa.

64
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,400
We know what it is,

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,240
and we also know the total of our sales for the date by items.

66
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,210
So there you go.

67
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,200
That's how you adapt on auto some from a column and use it in a row.

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,780
See you in the next lecture.
