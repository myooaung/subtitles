1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
Okay,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,530
guys,

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,880
shortly we're going to be entering the headings for all of our data.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,240
But before we do that,

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
I'm going to show you a neat trick in Excel.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,380
It's gonna make your life a lot simpler.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,220
I mentioned a little earlier that Excel does whatever it can to help you on one of the ways

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,630
it does.

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,220
This is by auto filling sequences.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,630
I can best demonstrate this by actually showing you how it does it.

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:32,580
So if we would type Monday into any one of our cells and hit enter when we go back up to

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,180
the cell that say's Monday,

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,910
If you look very closely at the bottom right hand corner,

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,590
you can see this little block.

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,950
If you have your cursor over there,

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,960
you can see that the curse of changes.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,080
If you left,

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,260
click your mouse button there and drag across,

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,120
you can see that it automatically works out that the sequence should probably be the days

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,650
of the week,

21
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,060
and similarly,

22
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,700
we can also go this way on dragged down one day Tuesday,

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,990
Wednesday,

24
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,340
Thursday,

25
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,850
Friday,

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,050
and as soon as you let go of your left mouse,

27
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,960
it automatically populates the sequence for you.

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,910
This will save you a lot of time having to type in Monday,

29
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,270
Tuesday,

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,630
Wednesday,

31
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,050
Thursday,

32
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,500
Friday,

33
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,750
and so on and so forth.

34
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,210
Okay,

35
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,310
let's just delete these just here.

36
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,950
I'm just highlight and then hitting delete on the keyboard,

37
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,910
so you'll notice that I typed Monday in full.

38
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,170
If I would just hope just mum and come back up to the cell and again go to this little box

39
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,870
at the corner,

40
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,590
wait till the cat cursor changes left,

41
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,160
click and drag down.

42
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,640
You can now see that it's also populated the sequence automatically,

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,830
but because I abbreviated Monday,

44
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,570
two months,

45
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,670
it's automatically abbreviated Tuesday to chew Wednesday toe when?

46
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,180
Thursday to Fu on DSO one and so forth.

47
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,600
Okay,

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,530
so we know it could do the days of the week.

49
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,070
Let's come over here if you were to type,

50
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,830
not jam Jum and hey,

51
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,780
center and come over here.

52
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,020
It will also work out that what we probably want to type is a sequence of the months and

53
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,350
again,

54
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,770
you see,

55
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,860
because I abbreviated January,

56
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,650
you can see it's automatically abbreviated all of the names of the month,

57
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,230
right?

58
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,550
So that's fairly easy,

59
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,750
because there are very few things that would follow Monday other than Tuesday.

60
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,650
One Excel needs if we're working with numbers,

61
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,070
is to spot a pattern.

62
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,010
And to do that,

63
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,710
it needs to see at least two entries to work out what that pattern will be.

64
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,460
So if I come into this cell just here and type one If I were to try to also fill now by

65
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,870
Dragon,

66
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,350
then you can see we just get one more,

67
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,520
more,

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,700
more,

69
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,870
more,

70
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,250
mom one all the way down.

71
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,620
But if I were to Cyp,

72
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,750
let me just delete that,

73
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,180
Okay?

74
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,310
If I were to type one and then type two on,

75
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,900
highlight both the boxes,

76
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,240
either by left clicking and dragging over them,

77
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,050
or click in the first on Hit and Shift and Down Arrow to highlight them on.

78
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,950
Then I hover over this little box here you can see that the curse has changed.

79
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,710
Excel has no worked out that what we're doing is increasing by an increment of one each

80
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,900
time and consequently it will automatically populate 12345 all the way down for us.

81
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,800
Far as we highlight now,

82
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,330
it can also do things a little bit cleverer than that.

83
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,440
So if we were to type two full,

84
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,860
it would also work out that what we're doing.

85
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,630
His increase in my in increments of two each time.

86
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,160
So when we dragged down,

87
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,880
we can see that we'll never get 2468 10 12.

88
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,440
This could save you an awful lot of time if you have a lot of sequences of data that you

89
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,360
need to enter,

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,780
Okay.

91
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:24,990
Now,

92
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:31,390
not only does it auto populates sequences going down and going over to the right if we were

93
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,020
to tight Monday in here on,

94
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,050
then we re select the cell,

95
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,240
come to this little box up the corner,

96
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,660
hover over it until they occur.

97
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,350
So changes we can also go up,

98
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,850
and it would populate the proceeding sequence.

99
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,030
And similarly,

100
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,180
if we would just like Monday and drag over to the left,

101
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,750
we can see that we know get some day and then a Saturday.

102
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,290
So any sequence,

103
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,650
no matter where you start in your workbook,

104
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,620
you can either drank down using this little box up the corner and left clicking.

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,660
You can drag right,

106
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,490
you can drag left and you can drag up,

107
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,510
and it will automatically populate the sequence.

108
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,570
The only thing to keep in mind,

109
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,110
obviously,

110
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,430
is if you're doing a sequence of numbers such as one and two,

111
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,250
that you need to highlight both of the cells on.

112
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,880
If you want to populate the proceeding sequence left,

113
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,120
click and drag up and you can see that will go to zero a minus one.

114
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,760
And it gives you a hint as to what it's gonna talk in that tone,

115
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,600
a little box that's appearing just there.

116
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,630
So they go.

117
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,550
That's a very quick way to enter a bunch of data that's in a natural sequence in Excel.

118
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,530
We're going to use that,

119
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:35,790
you know,

120
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,460
next lecture.

121
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,760
When we put in the headings for our new table,

122
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,950
so you and then it clicked you.
