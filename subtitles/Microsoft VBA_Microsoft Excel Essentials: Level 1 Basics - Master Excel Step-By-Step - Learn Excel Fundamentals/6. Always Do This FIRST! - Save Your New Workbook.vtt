00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
okay,

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.450
We're about to create a very first workbook from scratch.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.930
Now you can see that I've opened a new blank workbook here which Excel is called Book Won

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.850
by default.

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.510
Now,

6
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.010
very good habit to get into whenever you begin.

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.860
A new project in Excel is immediately rename the file or something more useful.

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.280
So in a few weeks time,

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.850
you'll be able to instantly identify it bites file name.

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.850
Okay,

11
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.830
So the first thing we're going to do is to rename a file to something useful.

12
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.730
And to do that,

13
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.890
we're going to use the ribbon just up here on We're going to select file by left clicking

14
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.230
and you'll be presented with this screen.

15
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.410
If you ever click this button by mistake and you don't know how to get back,

16
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.180
just left.

17
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.740
Click the little back arrow just there and you'll come back to your workbook.

18
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.290
OK,

19
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.620
so left click file move down the options to save as left click I'm gonna choose the path of

20
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.090
my computer by left clicking I'm gonna choose desktop and here we can see we have the save

21
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670
as dialog box.

22
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.480
We can see the current file name is Book one and what we're going to do is type over that

23
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.540
and choose more useful name of my fruit and veg shop.

24
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:29.650
So my fruit Andi veg shop I wish I could look at the street And for that my fruit on and

25
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.300
veg twice my fruit and veg shop they again.

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.420
Okay,

27
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.210
if you decide to change your mind,

28
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.870
just hit the council and you can come back and get their attending time It all.

29
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.240
But at the moment we're happy that it's gonna be called my Froome Benschop.

30
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.250
So we're gonna hover over,

31
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.080
Save left,

32
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.910
click on.

33
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.460
There you go.

34
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.740
A workbook has no being saved on.

35
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.000
We can see that the new titles no displayed at the top center of the screen in Excel.

36
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.910
Fantastic.

37
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.650
Okay,

38
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.360
the next thing we're going to look at is have you into text
