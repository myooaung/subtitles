1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
OK,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:02,810
guys.

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,690
Now we're gonna have a quick look at sorting out data.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,310
Now,

5
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,190
at the moment of,

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,360
um,

7
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,790
hidden all of our sales days Monday through Saturday on have also inserted a blank line

8
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,600
between celery and total.

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,350
Just so Data's nicely sectioned off there.

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,130
Okay,

11
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,780
we have three options.

12
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,880
What we're gonna do is we're gonna highlight the entire range that we want to sort,

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,450
and we're going to come up to the home ribbon and to sort and fills that just here on when

14
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,190
we left click.

15
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,010
We're just going to choose the first option,

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,190
which is sort eight,

17
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,040
or said and that's going to sort all of our data.

18
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,200
But notice what happens in the first column highlighted.

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,960
Currently,

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,020
we have apples,

21
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,100
which is an A followed by oranges,

22
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,010
which isn't Oh,

23
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,900
and when we click,

24
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,980
source data said,

25
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,880
you can see that it's no gone alphabetical.

26
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,530
All the other data to the right hand side has been sorted with it.

27
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,310
So whatever was against salary and all those different columns is still exactly as it waas

28
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,310
.

29
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,510
We just changed the source order.

30
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,740
Now equally,

31
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,570
we could choose the sort set to a which,

32
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,110
funnily enough puts it in the reverse order.

33
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,240
Now what we're gonna do is we're going to insert another column.

34
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,380
So I'm just going to right click,

35
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,600
choose Insert.

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,980
I'm gonna copy all that data down using control and day,

37
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,270
but change the answer of pineapple.

38
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,550
Two coconuts.

39
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,970
So now you can see that we have two entries for coconuts,

40
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:30,050
one that has let me highlight that one that has average monthly sales of 44 and one that

41
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,150
has average monthly sales of 128.

42
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,220
Right now,

43
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,930
we're gonna have look at the third option in sort again.

44
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,540
I'm in a source,

45
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,640
all of our data.

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,500
But this time we're gonna choose custom source.

47
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,670
Okay,

48
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,930
let's imagine we start from a blank.

49
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,050
What we're gonna do is we're gonna add to the level,

50
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,880
and we're going to tell it first,

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,770
that we want to sort by column A So we're gonna click Column A.

52
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,150
You have a few choices.

53
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,330
He you consort by cell color font,

54
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:56,620
color,

55
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,600
cell icon.

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,040
Let's just choose values,

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,110
which is the default option again.

58
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,670
We're going to stick to eight or said,

59
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,290
but this time we want to rank it According to the monthly sales.

60
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,750
Let me just move that over a little bit.

61
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,350
We want to rank it according to the monthly sales.

62
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,540
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a level.

63
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,440
So we're just gonna click this button here.

64
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,590
Once on,

65
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,150
we look over and we can see our monthly sales is in Colin K.

66
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,320
So I'm gonna choose column K.

67
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,860
We're gonna leave it of values.

68
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,370
Now,

69
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,930
at the moment,

70
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,720
it's saying smallest to largest,

71
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,490
but what we actually want to do issues largest to smallest.

72
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,140
Now,

73
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,910
before I click.

74
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,330
OK,

75
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,150
let's let me just draw your attention to this little box just up the corner.

76
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,800
Now,

77
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,680
this is if your headers are in your first line of data.

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,610
Hours aren't because they're headers,

79
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:41,840
Aaron,

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,790
Line three and we have a blank line.

81
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,060
But if they weren't,

82
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,260
you can just click this box and you can see that now is going to completely ignore the

83
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,610
first line of data.

84
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,020
So just tick that box.

85
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,460
If your head is are your first line of data,

86
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,970
that's just unclip that click,

87
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,610
OK?

88
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,760
And they can see that we've gone alphabetical down here.

89
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,240
Oh,

90
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,280
coconuts of being grouped together on because we said largest through smallest.

91
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,380
Our sales of 144 have appeared above themselves.

92
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,570
128

93
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,100
So that worked perfectly well.

94
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,970
Okay,

95
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,590
let me just highlight that again.

96
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,320
Choose custom.

97
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,240
Sort on.

98
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,330
Obviously you can.

99
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,760
Ada's many as you like in here so you could sail.

100
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,150
Actually,

101
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,970
I want to sort by then on.

102
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,970
Let me have a look.

103
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,310
I want to sort by Saturday.

104
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,820
So we look at Saturday.

105
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,660
Saturday's column h on We can choose smallest through largest,

106
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,990
and we can rearrange the order.

107
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,460
So if we want sort by a then K,

108
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,380
then h we just highlight H.

109
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,540
And then we hit the little down button and you can see the Leitch has moved to the bottom.

110
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,110
If we then decided we don't actually want K,

111
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,410
we can just click it hit,

112
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,310
delete level,

113
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,580
and there are sorts on A and h r left.

114
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,640
So there you go.

115
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,140
That's how the salt works.

116
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,370
I'm just gonna click council there.

117
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,520
There.

118
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,850
There are two ways to get to this.

119
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,630
The way we just looked at from the home,

120
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,000
Riman.

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,830
And you can also come up to the data ribbon left click Data and you have exactly the same

122
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,300
options.

123
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,190
Just here in the sort and filter.

124
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,040
OK,

125
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,580
that's it.

126
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,150
I'll see you in the next lecture.
