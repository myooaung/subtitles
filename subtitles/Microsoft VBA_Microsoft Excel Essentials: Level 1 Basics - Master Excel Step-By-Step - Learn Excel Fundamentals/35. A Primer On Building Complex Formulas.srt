1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,690
Okay,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,040
guys,

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,600
before we get to the next lecture,

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,520
we're just going to do a quick one on.

5
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:14,000
It's going to be a primer on how to build a complex formula or right to simple formulas and

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,280
then squash them together.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,780
Okay,

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,750
let's crack on.

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:23,010
The simplest way to work out how to build a complex formula is to use what you already have

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,010
.

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,450
Now this is just a screen cap of the spreadsheet that were already building.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,980
And if we're looking at average sales in Cell L five,

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,240
we can see that we have the formula of equals which tells Excel.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,750
It's a Formula I five because it's looking at our total of sales for that line.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,030
And then over one in column m five we wrote our round formula,

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,830
which was equals round open brackets.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,110
Then we referenced l five comma one to share that it's toe one decimal place.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,830
Then we closed off our brackets to encapsulate the arguments hit,

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,700
enter and they go We were all good so far right now this is what we have.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,380
This is just cooked down view.

21
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:05,700
Now,

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,890
the thing to remember in this formula here on the right is that where we said round L five

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,110
l five is just using the value that's been calculated in the cell of l five.

24
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,920
So it's not L five itself.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,950
It's the value that's been calculated in l five.

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,320
Do you remember from an earlier lecture that we use the phrase bless my dear Aunt Sally,

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,490
which gave us the order of mathematical operations.

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,340
So whenever you're in doubt,

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,320
when you're building a complex formula,

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,320
always bracket off your formulas is not gonna do any harm,

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,570
and it just makes them a little easier to read.

32
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,010
So what we're going to do first is we're gonna bracket off their formula in l five.

33
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,180
At the moment it say's equals I five divided by six on.

34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,700
We're gonna insert a bracket before the I five and after the six.

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,980
So it's gonna look something like this,

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,950
and you can see down here in the bottom corner that we've now got that formula just that

37
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,480
Now,

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,170
remember,

39
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,150
bless my dear Aunt Sally.

40
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,530
So in this video,

41
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,750
we're gonna have a look at the round formula that's in.

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,710
Sell em five on.

43
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,470
What we're gonna do to make this a perfect formula is we're going to school.

44
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,680
Gee,

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,110
this part over just a little bit.

46
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,990
We're gonna take the l five reference.

47
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,870
We're gonna get rid of it on.

48
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,800
We're gonna take the formula from the other cell on.

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,290
We're going to drop it in there.

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,060
Okay,

51
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,530
So now we have a perfectly built,

52
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,770
complex formula.

53
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,210
We're no longer reference in the cell.

54
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,980
Were actually calculating the whole thing all in one formula.

55
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,890
And that,

56
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,710
my friends,

57
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,300
is hell.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,950
You build a complex formula.

59
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,580
If you ever endeavor,

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,970
Just remember the phrase.

61
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,250
Bless my dear Aunt Sally.

62
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,350
Always do it simply first.

63
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,830
So if you can work out what your formula should do,

64
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,020
but you need to take a couple of steps to do it.

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,380
And that's perfectly fine.

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,210
And then once you worked and how to do it simply squashed them together.

67
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,000
OK,

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,290
so you in the next lecture
