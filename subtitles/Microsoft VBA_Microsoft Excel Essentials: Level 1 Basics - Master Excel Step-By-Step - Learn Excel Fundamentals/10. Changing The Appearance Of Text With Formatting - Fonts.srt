1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,730
Okay,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,490
We have a title for a worksheet,

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,570
but it looks a little boring at the moment.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,560
It's just in plain or Calibri 11 on.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,900
What we're going to do now is learn how to format our funds.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,070
So the first thing we're gonna do is select the cell that we want to format.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,910
So just selected cell a one,

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,380
and there are a couple of methods to do this.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,610
The 1st 1 we're gonna look at is using the home ribbon and specifically the font section of

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,480
the home ribbon.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:27,800
Now,

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,330
we have a few options available to us here.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,770
Not all of the options are available to us,

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,780
but we'll come to that in a little while now.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,200
The first thing we can see is that we have a calibri currently selected.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,150
So with the sole selected,

17
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,810
I'm gonna choose this little down arrow button just here.

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,960
And now every form that is available on your system will be listed in this in this little

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,380
scroll,

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,490
but scroll box here and notice what happens in cell a one.

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,850
As I move over each of the different font names,

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,250
you can see that in real time the phones is being updated in our spreadsheet,

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,350
so you can get a pretty good idea of what your text will look like if you were to choose

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,610
any particular funds.

25
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,250
Now,

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,940
at the moment,

27
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,250
I'm gonna stick with calibrate Now,

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,920
there is a quicker way of doing this.

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,800
If you know the name of the fund that you want to use,

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,010
you can just come up.

31
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,730
So here,

32
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,270
left,

33
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:27,490
click hit delete To get rid of the Texas in there and say we wanted to use times new Roman

34
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:27,490
,

35
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,000
we could we could literally just start type.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,320
In times they go and it's already said times New Roman site enter on,

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,640
they go.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,250
Our text has changed to times New Roman.

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:38,920
No,

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,230
actually,

41
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,970
like a livery.

42
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,800
So I'm gonna go back to Calibri Calibri.

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,050
So we're back a clean break.

44
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,090
Now the next thing we may want to do is also the size of our text.

45
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,020
Then we have three ways of doing this from the home ribbon.

46
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,580
We can use a little drop down box here,

47
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,660
left click on again noticing the sell.

48
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,420
What happens?

49
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,470
We can see that the font size is increasing as we scroll down and it will decrease as we

50
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,850
scroll back up.

51
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,580
Um,

52
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,520
let's just leave us.

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,390
It's 11 for now.

54
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,990
The other way is to click this little button here,

55
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,040
which is the increased phone sized button on for each click that we give it with our left

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,420
mouse.

57
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,130
You can see in this window here when l 2 14 Now we're up to 16.

58
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,290
So that will increase our font size by one of the uniform measures each time that listed

59
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:30,650
here.

60
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,910
Okay,

61
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,420
we can decrease our fun size by clicking this little button here,

62
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,710
and each time we click it,

63
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,190
our front gets smaller.

64
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,780
Now you may be thinking,

65
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:41,920
Well,

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,390
actually,

67
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,360
that there's a big gap between number 28 number 36 actually want to phone size of 32.

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
That's fine.

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,610
You can have a fun size of 32 by coming into this little box here.

70
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,040
Left click until you get the blinking cursor hit backspace to delete the number that's in

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,160
there and just type in the number on your keyboard that you want.

72
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,290
I said 32 didn't.

73
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,250
So let's say 30 to hit Enter and they go l font sizes No.

74
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,450
32 which isn't a standard form size listed here,

75
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,070
so you can even have decimals in there.

76
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,100
So if we wanted a 27.5,

77
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,610
we just talked.

78
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,330
27.5 hit,

79
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:21,760
enter,

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
and they go out of font sizes.

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,520
No,

82
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,750
27.5.

83
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,710
I actually,

84
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,680
like 22 4 titles,

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,850
so let's go back and change that 22.

86
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,510
Okay,

87
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,800
Next three things we're gonna look at are the bold,

88
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,980
italicized onda underlined,

89
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,730
which you can see are quickly accessed by using the B button on.

90
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,770
As we hover over it,

91
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,610
we can see the tool Tip tells us that this is bold and that the keyboard shortcuts his

92
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,750
control and bait.

93
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,040
Next to that,

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,050
we have I,

95
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,370
which stands for italics on We can see there that the keyboard shortcut is control.

96
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,890
And I andi underlying,

97
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,230
which we can see is the keyboard choker is control.

98
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,540
And you now you'll notice that the minute that all of these are Weiss in background until I

99
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,430
hover over them if I actually just want the text to be bold So I'm just gonna left click

100
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,860
bold.

101
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,990
We can see that that the text is being molded,

102
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,760
but as I move my cursor,

103
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,890
you can see that the B has remained highlighted.

104
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,650
That's a very useful way of finding out which formats have been applied to your text.

105
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,690
Okay,

106
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,140
so have a play around with those and make it bold making underlying to tell a size or any

107
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,640
combination of those three until you get a look that you're happy with.

108
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,360
Okay,

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,520
for now,

110
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,980
I'm going to skip over this option.

111
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,410
I'm going to skip over this option and I'm gonna come straight over here to the font color

112
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:45,410
.

113
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,650
If I select a little down arrow,

114
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,800
I have a range of theme Kalis that I could choose from.

115
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,140
And as I roll over them you can see that the you can see that cell a one is changing to

116
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,790
match whenever I'm hovering over,

117
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,060
have standard collis are available across the button.

118
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,200
Just here Now,

119
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,270
this should be good enough selection for you.

120
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,040
But if it's not,

121
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,670
don't worry.

122
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,540
Just left.

123
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,680
Click the more collis and you'll come to this option here so you can see all of your

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,650
standard colors.

125
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,550
You can see your current color is black and if I select this rather nice pinky color,

126
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,130
the new color is pink If I clicked.

127
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,700
Okay,

128
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,010
a text would go pink.

129
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,790
If this isn't a large enough array of colors for you,

130
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,050
you can hit the custom and you can left click and you can move around and literally select

131
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,860
any color that you could create far too many only Click Cancel for now on the left,

132
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,470
Click Next.

133
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,350
I quite like the green.

134
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,640
So they go with no successfully made a text green.

135
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,110
We've made it bold and we've increased the font size to 22 which looks much better as a

136
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,690
title.

137
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,430
Okay,

138
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,510
that's how you do that Use in the home ribbon.

139
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,380
The next method we're gonna look at is by right clicking in the cell itself and choosing

140
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,650
format cells.

141
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,700
So right,

142
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,950
click the cell.

143
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,340
Choose format cells left,

144
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,790
click.

145
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,670
Let me just drag that into shot.

146
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,500
And we now have the format cells dialog box which has now been displayed.

147
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,380
Now you can see across the top that we have six sections.

148
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,950
Here we have number.

149
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,080
We have alignment.

150
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,090
We have fund,

151
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,740
which is the one we want to play with.

152
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,990
We have border Phil and protection.

153
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,400
Don't worry about the other five.

154
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,960
For the moment we're just going to stick with front Now You can see here that everything

155
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,770
that we have displayed in the ribbon is displayed in this box too.

156
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,110
So we can see that we have Calibri Kelly Brick Nager.

157
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,040
You can see the no text is bold id on.

158
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,530
We can see by the highlight there that the Texas Bold We can see that we have a fun size of

159
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,530
22 which is reflected just here.

160
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,720
We can see we have no underlying on that are colored green.

161
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,680
Now the things that we get access to by going into it this way is we can also get to strike

162
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,050
through superscript and subscript.

163
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,730
Now,

164
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,480
if I want to make a change in this particular window,

165
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,480
it will not be updated in the cell until I click the OK.

166
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,800
So just to demonstrate,

167
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,070
if I chose red,

168
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,600
we can see in the preview window just here that the text will may be red,

169
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,470
but it doesn't actually show is ready in the cell until we click.

170
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:17,950
OK,

171
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,510
so let me just go back and change that to Green.

172
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,450
As I quite like it,

173
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,740
we'll use the preview window to see what these different effects do so if we left click the

174
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,580
little tick box their strike through,

175
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,450
we can see that we get a line through our text left click again to remove it Superscript

176
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:41,450
raises the text above the normal line Left click to remove it on Come down to sub scripting

177
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,850
Probably guess what matters left Click and it makes the script subscript And I'm gonna left

178
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,100
click just to undo That's I quite like it the way Liz Okay,

179
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,360
so hit.

180
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,710
Okay,

181
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,810
when you're happy with any changes that you made and away we go there The final method of

182
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,930
format in your font is some combination of the two.

183
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,590
If you look very closely at the top right hand corner of just zoom in here,

184
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:06,970
Okay?

185
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,290
If you look very closely at the bottom right hand corner of the following section of the

186
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:11,660
ribbon,

187
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,760
you'll see this little icon.

188
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,450
And if we hover over it,

189
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,070
we can see that we have fun settings.

190
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,820
So if we left click this little icon immediately,

191
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,920
have format cells,

192
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,650
dialogue boxes popped back up,

193
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,390
and it's automatically going to fund,

194
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,190
which is exactly what we want to play with.

195
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,630
Because we came from the fund section of the ribbon on again.

196
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,490
We can get access to the subscript and the superscript and all these different options.

197
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,720
If this is a way that you prefer to do it personally,

198
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,540
I prefer to use the ribbon because you can see the changes in real time happening in your

199
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,290
spreadsheet.

200
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,530
Where's with this?

201
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,380
You just have the little preview window.

202
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,990
It's a personal choice thing.

203
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,190
Have a play around with both.

204
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,330
See what you think in whichever one works for you.

205
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,110
Use that one.

206
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,960
OK,

207
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,990
that's funds.

208
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,400
Next,

209
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,150
we're gonna have a look at alignment.
