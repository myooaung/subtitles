00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
okay,

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.390
guys would come into the end of the first section,

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.080
and we've managed to build a spreadsheet completely from scratch on.

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.960
We've also amazed to build a chart off of their spreadsheets.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.750
Now,

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.510
at the moment,

7
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.120
although data is visible because the table is quite small in if resumed upto 100% by

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.630
clicking that button down there,

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.250
a table is still nice and easy to read.

10
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.710
Now,

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.530
this is useful if we only have a small data set.

12
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.410
But what if we have a larger data sets and we have twice as many lines?

13
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.490
So let's just go ahead and copy all of our data just down here.

14
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.550
I'm just gonna right clicking copy and then the bottom right click and insert copied cells

15
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.340
and hit escape.

16
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.990
They go.

17
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.420
So now a data set is twice as big.

18
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.030
Now,

19
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.840
at the moment,

20
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.270
we can't see the totals on the headings in the same view.

21
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.050
Now we could come down here and scroll out and they go No,

22
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.090
we can see the headings and the totals,

23
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.350
but it's getting a little more difficult to read.

24
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.750
And you can imagine if we have 1000 lines of data by the time you shrunk back down,

25
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.480
you wouldn't be able to read a thing.

26
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:04.920
Now,

27
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.530
Excel has a very useful way of dealing with this.

28
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.650
Let me just zoom back up to 100% and come.

29
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.900
That's the top of the page.

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.580
Okay?

31
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.220
We're gonna use the ribbon again,

32
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.440
and this time we're going to use the view section just here.

33
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.330
So I'm just gonna left click on view and that we're going to be looking at the windows

34
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.950
section and you can see in here we have an option called freeze panes.

35
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.640
And in freeze panes,

36
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.020
there are three different variations We have free Spain's freeze top row and freeze First

37
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.540
column.

38
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.480
Let's have a look at the freeze top row first.

39
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.710
So I'm just gonna left click free Stop row,

40
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.650
and you can probably see that is a faint lion appeared between lines one and two.

41
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.060
And what that is is when we scroll down,

42
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.860
we can see that our title is always visible.

43
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.270
Now,

44
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.800
that's partly useful,

45
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.750
but we still can't see what this particular terrible correspondence to because they're

46
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.790
headings are missing.

47
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.690
Okay,

48
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.020
So to remove that,

49
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.790
just left click again and choose on Freeze panes now.

50
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.530
Similarly,

51
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.480
we could choose Freeze First column,

52
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.940
and you probably guess what that does.

53
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.350
We now have a faint line between columns A and B.

54
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.650
So if we was a scroll over here,

55
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.190
you'll notice that our item always remains in view and all the rest of the columns move

56
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.720
over again.

57
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.280
Useful,

58
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.610
but not particularly useful for this exercise.

59
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.210
So what we're gonna do is unfreeze one more time on.

60
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.280
We're going to use the freeze panes option on its own.

61
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.270
If we always wanted to see our headings on,

62
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.970
we always wanted to see our items.

63
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.420
What we need to do is pick the first cell,

64
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.080
although data now,

65
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.210
when you use a freeze,

66
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.670
pain,

67
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.080
everything above the cell that you've selected and everything to the left of the cell you

68
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.670
selected will freeze where it is.

69
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.650
So because of selected Selby five for go ahead and click freeze panes.

70
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.090
Now you can no see that we have a faint line between lines four and five and we have a

71
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.050
faint line between columns A and B on.

72
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.430
What that's going to allow us to do is scroll down this way and you can see that I headings

73
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.950
of remaining in view and we can keep going.

74
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.250
So if we wanted to see it while our total sells for Friday,

75
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.710
where we can just scroll down and it's dead easy to see within the same view.

76
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.780
So Friday,

77
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.990
Total sales 46 Really,

78
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.130
really simple today,

79
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.620
I'm just gonna hit control,

80
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.550
went home to get up to the first cell again.

81
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.650
And similarly,

82
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.490
if we had a bunch of columns going way over to the side 2030 40 50 columns wide,

83
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.650
we can just simply scroll over.

84
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.410
And so we get there and we can see that instantly.

85
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.210
Even though there's a loaded data now out of you,

86
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.510
we can instantly Sparta Average sales for lettuces is eight.

87
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.580
So they go.

88
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.780
That's freeze panes.

89
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.640
Just remember,

90
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.820
with the free Spain's on the cell you've selected everything above and to the left will be

91
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.420
frozen.

92
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.240
So as long as you pick the right cell,

93
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.150
you find if you pick the wrong cell,

94
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.390
just hit unfreeze panes and have another go.

95
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.480
It is they go a very useful tool.

96
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.990
I'll see you in the next lecture
