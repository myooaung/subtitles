1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,610
Okay.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,050
We're covering a lot of ground very quickly.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,930
We've learned how to do addition the longhand way,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,100
the old fashioned way.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,110
We've learned how to do addition using the auto some function on.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,350
We've also learned how to do subtraction.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:14,940
Next,

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,720
we're going to cover multiplication.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,690
And to do this,

10
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,380
we're gonna add another column to ever table on this time,

11
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,850
we're going to call it monthly sales.

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,190
Okay,

13
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,970
we're gonna do this very simply.

14
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,670
I'm just going to resize out there,

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,430
OK,

16
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:30,900
now,

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,530
because we already know how many of each item we sell a week because we used our some

18
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,610
function over here in column G.

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,600
We're going to utilize that again just to do a simple multiplication,

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,380
for simplicity's sake.

21
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:44,540
Well,

22
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,350
just imagine their four weeks in each month.

23
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,520
I know that's not strictly correct,

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,700
but let's just do that for simplest is sake.

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,740
So we're gonna type equals,

26
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,550
which tells excel that we're about to enter a formula.

27
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,820
We're gonna click total because we already know the total of our weekly sales.

28
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,560
We're gonna hit,

29
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,820
multiply four and hit.

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,340
Enter and then you go.

31
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:15,000
We can see that if if a month had four weeks their monthly cells of apples would be 160 on

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,140
We're gonna hover over there and just double click to fill down so we can instantly see

34
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,500
what our monthly sales of each of their items would bay.

35
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,590
They go on.

36
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,190
That's how you do Multiplication.

37
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,430
Very simple indeed.

38
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,000
Onto the next lecture,

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,250
where will cover division?
