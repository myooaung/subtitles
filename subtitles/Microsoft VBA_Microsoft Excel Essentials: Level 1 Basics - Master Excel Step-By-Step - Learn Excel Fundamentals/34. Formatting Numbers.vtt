00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
OK,

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.190
guys.

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.760
Now we're gonna have a look at how to change the number of deaths.

4
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.490
Small places we can see you now.

5
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.300
Results.

6
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.120
You can see here currently in this range that we have a uniform amount of decimal places.

7
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.680
But if you look over here at this data,

8
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.340
we can see that we have vary in different lengths.

9
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.740
We have some that this long,

10
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.850
some with just one.

11
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.350
There were essentially two ways to change the number of decimal places you can see.

12
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.230
The first is to hover over the soul that you want to change.

13
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.510
Make sure it's selected right,

14
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.810
click and choose format cells on format cells will bring up this dialog box and you can see

15
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.450
that number is already selected.

16
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.580
We have a sample data,

17
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.930
which is eight point Sorry.

18
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.720
6.8333 which is copied from this cell just here on we can see that we have number of

19
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.470
decimal places is eight.

20
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.920
So if you want to increase it,

21
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.530
just hit the little top arrow button and you can see in a sample that this increases or hit

22
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.780
the down button and you can say our sample decreases the number alternatively in.

23
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.880
Just highlight the number and type any number you want over it.

24
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.940
So that's the one way.

25
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.410
Still it.

26
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.850
Let's click.

27
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.330
OK,

28
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.950
OK,

29
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.230
the next ways do it is to look at the home ribbon on.

30
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.880
We're gonna look at the number section of the home ribbon.

31
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.740
Now,

32
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
here we can see that we have the increased decimal on the decrease decimal,

33
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.350
and it's pretty obvious.

34
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.360
One day to she left click the increased decimal.

35
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.070
You can see that our number is increasing by one.

36
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.450
They're small place for each click and to decrease.

37
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.090
Just hit the other button and it decreases by one each time they can do this.

38
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.860
One is a time where you can do them on Mass,

39
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.720
and this time we're gonna do them all together.

40
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.840
So I'm just going to bring up that format box.

41
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.590
I'm gonna select number on.

42
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.190
I'm going to say,

43
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.160
Let's just have it down to one decimal place.

44
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.530
So I'm gonna hit okay and they go make us our data looks much better.

45
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.440
Let's just delete those zeroes off the bottom.

46
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.110
So they go in a Cassie.

47
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.650
Although data is uniform and it's displayed toe one decimal place.

48
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.800
Very simple indeed.

49
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.560
OK,

50
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.390
in the next lecture,

51
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.200
we're gonna have a look at something really interesting.

52
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.230
We're gonna have a look at how to build a complex formula by using some that you've already

53
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.360
built beforehand.

54
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.880
OK,

55
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.970
so you in the next lecture.
