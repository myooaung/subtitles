1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,610
Okay,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:03,930
guys,

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,040
we've covered a lot of ground.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,880
So far,

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,880
we've covered basic addition.

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,050
We've covered basic subtraction,

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,210
basic multiplication and basic division in our earlier lectures.

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,920
We've also had a quick look at our first Excel,

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,270
built in function of auto some.

10
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,780
And we're about to come to our second built in function of excel,

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,950
which is average.

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,770
So just so I don't forget what it is that we're gonna be doing.

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,810
I'm just gonna type the title average,

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,190
you know,

15
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,850
less there.

16
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,560
So they will know what this is when we're looking at it.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,710
Okay.

18
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,250
Now,

19
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,720
when we click auto,

20
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,780
some you'll recall from the earlier lecture excel automatically,

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,070
right?

22
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,650
So complete formula using the auto some now some is the operative word there.

23
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,360
If you've noticed there is actually a little down arrow below the auto,

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
some I come.

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,100
And if you left,

26
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,250
click with your mouse.

27
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,220
You can see that we have other options available to us on.

28
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,510
What we're gonna do is we're gonna hover over average left,

29
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,080
click on we can see there that excel is automatically written the complete formula forests

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,080
.

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,680
Now,

32
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,480
at the moment,

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,530
the formula is incorrect because we have not only ourselves for apples,

34
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,090
oranges,

35
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,680
all their fruits and veggies at the bottom.

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,750
We also have a total which is going to skew the result.

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,350
So for now,

38
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,400
let's just hit Enter and we can see that the average is 12.

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,320
Now,

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,770
what we need to do is edit the formula,

41
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,140
so it ignores the total on.

42
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,610
The way to do that is to hit F two on your keyboard,

43
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,450
and you can see that you now have access to the formula to be able to edit it.

44
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,760
Now we can see that range be five to be 14 as being selected,

45
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,720
which is reflected in the highlighted area on the worksheet on.

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,290
What we're gonna do is we're just gonna come up to the formula bar up here.

47
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,310
We're gonna left click just between the full and the closed brackets.

48
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,290
We're gonna delete before and we're gonna site five begin to lead the four.

49
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,670
We're gonna cite three.

50
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,770
So there we can see that the highlighted area is actually now only for our fruits and veg

51
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,550
is So Now we're happy that I have formulas being successfully edited.

52
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,260
Hey,

53
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,220
center on.

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,730
There you go.

55
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,990
We know about average sales of 6.666 lots of six is on the seven.

56
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,940
And again,

57
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,540
What we're gonna do is we're gonna copy that across for all of our days of the week by left

58
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,270
clicking dragon over with their mouths,

59
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,420
but impressed.

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,620
Let go the mayor Spartan.

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,570
And they go,

62
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:32,820
No,

63
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,990
we have our averages.

64
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,670
And that's a use the auto.

65
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,420
Some average function.

66
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,220
Okay,

67
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,450
so you in the next lecture.
