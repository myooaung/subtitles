00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
Okay,

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.920
Now we're gonna enter the headings for our data on.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.500
We're going to do this by simply coming down to sell a three and type in the men.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.230
Now is this is a fruit and veg shop.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.210
The first thing we want to see is what?

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.170
The items going to bay and the next thing we're gonna record of the days of the week.

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.410
Now,

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.530
you'll remember from the last lecture that if we took the first day of the week,

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.540
we can come up here till the curse of changes to the Black Cross left quick with their most

10
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.120
button and drag it across until we get Monday.

11
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.560
Tuesday,

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.940
Wednesday,

13
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.420
Thursday,

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.140
Friday.

15
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.880
There you go.

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.900
So then we have the days of the week,

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.630
and at the end,

18
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.580
we're gonna put our total.

19
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.370
So they go Now we have our headings right now at the moments just like our title was

20
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.890
originally these just in plain black text and we want them to look a little jazzy s.

21
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.270
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the format a game this time.

22
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.480
We're gonna come up here,

23
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.470
we'll choose blue.

24
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.550
I think on we'll make the front bold.

25
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.540
Yeah,

26
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.380
that looks pretty good.

27
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.930
Okay,

28
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.440
obviously,

29
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.490
we don't wanna have to go and repeat that exercise for every single one of the cells on

30
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.920
Monday.

31
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.340
Tuesday,

32
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.700
Wednesday,

33
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.110
Thursday,

34
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.730
Friday.

35
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.720
So there are a couple of things weaken Do,

36
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.970
using this tool up here in the home ribbon on this is called the former Painter.

37
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.270
And you can see from the little pop up box that it not only tells you what it is,

38
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.430
but it also tells you have to use it.

39
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.890
So if we select the cell with the formatting that we want,

40
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.940
come up here left,

41
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.350
click the former pain so we can see that we have the dancing ants going around this

42
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.420
particular cell.

43
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.030
Now all we need to do to paint that formatting on to the next cell it's just left.

44
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.900
Click that cell and then we get Monday,

45
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.400
and it has all the same formatting that this cell had,

46
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
the one that we carpet.

47
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.220
Now that does save some time.

48
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.440
But we can save ever more time by copying it again,

49
00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.460
but this time applying it to the entire line by clicking the number three because we're on

50
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.740
line three and then you can see that the formatting from Cell one has been copied across

51
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.350
all of the headings that we've entered.

52
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.050
And if we were to type something else in here,

53
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.110
anything,

54
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.390
anywhere on this line,

55
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.050
that's all.

56
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.780
You can see that that for matters being retained.

57
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.940
So there you go.

58
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.160
You don't have to redo your formatting for every single cell.

59
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.090
Just get the one cell correct.

60
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.070
Hit the format painter with that soul corrected,

61
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.720
and either select the individual cells that you want to format or format in the entire line

62
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.720
.

63
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.220
A little copy that formatting right the way across and they go.

64
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.850
That's one quick way of saving time in Excel.

65
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.570
Next,

66
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.550
we're gonna have a look at,

67
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.000
have to change the wits of the column so we can see all of their attacks clearly.

68
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.680
Okay,

69
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.870
so you in the next lecture
