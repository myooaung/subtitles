00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Okay,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.960
guys,

3
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.590
we're looking good.

4
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.190
So far,

5
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.430
we have a title or formatted merged incented.

6
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.350
We have the headings for all of our data.

7
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.330
Turn start entering some data.

8
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.300
And now I'm going to fast forward through some of this on.

9
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.820
I'm just gonna pause and then show you some useful tricks as we go.

10
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.550
So I'm just gonna pause for a second while I type some of these things in and I'll come

11
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.050
back to you when there's something interesting for you to say.

12
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.020
Okay.

13
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.950
Just got a bunch of fruits and veggies all listed here.

14
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.970
Okay,

15
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.570
We're just type in some mawr.

16
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.740
Veg is in here.

17
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.280
Okay?

18
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.440
No,

19
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.740
at the moment we've got apples,

20
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.260
oranges,

21
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.730
bananas,

22
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.330
coconuts,

23
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.740
potatoes and lettuce.

24
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.260
Now,

25
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.510
the first thing that I want you to notice is if I if,

26
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.320
for argument's sake,

27
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.150
we want to sell plums in our shop assumes they're type P.

28
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.170
Excel is immediately gonna look up all the data above it to see through is another p in

29
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.530
there.

30
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.100
No,

31
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.140
I already spotted that we have potatoes.

32
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.190
So if we wanted to enter potatoes again,

33
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.900
just hit,

34
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.450
enter,

35
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.950
and potatoes is in there.

36
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.080
But we're going to say plums so excels automatically going to check all the data that

37
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100
you've just entered to see if it can help you out.

38
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.210
If you want to actually repeat that data.

39
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.880
So no,

40
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.410
If I type p you'll see that it doesn't select anything because at the letter p it could be

41
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.390
potatoes or it could be plums.

42
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.070
So far,

43
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.610
it typed,

44
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.140
Oh,

45
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.430
it would automatically say,

46
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.770
Do you mean potatoes?

47
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.400
If I talked,

48
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.440
l it would say,

49
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.850
Do you mean plums?

50
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.670
So we're just one quick way of entrant data.

51
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.570
If their entries that you will repeat just type the first letter of the first couple of

52
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.280
letters and if it's automatically selected hit,

53
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.370
enter saves you typing in the whole thing,

54
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.100
Okay,

55
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.590
I'm gonna pause again and come back to you in a few seconds.

56
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.650
Okay?

57
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.670
There's the list of all the fruits and veggies that we're selling right now.

58
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.930
We're just going to start Topol in our sales for the day,

59
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.480
and we're just gonna randomly make this up so we'll say Well,

60
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:08.040
sell 745 to 5 11 Now you'll notice that I'm having to type each of these in fault.

61
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.490
Now,

62
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.750
if for argument's sake,

63
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.820
you have a data set.

64
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.920
Let me just finish this one off.

65
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.250
If you have a data set where you're typing the same number and repeatedly you have a few

66
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.270
ways of doing this,

67
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.510
so what you could do say,

68
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.510
for argument's sake,

69
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.670
you mention we want to enter 10 against every fruit and veg in Tuesday.

70
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.650
We've got a couple of ways of doing this.

71
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.550
We can either just type 10 in the first cell,

72
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.710
and you can see this little block up the bottom right hand corner.

73
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.980
If you hover over that until your cursor changes to the Black Cross and double click Excel

74
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.660
will automatically copy that value down all of the cells until it reaches the bottom of the

75
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.280
data.

76
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.180
And the way it works out where the bottom of the data is,

77
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.090
it looks at the cell immediately to the left and copies as far as the last entry.

78
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.730
A case that's woman groups.

79
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.240
That's one way of doing it.

80
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.140
There's another way of doing it.

81
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.450
If we want to enter the same value into all of these cells,

82
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.410
just highlights either.

83
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.660
Using your shift arrow keys,

84
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.510
all left.

85
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.620
Click with your mouse and drag over Let's just do Monday to Wednesday and Thursday.

86
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.940
Now let's imagine we wanted to enter nine into all of these values.

87
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.730
Highlights the highlight.

88
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.450
The range hit nine and hit control shift and enter.

89
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.790
And it will write that value to the entire highlighted range.

90
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.170
Okay,

91
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.050
I'm just skin new by randomly changed these to some of the values.

92
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.170
Just so we get some more interest in data to play with.

93
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.380
Let's hope some dates into here.

94
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.170
So say 5 to 937 Right?

95
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.540
Okay.

96
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.600
I'll just continue filling this data in on.

97
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.620
Then in the next lecture,

98
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.710
we're going to start to look a formulas.

99
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.000
See you in the next lecture.
