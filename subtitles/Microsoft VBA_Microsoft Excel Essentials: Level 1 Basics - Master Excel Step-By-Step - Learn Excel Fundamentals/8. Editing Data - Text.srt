1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
Okay,

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,260
We've learned how to enter text in Excel,

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,700
which is very straightforward,

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,650
but we may want toe edit the text we've just entered.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,760
Now we have a couple of ways of doing this,

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,160
the most obvious being selecting the cell hitting delete on your keyboard and wiping out

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,370
the cell completely.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,350
But we may just want to at least a part of the text that we've just entered.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,620
Now we have a couple of ways of doing this.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,040
Justus.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,550
We did with Enter in text.

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,140
We can either do it in the cell or we can do it in the Formula Bar,

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,750
and we're going to cover both of them now.

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,080
Okay,

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,500
we'll do the cell first will left click the cell to select it,

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,050
and then we can either double click left mouse button,

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,720
and you can see that we now have a flashing cursor inside so we could scroll over and

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,070
change our title to fruits and veggie shop hit.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,240
Enter and there you go.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,930
That's one.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,910
Let me just move the cursor.

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,610
They go.

23
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,660
That's one way of editing your texts by selecting the cell and double clicking.

24
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,030
Alternatively,

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,350
you can select the cell and hit F two on your keyboard like that,

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,260
and you'll instantly get your flashing cursor at the end of your text so you can then

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,970
scroll over.

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,550
Use in your arrow keys.

29
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,260
Onda delete whenever you want to do or make.

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,120
Whatever changes you need to hit,

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,150
enter and you're done on the third and final way is too slight the cell that you want to

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,540
read it.

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,950
Come up here to your formula bar,

34
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,090
and you can add whichever text you want to add in just up here.

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,350
And that will also edit the text you just entered.

36
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,370
Okay,

37
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:37,890
there you go.

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,850
That's how you edit text in the cell.
