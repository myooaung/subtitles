00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Okay,

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.090
guys,

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.410
from time to time,

4
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.240
you may find that the data set you're looking at is just too large to be manageable.

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.300
And it could be that you want to do some work far over on the right hand side.

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.080
Or you may want to do some work way down at the bottom there to make your data set more

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.860
manageable.

8
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.690
It's very simple to just hide some of the columns or the rose.

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.310
So imagine for a second that we didn't want to see our sales on Monday through Saturday or

10
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.210
we need to do is come up to the column heading left Click drag over all the columns that we

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.080
want to hide,

12
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.250
so have highlighted C through H the entire column.

13
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.750
If we just right click just here and choose hide,

14
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.500
you can see that all of that data is now being hidden from view.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.030
It hasn't been deleted,

16
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.940
it's still there and perfectly safe.

17
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.640
It's just been hidden from our view.

18
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.700
So now we can happily work over over here,

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.530
and everything is much easier to see now if you're in any doubt that you have any columns

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.050
hidden.

21
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.190
One quick way of finding names is just have a look at the column letters.

22
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.970
So here we can see that we have a baby and we immediately jumped toe I.

23
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.500
So obviously something has been hidden.

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.900
So there are two ways toe unhygienic.

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.110
This.

26
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.480
You can either left click and drag over the area that's been hidden on right click and

27
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.640
choose unhygienic.

28
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.150
You can let me just undo that hitting control and said,

29
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.210
or the other ways to select the entire sheet,

30
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.710
which is this little button at the corner here.

31
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.980
Left click and then just click anywhere in the columns,

32
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.120
right click and choose a new hide,

33
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.720
and they go whenever columns have been hidden for us.

34
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.280
Far across is your data goes will be unhindered.

35
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.360
Okay,

36
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.800
so that's a you hide columns.

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.660
If you want to do the same thing with Rose,

38
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.320
it's exactly the same process you can left.

39
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.930
Click the road number Aziz.

40
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.240
Many as you want to hide.

41
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.030
Let's just say we're gonna hide those to right click,

42
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.670
choose hide and they give their all hidden and again it will be a parent because we can see

43
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.780
we be jumped from them.

44
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.870
1234 and then immediately to seven.

45
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.980
So something is being hidden and again just left,

46
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.780
click and drag over the range that's been hidden.

47
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.860
So we've highlighted four through seven.

48
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.960
Right click Choose Unhygienic Anay Go All your datas back on the other way works just as we

49
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.830
did with columns.

50
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.140
If you click the entire shades right,

51
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.770
click on the road number and click unhygienic.

52
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.700
Anything that's been hidden for us far down is your data goes,

53
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.920
will get unhinging.

54
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.980
So there you go.

55
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.290
That's a Have you hide columns and hydro's See you in the next lecture.
