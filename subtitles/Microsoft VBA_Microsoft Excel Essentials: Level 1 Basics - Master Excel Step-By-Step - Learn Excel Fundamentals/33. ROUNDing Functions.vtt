00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Okay,

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:02.970
guys,

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.740
Welcome back.

4
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.480
Now we're gonna have a look at the three rounding functions that built into excel,

5
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.810
and they are round,

6
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.080
round up and rammed down.

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.580
Now,

8
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.720
you may wonder why you would want to use a rounding function.

9
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.660
So if we look over here column l you'll see that we have a couple of inter GIs.

10
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.570
We have six,

11
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.700
and we have eight.

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.050
We have some numbers that calculated out toe,

13
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.380
one decimal place.

14
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.360
But we also have some one of several decimal places.

15
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.920
No.

16
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.370
Do we really want to know that our average daily sales of oranges is 6.16666667?

17
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.570
Or would we like to say,

18
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.080
Do you know what?

19
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.380
Let's just call it six,

20
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.870
or let's just call it seven.

21
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.050
So this is what we would use a rounding function for.

22
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.770
Okay,

23
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.510
let's begin and have a look at all three of the rounding functions just so we can see the

24
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.900
data.

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.620
Clearly,

26
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.890
I'm going to do what we did in the last lecture.

27
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.150
I'm just gonna hide all of our sales on Monday through Saturday,

28
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.000
so I've just highlighted them all.

29
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.760
I'm just going to right click and click Hide they go Now it's sticking the title of our

30
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.690
three functions.

31
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.650
We have round,

32
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.400
we have round up,

33
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.650
Then we have round down.

34
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.680
Okay,

35
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.280
let's just make those a little bit wider so we can see nice and clearly they go now around

36
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.180
is a built in function on because it's gonna be a formula with type and we're just gonna

37
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
type equals we're gonna type round,

38
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.700
we're going to hit open brackets And now we can have a look at the tool tip to give us a

39
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.600
clue as to the structure of the formula so we can see that we already have round there.

40
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.250
So it's already narrowed it down for us on The first thing is looking for is a number.

41
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.050
Now the number we're gonna work on is this one just here.

42
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.330
So I'm just gonna left Click it on.

43
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.250
We can see from the tool tip that the next thing we require is a comment.

44
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.990
So I'm gonna hit comer,

45
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.260
and there you can see that number of digits has been bold ID.

46
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.450
So what I'm gonna do for now from type zero,

47
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.790
close the brackets,

48
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.120
which encapsulates the arguments and hit.

49
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.610
Enter.

50
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.570
So they go.

51
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.490
We can no see that are rounded.

52
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.230
6.833333 becomes seven.

53
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.390
Now,

54
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.570
I'm just going to copy that formula all the way down.

55
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.790
And we've done this before.

56
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.060
We just hover over this little box up the corner until a cursor changes DoubleClick and

57
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.310
that you can see that I formulas been copied all the way,

58
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.470
then Okay,

59
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.840
Next,

60
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.300
let's type in a round up function.

61
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.300
It would help if I could type so around up,

62
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.010
open rackets again,

63
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.850
you can see that we need to enter a number.

64
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.950
So we're just going to click the same number again.

65
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.030
We're going to stick with the same format hit,

66
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.360
comma type zero closer brackets and hit Enter Andi.

67
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.270
Just going to copy that formula down.

68
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.140
And then I'm gonna write in the round down function.

69
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.960
So round down open rackets,

70
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.940
I'm going to select the same number again.

71
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.980
Hit comma number digits.

72
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.300
I'm gonna stick to zero just so we can see the differences hit,

73
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.650
enter and then copied that formula down.

74
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.600
Okay,

75
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.900
let's have a look at what we've got.

76
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.810
Okay,

77
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.770
if we just look at our top line our apples.

78
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.060
We can see that an average daily sales exactly worked out to 6.8 and a lot of threes after

79
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.350
it.

80
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.540
Now we round 6.820 decimal places.

81
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.360
We can see that it ran its to seven,

82
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.840
which is pretty obvious because 6.8 is nearest the seventh and it is 26 If we look over at

83
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.730
the rammed up,

84
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.210
we can see a game that it's been rounded to seven.

85
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.850
Because this time we've explicitly told Excel to round up.

86
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.760
And if we look at the round down,

87
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.180
we can see that it signalled the 8.3 on its rounded down to the nearest whole number being

88
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.810
six.

89
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.760
So rounding down takes you down to the nearest whole number.

90
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.820
Rounding up takes you up to the nearest whole number on ground.

91
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.490
Just rains to the nearest whole number based on whatever the decimal places are after your

92
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.960
interview.

93
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.200
Okay,

94
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.110
so we can see if we look down the data that 6.1666 has been rounded to six,

95
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.630
obviously,

96
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.940
because it's nearer to six,

97
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.380
the new this to seven rounding up takes us up seven because seven is the next nearest large

98
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.450
number on rounding down again takes us specifically down to six and so on and so forth.

99
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.200
So all the nice and straightforward so far.

100
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.830
Now you'll remember that we had comma zero,

101
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.550
which means that we're gonna have no decimal places.

102
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.890
If you change your mind and you want to change everything to,

103
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.200
let's say one decimal place,

104
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.310
there's a very quick way of doing this.

105
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.850
No,

106
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.790
we know because if we click in here,

107
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.540
we can see we have round zero.

108
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.180
And if we scroll through them,

109
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.410
let me just move the curse right away.

110
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.550
If we scroll through,

111
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.950
then we can see that every single one of them saves comma zero.

112
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.690
And there's a very fast way to change all of those in one go.

113
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.650
What we're gonna do is highlight the entire range.

114
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.550
We're gonna hit control and f on.

115
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.860
What we're gonna do is type comma zero,

116
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.200
which is the one thing that's common to all of our formulas that we've just written.

117
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.600
We're gonna hit the replace button on.

118
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.350
We're going to say,

119
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.950
Comma,

120
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.490
did you say one?

121
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.420
Let's say one combat one,

122
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.710
and then we're gonna hit the replace all button and they go.

123
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.020
You consider Excel has told us it's made 33 replacements.

124
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.580
Just click.

125
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.120
OK,

126
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.840
we can close that now.

127
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.180
If we have a look at our formula,

128
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.290
we can see that we now have round l five comma one So that formulas changed that formless,

129
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.260
changed comma one,

130
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.430
as has that as has that one.

131
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.030
In fact,

132
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.730
all of them know,

133
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.560
say comma one.

134
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.150
So it's a very quick way of changing all your formulas if if they have a common element and

135
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.200
you just want to change one aspect off them.

136
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.980
Okay,

137
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.710
so now we can see if we've gone toe one day,

138
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.970
small place that all of their answers now equate to a whole number a decimal place and one

139
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.790
digit after the decimal place.

140
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.360
Now,

141
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.950
at the moment,

142
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.800
it looks a bit ugly because we've got lots of decimal places displayed.

143
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.530
So what we're going to do in the next lecture is have a look out of four matter attacks,

144
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.290
so it looks a little more uniform.

145
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.890
Okay,

146
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.050
So you in the next lecture
