00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Okay,

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.090
guys,

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.240
welcome to the second lecture in this bonus section where we're gonna have a look at all

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.890
the keyboard shortcuts.

5
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.340
Now,

6
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.810
one of the first things that we looked at was outing at Excel to automatically populate a

7
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.800
bunch of data if it was a natural sequence,

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.950
which is names of the week.

9
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.760
So if I type Monday in there,

10
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.000
you'll remember that we use the drag handled.

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.430
Now,

12
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.120
if we hover over the bottom right hand corner of the cell that we've selected,

13
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.470
we can see that the curse of changes and if we left,

14
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.790
click and drag down,

15
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.550
we automatically get Excel to fill that sequence in forest automatically.

16
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.590
So if you type in days of the week or months of the year,

17
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.550
just type your first entry,

18
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.280
select the drag handle and drag either down or across,

19
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.270
up or to the left,

20
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.040
and it will automatically populate that secrets for you.

21
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.550
OK,

22
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.850
so use the drag handle tow automatically populate Natural sequence is now the second use of

23
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.670
the drug handle.

24
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
If you already have data in a column,

25
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.150
is if you type January in this column here now because we already have some data in this

26
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.580
column.

27
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210
Excel knows how far we want to go down.

28
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.970
Naturally,

29
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.630
we don't have to drag it.

30
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.090
It will automatically work it out by find in the last cell immediately to the left.

31
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.400
So the other use for the drag handle when you already have data is again hover over it.

32
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.970
But this time,

33
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.010
instead of dragon,

34
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.470
just double click,

35
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.210
and it will automatically fill that sequence down as far as your data set goes.

36
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.210
OK,

37
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.360
so we'll run the subject of double clicking.

38
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.500
Let's just type a number in there now.

39
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.300
This could be any value or any formula and again to get excels copied all the way down to

40
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.650
the bottom of your data Set,

41
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.610
double click,

42
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.210
and they will automatically populate down for us,

43
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.660
far ritual data goes,

44
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.460
so double clicking will automatically copy all of that down.

45
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.270
As far ritual data set goes now because we type two number in there.

46
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.030
That wasn't a natural sequence,

47
00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.050
so Excel just repeated the number again and again and again if we actually wanted to say

48
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.630
put the five times table in.

49
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.190
What we need to do is give Excel couple of values so we can recognize the sequence and this

50
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.010
time just left,

51
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.290
click and drag over the two values that you've entered.

52
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.650
So now Excel can spot the sequence,

53
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.420
and this time,

54
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.280
if you double click,

55
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.740
it will automatically populate the rest of that sequence naturally.

56
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.490
So there you go.

57
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.770
That's how you quickly get the five times table.

58
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.120
Just hit five and 10.

59
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.560
Highlight the to double click the drag bar,

60
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.150
and it will automatically populate the entire sequence down for you.

61
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.070
The other thing we looked at was copying right,

62
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.730
and that's very simple to do.

63
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.790
The keyboard shortcut is control and are so what this is going to do?

64
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.110
It's gonna look at this cell and automatically populate this cell with its value,

65
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.050
so control and are fills right.

66
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.750
They can do one at a time.

67
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.960
Control when are or he wanted to do bunch of day to just highlight all of your blank cells

68
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.960
,

69
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.590
hit control and are,

70
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.750
and they go copies everything right,

71
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.020
and similarly,

72
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.900
you can copy down using control and D,

73
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.250
and they noticed that that it didn't extend the sequence.

74
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.420
Control and day literally will copy the cell immediately above paste into the cell you've

75
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.540
selected so Control and D copies down and again.

76
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.090
If you wanted to do a few cells,

77
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.360
you could just highlight them by holding the shift.

78
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.250
Hit Control and D and they go,

79
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.280
you copy down.

80
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.110
Okay,

81
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.330
so that's a use the auto fill sequence that's a use.

82
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.400
The drag handle tow automatically populate a bunch of cells,

83
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.710
and that's a use control and are to copyright on control and D to copy.

84
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.800
Down right,

85
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.290
Let's have a look at cutting,

86
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.080
copying and pasting so you'll remember.

87
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.940
If we wanted to copy all this data,

88
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.950
we can just left click and drag over it,

89
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.090
hit control and see on control and see copies.

90
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.830
And then we could come over to our first blank column.

91
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.450
Now we have two ways of getting the data in here.

92
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.190
Notice that we have dancing ands in the data we've just selected in column C,

93
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.660
and if we wanted to just paste it once,

94
00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.990
weaken,

95
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.700
just hit,

96
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.460
enter and they go.

97
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.240
We've successfully copied that data and pasted it somewhere else.

98
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.960
But we have two options of paste in the data,

99
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.820
and we can hit control and see again to copy it.

100
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.150
And instead of hitting,

101
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.790
enter I'm gonna hit control and V to paste.

102
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.700
No notice that the dancing ounces still appearing around the data in column C.

103
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.110
What that means is that that's been retained to the clipboard.

104
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.250
So if I was to select the next cell along and hit control on via gain,

105
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.060
I can copy it again,

106
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.540
and I can keep doing this for as often as I want to.

107
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.910
So while the dancing answer there and I hit,

108
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.630
control them.

109
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.190
V.

110
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.860
We can always keep copying the data because it's been retained in the clipboard.

111
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.860
If you want to get rid of the dancing honest after you've copied it a bunch of times and

112
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.810
pace it a bunch of times just hit the escape key.

113
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.140
So the difference between Control and V and enter is when you it's enter,

114
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.510
it empties the clipboard,

115
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.850
and you can only paste it once if you want to paste it multiple times hit control and the

116
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.480
which is a keyboard shortcut for paste.

117
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.270
Now the other thing we looked at was how to cut data and cutting.

118
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.090
You'll remember,

119
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.440
cuts the data from the original place and puts it somewhere else,

120
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.110
so you actually delete the data that you're cutting on the keyboard.

121
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.900
Shortcut for cut is controlling ex and X looks a little bit like a pair of scissors.

122
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.990
That sounds remember the difference on again.

123
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.950
Just click over to your first blank cell hit Control and V,

124
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.470
and you can paste it in there or simply can just press enter.

125
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.430
That will also paste it in there.

126
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.090
So control and X cuts the data which removes it from its original place and allows you to

127
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.220
put it somewhere else.

128
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.950
OK,

129
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.780
that's cutting.

130
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.360
Copying on paste in.

131
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.270
Okay,

132
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.250
never gonna have a look at the keyboard shortcuts for format in and those that these cells

133
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.240
just up here.

134
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.840
So they're very easy to remember.

135
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.930
If you hover over them,

136
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.240
you'll remember that your tool tip will always tell you in brackets what your keyboard

137
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.740
shortcut is on.

138
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.690
These three of really simple to remember to make something bold hit control and be because

139
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:15.690
bold begins with be nice and easy if you want to make something italicized hit control and

140
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.200
I,

141
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.520
which is very simple to remember a game because italics begins with I and if you want to

142
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.210
underline something hit control and you because underlined begins with you.

143
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.370
And you can have any combination though.

144
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.030
So if you wanted to have something in bold and italics let me just move the cursor.

145
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.950
You can hit control and be on control,

146
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.010
and I on it will have it in bold and italics.

147
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.450
And if you wanted to finish yourself by underlining it hit control and you And there you go

148
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.450
.

149
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.620
You get all three formats so control and be make something bold because bold begins with

150
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.890
big control.

151
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:56.930
And I make something in italics because italics begins with I and to underline something

152
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.620
control and you because underlying begins with you okay,

153
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.900
early.

154
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.010
We also have a look at what we did if we made a mistake and we used the undo button,

155
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.710
which was this one just up here.

156
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.550
But you'll remember if we hover over,

157
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.060
it's a game.

158
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.550
We can see that the keyboard shortcuts his control ends end.

159
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.060
And that's because it on does whatever we've just done.

160
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.140
So to undo the things that we've just don't we applied some formatting it.

161
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.540
Controlling zed on that will automatically let you undo whatever you just did.

162
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.850
If you've made a mistake,

163
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.610
okay?

164
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.850
So the keyboard shortcut for undoing is control and said,

165
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.960
If you decide that you actually didn't make a mistake and you want to redo what you've just

166
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.610
done again,

167
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.830
if you're not sure of what the keyboard shortcut is,

168
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.580
just hover over the redo and you can see that you get the tool tip,

169
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.170
which tells you the keyboard shortcut just up there and control.

170
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.080
And why allows you to redo what you've just done.

171
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.890
So the easy way to remember that will release the way I remember that is by saying yes,

172
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.830
I actually did want that after also controlling Why is yes,

173
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.550
I did want that.

174
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.230
After all.

175
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.770
Okay,

176
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.680
when you're working with large data sets,

177
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.550
you may want to instantly locate a particular piece of data.

178
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.020
So for argument's sake,

179
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.630
let's imagine that we wanted to find Saturday in our data set is quite easy to say at the

180
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:14.990
moment.

181
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.910
It is quite small,

182
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.270
but the keyboard shortcut for finding you wouldn't be surprised to hear,

183
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:26.940
because find begins with F is controlling F on that will bring up this dialog box just here

184
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:26.940
,

185
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.760
and you can see that we've already typed in Saturday,

186
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.310
Saturday on do you can hit find next and it will automatically skipper and spreadsheet

187
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.350
highlight each instance of that entry in there.

188
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.600
There's another thing you can do here,

189
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.930
and that is hit the replace,

190
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.200
which will allow you to replace something with something else.

191
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.970
So if I wanted to replace all of Saturday's with apples,

192
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.590
I just type apples in here.

193
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.790
I could type anything,

194
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.680
let's say or in just I don't know why we replace ancestor today with oranges.

195
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.680
If you want to do them all at once.

196
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.040
Hit Replace all.

197
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.820
If you want to do the 12 time just hit,

198
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.490
replace and it will go through them in sequence.

199
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.390
Let's just replace all on.

200
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:07.980
There you go.

201
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.060
We're done so to find something.

202
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.910
The keyboard shortcut is control and F because find begins with F and if you wanted to

203
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.070
instantly have it so it opens up with this.

204
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:24.580
Replace dialog box highlighted control and H An easy way to remember that is have begins

205
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.450
with H,

206
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.310
and you may want toe have something in place of something else.

207
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.330
So control and F find control,

208
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:40.150
and h that you have something so you can replace okay and the final few just to control

209
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.270
Excel on its own,

210
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.690
we could use a couple of other keyboard shortcuts.

211
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.150
And if we wanted to open a new file,

212
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:52.320
we could hit the keyboard shortcut control and end on that will automatically open a new

213
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.570
instance of Excel.

214
00:09:53.570 --> 00:10:00.610
So if you want a new workbook control and en will give you a new workbook because new

215
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:05.090
begins with n nice needs to remember when we just close that to get it out of the way.

216
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:10.580
If you want to open an existing workbook because open begins with O,

217
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.410
you can hit control and oh,

218
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.050
and that will bring up your open dialog box.

219
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.660
And you can instantly click any of your other files there to open them.

220
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.600
So control and oh,

221
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.580
opens a new workbook.

222
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.970
You'll remember that we already looked at Control and P,

223
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.510
which opened the print dialog box because print begins with P.

224
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:36.010
So Control and P brings up your print dialog box and finally one that we didn't Look,

225
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.720
I don't think was controlling s,

226
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.500
which is to save your work now,

227
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.250
because I haven't actually saved this yet.

228
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.150
It will automatically bring up to save as dialog box.

229
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.160
But when she work has been saved.

230
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:53.450
And you successfully renamed your file control and s will automatically save your workbook

231
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:53.450
.

232
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.450
Okay,

233
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.500
so they go,

234
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.340
there's a bunch of keyboard shortcuts.

235
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.060
Please.

236
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.000
If you have any easier ways to remember these open suggestions,

237
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.230
please drop me an email and I'll happily amend this thing if if you come up with a much

238
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.260
better way than I did.

239
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.200
So there you go.

240
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.090
You've made it to the end of the course of if you had some fun I hope you will enter north

241
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.750
