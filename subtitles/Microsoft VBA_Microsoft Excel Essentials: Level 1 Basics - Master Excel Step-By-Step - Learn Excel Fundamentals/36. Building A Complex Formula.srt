1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Okay,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,430
guys,

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,000
Time to look at building our first complex formula.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,570
Now,

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,330
at the moment,

6
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,940
we have our average daily sales over here,

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,740
which currently displays a 6.8.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,870
But you'll remember that if we increase the decimal places,

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,040
it's actual value of 6.8333 on day three,

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,070
Rikers forever.

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,790
Now,

12
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,570
also,

13
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,350
we've worked out over here.

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,150
That's around that number,

15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,050
actually makes it 6.8 because we've rounded toe one decimal place.

16
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,250
Now let's imagine that we actually want around this toe one decimal place,

17
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,370
that having tohave another column where we perform that calculation.

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,260
So what we're going to do now is we're going to turn this into a complex formula utilizing

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,430
the formula were already written just of here.

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,770
But in certain,

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,450
this formula into it.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,340
Okay,

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,600
here goes there.

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,450
You remember from an earlier lecture.

25
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,630
The phrase bless,

26
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,340
my dear,

27
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,330
aren't Sally,

28
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,490
and you'll also hopefully remember that the that is the order of mathematical operation.

29
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,970
So it's brackets,

30
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,410
multiplication division addition,

31
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,450
subtraction,

32
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,330
because we know that this former already works perfectly well.

33
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,740
What we're gonna do is we're gonna keep that part of the formula,

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,610
but just to keep it nice and clean.

35
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,260
I'm going to click in the formula bar.

36
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm gonna insert a bracket before the formula.

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,050
After the equals,

38
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,950
I'm gonna close it off a the end with close brackets.

39
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,500
So now formula size open brackets equals I five,

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,220
which is our total divided by six and close brackets.

41
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,890
It still has exactly the same result.

42
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,100
All we've done is enclosed that formula in brackets.

43
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,850
No,

44
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,090
for the clever part,

45
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,950
what we're gonna do is we're gonna incorporate this formula into this formula.

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,030
So we end up with one perfect,

47
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,840
complex formula that gives us the answer that we're looking for.

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,710
Okay,

49
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:55,880
now,

50
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,020
just to make this simple,

51
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,080
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna delete the equals on his center.

52
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,550
So,

53
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,810
no,

54
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,550
we can actually see what that formula Saiz.

55
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,070
Now you'll remember that l five was this cell here,

56
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:16,500
So this formula looked at this result and then rounded to one decimal place.

57
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,310
So we need to do is look at the format of this formula and edit this formula to match so we

58
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,520
can see that the L five value is immediately after the brackets.

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
So we're going to do here is come before our brackets,

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,190
we're gonna type round.

61
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,350
Imagine in that round is the option that we wanted to select on.

62
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,220
We have to open brackets to enclose arguments.

63
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,030
So now we can see that number is selected.

64
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,100
But we've already calculated our number because we bracketed.

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,650
It's off already here,

66
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,240
So I'm just going to click at the end of the formula.

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,180
I'm gonna hit comma.

68
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm gonna go straight to number of digits,

69
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,940
which was one on a tight one,

70
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,570
and I'm gonna close brackets.

71
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,240
So now you can see that what we've done is exactly the same formula.

72
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,450
But rather than referencing cell l five,

73
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,450
we've actually calculated the value of l five by enclosing it in brackets.

74
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,090
So when we hit enter,

75
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,870
we can see that we get an answer of 6.8,

76
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,250
which is exactly what we wanted to do.

77
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,240
And now I'm just going to decrease the which ones decrease.

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,630
I'm just going to decrease the decimal places so they go,

79
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,870
No,

80
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,230
we can see that we have 6.8 just to demonstrate that that works.

81
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,540
Let's just increase the brackets and you can see we have many decimal places in this one

82
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,450
here in this one here in this one here.

83
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,160
So I'm just going to copy that formula down and they go,

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,430
No,

85
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,490
you can see that they all only go to one decimal place.

86
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,320
So let's let's just reduce that,

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,110
which is that one?

88
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,810
So there you go.

89
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,280
And you have just built your first complex formula by using two formulas that you already

90
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,200
had and just copying the answers from one to the other.

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,120
Just so that's complete.

92
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,340
When you when you download this file,

93
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,650
I'm just gonna put that one back.

94
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,720
So there you go.

95
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,140
We've no negated the need to have a second formula to calculate the answer that we wanted

96
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,750
to get to.

97
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,630
Okay,

98
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,510
that's how you build complex formulas.

99
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,280
But no,

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,670
you know how they work.

101
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,170
OK,

102
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,350
so you in the next lecture
