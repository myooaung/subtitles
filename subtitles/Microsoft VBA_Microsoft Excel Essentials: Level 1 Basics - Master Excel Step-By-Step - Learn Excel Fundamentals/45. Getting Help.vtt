00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
Okay,

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.860
guys,

3
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.950
you may remember way back at the beginning of this section,

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.400
we talked about how to get help from Microsoft Excel.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.570
Then we have two ways of doing this.

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.660
We can either left click this little icon just up the corner,

7
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.780
the question mark,

8
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.320
or if we hover over it,

9
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.340
we can see the tool.

10
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.350
Tip tells us just a hit F one to get to help.

11
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.350
So I'm just gonna hit F one on the keyboard on this window here will pop up.

12
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.890
Now let's imagine for a second we would like to see formulas instead of results in our

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.700
spread sheet.

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.990
So if we just typed in plain old English show for Mueller's hit,

15
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.130
Enter Excel will go away and retrieve all the options that can think of.

16
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.640
That may pertain to what you just asked it.

17
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.030
So we can see here.

18
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.490
The first option is show improvement formulas.

19
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.520
That sounds pretty good.

20
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.310
So it's just left.

21
00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.230
Click that and we can see here that excels retrieved the helpful for that particular Queary

22
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.230
.

23
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.960
Okay,

24
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.720
so if we have a quick read through this,

25
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.340
we can see down here to show formulas in all cells,

26
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.880
press ctrl plus the little grave accent.

27
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.550
Okay,

28
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.320
so let me just close that and we'll have a play around to see what that does.

29
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.860
So it said,

30
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.830
Hit control on the grave accent and they go wonderful.

31
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.370
We could know,

32
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.130
see all of their formulas instead of the results.

33
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.140
And presumably,

34
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.490
if we want just reverse that we just hit control and grave again.

35
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.330
And now ask spreadsheets back to normal.

36
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.450
Fantastic.

37
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.570
So nice and simple.

38
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.410
That's how you get help from Excel.

39
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.570
It's a simple as that.

40
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.990
See you in the next lecture.
