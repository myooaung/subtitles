00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
Okay.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:03.950
Now,

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.750
is this good a time as any to cover.

4
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.420
What do you do if you make a mistake in excel?

5
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.010
No.

6
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.930
In the last lecture,

7
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.980
we edited the title of a worksheet to say my fruit and veggie shop on then a bunch of God

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.870
gobbledy goop straight after it.

9
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.180
Now,

10
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.810
obviously,

11
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.350
we don't want all these GSG Hmm?

12
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.200
Various letters in there because we've made a mistake.

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.740
So what we can do is we can use the quick access toolbar right up here and select the undo

14
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.200
button.

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.950
Now,

16
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.830
by hovering over the undo button,

17
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.760
you can see that you get the tool tip that tells you what the function is.

18
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.280
And you can also see that the keyboard shortcut of control and zed is highlighted.

19
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.990
Eso if you left,

20
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.880
click with your mouse.

21
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.810
The undue You can see that that gobbledygook has been removed.

22
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.820
Andi Tyler's room restored to what it was before.

23
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.560
Now.

24
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.340
Similarly,

25
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.000
if we move over to the right,

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.570
we can see the redo button on the redo.

27
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.270
It performs exactly the opposite function.

28
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.790
So if we hit the redo,

29
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
it will take us back to where we were just a few seconds ago.

30
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.370
We wanna undo because we like the type of our fruit and veg shop as it is on.

31
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.750
Do you go?

32
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.690
That's how you correct a mistake if you make one in excel.
