00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Okay,

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.920
guys,

3
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.790
welcome back.

4
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:03.910
Now,

5
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.570
you can probably guess where we're going to go with this lecture.

6
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.310
But just for the sake of completeness,

7
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.710
we're going to cover it anyway.

8
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.580
Again,

9
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.930
I've got two rows of numbers here,

10
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.800
and I'm just going to write a simple formula.

11
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.610
I'm gonna say this number multiplied by this number,

12
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.610
but then I'm gonna hit F four once,

13
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.240
and that will give me an absolute a absolute one reference on twice.

14
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.610
And now I'm going to get a absolute one.

15
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.420
And what that means is column The column that this formula will look at will very dependent

16
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.310
on where we've dragged the formula.

17
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.430
But the road number will never move from one.

18
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.290
So what we're gonna do,

19
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.640
hit,

20
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.030
enter,

21
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.480
copy that formula across using control and are on.

22
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.620
Then,

23
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.080
when we look at this formula by hitting F two,

24
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.880
we can see that it's always looking at road one.

25
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.550
So let's just copy that down a few rows,

26
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.160
Control and D And again,

27
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.530
we're in some really big numbers.

28
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.170
So if we hit F two now,

29
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.470
we can see that the B cell,

30
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.280
the one that's relative relative,

31
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.890
just straightforward plane be three as moved down as we've moved the formula around.

32
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.550
But the second part of the formula be absolute.

33
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.110
One has changed a column B because that's a relative reference,

34
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.480
but it is locked.

35
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.130
So if we come over here and his F two,

36
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.350
you can see exactly the same thing.

37
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.840
This reference D four is relative relative.

38
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.490
So whenever we drank the formula,

39
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.350
it is relative to where the formula is looking.

40
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.560
But D absolute one always looks at Row one,

41
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.980
no matter where you dragged the formula because we have the dollar sign in front of the one

42
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.980
.

43
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.720
So that's a relative absolute cell reference.

44
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.460
Okay,

45
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.660
ever play around with it and it will soon become second nature on.

46
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.510
I'll see you soon.

47
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.400
Thanks very much.
