1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,630
OK,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:02,980
guys.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,290
Now we're gonna have a look at how to create a simple chart from the data that we've

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,360
already created.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:08,830
Now,

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,040
I'm not gonna highlight Absolutely everything here woman do is I'm gonna left click item,

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,980
hold my left.

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,910
Most button down.

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,250
I'm gonna come all the way over and just highlight our sales up to Saturday.

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,080
No,

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,470
I'm gonna go up to the insert option Just here.

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,530
Left click on this will bring.

13
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,250
Got our insert ribbon.

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,340
Now we can see that we have the option in the charts section just here to choose

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,520
recommended charts.

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,350
So let's just left.

17
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,140
Click that for a second on.

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,810
Let's have a look what it's going to give us,

19
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,380
OK,

20
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,590
we could have this particular one more I'm gonna choose Here is this one,

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,550
And this is going to give us a stacked chart so we can see all of our sales for each day.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,910
And we can also see the breakdown of what?

23
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,800
Each of the fruits and vegetables Where now,

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,270
if we just click okay for a second,

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,770
you can see that our chance being created now I'm just gonna drink that out so you can see

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,760
the little better,

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,120
but you'll notice that what we have is this huge blue area just here.

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,630
If we look down to the key at the bottom,

29
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,210
we can see that this is the opening stock.

30
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:14,750
Now,

31
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,850
if we were to look at that chart immediately,

32
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,150
we could see that Apple's it looks like we've sold somewhere near 120 both groups.

33
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,950
I didn't mean to do that when we just didn't it.

34
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,350
If I move that chance head the way and we look at our total sales of Apple's,

35
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,380
it's actually only 41 now.

36
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:38,300
The reason for that is we've included the opening stock because the opening stock is our

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,750
second column of data after our item titles.

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,650
So what we're going to do now is we're going to select a non contiguous set of data.

39
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,200
Okay,

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,690
I'm just gonna delete that chart for just one second,

41
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,230
and we're going to do it.

42
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,000
But this time we're gonna miss out this column completely there.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,570
So far,

44
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,750
we've looked at how you highlight a range by left clicking,

45
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,590
but we haven't yet looked at how you highlight two separate ranges.

46
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,890
So we're just gonna do that now I'm gonna left click item tracked down with my mouse button

47
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,830
clicked Let go!

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,890
And now I'm gonna hit the control button on the keyboard and hold it down.

49
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,120
And now I'm gonna left click Monday and dragged through to Saturday So they go,

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,300
You can see that with no highlighted two separate ranges of data on We've missed out our

51
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,580
opening stock So let's go back up to insert.

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,920
Have a look at the recommended charts.

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,300
Let's just left click.

54
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,650
This is the one we selected before and there we can see ourselves for each of our items.

55
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,060
So let's just click,

56
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,750
OK,

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,750
they go on,

58
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,950
let me just make that little bit bigger by dragging out.

59
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,980
Okay,

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,330
so now we can see instantly that apples are Monday the blue.

61
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,270
We sold seven by hovering over it.

62
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,970
It will tell you what the actual value is.

63
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:02,930
On Tuesday we sold 10 and so when the so full so we can spot instantly,

64
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,550
our biggest seller is lettuce.

65
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,310
So we can see by just looking at this chart which are our best sellers,

66
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,940
in which are porous sellers.

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,720
If we look over here,

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,870
we can see that oranges and pineapples don't sell particularly well,

69
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,520
but lettuces were pushing nearly 50 a week on that.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,710
This is so lettuce is our best seller.

71
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,440
So it's just a quick graphical representation of one.

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,530
Our sales data actually tells us because we created a new child in the other worksheet.

73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,690
What we're gonna do is we're gonna copy this chart,

74
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,980
take it from this sheet and stick it in our chart.

75
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,080
Eso Let's just left click cut left,

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,220
click our chart And let's just go ahead and paste it right in there.

77
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,270
So they go No,

78
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,990
we can see the chart data.

79
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,680
Let's just make a little bigger Occupies our entire screen.

80
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,580
We may want to change the chart title,

81
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,020
so we're just gonna left click,

82
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,140
highlight the date and say,

83
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,150
uh,

84
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,090
sales chart,

85
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,130
call it ever sales chart,

86
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,880
click off.

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,450
So they go.

88
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,080
We now have a nice simple chart based on the data they have already created account just

89
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
going to go back to sheet one.

90
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,840
Just click off and they get That's how you create a simple chart.

91
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,350
So you in the next lecture
