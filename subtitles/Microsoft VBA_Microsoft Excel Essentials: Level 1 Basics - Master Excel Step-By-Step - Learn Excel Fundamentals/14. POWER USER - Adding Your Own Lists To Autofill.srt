1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
Okay,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:02,870
guys,

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,720
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,050
we have a look at the auto fill sequence,

5
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,050
and we know that we can use that very quickly to populate the days of the week all the

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,090
months of the year.

7
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,730
But wouldn't it be particularly useful if you could add your own custom lists?

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,060
Well,

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,580
luckily,

10
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,320
you can So imagine for a second that if you manage a particular department and you have

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,090
half a dozen members of staff from 10 or 20 members of staff rather than having to tighten

12
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,490
their names out individually in a column every time that you have to report on something,

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,530
you can just add them to your own custom list type.

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,490
The first name usually drag handle,

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,200
and they're automatically populated.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,400
Well,

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,800
luckily,

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,710
it's really easy to do on.

19
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,120
What we're gonna do is we're going to use the file ribbon,

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,000
which is just that the top just here.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,570
We're gonna left click on the file option.

22
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,200
We're going to come down to options just down the bottom.

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,470
Here,

24
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,610
we're getting a left click,

25
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,290
and then this little dialog box is gonna pop up.

26
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,740
You see,

27
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,090
we have another bunch of options down the left hand side on.

28
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,760
What we're gonna do is we're gonna come to the advanced option on left.

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,090
Click on this window is going to open up and see that we have a scroll bar.

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,540
What we want to do is left,

31
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,470
click and drag all the way down to the bottom until we can see edit custom lists.

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,930
So just left click the edit custom lists and they go,

33
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,770
you can see the built in ones that are already there in excel.

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,550
And what we're going to do because we have new list added,

35
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,640
is we're going to click,

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,050
add,

37
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,940
and our curse is going to jump over to the list and interest.

38
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,710
So I'm just gonna pause for a second.

39
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,710
I'm just gonna answer a bunch of names in there,

40
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,050
and then I'll come back to you in just a second.

41
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,690
Okay,

42
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,120
There you go.

43
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,940
So I've just talked to a bunch of names there.

44
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,280
So we now have Tracy,

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,880
Emmylou,

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,460
Orville,

47
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,000
Ricardo,

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,710
Maurice,

49
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,540
Mike am Belinda.

50
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,920
So what I'm gonna do now is click add and you can see that net.

51
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,970
That list is no populated over here.

52
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,380
We know custom lists.

53
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,210
We're gonna click,

54
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,940
OK,

55
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,960
and then we're going to click OK again,

56
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,730
and then we're gonna try.

57
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,550
And so Tracy was the first person in our department.

58
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,030
So let's just send to Tracy in there.

59
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,620
Hit,

60
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,100
enter,

61
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,850
then re select the cell.

62
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,460
Come to the drag handle.

63
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,750
Left click drag down on.

64
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,140
There you go.

65
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,150
You can see that all the members of our department automatically populated.

66
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,710
And then when they get back to the beginning,

67
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,730
their repeated again,

68
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,320
just like the days of the week and the months of the year.

69
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,010
Okay,

70
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,570
so that's one way to add a custom list into the custom list feature of auto fill.

71
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,430
There's also another way to do it.

72
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,220
Let's imagine that you have to report frequently on a bunch of departments in your company

73
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,220
.

74
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,770
So let's go ahead and add a bunch of departments for our company.

75
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,150
Okay?

76
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,260
I'm just gonna pause for a second while I typed them in.

77
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,460
And then I'll come back to you in just a few seconds.

78
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,710
Okay,

79
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,720
So what I've done have just entered a bunch of departments at random in the cells here,

80
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,050
So tight warehouses transport a camp sales tech support marketing human resource is in the

81
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,870
States and then what we're gonna do is we're going to use that list to build our own custom

82
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,740
list game.

83
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,920
We're going to go to the file option We're going to choose options again on we're gonna

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,600
choose Advanced again.

85
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,350
And this time I'm going to scroll down.

86
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,220
She was edit custom lists on this time.

87
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,510
What we're gonna do is we're gonna click this little symbol just here.

88
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,250
So we're just gonna left click there,

89
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,700
and we're gonna drag a box by left clicking and dragon with almost You can see that that

90
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,800
ranges being selected in here.

91
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,940
So now what we're gonna do is click this little button and we can press the import and you

92
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,330
can see their lists No,

93
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,510
been imported into our custom lists.

94
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,230
So again,

95
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:28,580
just here.

96
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,270
OK,

97
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,900
just hits.

98
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,030
Okay again against you know what we're gonna do to test it out?

99
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,490
We're gonna type in warehouse on.

100
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,340
We're gonna left click on,

101
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,650
we're gonna drag down and they go.

102
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,860
You can see that all of the other departments have been populated automatically because

103
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,210
we've already added that to the list.

104
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,220
We can go ahead and quite safely delete the original source.

105
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,490
The one that we imported.

106
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,600
And we can find out that if we type in again that that should still work.

107
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,390
So it's just left,

108
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,130
click and drag,

109
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,960
and they go nice and using.

110
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,130
Now,

111
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,200
the one thing you may notice is that here while I talkto warehouse,

112
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,590
I typed it in lower case.

113
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,320
So it didn't have a capital beginning on automatically.

114
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,180
Excel suggested that so that all in lower case.

115
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,060
But here I talked with the capital of the beginning,

116
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,560
so accept automatically capitalize all of those interests.

117
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,440
So there you go.

118
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,800
That's how you add your own custom lists.

119
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,470
Enjoy.

120
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,900
So you in the next lecture.
