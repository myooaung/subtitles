1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
Okay,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,430
guys,

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,000
we're just gonna very quickly cover a couple of ways of copying of formula to save you

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,280
having to rewrite it.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,940
Then the last lecture recovered.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,150
How to use the auto,

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,130
some function.

8
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,010
So what we're going to do now is we're going to copy that formula all the way across the

9
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,180
bottom of their data.

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:26,690
The first thing we can do is copy the sell by hitting control and see selecting the cell we

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,850
want to pace to by left clicking it on hitting control and V.

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,830
And if I move the cursor right,

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,690
the way you can see there that are forming there has been successfully copied to get rid of

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,590
the dancing on.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,750
It's just hit the escape key on your keyboard and they go,

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,650
That's warm way of copying formula.

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,450
Let me just delete that.

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,090
Alternatively,

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,760
we could select the formula we have on.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,100
We can come over to this little box just at the bottom right hand corner,

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,950
hover over its left click on drag as far as we want to go.

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,750
And then when we let go of the left mouse button,

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,630
there you go.

24
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,570
You can see that the former has been copied all the way across.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,800
Let me just delete that.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,400
On the other way is if you come to the cell immediately to the right of the cell.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,150
You want to copy and hit control and are,

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,240
which is the keyboard shortcut for Phil?

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,950
Right?

30
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:31,760
Controlling our you can see that it's been copied across again so we can either copy using

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,560
control and see Move over either hit control,

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
envy or just hit.

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,750
Enter weakened drag over when it occurs to changes to the Black Cross.

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,240
Or we can left click in the cell immediately to the right of it.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,550
Hit,

36
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,560
controlling our and they go.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,080
And that's hey,

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,890
copyright!

39
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,710
Okay,

40
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,070
now,

41
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,150
very quickly.

42
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,260
I'm also going to show you the same way to do it.

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,520
Going downwards.

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,680
Now again,

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,380
we have exactly the same options we can either hit control with C.

46
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,170
Move down,

47
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,630
hit control and V.

48
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,030
Let me just delete that we can hit control and see come down and hit.

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,100
Enter Amega that gets rid the dancing Lance.

50
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,210
We can come to the cell immediately below it.

51
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,320
Hit control and D,

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,500
which is the keyboard shortcut for Phil down.

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,510
We can also drag down to fill down when we hover over the box on the corner and there

54
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,260
occurs to changes weaken,

55
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,430
just drag down,

56
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,220
let go and they go groups.

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,740
We can see that the formula's been copied.

58
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,660
But if we're talking about the vertical plane,

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,510
there is another very quick way to copy the formula down again.

60
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,740
If you come to this little box up the corner,

61
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,750
hover over it until your cursor changes to a plus double click,

62
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,530
and you can see that the formula is being copied all the way down.

63
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:54,910
Now,

64
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,380
the way it works out where the bottom of the range is,

65
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,910
it just looks to the cell immediately to the left to find out where the last entry is.

66
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,950
They go another time saving tip for excel.

67
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,730
Okay,

68
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,090
Next,

69
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,440
we're gonna have a look at how we can adapt the auto some formula so we can actually use it

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,470
to some a row of data.

71
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,210
Okay,

72
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,370
See you in the next lecture.
