1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:02,990
guys,

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,740
let's have a look at a simple division formula now a game.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,550
We're gonna add another column over here at the end,

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,870
and we're gonna work out this time with an average daily sales are so I'm just gonna type

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,470
average daily sales on they go.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,080
Okay,

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,450
I'm just gonna resize that again.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,370
We're going to come into our first empty self,

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,120
and we're going to hit equals to tell Excel that we're about to do a formula.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,920
Next,

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,490
we're going to utilize our some again from column G.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,360
So we're just gonna left click there and we can see that That's also massively been

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,180
highlighted.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,950
We're going to hit divide.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,800
We're going to count up family.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,980
We need to divide by.

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,000
So we have Monday,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,470
Tuesday,

20
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:45,860
Wednesday,

21
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,270
Thursday,

22
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,940
Friday.

23
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,640
That's five.

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,170
So we just hit 500 keyboard hit,

25
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,920
Enter on.

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,440
There you go.

27
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,790
We can see that our average daily sales for apples is eight.

28
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,690
And again,

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,770
we'll just click that cell double click window cursor changes.

30
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,310
And there you go.

31
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,660
We can see our average daily sales for each of our items.

32
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,360
Now,

33
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,670
that's how you do a simple division.

34
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,150
Now,

35
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,600
obviously,

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,740
because we working out on average.

37
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,500
We may also want to use the average function,

38
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,030
and we're going to cover that in the very next lecture.

39
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,450
So you in a few seconds?
