1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
OK,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,820
guys.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,820
Now we're gonna have a look at an absolute cell reference.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,780
So I have a column of numbers down here I'm gonna do in Cell.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,210
A one is just type three.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,230
Let's just type three.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,020
So I'm gonna write a similar formula wrong and say,

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,850
Is this cell multiplied by this cell?

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,480
But when I'm selecting cell A one,

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,670
what I'm gonna do is push f four on the keyboard and you can see in the formula bar that we

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,260
now have.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:37,570
The formula equals a three multiplied by dollar sign a dollar sign one.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,890
So that's absolute a absolute one.

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,960
And I'm gonna hit enter,

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,890
and there's our formula.

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,310
Now I'm gonna copy it down just as we did before,

17
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,380
using the drag handle and double clicking.

18
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,480
But this time,

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,750
notice what's happened as I moved down here.

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,350
When they hit F two,

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,630
you can see that the a reference has moved down in line with our copy in the formula Dem.

22
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,700
So instead of calculating on a three is now looking at a four.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,590
But the other cell,

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,480
the absolute a absolute one,

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:18,930
has bean anchored up the corner to always be a and one and then if I come down,

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,810
Teoh here and his have to again.

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,240
You can see that the first cell a 10 has moved down relative to where the formula is but a

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,270
game because we put the dollar sign a dollar sign,

29
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,900
one that is,

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,990
we absolute cell referenced it.

31
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,160
It's always going to multiply by a one because those dollar signs Luckett in his column.

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,370
I unluckily INS column one.

33
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,180
So if we if we were to copy that formula across what would happen,

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,550
let's just copy it over there on Copy it down.

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,590
Oops,

36
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,550
tracking that down.

37
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,550
So even when we come over here and hit F two,

38
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,560
you can see that this sellers moved relative to its position where the formula lives but

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,050
still absolute.

40
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,930
A absolute one is always the second operator.

41
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,490
So by putting a dollar sign or hitting,

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:20,030
F four once puts a dollar sign in front of the column letter on the road number on.

43
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,880
Wherever you move your formula that particular cell reference will absolutely never move.

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,610
It becomes an absolute cell reference.

45
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,410
So they go.

46
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,520
That's an absolute cell reference.

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,620
In the next lecture,

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,810
we're gonna have a look at an absolute and relative cell reference with absolute a one.

49
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,230
I'll see you in the next lecture
