00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
Hi,

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,100
David.

3
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,580
Hopefully the audio on this comes out.

4
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,260
Clearly.

5
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,210
I'll be able to come to adjust it so you can read it.

6
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,680
I've got your file.

7
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,050
It's it's It's all pretty much straightforward stuff.

8
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,180
There's just an awful lot of straightforward stuff in there.

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,490
So if I started the top,

10
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,950
we've got there just emerged incented cell,

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,610
which looks like it's going from a over to end.

12
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,400
Probably put that over 20 actually,

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,860
at the end.

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,300
But for now,

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,200
we'll just replicate exactly what you've got.

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,010
So I'm just highlight in a through to I m going to hit emergence center on.

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,890
I'm gonna put the texting E T p.

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,150
Whatever.

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,690
Excess attendance.

20
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:49,000
Forgive any typing errors that Aaron this s so I'm just going to click that I'm gonna make

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,960
it bold hitting the bold,

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,550
but in there.

23
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,770
And I'm just going to increase the font size by hitting the little plus button.

24
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,290
So you've got attendant stretched attendance roster actually saves,

25
00:00:59,290 --> 00:00:59,750
doesn't it?

26
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,290
Underneath that looks like we have merged from a through two K,

27
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,740
another merged incented cell.

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:15,280
So I'm just gonna emerging center that this one says training site lips training site.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,380
Okay,

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,440
so far so good.

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,530
After the train insights,

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,950
we have another two merged incented cell.

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,050
So we have this one here merged incented,

34
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,440
and this one saves roster.

35
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:35,170
Eso we have roster and I'm gonna make that bold on we have an outline.

36
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,220
He s so I'm just going to choose outline outside Borders,

37
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,300
which is gonna just gonna call around the outside there.

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,190
And I think we have a background of yellow,

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,500
uh,

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,880
more colors.

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,110
It's probably that kind of color.

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,370
Okay on then we have just this one that's being merged incented on that has an outline

43
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,290
around it too.

44
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,260
So they go.

45
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,320
That's almost what the first couple of lines look like.

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,630
The next line's been scrooge it up a little bit,

47
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,430
so it reduces in size and then we've got down the side.

48
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,040
We have number of trainees,

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,110
then that goes from line unnecessary.

50
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,310
We have contractor type.

51
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,580
Next,

52
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,250
don't make so we have a contract or turn that right.

53
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,000
Ignoring spelling mistakes that are made during this contract to name on,

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,850
then in line here.

55
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:34,740
Whatever that sees on this one's merged incented over to E s.

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,910
So I'm just gonna merge in center on,

57
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,350
then it looks like it's left aligned,

58
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,390
but you probably have a few spaces in here to make it look like it nudges in a little bit.

59
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,720
The next one we have is I think we have ah,

60
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,790
Line five has been Scrooge it up a little bit to make it look a little contractor Names

61
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,280
also got a background of yellow,

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,560
so just selected that choose the color on Choose that outline Borders option again.

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,650
And I think the text is bold,

64
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,960
so it's a little cumbersome,

65
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,870
but luckily you only have to do it once.

66
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,450
Then we have emerged and sent itself from a six down to a 12.

67
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,090
So I'm just gonna highlight a six.

68
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,110
Enter a 12 hit merge in center on.

69
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,190
There's a trick in this one.

70
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:30,220
So what we have is hashtag dot I think train this on.

71
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,210
What we need to do is a line that differently.

72
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,070
So I've just selected that sell at the moment.

73
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,240
The text is going from left to right.

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,430
What we wanted to do is go from bottom to top.

75
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,470
So I've just hit that there and you can see this little option here Orientation.

76
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,050
If you just click on that,

77
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,620
you can see that you can flip it.

78
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,830
So format sell.

79
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,730
Let's go to format cell alignment on.

80
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,910
Then we're just gonna drank this little red dot here all the way up until it goes upwards.

81
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,880
So it's 90 degrees and then we'll have number of a number of trainees.

82
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,250
It say's groups.

83
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,940
Number of train,

84
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,790
EES.

85
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,510
I think that's what it says on the game.

86
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,640
We can weaken send to that in that cell by using the the center in the middle alignments,

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,290
and that is also in yellow and it is also boarded.

88
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,160
So now we have that one in there.

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,810
Now,

90
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,730
the next thing we have is this E t p thing,

91
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,030
which looks like it's done over two E and down this father's line 10 eso I've just

92
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,450
highlighted that I'm gonna hit merge in center.

93
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,180
It is colored in yellow on it has a border around it.

94
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,070
Now,

95
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,820
here's the trick.

96
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,320
Okay,

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,760
so we're gonna type,

98
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,630
uh,

99
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,050
inside the right thing in here.

100
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:57,520
So we have our first line of text now if you hit old and enter at the same time,

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,160
you can see in the formula bar that it's actually given you a new line of text type into so

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,630
in he content my second blind off data and then it bold and enter on.

103
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,800
That will give you another one.

104
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:19,810
And so you can put my the line on adult and intact and you can get new lines like that seem

105
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:19,810
,

106
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,520
type something else ultimate enter something else hit ends at,

107
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,980
and then it will all line up.

108
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,930
So I'm just going to re select that just the line is over to the left.

109
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,220
And if you want to change the front formatting on any of these,

110
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,580
just scroll opinion into your formula bar.

111
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,140
Highlight the text.

112
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,180
So my first line of text on my line of text will be bold.

113
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,850
And then when they hit enter,

114
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,960
you can see that that 1st 1 has appeared is bold.

115
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,070
So if you want to just highlight some of the text in this,

116
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,390
just select the text in the formula bar and we could say,

117
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,370
Make that larger,

118
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,450
and then we can scroll down a little bit and say,

119
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,690
My third line.

120
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:06,000
We'd like it to be read on bond bold and italics and just scroll down through here if you

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you got a mouse with a scroll button.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,070
You can just use that.

123
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,550
If not just clicking and usually arrow keys on.

124
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,360
Then you can just select by highlight in any bit of the cell that you want to highlight.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,480
So we could say,

126
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,670
Well,

127
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,110
make that blue Andi increase of font size and make it bold.

128
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,100
And then when you finish their continue text in the formula bar hit,

129
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,610
enter,

130
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,340
and then your text will look exactly as it needs to.

131
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,290
Okay.

132
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:31,940
Next.

133
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,980
We have,

134
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,100
um,

135
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,830
some merge in centering over here all the way over column.

136
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,350
Oh,

137
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,370
so emergence center.

138
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,530
Make it yellow.

139
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,620
Make it outline bordered on.

140
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,990
We have training dates,

141
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:54,440
and then it looks like underneath we've just got at bordered cells for each of those.

142
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,500
So I'm just gonna highlight all of those on this time.

143
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,190
I'm gonna choose all borders.

144
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,390
So there we get those lines and they're just like we did before on to speed it up.

145
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,330
I'm just gonna copy that Serve highlighted from here down to here.

146
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,640
Hit control and see Come underneath Control.

147
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,200
Envy.

148
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:22,030
That gives us our start and ending times and and on day I'm going to copy that against we

149
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,050
have another one for heroism in its own copy.

150
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,370
And that left click drag down.

151
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,170
Copy Andi paste that in there.

152
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,910
And here we have hours on end lips.

153
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,520
Now it looks like Road 12 is just being made taller.

154
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,390
So I'm just gonna drag it down to where Line 13 would be by left clicking.

155
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,420
And then I'm gonna merge in center this emergence center,

156
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,350
make it yellow.

157
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,040
Make it outlined on it.

158
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,230
Say's trainee in the Schoen's colon.

159
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,770
There to get to the new line holding old press.

160
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,180
Enter Andi more text in here on whatever that needs to say.

161
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,600
And the next thing we have is another merged in sentence self,

162
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,510
which is here.

163
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,770
So I'm just going to highlight the to emerge in center,

164
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,210
make it yellow and use that outside border again cause I don't want a line through the

165
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:18,590
middle.

166
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,930
And here we have a job both and Andi,

167
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,520
what do we have?

168
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,290
Jump no dot Enter Andi.

169
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,410
That one needs to be centered.

170
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,490
So we're gonna choose this option here.

171
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,890
Rips this option here on this option here to put it in the middle.

172
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,260
And I think we also have it bold and underlined.

173
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,890
So there we have job number.

174
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,850
We have training name across here,

175
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,130
which is another merged in sentence emergence center,

176
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,620
yellow and again,

177
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,670
I'm going to choose the outside borders.

178
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,710
And I'm just gonna line this up in the middle.

179
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,700
So chosen this option and this option.

180
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,470
And in here we type training,

181
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:01,950
name,

182
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,740
trainee,

183
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,860
name Andi.

184
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,600
I think that's bold and underlined.

185
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,180
Bold underlined.

186
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,190
Now,

187
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,130
this cell is a little bit wider,

188
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,030
so I'm just gonna widen that out a little bit on DWI and have And do we have another

189
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,250
merchant sentence cell that I think we do?

190
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,760
So I'm just gonna highlight here and here.

191
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,050
Hit merging center,

192
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,580
Make it yellow on doing outside Border on.

193
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm gonna put trainee signature colon bolt and enter and whatever the texts who's in here?

194
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Okay.

195
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,010
And then you can you can talk whatever needs to go in now,

196
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,620
trainee.

197
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:47,880
Sick.

198
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,020
Well,

199
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,400
this entire box looks like it's centered,

200
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,130
which is good,

201
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,710
but its top aligned.

202
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,190
So I'm just going to come over here to topple line left click,

203
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,190
and it will go to top on trainee.

204
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,700
Signature is underlined.

205
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,490
So I'm just gonna highlight Trainee signature in the formula bar.

206
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,870
And I'm gonna hit the little underlying Lemina here.

207
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,400
Tender.

208
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,440
You can see that.

209
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,670
That's no Got training.

210
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,950
Signature underlined.

211
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,830
Could be boulders.

212
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,230
Well,

213
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,680
now,

214
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,570
if I look over at these end columns over here,

215
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,010
there are a little bit narrower.

216
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,750
So I'm just going to click on your original document,

217
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,600
which I've got open here just a second.

218
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,690
So just going to click on here,

219
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,340
right?

220
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,790
Click and choose column wits.

221
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:35,480
And we can see that the common with this 5.14 So I'm just gonna copy that Hit counts on

222
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
dragging out the way,

223
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,800
and I'm gonna change.

224
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,270
The column went from all of these by highlighting f through toe.

225
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,660
Right click.

226
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,180
Choose column.

227
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,110
It's on tight that over the top.

228
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,770
So it's 5.14 Okay,

229
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,380
so that should be starting to look like the original documents.

230
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,770
It looks like we have a bunch of numbers down this side there that go from one through 20.

231
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,480
So I'm just gonna hit one on too.

232
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,850
Andi,

233
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm just going to drank that down using the fill handle until we get to 20.

234
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,950
Keep going,

235
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,650
uh,

236
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,260
20

237
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,060
Okay.

238
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,450
And it looks like they've been central lined.

239
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,950
So I'm just gonna choose this option here.

240
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,720
So they go somewhere.

241
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,370
We have number of trainees,

242
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,380
sub liquor that looks compared to the original.

243
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,000
So far,

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,550
so good.

245
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,700
Andi job number always appears to say one.

246
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,700
So I'm just going tight one in the 1st 1 and just double click there,

247
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,750
and it will fill one all the way down.

248
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,050
And we also want that centered by the looks of it.

249
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,840
So I'm just gonna hit center now.

250
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,930
All of this area here.

251
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,630
Trainee name is merged.

252
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,460
Incented.

253
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:56,650
So most incented on C 13 and d thirties or just highlighted there on,

254
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:03,100
I think if I just dragged down and hit control and day and I didn't do it just a second.

255
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,530
So I'm highlighting their I'm his emergence centre,

256
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,050
and I'm highlighting here underneath emergence center.

257
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,400
And now I'm just gonna copy that one down on holding shift.

258
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,230
So selected this cell.

259
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,710
I'm holding shift.

260
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,640
I'm going all the way down to the bottom,

261
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,260
and then I'm gonna hit control in D to fill down.

262
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,570
And that should give us merge.

263
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,950
Sells all the way down.

264
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,470
Perfect.

265
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,540
Okay,

266
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,630
this isn't merged on the rest of this looks like it said just but wind.

267
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,350
So I'm just gonna highlights all of this area.

268
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,710
Let me come down to the bottom on.

269
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,150
I'm going to go into here.

270
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,080
I'm gonna choose all borders because we want the lines to appear in these little lines,

271
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,020
coming down as well.

272
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,350
So all borders.

273
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,240
So now it's starting to look something like the original.

274
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,210
Let's just narrow this column appellate or here between A and B on narrow.

275
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,460
This column up here between being see Andi that let's have a look on the limit.

276
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,450
Just regular original into shots.

277
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,680
So this column here c and D.

278
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,340
If I highlight the to and hit column,

279
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,180
Wittes says,

280
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,060
15.43 I don't know if that's the two of them,

281
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,640
so let's just try it column.

282
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,380
It's 15.43 was it?

283
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,810
Let's bring the original backend.

284
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,270
Okay,

285
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,080
that's starting to look something like the original document.

286
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,490
Let's just check the width of AEA's well by right clicking it and choosing column.

287
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:42,710
It's and that want to say is 32.43 Let's copy that using control and see and do the same

288
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,900
for this one column.

289
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,050
It's 32.43 Enter.

290
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,830
Okay,

291
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,640
so that should Where's your original document going?

292
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,420
Hang on a minute.

293
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,750
Way Go.

294
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,680
Okay,

295
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,940
so that's starting to look.

296
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,350
Okay,

297
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,690
so we're good for all of this bit.

298
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,450
Then we Let's just zoom in a little bit.

299
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,580
It looks like we've got a motion sentence cell across here as well.

300
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,250
At the bottom,

301
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,010
eso will just come down to the bottom.

302
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,920
Hit merged incented.

303
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,470
So dragging from a 33 all the way across Emergence center said,

304
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,380
Look at the original.

305
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,730
Um,

306
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,720
it looks like some spaces in there,

307
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,450
so it will say note one.

308
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,870
Whatever the notice in their Andi,

309
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,750
it's being left aligned,

310
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,220
but it looks like they've just entered a few spaces before the word notes to make it no gin

311
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,220
.

312
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,590
A little bit Onda.

313
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:44,960
We have no to so highlight the cell that we've just done the no motion centered hold down

314
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,550
shift Come down hit control and D and that will copy that down.

315
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:57,560
Um and that will now say note to on whatever note to will say that he is texting here.

316
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,850
Okay,

317
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,470
So far,

318
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,120
so good a game.

319
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,350
It looks like down the bottom we have something has been merged and centered across A and B

320
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,350
.

321
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,550
So we'll emergency and 2 a.m. b on what does it say?

322
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,000
It say's date.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,550
So we have date.

324
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,230
Andi,

325
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,540
I'm just going to re select the cell and it looks like we now have a different color.

326
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,740
So we now have a blue kind of color.

327
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,810
This probably won't be spot on the date on.

328
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,130
Then we want the outside border again because we don't want to call her that,

329
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,460
Lyle.

330
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,100
And down the middle today we have date.

331
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,300
We now have trainer name,

332
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,210
which is in column c train name Andi.

333
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,090
That looks like it's bean.

334
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,560
Some look that's been centered and it's got the same for matters.

335
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,350
These cells.

336
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,570
So we're just gonna hit center,

337
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,690
make it blue and color the outlines.

338
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,080
Okay,

339
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,060
Training name.

340
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,750
I think these are actually in bold as well trained Signature.

341
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,460
I'm just going to copy that.

342
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:12,200
So I'm just going to select control and are and just change the word two signature picture

343
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,630
train a signature course titles again.

344
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,510
I'm just going to select the cell to the side and hit control and are because these air

345
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,430
single cells.

346
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,270
That's so that that and that are single cells,

347
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,260
so you can just copy it and paste it in here we have course titles,

348
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,450
lips stifles,

349
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,200
and that looks like it's being centered.

350
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,290
Right now we have another merged incentive,

351
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,580
but let me just drag leading.

352
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,190
Okay,

353
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:52,650
so now we have emerged Incentive cell that's running from F over 20 for the next one.

354
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,760
So I'm just gonna drag from F over 20 on hit Emergence center.

355
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:06,660
Andi then whatever text that say's what Ever Text Gu's in here.

356
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,550
Uh,

357
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:14,760
and that also needs to be blue in background on having outside border.

358
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,710
I think this entire lines actually bold.

359
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,330
So I'm just gonna highlight line 35 by left clicking it hit in the bowl.

360
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:28,950
But eso let's just find your original documents again on Zoom out.

361
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,800
I have to do that so you can actually see it'll scroll down a bit on them.

362
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,660
It looks like we just got some most incentive cells again underneath here.

363
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,810
So I'm gonna hit,

364
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,340
merge in,

365
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,120
center on.

366
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,550
I'm going to give that an outside border.

367
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,370
And hamli,

368
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,270
do we have We have 123 groups,

369
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:59,500
1234 So I'm just gonna highlight that Left click one That's 23 foot four rows Control and D

370
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,140
something.

371
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,990
We have our date boxes in there back to the original document,

372
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,140
train and name.

373
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,930
That's just outside borders.

374
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,060
So I can,

375
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,940
in fact,

376
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,160
I'm gonna highlight all of those that,

377
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,140
in fact,

378
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,150
I'm gonna highlight there,

379
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,020
through there but rather than outside ball that because we wanted to actually color in all

380
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:26,990
the lines will come up to here and we'll choose all borders So they go.

381
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,190
No,

382
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,890
we have are all borders.

383
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,950
Let's have a look at the original document again.

384
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,350
It looks like it's exactly the same thing over here as well.

385
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,760
This is an all borders thing.

386
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,380
So a lot borders.

387
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,470
So just highlighted all of those sounds I'm gonna hit the this one with the cross in its

388
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:45,880
services.

389
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,690
All borders.

390
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,160
And that's colored that in Let's have a look at the original.

391
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
Okay,

392
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,400
it looks like we've just got emergence center thing across the bottom there,

393
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,220
so I'm just gonna highlight away across the bottom hit emergence center.

394
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:10,740
This is the last cell on the sheets and let's also in blue.

395
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,910
Andi it has an outside border.

396
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,780
There we go.

397
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,760
So let me just shrink that down.

398
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,580
The colors are probably not right,

399
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,120
but it kind of looks something like the original.

400
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,850
If I could just put that to the side of it,

401
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,620
make that a little bit bigger on Zoom.

402
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,230
And it looks something like that.

403
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,630
I think now,

404
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,020
actually,

405
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,600
on your original what you do have where is that?

406
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,090
You have a bold line around this section here,

407
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,500
this this middle section up to there by the looks of it.

408
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:56,620
So it looks like it's from 31 0 31 up to probably goes all the way over to D six.

409
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,260
Yeah,

410
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:04,790
so let's just highlight all of that there on this time we're going to go here on,

411
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,840
we're going to say thick box border and click that and know when we click off,

412
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,610
you should say that you got a super white,

413
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,520
a super thick border around all of that section.

414
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,020
And you may want to do that around this section here by choosing the thick box border on

415
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,660
maybe even at the top.

416
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,310
I don't actually know what the original looks like.

417
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,560
Now think around.

418
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,050
That's up.

419
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,540
And then if assuming,

420
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,340
uh,

421
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,620
that looks something like your original document.

422
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,220
Sorry,

423
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,510
that's a 22 minute video that went on a bit,

424
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,520
but that should cover everything that's included in that document.

425
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,140
So,

426
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,970
as usual,

427
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,260
if you have any questions,

428
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,140
ping me an email or ping me a message or post in discussion on day,

429
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,260
I can see if I can source it out for you.

430
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,550
Have a great day.
