1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
OK,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:02,840
guys.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,270
Now we're gonna have a look at how to set up a worksheet to print.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,660
Then we have three ways to get to the print interface.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,340
They're all the same methods.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,190
Once we get in there,

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,320
it's just the different ways to get into the interface itself.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,450
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna look at the ribbon and we're gonna choose

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,540
the file section,

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,870
which is right up here on the left hand side.

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,590
So it's gonna left click file on this window will appear on.

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,800
We can see from the options down the left hand side that we have the option to print just

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,450
down here.

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,110
So I'm just gonna left click,

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,560
and that's going to open this window there.

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,010
We can see in the main window.

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,450
We have a print preview.

18
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,290
This is what the print will look at if we were to hit the print,

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,510
but immediately.

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,370
But if we look down the bottom there,

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,650
we can see that the print will actually go over onto two pages.

22
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,040
What we can see there is the first page,

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,480
and if we click the little arrow to the right,

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,880
we can see that that will be the second page if he wants all of out dated to appear on one

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,360
page,

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,040
we have two ways of doing this.

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,910
The first way would be to look at the scaling option,

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,730
which is down the bottom just here now.

29
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,160
Currently,

30
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,850
you can see that we have no scaling selected.

31
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,480
Well,

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,670
we're going to do is click the little down arrow and we can see that we have the option to

33
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,540
fit sheet on one page.

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,060
So if we left click that we can no see that our table will print out on one sheet now

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,480
because this is set up to print in portrayed,

36
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,970
you might find that this is a little difficult to read.

37
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,850
So let's just go ahead and them do that for a second and choose no scale in on this time

38
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,020
caught two portrait orientation.

39
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,920
So I'm just gonna left click there and switch it to a landscape by left clicking on there.

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,120
We can see that that's much easier to read,

41
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,490
but we still have it over two pages without last column just tripping over onto the second

42
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:45,810
page.

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,830
So let's just come back again and again.

44
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,720
We're going to choose the scaling option.

45
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,230
We're gonna pick fit Cheeto.

46
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,070
One page on they go.

47
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,130
That looks much better.

48
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,910
Will bounce here entire data at all on one page,

49
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,280
nice and easy to read.

50
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,910
And then when we're ready to print,

51
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,400
we just make sure we have the right princess selected.

52
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,060
Currently I have one nose.

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,650
I think it picks that by default.

54
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,850
So just hit the little down arrow,

55
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,940
pick your printer on,

56
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,090
hit the print button and there you go.

57
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,330
That's how you do you print.

58
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,910
And it's a simple Is that the second way to get to that interfaces to hit the keyboard

59
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,060
shortcuts Control on DPI on that will bring you straight back here again.

60
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,340
And they're just finally the third way Just hit the little back arrow is to use this new

61
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,410
button that we've added to our quick access toolbar.

62
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,530
So we can see then that we have the print preview and print button just left.

63
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,790
Click that and that will bring you straight back here.

64
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,270
Now that could be that You want to print the second tab on their work sheikhs as well.

65
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,400
Now that the moment you can see in the settings that we have prints only the active sheets

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,400
.

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,570
So foods the left,

68
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,750
click this button just here and click print entire workbook.

69
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,590
We can see that this pages remained exactly the same,

70
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,770
but we now have page one of three.

71
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,770
So if we click next page,

72
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,290
we can see that we have a chart and we click on the next page.

73
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,710
We can see that our chart trips over onto the page after that,

74
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,150
too.

75
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,820
So let's just go go back here again,

76
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,150
change it to let escape orientation on they go,

77
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,730
and then we can see that it will print out onto two pages without a data table on the first

78
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,180
page on their charts on the second page.

79
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,860
So when you're happy that you've got it all set up just right,

80
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,590
hit the print button on.

81
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,100
There you go.

82
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,540
That's how you print Easy is that I'll see you in the next lecture
