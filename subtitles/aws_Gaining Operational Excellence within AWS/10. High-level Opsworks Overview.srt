00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,030
[Autogenerated] Okay.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,890
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,460
Now let's just take a look at a W s Ops works when you

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,190
come to the original screen here,

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,070
The landing page for the service we can have three different selections.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,240
We can Look at our stacks, which will look at in a minute.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,110
We can immediately jump to chef automate or we can jump to puppet enterprise and

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,340
you can see the differences here listed below the pictures.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,060
So I'll go to stacks and you'll notice on the left is a

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,540
similar menu to what we just saw.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,940
Now we're under stacks,

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,700
and you can either register existing instances or you can

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,980
add your first stack and start fresh.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,900
So let's go ahead.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,140
I'm gonna add my first stack.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,040
We'll go ahead and do a sample one,

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,390
but notice you can specify your version if you wanted to,

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,230
I'll do it on Linux Ops works creates an I am role

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,540
for this particular operation.

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,760
And then it ran through setting up our sample.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,340
Steck.

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,840
So let's look at it.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,340
You can see we're looking at our stack that we just created.

24
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,800
We have a new app server layer.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,540
We have our apps themselves, and then the number of instances that we have.

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,040
So from here,

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,600
we can treat our stack as a logical unit or resource and we can

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,340
run commands or change settings as a hole.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,120
So this allows us to automate deployments for all of our instances that

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,810
belong to our application and do it using chef or puppet so we don't

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,970
have to repeat manually what we're doing now.

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,590
If I go to layers, we'll see we have our note app server layer that we looked at.

33
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,980
Let's look at settings so we can specify some settings.

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,760
We can Look at our recipes and these error custom chef recipes

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,870
that we want to deploy to this entire layer.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,200
So any instances belonging to this layer will have this

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,740
Node.js demo cookbook deployed via this recipes setting

38
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,250
we can specify network security tags.

39
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,640
All the normal compute based resource is.

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,340
So I'm going to go back to stack.

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,960
I'm in my samples stack here.

42
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,540
Let's click on run Command.

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,210
You can see we have different command apps tions that we

44
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,030
want to use we can update cookbooks, execute a recipes we can set up,

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,840
configure or upgrade the OS.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,350
You'll see.

47
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,550
Hey, I wanna upgrade to this version of Amazon Linux.

48
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,640
All allow a reboot.

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,210
And then if I needed to,

50
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,820
you can pass in customs Chef JSON for this to run on now,

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,330
we don't have any instances running right now in this stack.

52
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,360
So this is not going to do anything.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,030
I just wanted you to be familiar with how you can use this

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,990
run command on your deployments in order to automate your

55
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,810
configuration management.

56
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,340
Now, that's gonna do it for this overview of a W s ops works.

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,330
If you leverage chef or puppet in your enterprise,

58
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:28,000
this managed service might be your best bet to get things up and running quickly and efficiently, so be sure to check it out.
