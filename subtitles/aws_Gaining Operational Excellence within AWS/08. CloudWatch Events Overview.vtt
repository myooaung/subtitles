00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.770
[Autogenerated] All right, let's talk about CloudWatch events now.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.140
What are CloudWatch events?

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.400
Well,

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.270
CloudWatch events allow us to have near real time streams of different events.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.110
That error showing changes in our AWS resource is so we can

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.580
quickly set up rules that allow us to watch for certain events

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.940
and perform certain actions similar to alarm that we saw earlier

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.050
now four CloudWatch events.

9
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.590
There are two different types of triggers.

10
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.140
The first is a scheduled trigger, so based on a schedule that we set,

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.440
our CloudWatch event will self trigger.

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.640
And then there's event.

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.820
Now this is a CloudTrail event,

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.940
and we will discuss CloudTrail a little bit deeper later on in this course.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.180
But for now,

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.810
the gist of it is that it's an event more API call

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.040
that's being made in your account.

18
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.310
Now to go ahead and get a better grasp of this.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.440
Let's go ahead and demo these CloudWatch events now for these demos.

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.540
When we create these events,

21
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.040
we'll go ahead and make one that's a scheduled trigger

22
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.740
as well as an event based trigger.

23
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.620
So let's go ahead.

24
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:34.000
We'll wrap up here and then let's swing into the next clip where we'll start getting some hands on and digging into the console
