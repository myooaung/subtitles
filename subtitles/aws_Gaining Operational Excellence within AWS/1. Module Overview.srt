[Autogenerated] welcome to Module two of the gaining operational

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,840
excellence within a W s Pluralsight course.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,380
In this second module,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,240
we're going to look at leveraging CloudTrail to secure our AWS accounts.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,640
Now, before we dive in, there are a few module objectives we want to cover.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:29,440
So the first is we want to be able to create a W s CloudTrail trails for audits.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,010
And then the next thing is,

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,940
we want to protect our CloudTrail trails via validation and encryption.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,910
And then finally,

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,180
we want to learn how CloudTrail is best use within

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,040
organizations and advanced architectures.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:56,000
So those are the key module objectives for the upcoming module. Now let's go ahead and dig into CloudTrail.
