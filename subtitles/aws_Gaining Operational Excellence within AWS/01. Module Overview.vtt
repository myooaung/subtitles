00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.330
[Autogenerated] welcome to the final module in this gaining

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.840
operational excellence within a W S course.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.410
In this final module,

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.840
we're going to be discussing how we can create repeatable deployments.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.530
So what's on the menu for us?

6
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.090
What can we expect?

7
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.740
Well, we have a few different module objectives.

8
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.320
We wanna have an overview of infrastructure as code,

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.940
which is shortened to I A C.

10
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.230
We're going to look at how we can implement

11
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.540
infrastructure as code via CloudFormation,

12
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.320
which will discuss further.

13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.540
And then we're going to identify the best use cases for A W S ops works.

14
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.600
If you're not familiar with some of these terms, that's perfectly fine.

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.000
We'll start diving into them here in the upcoming clips. So let's wrap this up here and then continue on.
