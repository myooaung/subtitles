00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.020
[Autogenerated] So what is a W s ops works well,

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.850
Ops Works is a configuration management service that helps us

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.380
configure and operate our applications.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.740
Living in a W s.

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.200
The backbone of this service is either puppet or chef,

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.740
depending on the operation that you're trying to run.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.290
Now the differences are ops, works,

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.080
stacks and ops works for chef automate leverage Chef cookbooks.

9
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.040
So you need to be familiar with a chef cookbook syntax in order to use this.

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240
But it handles the heavy lifting in the back end so you

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.340
don't have to spin up your own chef servers.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.380
And then we have ops works for puppet enterprise,

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.840
which is going to leverage surprisingly puppet enterprise.

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.010
And this is simply managed puppet master servers that you can use

15
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.840
for managing nodes and configuration management.

16
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.540
Now, the nice thing about puppet is it allows us to enforce a desired state.

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.090
For all of our resource is as well as automate

18
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.340
several different tasks on demand.

19
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.500
It is an awesome managed service and really handles a lot of the

20
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.740
heavy lifting that we might otherwise have to do.

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.460
So let's go ahead and take a look now for this upcoming demo.

22
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.720
We're just going to get hands on experience with AWS ops.

23
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.980
Works well,

24
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:38.000
look at the syntax of the files and then how we can deploy it in our console for our own work.
