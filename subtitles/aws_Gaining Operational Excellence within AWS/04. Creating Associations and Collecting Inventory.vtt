00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.280
[Autogenerated] Okay, let's jump in now in the console here,

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.240
I'm going to go to systems Manager,

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.910
and this brings me to the getting started screen for A W S

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.920
systems manager as a whole on the left.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.740
Here you can see the several groups that we talked about in the presentation.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.880
We have operations and management application management.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.990
There's actions and change instances and nodes.

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.240
And then we have shared resource is here at the bottom.

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.020
Now, operations management is not going to be tested over,

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.640
so we're not going to cover that in depth.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340
But if you click on it,

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.540
you can see that it allows us to quickly view our data and then

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.370
take actions against that collected data so we can see what's going

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.980
on in our environment and then run operational commands based on

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.210
that collected data and events.

16
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.640
Now there's also a CloudWatch dashboard and then trusted adviser.

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.780
Well, look at these other two here in the upcoming clips,

18
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.440
but for this one, let's go ahead and go down to instances and notes.

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.960
Now you'll see we have several selections.

20
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.240
I'm going to click on managed instances.

21
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.270
This is where we centrally manage and view our

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.240
instances like it says here at the top.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.150
So to get started, if we follow this link,

24
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.840
it's going to tell us that we need to make.

25
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.140
And I am role or user.

26
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.060
We need an I am instantiate profile for E C two instance and

27
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.020
then we give the instantiate time to go ahead and communicate

28
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.240
with our systems manager account.

29
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.280
So let me go back here and I'm going to set this up.

30
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.140
Now let me load easy to,

31
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.230
and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to launch an instance.

32
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.340
So I'm gonna pause here, spin this up and then resume,

33
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.640
and I'll walk you through what I did.

34
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.200
Alright.

35
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.440
So I've spun up an Amazon Linux to am I on a small instance here,

36
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.640
and what I wanna point out is our I am role.

37
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.400
So if I follow this shortcut here and this is the I am

38
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.210
instantiate profile we attached to this instance you can see

39
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.740
we gave it Amazon s s m full access.

40
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.480
I would not recommend you do this in any of your accounts,

41
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.540
but for the sake of the demo, we're going to use full access.

42
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.500
You should go ahead and try and do the least privileged possible in

43
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.940
order to meet the best practice recommended by a W S.

44
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.740
So after attaching this, I am instantiate profile.

45
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.400
What it's going to do is allow us to have our easy to

46
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.130
instantiate push data to S S M.

47
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.740
So let's go back to systems manager.

48
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.240
And if I go to inventory,

49
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.240
this is how we start building our inventory for our instances.

50
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.340
So what I would do here is I would set up inventory.

51
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.340
I would give it a name.

52
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.490
I would specify my targets here.

53
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.330
So I can select all managed instances I can specify by tag or I can

54
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.740
manually select and you can see our instance here,

55
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.540
listed in the table.

56
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.960
It shows its online.

57
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.320
So it is communicating with S S M.

58
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.040
I'll do select all.

59
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.700
And after we specify our targets,

60
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.740
we can set a schedule to collect our inventory data.

61
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.330
It's important to know that 30 minutes is the shortest amount of

62
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.540
time you can have for collection intervals,

63
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.740
so we'll leave it at 30.

64
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.840
I'll scroll down and you can see we have to specify parameters.

65
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.240
So these are essentially the options we get that we want to

66
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.940
configure collection for On our instances,

67
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.510
it's a very broad amount of parameters that were given we can Look for

68
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.270
applications Networking config If you're on Windows,

69
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.280
you can look at your Windows updates.

70
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.540
Or maybe your Windows services that error running.

71
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.740
You can even scan for files and Windows registry on your instances,

72
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.520
so it's very powerful.

73
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.890
I'll leave the defaults,

74
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.540
I'll scroll down and you can see we can sync our logs to an S3 bucket.

75
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.520
So if we wanted to store this collected information somewhere outside of S S M,

76
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.510
we could do it in S3.

77
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.420
I'll uncheck this.

78
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.960
I'll click on set up inventory and there we go.

79
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.640
It's succeeded.

80
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.670
Now the next thing I want to do here while we give it time to collect

81
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.290
is I want to click enable inventory on all instances Now we might get

82
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.100
an error here because it's pretty recent.

83
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.840
So what I'll do is will pause and then once I'm allowed to do this, I'll resume.

84
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.310
Okay,

85
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.110
You can see now that we have enabled all of our instances to collect

86
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.570
inventory and obviously we only have one instance.

87
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.290
So it's just one that's enabled, but you can also see in the middle here.

88
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.840
We're starting to collect that data that we're looking for on our servers.

89
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.830
We C R O S S R applications that error installed.

90
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.590
And then there's some specific services to windows.

91
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.440
So we have no data for those now behind the scenes here.

92
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.740
What we did is we created an association with our managed instances.

93
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.140
This is a critical step.

94
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.980
By setting up an inventory, it automatically did this for us.

95
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.140
But we can also set up a custom association if we wanted to.

96
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.530
So since we already have some of that inventory collected

97
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.540
we can just create a new association, IDE,

98
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.040
and then use that to connect to S S M as well.

99
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.040
And when we go to this association, IDE,

100
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.220
it just gives us an overview of all of the parameters that we

101
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.540
set when we specified our collection desires.

102
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.040
We can CR resource is so the one instance that's associated with this IDE.

103
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.840
There's parameters.

104
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.740
We have our targets, there's versions.

105
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.600
And then there's execution history.

106
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.740
So we see it ran one time successfully.

107
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.140
So now we have this ability to dig in to our configuration settings on our

108
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.940
servers without having to connect into the servers themselves.

109
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.810
So go ahead.

110
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.440
I recommend you experiment with this and play around with it.

111
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.840
It's a handy tool,

112
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.950
and you will more than likely be asked some exam questions on it.

113
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.900
If you take the solutions architect professional exam for now,

114
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:11.000
we'll end here and in the next clip will pick back up by running some automation commands on our instance.
