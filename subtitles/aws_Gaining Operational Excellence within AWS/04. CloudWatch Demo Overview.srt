[Autogenerated] welcome back,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,990
since we have a good understanding of some of the key

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,280
concepts of CloudWatch and what CloudWatch does,

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,440
let's go ahead and dive in on getting hands on experience within the service.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:19,810
Now,

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,170
some of the demos that you're going to see here and hopefully take part

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,500
in our we're going to explore the different name,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,940
spaces and metrics that error offered by CloudWatch.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,740
We're going to create a dashboard with specific metrics that we deem important.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,340
And then we'll go ahead and set up a CloudWatch alarm to

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,340
send out a notification to a made up admin.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,550
And in this case, it will be me.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,890
So without further ado,

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:00,000
let's go ahead and wrap up here and let's begin diving into interacting with Amazon CloudWatch.
