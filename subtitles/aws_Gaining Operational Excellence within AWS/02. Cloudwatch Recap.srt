[Autogenerated] So in this short clip,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,150
let's just have a quick recap on what CloudWatch is and how we can use it.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,630
Now.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,750
CloudWatch is a service that monitors are a W s resource is as well

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,610
as our applications that were running on A W s.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,540
And it does this in real time.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,760
Now it allows us to collect and then track certain metrics that

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,040
are important to us in order to gain that operational excellence

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,170
and building off of this we can.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,520
Then create alarms based on those collected metrics

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,080
to alert us whenever we need it.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,300
So, for instance, if we see some high CPU usage in an auto scaling group,

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,540
we might want to create an alarm that takes an action.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,160
And we will dive into that a little bit deeper here in the upcoming clips.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,060
The next thing it allows us to do is visualized resource utilization.

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,240
So we can see how much of a specific resource is being used.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,290
Next, we have the ability to measure application performance.

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,970
So we can see how well our applications are performing within our services.

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,180
And then finally we have the ability to maintain operational health.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,040
So we're going to be able to leverage CloudWatch to

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,940
keep our systems healthy and running, which is always a good thing.

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,120
Now let's go ahead.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:40,000
We're going to wrap up here and in the next clip will start discussing the key CloudWatch concepts.
