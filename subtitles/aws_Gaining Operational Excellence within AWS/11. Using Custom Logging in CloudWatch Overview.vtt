00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.040
[Autogenerated] Now let's move on to custom logging within CloudWatch.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.140
Now we know that CloudWatch contains logs,

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.620
but what's cool about it is we can actually push our own

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.500
custom logging to CloudWatch for us to use.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.950
Now,

6
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.810
this is very useful in enterprises where we want to measure

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.540
specific metrics that error not offered by CloudWatch.

8
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.540
So we have our CloudWatch services,

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.550
and then we obviously have Our aws resource is here that have

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.940
a native built in CloudWatch integration.

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.000
But then we have our data center on premise.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.780
Resource is like maybe some of our servers,

13
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.000
like VMS or rack servers or even i o t sensors that live in

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.140
a warehouse somewhere reporting data.

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Now, these utilize what's called the CloudWatch agent.

16
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.430
Now,

17
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.890
this is something we configure on our servers in our resource is so

18
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.370
we can push data to CloudWatch to capture it in R.

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.550
A.

20
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.040
W s account for aggregated view.

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.920
Now, we're gonna go ahead and move on to a demo so I can show you how this works,

22
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.110
and we're gonna look at pushing custom logs to

23
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.510
CloudWatch from an on premise server.

24
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.070
Now, in this demo, it's going to be an easy to instance,

25
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.440
because that's just easier to do.

26
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.490
But we're going to pretend that it's on Prem and I'm

27
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.000
going to send a custom log to AWS, so let's go ahead and move on to that clip now.
