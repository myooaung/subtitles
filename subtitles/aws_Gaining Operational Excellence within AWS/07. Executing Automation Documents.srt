1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,210
[Autogenerated] Okay, let's dive into actions and change.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,440
Now, the first thing that I want to talk about is our maintenance Windows.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,180
Now, I'm not going to create one.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,150
But this is where we create our maintenance window for

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,390
our patch manager if we want one, and then we have change calendar,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,820
which is a new service.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,540
So you're not going to be tested over it anytime soon.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,640
We'll go ahead and look at it, though from an overview.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,340
And if you read, you'll see,

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,720
it allows us to control our changes specifically when

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,110
they happen on a calendar date.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,740
Now, the big piece I want to touch on here is automation.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:46,540
Now, automation, as you can tell, is fleet wide automation for common tasks.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,690
So let's just go ahead and demo What that means when I execute,

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,140
it shows what's owned by us and Amazon, or even shared.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,550
We have our categories on the left and then our

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,540
automation documents here on the right.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,510
Now these documents are shared resource documents within S S M.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,940
They all utilize run commands in the background.

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,140
The difference is these are usually doing more than one step.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,160
So, for instance,

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,240
if I choose instantiate Let's create a managed Linux instantiate.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,270
I scroll down we can see that we have our document details.

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,120
I'll use the default versioning and then we can

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,870
specify our execution that we want.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,870
I'll do a simple we specify the A M D that we want.

27
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,630
So let me copy this in here.

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,340
And this is just the latest Amazon Linux two OS am I IDE.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,740
We'll leave the default BBC.

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,140
We'll use the default role name that's going to be created.

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,130
Our security group, which is fine we can specify our instance.

32
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,040
Type.

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,790
We have to specify a keep your name so we'll use the

34
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,340
same as I used for my other one.

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,540
We're allowing remote access from anywhere,

36
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,440
which is fine because I'll delete this.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,340
We specify an automation role we want this to use,

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,130
which you can see is optional.

39
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,770
This will just use my permissions and we can specify a

40
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,310
default sub net that we want to use.

41
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,340
I'll leave this at default.

42
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,500
I'll click on execute and what I'll do.

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,950
I'm gonna pause here and then I'll resume after this

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,340
is completed and we'll take a look.

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,840
Okay,

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,620
so it's completed now and we see it's successful so let me go

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,990
to Easy to let me refresh And there we go.

48
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,000
There's our new instance we just executed that

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,440
automation for So if I click on it,

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,600
we see our I am role that we went ahead and used.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,700
We see our security group that was created in our AM I IDE

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,540
that we used now an interesting fact here.

53
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,760
So what this actually did in the background is it created a

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,190
CloudFormation stack managed by a W s in the background to create

55
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:14,650
our resource is and then it went ahead and deleted that stack

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,340
after the resource is were created.

57
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,620
So that's kind of the workings in the back end.

58
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,340
And we'll talk about CloudFormation here in the next module.

59
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,430
We'll go ahead and in this clip here and in the next clip,

60
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,050
I'll go ahead and install the S S M agent on a server that

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,550
will use to mimic an on Prem server.

62
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,040
So I'll use easy to,

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,000
but I'll remove the default installation and then manually install it and configure it
