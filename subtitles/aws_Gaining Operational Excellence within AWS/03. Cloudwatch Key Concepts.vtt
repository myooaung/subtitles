00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.010
[Autogenerated] Okay, let's continue on.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.420
Let's go ahead and discuss the key CloudWatch concepts that are

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.040
important to know for any architect within a W s.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.540
Now AWS provides six key concepts that we need to understand.

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:24.320
The first is name spaces, and this is simply a container for a CloudWatch metric.

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.050
So a W S uses name spaces to differentiate the different

7
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.640
metrics that they allow us to collect and track.

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.970
The next one we have is metrics.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.520
Now metrics are exactly what they sound like and they represent a time ordered,

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.270
which is important a time ordered set of data points that get

11
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.520
pushed to CloudWatch for us to visualize.

12
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.980
The next key concept is dimensions.

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.120
Now dimensions are simply a name value pair that is part of a metric now,

14
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.650
a quick way to think of dimensions is a category for certain

15
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.240
characteristics that each metric contains.

16
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.730
Fourth,

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.530
we we have statistics and statistics are simply aggregated data from our

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.630
metrics that we collect over a certain period of time.

19
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.000
So an example of a statistic would be a minimum,

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.640
or maybe an average of a certain metric that were measuring.

21
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.850
The next thing we have is percentiles now a percentile simply indicates,

22
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.840
are standing of a value in a given dataset,

23
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.810
and we'll dive into this a little bit deeper here later on.

24
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.470
The final key concept that we're going to cover is alarms.

25
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.010
Now.

26
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.390
I'm sure it's self-explanatory,

27
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.640
but an alarm is something we create to initiate an action on our behalf,

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.800
and we set them up by watching certain metrics over

29
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.080
a time period that we specify.

30
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.520
It's important to know that we're going to cover all of these throughout this

31
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.960
module and you'll see within the console what those look like,

32
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:20.000
as well as gain some hands on experience in interacting with them. Let's go ahead and wrap up, and I'll see you in the next clip.
