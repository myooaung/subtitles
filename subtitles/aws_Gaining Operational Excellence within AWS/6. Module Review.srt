[Autogenerated] awesome.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,140
You have now completed the second module in this gaining

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,770
operational excellence within a W S course before we officially

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,640
in this and move on to the next module.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,840
Let's just have a quick recap on what we learned.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,120
We learned that CloudTrail helps us enable

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,290
governance compliance and risk auditing.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,810
And we explored how it does that within our own A.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,070
W s accounts.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,450
We learned that CloudTrail is actually turned on by

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,940
default in all AWS accounts upon creation.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,680
But we also learned that there are some limitations to that default trail.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,550
We went ahead and got some practice on creating our very own

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,540
trails to customize our options to our liking.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,690
We learned that we need to utilize organizational

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,320
trails for centralized logging.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,140
So the master account or one other central account that you might choose,

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,240
like a security based account,

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,940
can store all of those CloudTrail logs in their very own buckets.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,440
So then you have an aggregated view of your logs,

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,140
and that would be from all sub accounts.

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,440
So it allows for a lot of customization.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,620
And then finally,

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,750
we learned that we want to always enable S3 log delivery and log

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,740
validation within our CloudTrail in our accounts.

26
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,050
This will ensure that we have long term storage as well as protection against

27
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:39,000
anyone trying to manipulate the data within those log files. So let's end here, and I'll see you in the next module.
