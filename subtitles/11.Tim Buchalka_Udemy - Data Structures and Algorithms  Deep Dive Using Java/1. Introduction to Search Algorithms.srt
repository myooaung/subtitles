00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,581
(upbeat music)
2

2

00:00:02,581  -->  00:00:05,998
(keyboard keys clicking)
3

3

00:00:08,176  -->  00:00:10,690
<v Sarah>All right, we're going to take a break now</v>
4

4

00:00:10,690  -->  00:00:12,710
and look at search algorithms.
5

5

00:00:12,710  -->  00:00:14,750
So what does a search algorithm do?
6

6

00:00:14,750  -->  00:00:18,520
Well, a search algorithm will find a value
7

7

00:00:18,520  -->  00:00:20,250
in a data structure
8

8

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:23,850
and so the search algorithms we'll look at will find a value
9

9

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:24,900
in an array.
10

10

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:27,090
Now you can use them to search linked lists
11

11

00:00:27,090  -->  00:00:30,240
and other data structures but we'll look at arrays.
12

12

00:00:30,240  -->  00:00:32,140
We're not gonna look at as many algorithms
13

13

00:00:32,140  -->  00:00:35,530
as we did for sort because there is one search algorithm
14

14

00:00:35,530  -->  00:00:37,350
that performs really, really well
15

15

00:00:37,350  -->  00:00:40,730
and so we're going to look at the linear search algorithm
16

16

00:00:40,730  -->  00:00:43,510
and then we're going to look at the binary search algorithm.
17

17

00:00:43,510  -->  00:00:44,700
So let's jump right in.
18

18

00:00:44,700  -->  00:00:46,250
I'll see you in the next video.
