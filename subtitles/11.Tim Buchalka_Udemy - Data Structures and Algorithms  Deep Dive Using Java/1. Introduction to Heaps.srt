(upbeat music)

00:00:02,558  -->  00:00:04,657
(keyboard keys clicking)

<v Sarah>In this section we're going</v>
4

4

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:07,930
to take a look at heaps.
5

5

00:00:07,930  -->  00:00:09,940
Now heaps have nothing to do with memory.
6

6

00:00:09,940  -->  00:00:12,160
You may have heard the term heap discussed
7

7

00:00:12,160  -->  00:00:13,540
in relation to memory.
8

8

00:00:13,540  -->  00:00:15,870
This has absolutely no relation to that.
9

9

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:19,490
A heap is a special type of binary tree
10

10

00:00:19,490  -->  00:00:21,140
and so that's what we're gonna take a look at
11

11

00:00:21,140  -->  00:00:21,973
in this section.
12

12

00:00:21,973  -->  00:00:25,220
We'll start by discussing what a heap is
13

13

00:00:25,220  -->  00:00:26,970
and then we'll code a simple heap.
14

14

00:00:26,970  -->  00:00:29,503
So let's get going, I'll see you in the next video.
