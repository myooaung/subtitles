WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.020
So when we talk about a book, what does that mean?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.300
So if you can go to a vogue.com,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.965
you will see this page over here.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:09.825
This is the landing page for Upwork.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.685
If you are new, but sin,

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:17.700
someone knew who's registering to upload to take on sign-up and go from there.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.390
So I also already managed to sign up on these profiles are just basic stuff.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.300
Just follow, follow to the wizard that Africa has provided

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.320
you some current login using my email address.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.550
So this is my backup profile.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.920
It's not something that I use on my basis.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.490
But I will be using this as a part of this course so that I can explain you.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.625
How do you do everything from the start?

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.240
So even though I and I don't use this for file,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.515
you can see I still have some interview request and available connects.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:02.540
So the Kinects are basically the amount of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.120
bedding that you can do by month on job.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.680
So if, for example,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.795
if this is a job looking for a web designer,

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.050
you can bid once and you will.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.155
That would cost you one connect.

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:27.515
So before even jumping onto how do you like make you profile better our start bit,

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:30.845
what kind of projects that we want to walk on.

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:35.310
So this is a good keyword, automated testing.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.110
So when you search for Tony testing,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.135
we will find some of the jobs over here.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:50.915
Some jobs are our li and some jobs are like fixed price.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:56.615
So let's see.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.865
So most of them are hourly.

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.680
When it says fixed price,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.520
this estimated budget dislike really low.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.650
So I'll already be embodied.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.345
Looking at them at this point is more about effort versus value.

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:13.835
So let's look at this one,

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:16.800
software development engineering test.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:26.105
So in this job is saying that they could pay up to 12k.

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:31.530
And to apply for this,

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.530
we need to have the knowledge about QA automation.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.600
Somewhere it is Kafka nor G,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.465
S by D. These are like extra,

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.520
mainly what were they looking for?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.895
A strong proficiency of desperate looks.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:53.675
So It's an interesting bit that you can capture from here is, are these keywords.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:55.715
So it their decimal.

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:58.565
So I'm gonna start in local weaker.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:00.720
Some.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:12.560
Let's see. So like

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.880
do you use vgs,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:22.445
you quote for Mickey Montezuma or Damasio February,

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:25.280
I liked Google, uses one.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.740
So if we talk about keywords,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.380
because Job has EPA testing.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.570
Javascript automation framework,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.470
end to end testing,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.800
testing, testing, load testing.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:07.115
Qe, proclamation of gray,

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:11.840
Q8, casting, site breaths.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.280
We're going to leave some of the other ones to bet because

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.270
they convey specific to this job.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.210
So I'm looking for keywords which I generate.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.520
We get add MySQL and radius over here,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.580
but that does just extra keywords.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.900
I know that from my experience,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.835
but if you even add them to your profile,

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:38.090
it would be a benefit for you.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.350
It doesn't matter. For, for me,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.540
b2 are a relatively bigger right? Study.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.910
So let's look at another job.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.680
Sr tuition desks are needed to write test scripts.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.310
Here the keyword is automation frameworks,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.145
so we have already covered it and JavaScript and,

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:09.960
and the one that we are missing is that testing.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.090
And let's go to another one.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.070
So this is more about how do you do keyword research.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.685
So we've got API testing, we've got webcasting.

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:29.369
But automation for a MOOC and to investing.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.490
Selenium is some thing that didn't look for it. So I'm going to put deck.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.120
And selenium are grammars

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:47.510
or software engineer performance testing.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.955
Let's us. Ok.

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:53.735
So thats execution.

00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:55.940
We already got API gravity,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.540
load testing, performance testing.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.660
And we only have Selenium and Chrome.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.445
So if you have only covered one p,

00:06:13.445 --> 00:06:17.675
that would be enough for you to like start with your profile.

00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:21.920
So these are the main keywords that you're Profiles should have.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.760
Now, if you look at the first job again,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.040
what what is the person looking for?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.410
So he's looking for Senior Software Development Engineer in test.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.000
Okay.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.225
So that's his requirement.

00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:44.580
What is this personality form is looking for senior automation tester.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.220
Now, this one as dead is

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.740
basically Software Development Engineering Test Automation Engineer.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.000
So now, when we talk about their titles,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.800
what kind of titles should be have?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.695
So bridles is like a tagline for your profile.

00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:12.980
So I go, let's this, look at all of them.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.280
So this person needs Software.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.700
Engineer in Test.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.365
In-person needs automation.

00:07:30.365 --> 00:07:36.120
Has to herd is instead, as dead.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.560
Software development engineering has

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.835
off to our software development engineering because here there,

00:07:43.835 --> 00:07:45.815
that's basically the same thing.

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:48.720
And automation engineer,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.660
quality engineer will call that but not

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:05.490
the easiest fixes like Oldham menu let documented Qe.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.225
Okay, I think that's fine.

00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:16.070
So we've got a deadline.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.455
We've gotta keywords, nel,

00:08:18.455 --> 00:08:21.450
quadro, meta description, file profile.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.175
The blind is already writing,

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:29.375
are your profile for you.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.465
You don't have to like come up with your own wordings.

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:39.934
So it says my multi is an margin first crypto x change,

00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:41.465
fade out of frustration.

00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:43.475
The lack of products.

00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:45.830
No user-centered development and

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.565
transparency is just describing about his product or here.

00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:51.335
We are going to looking for.

00:08:51.335 --> 00:08:54.515
Now after this, what he's going to say is,

00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:58.130
is going to be a part of the perfectly or provide

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.740
a Senior Software Development Engineer in desk to develop and maintain test automation.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.070
Same truly, humans be self-driven.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.690
There does have motivation.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.520
You're looking voting members were comfortable.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:17.180
This you will have part of now up

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:25.080
until here using the initiative in seeing to the completion, so on cooperatives.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.950
And then that he's describes what,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:42.725
what else should be able to understand software in general is d blood cooled,

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:45.185
augmented with PDF files.

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:50.760
As debt should understand customer usage models that are done.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:00.770
Because gotten a copy paste some of the data we're and skills, they keep on changing.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.825
So humbling, gone dead.

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:05.520
Let's look another one.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.100
To come.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.675
The IGS.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:11.770
No, that wasn't much information.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.665
We're experiencing.

00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:16.415
Automation testing.

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:19.295
And this ten based scenario,

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:22.490
edge case coverage and eastern business requirement.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.620
These are good ones.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.150
Nerdy engineer needed to build an automated test suite.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.865
Now, when he says we need

00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:43.160
an engineer to help us build and mature our automated test suite.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.800
Ok, so there's not a sorry.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.340
There hasn't been any specification about like what kind of engine AND need.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.220
Okay.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.930
Let's look at this one.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.455
Yeah.

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:06.575
I think we have covered most of the MOU.

00:11:06.575 --> 00:11:10.620
Now let's look at the tricks in the next block.
