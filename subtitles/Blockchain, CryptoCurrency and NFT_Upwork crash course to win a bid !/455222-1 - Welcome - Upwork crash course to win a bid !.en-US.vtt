00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
Hello again. So in this video we will learn how do you put yourself out there.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.800
By that, I mean,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.470
you need up profile where you can

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.835
actually go to your client and ask them for the projects.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:20.760
So one of the ways is to register yourself on a freelancing website like Upwork,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.295
which I will be covering in this course.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.665
I will teach you how to create your profile.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.970
How do you make your profile more attractive?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.300
So use the words that client is using.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.505
All the, don't use your own words.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:41.105
Because searching, using the terminologies that they understand better.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.570
And if you use the same technologies in your profile,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.435
they will find it easy to find it.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.765
Okay, so I'm going to cover that.

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:52.775
How do you create a willing profile?

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.840
And also, mankind has posted a project.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.830
How do you read the description of that project?

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.875
How do you understand what is the requirement and how do you write a winning proposal?

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:11.370
And I will be covering all this in this video.
