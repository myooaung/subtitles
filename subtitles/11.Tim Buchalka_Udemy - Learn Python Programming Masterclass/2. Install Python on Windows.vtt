00:00:05.220  -->  00:00:07.350
In this video we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:10.020
and download and install Python for the
3

3

00:00:10.020  -->  00:00:12.210
Windows platform. Now if you're running a
4

4

00:00:12.210  -->  00:00:15.110
Mac or running a Linux computer, do refer
5

5

00:00:15.110  -->  00:00:16.500
to the separate videos in this section
6

6

00:00:16.500  -->  00:00:18.390
of the course and that's because the
7

7

00:00:18.390  -->  00:00:19.770
process of downloading and installing
8

8

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:21.710
path are slightly different for those
9

9

00:00:21.710  -->  00:00:23.840
platforms, but if you run in Windows
10

10

00:00:23.840  -->  00:00:26.430
follow along in this video. So the first
11

11

00:00:26.430  -->  00:00:29.750
thing to do is go to python.org,
12

12

00:00:29.750  -->  00:00:32.370
and once you get there you can
13

13

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:34.080
move your mouse down to downloads and
14

14

00:00:34.080  -->  00:00:35.520
you can see a little pop-up window came
15

15

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:37.740
up and come over here and select what is
16

16

00:00:37.740  -->  00:00:39.480
the latest version and you can see
17

17

00:00:39.480  -->  00:00:41.210
currently it's showing Python to three
18

18

00:00:41.210  -->  00:00:43.350
point six point two, so I'm going to
19

19

00:00:43.350  -->  00:00:45.740
click that then I'm going to actually
20

20

00:00:45.740  -->  00:00:48.710
save this and while that's downloading,
21

21

00:00:48.710  -->  00:00:51.030
all that shouldn't take long, I just want
22

22

00:00:51.030  -->  00:00:53.190
to mention that you probably don't want
23

23

00:00:53.190  -->  00:00:54.510
or you certainly don't want to download
24

24

00:00:54.510  -->  00:00:57.080
Python 2. In this course we're going to
25

25

00:00:57.080  -->  00:00:59.810
be going through and using Python 3,
26

26

00:00:59.810  -->  00:01:01.190
but do keep in mind that we'll talk a
27

27

00:01:01.190  -->  00:01:02.870
little bit from time to time about the
28

28

00:01:02.870  -->  00:01:05.700
older version Python, but in general we
29

29

00:01:05.700  -->  00:01:07.260
definitely want you to download and use
30

30

00:01:07.260  -->  00:01:09.450
Python 3, because that's the majority of
31

31

00:01:09.450  -->  00:01:11.070
the courses and of course it's the most
32

32

00:01:11.070  -->  00:01:12.930
recent version. Alright so down on the
33

33

00:01:12.930  -->  00:01:14.120
bottom you can see that's now finished
34

34

00:01:14.120  -->  00:01:16.790
downloading, so I'm going to click on run,
35

35

00:01:16.790  -->  00:01:18.930
now you click this little option that will
36

36

00:01:18.930  -->  00:01:21.360
pop up, it gives you the directory where
37

37

00:01:21.360  -->  00:01:23.010
it's going to install the files, you can
38

38

00:01:23.010  -->  00:01:25.440
choose a custom installation, you don't
39

39

00:01:25.440  -->  00:01:26.910
really need to do that, anything you
40

40

00:01:26.910  -->  00:01:28.230
really need to do here is just click on
41

41

00:01:28.230  -->  00:01:29.970
this little checkbox, I mean it very
42

42

00:01:29.970  -->  00:01:31.730
important that you do that to add python
43

43

00:01:31.730  -->  00:01:34.940
3.6 to path, so that's been checked and
44

44

00:01:34.940  -->  00:01:35.970
they've come up here and click on
45

45

00:01:35.970  -->  00:01:37.910
install now, noting that it's actually
46

46

00:01:37.910  -->  00:01:40.550
installing it there in my local app data
47

47

00:01:40.550  -->  00:01:43.230
folder. So click on install now,
48

48

00:01:43.230  -->  00:01:44.580
you didn't see that most likely but there's
49

49

00:01:44.580  -->  00:01:45.950
a little pop-up that came up and said
50

50

00:01:45.950  -->  00:01:47.450
I had to click on yes to allow it to
51

51

00:01:47.450  -->  00:01:50.330
continue installing, so I clicked on that
52

52

00:01:50.330  -->  00:01:51.440
and it's now going through the process,
53

53

00:01:51.440  -->  00:01:54.260
it's a fairly fast process I won't take
54

54

00:01:54.260  -->  00:01:58.820
too long to finish.
55

55

00:01:58.820  -->  00:02:00.730
Alright, so at this point you can see
56

56

00:02:00.730  -->  00:02:02.830
that it's actually now finished and
57

57

00:02:02.830  -->  00:02:04.870
successfully installed and we just click
58

58

00:02:04.870  -->  00:02:06.520
on close, we can ignore this disabled
59

59

00:02:06.520  -->  00:02:08.200
path length limit, we don't need to worry
60

60

00:02:08.200  -->  00:02:10.640
about that, click on close and what we
61

61

00:02:10.640  -->  00:02:12.530
want to do now is just verify that
62

62

00:02:12.530  -->  00:02:14.570
Python has been correctly installed and
63

63

00:02:14.570  -->  00:02:16.790
that we can access it and one quick way
64

64

00:02:16.790  -->  00:02:18.560
to do that is to come over here and
65

65

00:02:18.560  -->  00:02:20.630
click on your Windows icon right-click
66

66

00:02:20.630  -->  00:02:23.120
it and select run, that should work on
67

67

00:02:23.120  -->  00:02:25.010
most versions of Windows but just make
68

68

00:02:25.010  -->  00:02:27.020
sure that you get this option to run and
69

69

00:02:27.020  -->  00:02:28.990
type in that little window a little
70

70

00:02:28.990  -->  00:02:31.700
while the order should say CMD which is
71

71

00:02:31.700  -->  00:02:33.960
an abbreviation for command press enter
72

72

00:02:33.960  -->  00:02:36.740
that opens up a command window and if we
73

73

00:02:36.740  -->  00:02:40.040
just type in Python now, python press
74

74

00:02:40.040  -->  00:02:42.320
enter you can see in my case it's came
75

75

00:02:42.320  -->  00:02:44.020
up and said python three point six point
76

76

00:02:44.020  -->  00:02:46.670
two. So that's a visual confirmation that
77

77

00:02:46.670  -->  00:02:48.400
python has been successfully installed.
78

78

00:02:48.400  -->  00:02:50.680
Now I'm going to exit out of this by
79

79

00:02:50.680  -->  00:02:52.640
typing exit then left to right
80

80

00:02:52.640  -->  00:02:55.160
parenthesis press enter and if you
81

81

00:02:55.160  -->  00:02:56.710
happen to type Python but you've got
82

82

00:02:56.710  -->  00:02:57.980
something like this and I'm just going
83

83

00:02:57.980  -->  00:03:01.040
to type it incorrect command, so if you
84

84

00:03:01.040  -->  00:03:02.630
type Python and you got python is not
85

85

00:03:02.630  -->  00:03:03.980
recognized as an internal or external
86

86

00:03:03.980  -->  00:03:07.300
command, two things probably you or one
87

87

00:03:07.300  -->  00:03:09.230
of two things may have occurred firstly
88

88

00:03:09.230  -->  00:03:10.540
you may not have click on that add to
89

89

00:03:10.540  -->  00:03:12.260
path, which was on that first checkbox
90

90

00:03:12.260  -->  00:03:14.710
that came up when were installing python
91

91

00:03:14.710  -->  00:03:17.240
and secondly, you may need to reboot your
92

92

00:03:17.240  -->  00:03:19.610
computer for the change to take effect.
93

93

00:03:19.610  -->  00:03:22.700
So first things first would be to reboot
94

94

00:03:22.700  -->  00:03:24.580
and see and go back into the command
95

95

00:03:24.580  -->  00:03:26.180
window and see whether that fixes the
96

96

00:03:26.180  -->  00:03:28.490
problem, if that doesn't fix it you might
97

97

00:03:28.490  -->  00:03:29.420
want to go through the process of
98

98

00:03:29.420  -->  00:03:31.360
uninstalling and reinstalling python and
99

99

00:03:31.360  -->  00:03:33.460
making sure that this time you click on
100

100

00:03:33.460  -->  00:03:35.180
that add to path checkbox to make sure
101

101

00:03:35.180  -->  00:03:36.740
that's ticked and you should find in
102

102

00:03:36.740  -->  00:03:38.630
most cases that will fix the problem,
103

103

00:03:38.630  -->  00:03:39.770
for once I'm going to type exit there to
104

104

00:03:39.770  -->  00:03:42.380
close down the command window at this
105

105

00:03:42.380  -->  00:03:43.300
point we're done.
106

106

00:03:43.300  -->  00:03:44.930
So we're done with the installation of
107

107

00:03:44.930  -->  00:03:48.820
Python and we can move on to the next video.
