00:00:05.160  -->  00:00:07.360
in the last video we saw how composition
2

2

00:00:07.360  -->  00:00:09.820
is a powerful technique for combining
3

3

00:00:09.820  -->  00:00:11.890
objects to create something more complex
4

4

00:00:11.890  -->  00:00:14.830
and we built up a HTML document from
5

5

00:00:14.830  -->  00:00:16.960
the three classes that it's composed of
6

6

00:00:16.960  -->  00:00:20.920
the doctype a head element and a body now
7

7

00:00:20.920  -->  00:00:23.590
aggregation is very similar and is often
8

8

00:00:23.590  -->  00:00:26.140
described as a weak form of composition
9

9

00:00:26.140  -->  00:00:29.260
now with composition the objects that another
10

10

00:00:29.260  -->  00:00:31.750
object is composed of don't exist
11

11

00:00:31.750  -->  00:00:35.620
outside of their container so in our
12

12

00:00:35.620  -->  00:00:39.400
example looking down here on line 50
13

13

00:00:39.400  -->  00:00:42.910
the init method for HTML doc there
14

14

00:00:42.910  -->  00:00:45.760
instances of a doctype which is created
15

15

00:00:45.760  -->  00:00:48.370
in a HTML doc init method on line 51 as i
16

16

00:00:48.370  -->  00:00:51.120
mentioned and a head and a body created
17

17

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:54.280
on the next two lines so instances of
18

18

00:00:54.280  -->  00:00:56.850
all three classes exist but they only
19

19

00:00:56.850  -->  00:01:00.100
exist within the context of our HTML
20

20

00:01:00.100  -->  00:01:04.000
doc object my_page now if we
21

21

00:01:04.000  -->  00:01:06.220
delete my_page then those
22

22

00:01:06.220  -->  00:01:08.280
three instances will no longer exist
23

23

00:01:08.280  -->  00:01:11.380
either now in our program we've
24

24

00:01:11.380  -->  00:01:13.240
indicated at the three instance
25

25

00:01:13.240  -->  00:01:16.020
variables self dot underscored doc _
26

26

00:01:16.020  -->  00:01:19.060
type self._head and
27

27

00:01:19.060  -->  00:01:21.550
self dot _ body are quote unqote
28

28

00:01:21.550  -->  00:01:22.770
private
29

29

00:01:22.770  -->  00:01:26.140
now as we learned previously this is python
30

30

00:01:26.140  -->  00:01:27.660
and so they're not really private as
31

31

00:01:27.660  -->  00:01:30.310
such but there should be treated as if
32

32

00:01:30.310  -->  00:01:32.800
they are now this program was written in
33

33

00:01:32.800  -->  00:01:35.020
java for example there'd be no way to
34

34

00:01:35.020  -->  00:01:37.230
change those fields from outside the
35

35

00:01:37.230  -->  00:01:40.060
HTML dot class now I mention that
36

36

00:01:40.060  -->  00:01:41.830
because we can change this program to
37

37

00:01:41.830  -->  00:01:44.620
use aggregation without changing the
38

38

00:01:44.620  -->  00:01:47.620
HTML dot class in Java for example the
39

39

00:01:47.620  -->  00:01:49.270
code will have to be written a bit
40

40

00:01:49.270  -->  00:01:52.120
differently so in Python the distinction
41

41

00:01:52.120  -->  00:01:54.520
between aggregation and composition can
42

42

00:01:54.520  -->  00:01:58.200
blur slightly in Python focus more on
43

43

00:01:58.200  -->  00:02:00.520
the intent rather than what's possible
44

44

00:02:00.520  -->  00:02:02.770
with language that's because in Python
45

45

00:02:02.770  -->  00:02:04.930
just about anything is possible
46

46

00:02:04.930  -->  00:02:07.800
alright so let's use aggregation now
47

47

00:02:07.800  -->  00:02:10.450
to get our documents a new content then
48

48

00:02:10.450  -->  00:02:12.720
will go ahead and rewrite the class so
49

49

00:02:12.720  -->  00:02:14.980
that it uses aggregation rather than
50

50

00:02:14.980  -->  00:02:16.320
composition
51

51

00:02:16.320  -->  00:02:17.550
and then we're going to add some more
52

52

00:02:17.550  -->  00:02:20.070
code at the end of the program here so
53

53

00:02:20.070  -->  00:02:23.970
right down to the bottom and let's
54

54

00:02:23.970  -->  00:02:25.740
start here on line 74 we're going to type
55

55

00:02:25.740  -->  00:02:30.600
new....
56

56

00:02:30.600  -->  00:02:34.440
....
57

57

00:02:34.440  -->  00:02:37.800
...
58

58

00:02:37.800  -->  00:02:51.930
...
59

59

00:02:51.930  -->  00:02:54.180
....
60

60

00:02:54.180  -->  00:02:57.480
...
61

61

00:02:57.480  -->  00:03:21.210
...
62

62

00:03:21.210  -->  00:03:22.860
....
63

63

00:03:22.860  -->  00:03:26.070
...
64

64

00:03:26.070  -->  00:05:15.640
...
65

65

00:05:15.640  -->  00:05:17.320
alright so you can see what we've done
66

66

00:05:17.320  -->  00:05:19.960
there we created a new instance of the
67

67

00:05:19.960  -->  00:05:22.180
body class called new_body
68

68

00:05:22.180  -->  00:05:24.880
then we added to several tags to it we
69

69

00:05:24.880  -->  00:05:27.250
then assign the new_body object to our
70

70

00:05:27.250  -->  00:05:29.320
documents_body attributed
71

71

00:05:29.320  -->  00:05:31.840
directly if you run this program now
72

72

00:05:31.840  -->  00:05:39.490
you've see we got a test 2 . HTML showing
73

73

00:05:39.490  -->  00:05:41.620
their now and if I right click that now
74

74

00:05:41.620  -->  00:05:44.800
and open in browser and select a
75

75

00:05:44.800  -->  00:05:46.870
chrome in my case you select whichever
76

76

00:05:46.870  -->  00:05:50.380
browsers relevant you can see that we've
77

77

00:05:50.380  -->  00:05:51.730
got the new output showing their
78

78

00:05:51.730  -->  00:05:55.810
let's just go back to the code now so
79

79

00:05:55.810  -->  00:05:57.940
the point here is that if the my_
80

80

00:05:57.940  -->  00:06:00.190
page object is deleted then the
81

81

00:06:00.190  -->  00:06:02.200
new _ body object continues to
82

82

00:06:02.200  -->  00:06:04.450
exist and could actually be used in
83

83

00:06:04.450  -->  00:06:06.280
another document if we wanted to do that
84

84

00:06:06.280  -->  00:06:08.920
now as I said in python the
85

85

00:06:08.920  -->  00:06:11.080
distinction can get a little bit blurred
86

86

00:06:11.080  -->  00:06:13.960
so what I'm going to do is change the HTML dot
87

87

00:06:13.960  -->  00:06:15.970
class so that it's written to use
88

88

00:06:15.970  -->  00:06:18.280
aggregation rather than composition
89

89

00:06:18.280  -->  00:06:20.320
which is what you'd have to do in
90

90

00:06:20.320  -->  00:06:22.240
languages like Java if you wanted an
91

91

00:06:22.240  -->  00:06:24.340
aggregate class rather than a composite
92

92

00:06:24.340  -->  00:06:28.300
one we go back up to the HTML . class
93

93

00:06:28.300  -->  00:06:30.520
we defined here and what we're
94

94

00:06:30.520  -->  00:06:31.690
going to do first is we're going to
95

95

00:06:31.690  -->  00:06:36.850
remove the title and we're going to add
96

96

00:06:36.850  -->  00:06:38.020
some parameters going to add the
97

97

00:06:38.020  -->  00:06:43.240
doctype the head and the body and then
98

98

00:06:43.240  -->  00:06:45.340
we're going to initialize them so we're
99

99

00:06:45.340  -->  00:06:47.560
going to put...
100

100

00:06:47.560  -->  00:06:50.080
....
101

101

00:06:50.080  -->  00:06:51.880
...
102

102

00:06:51.880  -->  00:06:54.660
....
103

103

00:06:54.660  -->  00:06:56.360
...
104

104

00:06:56.360  -->  00:07:02.450
...
105

105

00:07:02.450  -->  00:07:06.860
....so now that we've done that in our HTML
106

106

00:07:06.860  -->  00:07:09.510
. class we need to provide instances
107

107

00:07:09.510  -->  00:07:12.300
of all three classes when we create a
108

108

00:07:12.300  -->  00:07:15.660
new html doc object now my
109

109

00:07:15.660  -->  00:07:17.130
original code that we have defined down
110

110

00:07:17.130  -->  00:07:19.080
here for my page my _ page
111

111

00:07:19.080  -->  00:07:21.260
won't work now so I'm going to actually
112

112

00:07:21.260  -->  00:07:23.610
comment that out will comment out the
113

113

00:07:23.610  -->  00:07:28.380
entire bit of code there and by doing
114

114

00:07:28.380  -->  00:07:29.990
that you can see these errors further on
115

115

00:07:29.990  -->  00:07:31.070
down in the code but we can ignore
116

116

00:07:31.070  -->  00:07:32.960
them for now because i'm going to go
117

117

00:07:32.960  -->  00:07:35.570
once we've created a new document
118

118

00:07:35.570  -->  00:07:38.760
so below that now i'm going to type in...
119

119

00:07:38.760  -->  00:07:43.010
....
120

120

00:07:43.010  -->  00:07:47.300
..
121

121

00:07:47.300  -->  00:07:49.230
...
122

122

00:07:49.230  -->  00:07:53.450
...
123

123

00:07:53.450  -->  00:07:56.550
...so the are only going to be
124

124

00:07:56.550  -->  00:07:59.210
executed if the if that we defined
125

125

00:07:59.210  -->  00:08:03.080
on line 66 returns true but what we do need to
126

126

00:08:03.080  -->  00:08:05.390
do after the new body the adding of the
127

127

00:08:05.390  -->  00:08:08.850
three tags is we need to assign new doc
128

128

00:08:08.850  -->  00:08:10.130
type so let's go ahead and do that so....
129

129

00:08:10.130  -->  00:08:14.820
...
130

130

00:08:14.820  -->  00:08:28.460
...
131

131

00:08:28.460  -->  00:08:34.350
...so what we should probably should
132

132

00:08:34.350  -->  00:08:35.370
have done with all these code is have
133

133

00:08:35.370  -->  00:08:37.860
it indented anyway so I'm going to just go
134

134

00:08:37.860  -->  00:08:38.940
ahead and do that so we're going to
135

135

00:08:38.940  -->  00:08:42.620
indent to that level and
136

136

00:08:42.620  -->  00:08:43.800
will delete the comment because we no longer
137

137

00:08:43.800  -->  00:08:45.600
need that anymore
138

138

00:08:45.600  -->  00:08:48.060
delete the my page that's because we're
139

139

00:08:48.060  -->  00:08:49.290
going to change the definition of that
140

140

00:08:49.290  -->  00:08:53.810
my page will become...
141

141

00:08:53.810  -->  00:08:57.740
...
142

142

00:08:57.740  -->  00:09:05.680
...
143

143

00:09:05.680  -->  00:09:08.260
we're going to leave the width open
144

144

00:09:08.260  -->  00:09:10.600
there because that's now valid because
145

145

00:09:10.600  -->  00:09:13.420
we've recreated our my_page
146

146

00:09:13.420  -->  00:09:15.460
variable but we will do is just change
147

147

00:09:15.460  -->  00:09:17.110
the filename so its test three .
148

148

00:09:17.110  -->  00:09:17.980
HTML
149

149

00:09:17.980  -->  00:09:20.140
it's not trying to override the previous one
150

150

00:09:20.140  -->  00:09:23.020
we've created right so let's just open
151

151

00:09:23.020  -->  00:09:24.640
the project pane and run to
152

152

00:09:24.640  -->  00:09:29.500
confirm that it does work works ok and
153

153

00:09:29.500  -->  00:09:32.470
got test three dot HTML so let's open in
154

154

00:09:32.470  -->  00:09:36.550
browser open in chrome and we've got
155

155

00:09:36.550  -->  00:09:39.310
working as you can see again we
156

156

00:09:39.310  -->  00:09:40.870
don't see the title bar but we just go
157

157

00:09:40.870  -->  00:09:41.980
back in there
158

158

00:09:41.980  -->  00:09:43.990
view page source you can see that the
159

159

00:09:43.990  -->  00:09:46.240
title is actually showing in the HTML
160

160

00:09:46.240  -->  00:09:47.950
and depending on your browser you may
161

161

00:09:47.950  -->  00:09:50.140
see that title appearing for you but for
162

162

00:09:50.140  -->  00:09:51.130
me the way that I've configured
163

163

00:09:51.130  -->  00:09:56.080
chrome its not showing ok so the
164

164

00:09:56.080  -->  00:09:57.790
difference now is that the objects are
165

165

00:09:57.790  -->  00:10:01.000
created independently of my _ page
166

166

00:10:01.000  -->  00:10:03.550
but then passed to the constructor to
167

167

00:10:03.550  -->  00:10:05.710
create the new document now when it's
168

168

00:10:05.710  -->  00:10:06.700
done that way
169

169

00:10:06.700  -->  00:10:07.930
in other words when the class is
170

170

00:10:07.930  -->  00:10:10.300
rewritten to use aggregation rather than
171

171

00:10:10.300  -->  00:10:12.460
composition then the difference between
172

172

00:10:12.460  -->  00:10:14.980
aggregation and Composition becomes more
173

173

00:10:14.980  -->  00:10:17.740
obvious note that in both cases we
174

174

00:10:17.740  -->  00:10:20.530
still got has a relationships our new
175

175

00:10:20.530  -->  00:10:22.750
my_page object still has a
176

176

00:10:22.750  -->  00:10:25.330
doctype has a head element and has a
177

177

00:10:25.330  -->  00:10:27.760
body it's just what owns those objects
178

178

00:10:27.760  -->  00:10:30.190
that's changed now if we delete the
179

179

00:10:30.190  -->  00:10:32.290
my_page variable the other
180

180

00:10:32.290  -->  00:10:33.940
three objects obviously continue to
181

181

00:10:33.940  -->  00:10:36.040
exist and can be used elsewhere in the
182

182

00:10:36.040  -->  00:10:39.280
program and that's obviously because
183

183

00:10:39.280  -->  00:10:40.990
we've actually defined them as
184

184

00:10:40.990  -->  00:10:46.840
separately here on line 74 line 81 and line 82 so
185

185

00:10:46.840  -->  00:10:48.490
that's aggregation compared to
186

186

00:10:48.490  -->  00:10:51.070
composition so the question now is which
187

187

00:10:51.070  -->  00:10:53.560
one should you use and when and the
188

188

00:10:53.560  -->  00:10:55.510
answer to that is that it depends
189

189

00:10:55.510  -->  00:10:57.670
so in this example you might want the
190

190

00:10:57.670  -->  00:10:59.260
ability to swap out the documents
191

191

00:10:59.260  -->  00:11:02.230
contents that can be useful and web
192

192

00:11:02.230  -->  00:11:04.690
pages often swap out content in response
193

193

00:11:04.690  -->  00:11:08.080
to selections for menus for example now
194

194

00:11:08.080  -->  00:11:10.300
admittedly they tend to work on div tags
195

195

00:11:10.300  -->  00:11:11.950
rather than swapping the entire body
196

196

00:11:11.950  -->  00:11:14.420
section but the principles the same
197

197

00:11:14.420  -->  00:11:16.310
now it's very unlikely that you want to
198

198

00:11:16.310  -->  00:11:18.680
change the doctype so there's no real
199

199

00:11:18.680  -->  00:11:20.510
reason that you couldn't use composition
200

200

00:11:20.510  -->  00:11:22.460
for the doc type and maybe even the head
201

201

00:11:22.460  -->  00:11:24.770
element while using aggregation for the
202

202

00:11:24.770  -->  00:11:27.920
body design a structure of the classes
203

203

00:11:27.920  -->  00:11:30.320
that make up a program is arguably the
204

204

00:11:30.320  -->  00:11:31.940
hardest part of object-oriented
205

205

00:11:31.940  -->  00:11:34.130
programming and you have to think
206

206

00:11:34.130  -->  00:11:36.200
carefully about how the various classes
207

207

00:11:36.200  -->  00:11:38.600
will work together and also what sort of
208

208

00:11:38.600  -->  00:11:41.380
things you want to do with them now
209

209

00:11:41.380  -->  00:11:43.490
sometimes the relationship is obvious
210

210

00:11:43.490  -->  00:11:45.320
thinking back to our player class in the
211

211

00:11:45.320  -->  00:11:47.380
game program we probably want to give
212

212

00:11:47.380  -->  00:11:49.820
the players weapons of some sort
213

213

00:11:49.820  -->  00:11:51.200
now there's an obvious has a
214

214

00:11:51.200  -->  00:11:53.660
relationship there a player will have a
215

215

00:11:53.660  -->  00:11:55.880
weapon now the weapons will probably be
216

216

00:11:55.880  -->  00:11:58.100
strung across the dungeons waiting to be
217

217

00:11:58.100  -->  00:12:00.380
found by the players so they need to exist
218

218

00:12:00.380  -->  00:12:03.380
independently of the players the players
219

219

00:12:03.380  -->  00:12:05.380
will also exchanged their weapons when
220

220

00:12:05.380  -->  00:12:07.160
they stumble across better ones
221

221

00:12:07.160  -->  00:12:09.680
so in that scenario you'd probably be
222

222

00:12:09.680  -->  00:12:12.290
better off choosing aggregation rather
223

223

00:12:12.290  -->  00:12:14.840
than composition but other times such as
224

224

00:12:14.840  -->  00:12:17.030
our document here the relationship is less
225

225

00:12:17.030  -->  00:12:19.460
clear you could make a case for either
226

226

00:12:19.460  -->  00:12:21.530
aggregation or composition when
227

227

00:12:21.530  -->  00:12:23.810
considering the body of a document it
228

228

00:12:23.810  -->  00:12:25.160
really does depend on what you want to
229

229

00:12:25.160  -->  00:12:27.380
do with it as we saw changing the
230

230

00:12:27.380  -->  00:12:29.270
composition relationship to an
231

231

00:12:29.270  -->  00:12:31.040
aggregation one isn't really that
232

232

00:12:31.040  -->  00:12:32.120
difficult
233

233

00:12:32.120  -->  00:12:34.970
we created the test 2 HTML document by
234

234

00:12:34.970  -->  00:12:37.000
accessing the quote-unquote private body
235

235

00:12:37.000  -->  00:12:39.920
attribute and replacing it if you found
236

236

00:12:39.920  -->  00:12:41.780
your class was used like that a lot
237

237

00:12:41.780  -->  00:12:43.670
then you could add a property so that
238

238

00:12:43.670  -->  00:12:45.320
the body attribute was no longer hidden
239

239

00:12:45.320  -->  00:12:47.320
and we saw how to do that a little bit
240

240

00:12:47.320  -->  00:12:49.070
earlier in this section
241

241

00:12:49.070  -->  00:12:50.630
alright so let's move on to the next
