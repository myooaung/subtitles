00:00:04.720  -->  00:00:06.399
In this video, we're gonna go ahead and
2

2

00:00:06.399  -->  00:00:09.549
download and install IntelliJ IDEA which
3

3

00:00:09.549  -->  00:00:10.900
is the editor or the integrated
4

4

00:00:10.900  -->  00:00:13.450
development environment IDE they were
5

5

00:00:13.450  -->  00:00:15.250
going to be using in this course for our
6

6

00:00:15.250  -->  00:00:17.259
programs. Now there are other IDEs
7

7

00:00:17.259  -->  00:00:19.779
available for Python programming and if
8

8

00:00:19.779  -->  00:00:21.609
you're happy with any IDE that perhaps
9

9

00:00:21.609  -->  00:00:23.109
you've already downloaded and are using,
10

10

00:00:23.109  -->  00:00:24.880
that's fine there's no need to install
11

11

00:00:24.880  -->  00:00:27.039
another one, we get to pick one for this
12

12

00:00:27.039  -->  00:00:28.660
course but you can take this course with
13

13

00:00:28.660  -->  00:00:31.720
any IDE that supports Python. So this
14

14

00:00:31.720  -->  00:00:33.280
particular video is for the Linux
15

15

00:00:33.280  -->  00:00:35.140
platform, if you're running a Mac or
16

16

00:00:35.140  -->  00:00:36.339
you're running on Windows there are
17

17

00:00:36.339  -->  00:00:38.350
separate videos for both these operating
18

18

00:00:38.350  -->  00:00:40.540
systems in this course so refer to those
19

19

00:00:40.540  -->  00:00:43.239
videos as appropriate, if you're using
20

20

00:00:43.239  -->  00:00:45.309
Linux though you're in the right place and
21

21

00:00:45.309  -->  00:00:48.340
I'm using Ubuntu. Now JetBrains the
22

22

00:00:48.340  -->  00:00:51.370
makers of IntelliJ IDEA make two IDEs
23

23

00:00:51.370  -->  00:00:53.489
that are suitable for Python programming
24

24

00:00:53.489  -->  00:00:56.350
IntelliJ ID and PyCharm so we're going
25

25

00:00:56.350  -->  00:00:57.809
to go to their website at
26

26

00:00:57.809  -->  00:01:02.739
www.jetbrains.com and I'll talk about the
27

27

00:01:02.739  -->  00:01:05.530
differences, I'll come over here and
28

28

00:01:05.530  -->  00:01:09.429
click on tools you can see how it's
29

29

00:01:09.429  -->  00:01:11.530
going to click on this closes little
30

30

00:01:11.530  -->  00:01:12.849
window down the bottom, we've got two
31

31

00:01:12.849  -->  00:01:15.700
options here IntelliJ IDEA or pycharm
32

32

00:01:15.700  -->  00:01:18.130
and for Python programming they look
33

33

00:01:18.130  -->  00:01:20.530
pretty like pretty identical I'm going
34

34

00:01:20.530  -->  00:01:22.509
to be selecting and using IntelliJ IDEA
35

35

00:01:22.509  -->  00:01:24.490
here but if you want to use pycharm
36

36

00:01:24.490  -->  00:01:26.289
instead, everything will look almost
37

37

00:01:26.289  -->  00:01:29.590
exactly the same as the videos Now Pycharms
38

38

00:01:29.590  -->  00:01:31.750
got the advantage that you don't
39

39

00:01:31.750  -->  00:01:33.340
have to install a separate path and
40

40

00:01:33.340  -->  00:01:34.690
plug-in and that's because it's
41

41

00:01:34.690  -->  00:01:36.849
basically a version of IntelliJ IDEA
42

42

00:01:36.849  -->  00:01:39.640
that only does Python, so the advantage
43

43

00:01:39.640  -->  00:01:41.739
of IntelliJ IDEA is that you can use it
44

44

00:01:41.739  -->  00:01:44.050
for a whole range of languages if you're
45

45

00:01:44.050  -->  00:01:45.429
planning to program in other languages
46

46

00:01:45.429  -->  00:01:48.220
and an example would be the Java master
47

47

00:01:48.220  -->  00:01:49.690
class from the Learn Programming Academy
48

48

00:01:49.690  -->  00:01:52.390
and you'll find that IntelliJ IDEA will
49

49

00:01:52.390  -->  00:01:55.000
be more suitable, for that reason I'm
50

50

00:01:55.000  -->  00:01:56.560
going to suggest you install IntelliJ
51

51

00:01:56.560  -->  00:01:58.509
IDEA, so basically hover over whichever
52

52

00:01:58.509  -->  00:02:00.399
one you want to use in download you
53

53

00:02:00.399  -->  00:02:02.679
click on the download link. Now the IDEs
54

54

00:02:02.679  -->  00:02:04.750
come in two flavors the ultimate
55

55

00:02:04.750  -->  00:02:08.050
edition of IntelliJ or the professional
56

56

00:02:08.050  -->  00:02:10.239
edition of pycharm well they're the paid
57

57

00:02:10.239  -->  00:02:12.370
versions you can use them for 30 days
58

58

00:02:12.370  -->  00:02:14.320
but after that you have to purchase a
59

59

00:02:14.320  -->  00:02:16.630
license to continue using them but both
60

60

00:02:16.630  -->  00:02:18.160
products also
61

61

00:02:18.160  -->  00:02:20.230
community edition then the community
62

62

00:02:20.230  -->  00:02:22.510
editions are free for personal use and
63

63

00:02:22.510  -->  00:02:25.300
there are some features missing in the
64

64

00:02:25.300  -->  00:02:27.100
community versions compared to the
65

65

00:02:27.100  -->  00:02:29.200
ultimate or professional editions but
66

66

00:02:29.200  -->  00:02:30.790
generally they're not things you need to
67

67

00:02:30.790  -->  00:02:32.710
worry about while learning your Python
68

68

00:02:32.710  -->  00:02:34.690
there's a feature matrix on the
69

69

00:02:34.690  -->  00:02:36.940
JetBrains side if I come down for two
70

70

00:02:36.940  -->  00:02:38.500
PyCharm for argument's sake and click on
71

71

00:02:38.500  -->  00:02:43.490
that I'm just going to close that
72

72

00:02:43.490  -->  00:02:46.010
it gives you some information element
73

73

00:02:46.010  -->  00:02:46.970
and the bottom you can see there's the
74

74

00:02:46.970  -->  00:02:48.560
differences they're showing from pycharm
75

75

00:02:48.560  -->  00:02:50.570
between the professional Edition and the
76

76

00:02:50.570  -->  00:02:53.570
Community Edition and likewise, if I go
77

77

00:02:53.570  -->  00:02:56.060
back up to tools and do the same for
78

78

00:02:56.060  -->  00:02:59.510
IntelliJ you get the same thing we get
79

79

00:02:59.510  -->  00:03:01.970
that same feature matrix which we can
80

80

00:03:01.970  -->  00:03:04.130
use to decide ultimately which version
81

81

00:03:04.130  -->  00:03:07.070
to download, none of this makes sense at
82

82

00:03:07.070  -->  00:03:08.270
the moment the best thing I would
83

83

00:03:08.270  -->  00:03:10.910
suggest you do is just to download the
84

84

00:03:10.910  -->  00:03:13.850
community edition version of IntelliJ
85

85

00:03:13.850  -->  00:03:17.330
IDE, so click on download and/or
86

86

00:03:17.330  -->  00:03:19.340
IntelliJ IDEA and I'm gonna come over
87

87

00:03:19.340  -->  00:03:20.540
here and click on download for the
88

88

00:03:20.540  -->  00:03:23.720
community edition of IntelliJ we've got
89

89

00:03:23.720  -->  00:03:24.710
a moment and that should start
90

90

00:03:24.710  -->  00:03:27.710
downloading automatically I'm gonna save
91

91

00:03:27.710  -->  00:03:31.310
that and just while that's downloading
92

92

00:03:31.310  -->  00:03:32.720
I'm going to mention again that you
93

93

00:03:32.720  -->  00:03:35.180
don't have to install this IDE if you've
94

94

00:03:35.180  -->  00:03:36.410
already got one that you're using and
95

95

00:03:36.410  -->  00:03:38.450
you're happy with we had to pick one and
96

96

00:03:38.450  -->  00:03:40.130
because I've created courses and so for
97

97

00:03:40.130  -->  00:03:42.110
a number of languages I've picked an IDE
98

98

00:03:42.110  -->  00:03:43.700
that supports them all in the IntelliJ
99

99

00:03:43.700  -->  00:03:45.710
IDEA, I'm gonna be showing your way so
100

100

00:03:45.710  -->  00:03:48.080
the IntelliJ and bugs in your code and
101

101

00:03:48.080  -->  00:03:50.540
some other features that modern ideas
102

102

00:03:50.540  -->  00:03:52.100
have to make programming easier,
103

103

00:03:52.100  -->  00:03:54.200
most modern IDEs will have similar
104

104

00:03:54.200  -->  00:03:55.670
features and once you know that
105

105

00:03:55.670  -->  00:03:57.410
something is possible you can Google how
106

106

00:03:57.410  -->  00:03:59.450
to do the same thing in any other ID
107

107

00:03:59.450  -->  00:04:02.030
that you've chosen the other thing I can
108

108

00:04:02.030  -->  00:04:03.710
do though is I can extend the trial
109

109

00:04:03.710  -->  00:04:06.470
period for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
110

110

00:04:06.470  -->  00:04:08.600
Edition if you're considering purchasing
111

111

00:04:08.600  -->  00:04:10.370
it and would like more time to evaluate
112

112

00:04:10.370  -->  00:04:12.020
that Edition then that's only applicable
113

113

00:04:12.020  -->  00:04:14.180
for the Ultimate Edition so if that's
114

114

00:04:14.180  -->  00:04:15.920
something you're interested in check
115

115

00:04:15.920  -->  00:04:17.450
that out in a later lecture which shows
116

116

00:04:17.450  -->  00:04:19.609
you how to get a special key that you'll
117

117

00:04:19.609  -->  00:04:21.620
paste into the ultimate edition of
118

118

00:04:21.620  -->  00:04:24.260
IntelliJ IDEA to get the extra 90 days
119

119

00:04:24.260  -->  00:04:26.300
trial so you get a total of 120 days to
120

120

00:04:26.300  -->  00:04:28.250
try it out so refer to that again if you
121

121

00:04:28.250  -->  00:04:29.780
decide to download and use the ultimate
122

122

00:04:29.780  -->  00:04:31.790
edition. Alright because here now that
123

123

00:04:31.790  -->  00:04:33.890
it's downloaded so I'm going to go and
124

124

00:04:33.890  -->  00:04:36.290
open the downloaded file so I'm going to
125

125

00:04:36.290  -->  00:04:39.260
do is have a look at this I'm going to
126

126

00:04:39.260  -->  00:04:41.240
just take a look at the folder and you
127

127

00:04:41.240  -->  00:04:43.100
can see it's been put into my down it's
128

128

00:04:43.100  -->  00:04:45.430
been downloaded into my downloads folder
129

129

00:04:45.430  -->  00:04:48.560
so I'm going to go to my home folder and
130

130

00:04:48.560  -->  00:04:50.750
I'm going to create a new folder I'm
131

131

00:04:50.750  -->  00:04:53.720
going to call it dev
132

132

00:04:53.720  -->  00:04:55.770
and they're going to get back and I'm
133

133

00:04:55.770  -->  00:04:59.310
going to open an archive manager open
134

134

00:04:59.310  -->  00:05:03.930
the downloaded file IntelliJ IDE
135

135

00:05:03.930  -->  00:05:05.490
what I'm going to do I'm going to
136

136

00:05:05.490  -->  00:05:08.310
extract that I'm going to extract it
137

137

00:05:08.310  -->  00:05:15.240
into the dev folder like so
138

138

00:05:15.240  -->  00:05:17.220
okay gonna close that I'm gonna close
139

139

00:05:17.220  -->  00:05:19.470
this down now and what I can do then is
140

140

00:05:19.470  -->  00:05:21.000
go back to that folder that's been
141

141

00:05:21.000  -->  00:05:22.830
downloaded beat down it's been extracted
142

142

00:05:22.830  -->  00:05:26.160
into dev we've never got an IDE folder
143

143

00:05:26.160  -->  00:05:28.050
I'm not going to do is just make things
144

144

00:05:28.050  -->  00:05:29.220
a bit easier going to go to the command
145

145

00:05:29.220  -->  00:05:30.690
line for mr. this I'm gonna close down
146

146

00:05:30.690  -->  00:05:32.789
this window they see on the browser
147

147

00:05:32.789  -->  00:05:34.800
we're finished with that now and I'm
148

148

00:05:34.800  -->  00:05:37.770
just gonna open in terminal I'm going to
149

149

00:05:37.770  -->  00:05:39.780
navigate look where we are now which a
150

150

00:05:39.780  -->  00:05:42.030
bit the reason behind folder into the
151

151

00:05:42.030  -->  00:05:47.280
dev folder oh dear and also going to go
152

152

00:05:47.280  -->  00:05:49.199
to the bin folder business folder is
153

153

00:05:49.199  -->  00:05:52.080
where the executable is and there's IDE
154

154

00:05:52.080  -->  00:05:55.410
IDE.sh and by the way if you've
155

155

00:05:55.410  -->  00:05:57.570
downloaded PyCharm instead there'll be a
156

156

00:05:57.570  -->  00:05:59.430
PyCharm community and the version
157

157

00:05:59.430  -->  00:06:01.199
that's which easily
158

158

00:06:01.199  -->  00:06:03.270
starts with the year 2018 at the moment
159

159

00:06:03.270  -->  00:06:05.460
you can see this case of IntelliJ IDEA
160

160

00:06:05.460  -->  00:06:08.280
we've got idea-ic-and a build
161

161

00:06:08.280  -->  00:06:11.009
number there okay, we're now going to
162

162

00:06:11.009  -->  00:06:13.889
start IntelliJ and we're going to do a
163

163

00:06:13.889  -->  00:06:16.440
dot or period /id
164

164

00:06:16.440  -->  00:06:19.260
sh and if you download pycharm it'll
165

165

00:06:19.260  -->  00:06:23.449
be something like period / pycharm sh
166

166

00:06:23.449  -->  00:06:25.500
I'm gonna run that in this case for
167

167

00:06:25.500  -->  00:06:27.659
IntelliJ now usually you'll see this
168

168

00:06:27.659  -->  00:06:29.490
option come up and it's coming up
169

169

00:06:29.490  -->  00:06:32.280
telling us that we have got an option to
170

170

00:06:32.280  -->  00:06:34.860
import some settings now that would be
171

171

00:06:34.860  -->  00:06:36.360
useful if you're running IntelliJ or
172

172

00:06:36.360  -->  00:06:38.699
you've installed a previous version and
173

173

00:06:38.699  -->  00:06:39.990
you want to retain the settings that
174

174

00:06:39.990  -->  00:06:41.970
you've configured but in this case I
175

175

00:06:41.970  -->  00:06:43.530
haven't installed intelligence computer
176

176

00:06:43.530  -->  00:06:45.419
before so I'm going to choose do not
177

177

00:06:45.419  -->  00:06:46.620
import settings which is the default
178

178

00:06:46.620  -->  00:06:48.960
actually otherwise there's a location
179

179

00:06:48.960  -->  00:06:50.639
found by IntelliJ you could select that
180

180

00:06:50.639  -->  00:06:52.560
it would normally come up here if it
181

181

00:06:52.560  -->  00:06:54.360
found one for you automatically and then
182

182

00:06:54.360  -->  00:06:56.009
get IntelliJ to import those settings
183

183

00:06:56.009  -->  00:06:57.449
and use them and you've this specific
184

184

00:06:57.449  -->  00:06:59.820
installation of IntelliJ but again I'm
185

185

00:06:59.820  -->  00:07:01.020
going to leave the default and click on
186

186

00:07:01.020  -->  00:07:05.370
ok, we've got a privacy policy let's up
187

187

00:07:05.370  -->  00:07:08.009
popped up here and you need to scroll
188

188

00:07:08.009  -->  00:07:10.139
right down to the bottom there and I
189

189

00:07:10.139  -->  00:07:13.770
could kinda accept there and that
190

190

00:07:13.770  -->  00:07:16.860
privacy policy was fairly new it may or
191

191

00:07:16.860  -->  00:07:18.419
may come up slightly differently if
192

192

00:07:18.419  -->  00:07:19.740
you're in Europe based on the new
193

193

00:07:19.740  -->  00:07:22.409
privacy legislation in force and when I
194

194

00:07:22.409  -->  00:07:24.090
did the new installation videos for
195

195

00:07:24.090  -->  00:07:25.620
Windows that didn't come up at all but
196

196

00:07:25.620  -->  00:07:27.300
it may or may not come up you can see
197

197

00:07:27.300  -->  00:07:28.770
it's a simple case of just selecting
198

198

00:07:28.770  -->  00:07:30.419
the option to accept is accept the
199

199

00:07:30.419  -->  00:07:33.030
privacy policy and to stop be concerned
200

200

00:07:33.030  -->  00:07:35.009
if you don't see the privacy policy pop
201

201

00:07:35.009  -->  00:07:36.630
up. Alright so at this point now we've
202

202

00:07:36.630  -->  00:07:39.120
got this configuration section we just
203

203

00:07:39.120  -->  00:07:40.380
need to set up the settings to tell
204

204

00:07:40.380  -->  00:07:43.080
intellij what options we want so this is
205

205

00:07:43.080  -->  00:07:44.400
the theme we've got a choice of using
206

206

00:07:44.400  -->  00:07:46.319
the dark theme or the white theme
207

207

00:07:46.319  -->  00:07:49.050
there's also this gtk+ theme we can use
208

208

00:07:49.050  -->  00:07:50.220
as well which you may be more familiar
209

209

00:07:50.220  -->  00:07:52.319
with the select which one you prefer to
210

210

00:07:52.319  -->  00:07:53.490
work with knowing that you can always
211

211

00:07:53.490  -->  00:07:55.590
change it later I'm going to select the
212

212

00:07:55.590  -->  00:07:57.900
IntelliJ one which is the white
213

213

00:07:57.900  -->  00:07:59.300
background text on a white background
214

214

00:07:59.300  -->  00:08:01.550
and click on next
215

215

00:08:01.550  -->  00:08:04.020
we're going to leave the option under
216

216

00:08:04.020  -->  00:08:05.550
credit desktop entry for integration
217

217

00:08:05.550  -->  00:08:07.889
with this system an application menu
218

218

00:08:07.889  -->  00:08:11.039
just so I can select it from a menu as
219

219

00:08:11.039  -->  00:08:12.360
well as being able to start up from the
220

220

00:08:12.360  -->  00:08:13.949
command line if I want to do if I want
221

221

00:08:13.949  -->  00:08:17.009
to do that so if you've gone next now
222

222

00:08:17.009  -->  00:08:18.360
for this one here it's also talking
223

223

00:08:18.360  -->  00:08:20.430
about a launcher script creating a
224

224

00:08:20.430  -->  00:08:22.139
script for opening files and projects
225

225

00:08:22.139  -->  00:08:23.909
from the command line I'm not going to
226

226

00:08:23.909  -->  00:08:25.229
create one here because I prefer to
227

227

00:08:25.229  -->  00:08:27.360
start the IDE in crate or open projects
228

228

00:08:27.360  -->  00:08:29.280
from there from the interface and the
229

229

00:08:29.280  -->  00:08:30.569
node at the bottom of the dialog here
230

230

00:08:30.569  -->  00:08:32.039
anyway in any events tells you how you
231

231

00:08:32.039  -->  00:08:33.979
can create that later it gives you the
232

232

00:08:33.979  -->  00:08:36.750
location in the menus to do that so I'm
233

233

00:08:36.750  -->  00:08:38.909
going to leave that as the default so
234

234

00:08:38.909  -->  00:08:40.110
I'm not going to create the launcher
235

235

00:08:40.110  -->  00:08:42.510
script and click on next now there's a
236

236

00:08:42.510  -->  00:08:43.860
series of plugins on the screen you can
237

237

00:08:43.860  -->  00:08:45.390
see here and you can choose all sorts of
238

238

00:08:45.390  -->  00:08:47.370
things what I suggest you do is to leave
239

239

00:08:47.370  -->  00:08:49.079
it as it is now and come back later if
240

240

00:08:49.079  -->  00:08:50.550
you decide you want to install plugins
241

241

00:08:50.550  -->  00:08:52.920
there's actually a plugins option that
242

242

00:08:52.920  -->  00:08:54.990
would be going into shortly and you can
243

243

00:08:54.990  -->  00:08:56.190
install the plugins from there at any
244

244

00:08:56.190  -->  00:08:58.410
point in the future one thing to note is
245

245

00:08:58.410  -->  00:08:59.880
if you're running the ultimate edition
246

246

00:08:59.880  -->  00:09:02.190
of IntelliJ you have more options to
247

247

00:09:02.190  -->  00:09:03.720
install plug-ins for that as well
248

248

00:09:03.720  -->  00:09:04.770
there's more options that will come up
249

249

00:09:04.770  -->  00:09:07.970
on the screen then click on next here
250

250

00:09:07.970  -->  00:09:10.829
and the same deal here if you want to
251

251

00:09:10.829  -->  00:09:12.149
change or install these things which we
252

252

00:09:12.149  -->  00:09:13.529
aren't going to use in this particular
253

253

00:09:13.529  -->  00:09:15.779
course you can do that now but I'm going
254

254

00:09:15.779  -->  00:09:17.070
to skip both of these and just click on
255

255

00:09:17.070  -->  00:09:21.400
start using IntelliJ IDEA.
256

256

00:09:21.400  -->  00:09:23.510
Alright, so now that would install the
257

257

00:09:23.510  -->  00:09:25.610
community version the community edition
258

258

00:09:25.610  -->  00:09:27.830
of IntelliJ IDEA, the next thing we need
259

259

00:09:27.830  -->  00:09:30.500
to do is install a python plugin so
260

260

00:09:30.500  -->  00:09:32.510
that's a plug-in that's been developed
261

261

00:09:32.510  -->  00:09:34.490
by IntelliJ, so that it's fully supports
262

262

00:09:34.490  -->  00:09:36.500
Python within the integrated development
263

263

00:09:36.500  -->  00:09:38.600
environment. Now if you decided to
264

264

00:09:38.600  -->  00:09:40.970
install PyCharm instead you can skip this step
265

265

00:09:40.970  -->  00:09:42.410
that's because pythons already
266

266

00:09:42.410  -->  00:09:44.450
integrated with PyCharm but do make sure
267

267

00:09:44.450  -->  00:09:46.400
you watch the next video where we can
268

268

00:09:46.400  -->  00:09:47.900
figure python and change some other
269

269

00:09:47.900  -->  00:09:50.570
useful settings so the Python plugin
270

270

00:09:50.570  -->  00:09:51.890
gives IntelliJ IDEA the same
271

271

00:09:51.890  -->  00:09:54.470
capabilities as pycharm for python
272

272

00:09:54.470  -->  00:09:55.970
programming, so what I'm going to do is
273

273

00:09:55.970  -->  00:09:58.730
come down here click on configure and
274

274

00:09:58.730  -->  00:10:02.330
I'm going to select the plugins, this is
275

275

00:10:02.330  -->  00:10:03.620
how you install other plugins in the
276

276

00:10:03.620  -->  00:10:06.080
future as well, so the search box at the
277

277

00:10:06.080  -->  00:10:07.850
top I'm going to type in Python we're
278

278

00:10:07.850  -->  00:10:09.740
going to be searching for then I'm going
279

279

00:10:09.740  -->  00:10:11.870
to come down here and click on install JetBrains
280

280

00:10:11.870  -->  00:10:14.870
plug-in, you can see that it's come up
281

281

00:10:14.870  -->  00:10:16.640
with a few options there the only one
282

282

00:10:16.640  -->  00:10:18.190
who is this Python Community Edition
283

283

00:10:18.190  -->  00:10:21.140
languages and you can see this Python
284

284

00:10:21.140  -->  00:10:23.060
community edition and the other thing to
285

285

00:10:23.060  -->  00:10:24.890
note is it's the vendor is JetBrains
286

286

00:10:24.890  -->  00:10:26.690
and they can generally see it anyways
287

287

00:10:26.690  -->  00:10:29.210
but quite a large number of downloads in
288

288

00:10:29.210  -->  00:10:30.470
this case our behalf a million downloads
289

289

00:10:30.470  -->  00:10:32.390
so that's the python plugin that we
290

290

00:10:32.390  -->  00:10:33.440
want to install I'm going to click on
291

291

00:10:33.440  -->  00:10:36.560
install here and it's downloading the
292

292

00:10:36.560  -->  00:10:40.460
plug-in you can see at this point it's
293

293

00:10:40.460  -->  00:10:42.820
now finished, so they can see that the
294

294

00:10:42.820  -->  00:10:45.590
Python plugin has now downloaded and
295

295

00:10:45.590  -->  00:10:48.470
IntelliJ IDEA wants us to restart to
296

296

00:10:48.470  -->  00:10:49.970
finish off the installation of the
297

297

00:10:49.970  -->  00:10:51.770
plugin so I'm gonna click on restart
298

298

00:10:51.770  -->  00:10:56.000
intelliJ IDEA then click on ok and I
299

299

00:10:56.000  -->  00:10:57.380
think gives us an option to restart
300

300

00:10:57.380  -->  00:11:02.939
IntelliJ IDEA I'm going to do that here
301

301

00:11:02.939  -->  00:11:05.290
you can see that IntelliJ as we started
302

302

00:11:05.290  -->  00:11:06.369
I'm going to take the opportunity to
303

303

00:11:06.369  -->  00:11:11.379
close down the terminal and the other
304

304

00:11:11.379  -->  00:11:12.879
thing to notice now is if we have a look
305

305

00:11:12.879  -->  00:11:16.899
here we do a search for IntelliJ we've
306

306

00:11:16.899  -->  00:11:19.119
now got this little launcher that we can
307

307

00:11:19.119  -->  00:11:21.209
click to start IntelliJ anytime we want.
308

308

00:11:21.209  -->  00:11:24.309
Alright, now just a note here that
309

309

00:11:24.309  -->  00:11:26.889
sometimes the reach that doesn't seem to
310

310

00:11:26.889  -->  00:11:28.989
work and I do make sure you click our
311

311

00:11:28.989  -->  00:11:32.139
case I did there to close the dialogue
312

312

00:11:32.139  -->  00:11:33.459
down and then they usually you'll get
313

313

00:11:33.459  -->  00:11:35.290
the option to restart but worst case is
314

314

00:11:35.290  -->  00:11:36.489
you might have to shut down or restart
315

315

00:11:36.489  -->  00:11:38.889
yourself manually to get it to restart
316

316

00:11:38.889  -->  00:11:40.569
it certainly didn't seem to work on a
317

317

00:11:40.569  -->  00:11:43.689
Ubuntu 18.04 the other thing I
318

318

00:11:43.689  -->  00:11:47.169
noticed was that on Ubuntu 18.4, pycharm
319

319

00:11:47.169  -->  00:11:49.029
doesn't create a desktop entry when
320

320

00:11:49.029  -->  00:11:50.739
you first run it though if it doesn't
321

321

00:11:50.739  -->  00:11:52.299
get created for you, you just come down
322

322

00:11:52.299  -->  00:11:54.669
to configure and you can choose the
323

323

00:11:54.669  -->  00:11:57.220
option to create desktop entry here and
324

324

00:11:57.220  -->  00:11:58.600
that would be the same for pycharm and
325

325

00:11:58.600  -->  00:12:00.399
you can create that as well
326

326

00:12:00.399  -->  00:12:02.109
and obviously I know that this is
327

327

00:12:02.109  -->  00:12:03.910
IntelliJ IDEA on my screen but the
328

328

00:12:03.910  -->  00:12:06.279
option is the same in pycharm but in
329

329

00:12:06.279  -->  00:12:08.559
this case IntelliJ IDEA was restarted so
330

330

00:12:08.559  -->  00:12:10.480
I'm going to stop the video here in the
331

331

00:12:10.480  -->  00:12:11.919
next one we're going to make sure that
332

332

00:12:11.919  -->  00:12:13.419
python plugin is configured correctly
333

333

00:12:13.419  -->  00:12:16.480
but also change some other settings to
334

334

00:12:16.480  -->  00:12:18.339
make it a bit easier to use. Now the
335

335

00:12:18.339  -->  00:12:19.989
steps in the next video will be the same
336

336

00:12:19.989  -->  00:12:23.139
for both IntelliJ IDEA and pycharm so be
337

337

00:12:23.139  -->  00:12:24.639
sure to watch it even if you installed
338

338

00:12:24.639  -->  00:12:28.739
pycharm instead. See you in the next video.
