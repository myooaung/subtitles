1

00:00:04,690  -->  00:00:06,910
Now we've installed the IDE and the
2

2

00:00:06,910  -->  00:00:09,070
Python plugin if you installed IntelliJ
3

3

00:00:09,070  -->  00:00:11,620
IDEA rather than Pycharm, we need to make
4

4

00:00:11,620  -->  00:00:13,719
sure that it can find Python. Now the
5

5

00:00:13,719  -->  00:00:15,370
steps here are almost the same for
6

6

00:00:15,370  -->  00:00:18,340
IntelliJ IDEA and Pycharm and the chances
7

7

00:00:18,340  -->  00:00:20,080
are that it's sorted itself out,
8

8

00:00:20,080  -->  00:00:21,880
but just in case it has it I'm going to
9

9

00:00:21,880  -->  00:00:23,260
go through all the steps to configure
10

10

00:00:23,260  -->  00:00:26,529
the Python SDK, now from IntelliJ IDEA
11

11

00:00:26,529  -->  00:00:28,720
first from the welcome screen I'm going
12

12

00:00:28,720  -->  00:00:30,369
to show you how to do that we could have
13

13

00:00:30,369  -->  00:00:32,410
come over here click on configure let me
14

14

00:00:32,410  -->  00:00:34,750
click on project defaults, then project
15

15

00:00:34,750  -->  00:00:38,230
structure once we've done that we come
16

16

00:00:38,230  -->  00:00:39,489
over here to the left hand side and
17

17

00:00:39,489  -->  00:00:43,420
select SDKs and this is where we set up
18

18

00:00:43,420  -->  00:00:46,989
the Python SDK. Now in pycharm let me
19

19

00:00:46,989  -->  00:00:50,649
just swing over to Pycharm these
20

20

00:00:50,649  -->  00:00:53,020
settings slightly different for Pycharm
21

21

00:00:53,020  -->  00:00:55,270
click on configure and we select
22

22

00:00:55,270  -->  00:00:59,680
preferences then we come over here to
23

23

00:00:59,680  -->  00:01:02,309
the left and select project interpreter.
24

24

00:01:02,309  -->  00:01:04,780
Now I've used the dark theme here
25

25

00:01:04,780  -->  00:01:06,580
for pycharm just so you can tell at a
26

26

00:01:06,580  -->  00:01:08,500
glance which IDE I'm showing on the
27

27

00:01:08,500  -->  00:01:11,289
screen. Now Pycharm got this little cog
28

28

00:01:11,289  -->  00:01:13,599
icon over here to the right of the
29

29

00:01:13,599  -->  00:01:16,119
project interpreter drop-down list,
30

30

00:01:16,119  -->  00:01:18,310
so I'm going to click on that and we're
31

31

00:01:18,310  -->  00:01:21,729
going to choose add and that gets us to
32

32

00:01:21,729  -->  00:01:23,050
the screen where we can actually
33

33

00:01:23,050  -->  00:01:26,380
configure or rather add our Python interpreter,
34

34

00:01:26,380  -->  00:01:29,979
we're going back to IntelliJ IDEA to get
35

35

00:01:29,979  -->  00:01:31,990
to that same screen in IntelliJ IDEA
36

36

00:01:31,990  -->  00:01:33,489
we just come over here and click on this
37

37

00:01:33,489  -->  00:01:35,080
little plus button at the top of the
38

38

00:01:35,080  -->  00:01:38,259
screen, we want to come down here we need
39

39

00:01:38,259  -->  00:01:40,539
to select a Python SDK and that's
40

40

00:01:40,539  -->  00:01:42,459
because IntelliJ IDEA can of course be
41

41

00:01:42,459  -->  00:01:45,039
used for a range of languages, so I'm
42

42

00:01:45,039  -->  00:01:46,890
going to select Python SDK
43

43

00:01:46,890  -->  00:01:49,270
we've not basically got the same screen
44

44

00:01:49,270  -->  00:01:52,060
now, very similar to what we saw in Pycharm
45

45

00:01:52,060  -->  00:01:53,860
now you've got these options down the
46

46

00:01:53,860  -->  00:01:55,869
left hand side these virtual
47

47

00:01:55,869  -->  00:01:58,179
environments virtual ends I'm not going
48

48

00:01:58,179  -->  00:02:00,009
to discuss those just yet because that's
49

49

00:02:00,009  -->  00:02:01,000
because we're going to be looking at
50

50

00:02:01,000  -->  00:02:03,310
them later in the course what they are
51

51

00:02:03,310  -->  00:02:05,020
though is a way of keeping your Python
52

52

00:02:05,020  -->  00:02:07,629
environments separate so that things you
53

53

00:02:07,629  -->  00:02:09,610
install for one project don't affect
54

54

00:02:09,610  -->  00:02:11,920
other projects you may be working on.
55

55

00:02:11,920  -->  00:02:13,000
Now we're going to be looking at them from
56

56

00:02:13,000  -->  00:02:15,220
the command line, so I won't be
57

57

00:02:15,220  -->  00:02:18,190
discussing these options in IntelliJ or PyCharm
58

58

00:02:18,190  -->  00:02:19,810
this is a Python course after all the
59

59

00:02:19,810  -->  00:02:23,500
not an IntelliJ / Pycharm course but
60

60

00:02:23,500  -->  00:02:25,090
once we have explained about virtual
61

61

00:02:25,090  -->  00:02:27,040
environments virtual env these
62

62

00:02:27,040  -->  00:02:29,140
options will make more sense, for now
63

63

00:02:29,140  -->  00:02:31,390
let's get going, the things the steps you
64

64

00:02:31,390  -->  00:02:33,880
need to take here for both IntelliJ IDE
65

65

00:02:33,880  -->  00:02:36,520
and PyCharm is to select virtual env
66

66

00:02:36,520  -->  00:02:39,010
which is selected by default and leave
67

67

00:02:39,010  -->  00:02:40,690
the new environment selected over here
68

68

00:02:40,690  -->  00:02:42,610
you want kind of come down here and tick
69

69

00:02:42,610  -->  00:02:45,880
or check both boxes inherit global site
70

70

00:02:45,880  -->  00:02:47,980
packages and make available to all
71

71

00:02:47,980  -->  00:02:49,990
projects, so it's select both of those
72

72

00:02:49,990  -->  00:02:53,740
now the location should be your home
73

73

00:02:53,740  -->  00:02:56,260
directory and if you only plan to use
74

74

00:02:56,260  -->  00:02:58,540
one version of Python you can leave that
75

75

00:02:58,540  -->  00:03:01,330
here unchanged, otherwise what you can do
76

76

00:03:01,330  -->  00:03:03,220
is add the words Python and the version
77

77

00:03:03,220  -->  00:03:05,020
number to the end, so I'm going to do
78

78

00:03:05,020  -->  00:03:06,910
that I'm gonna put a / on the end of
79

79

00:03:06,910  -->  00:03:09,010
the path that has been created for me
80

80

00:03:09,010  -->  00:03:14,050
I'm gonna type Python 3 point 6 so
81

81

00:03:14,050  -->  00:03:15,850
IntelliJ or pycharm should have found
82

82

00:03:15,850  -->  00:03:18,250
your Python 3.6 installation or whatever
83

83

00:03:18,250  -->  00:03:20,380
version of python you're using you've
84

84

00:03:20,380  -->  00:03:22,810
probably installed version 3.6 of python
85

85

00:03:22,810  -->  00:03:23,940
going through the steps in this video
86

86

00:03:23,940  -->  00:03:27,040
but note that python 3.7 is coming out
87

87

00:03:27,040  -->  00:03:30,459
in 2018 late in 2018 so that's the
88

88

00:03:30,459  -->  00:03:31,810
version of what they're if you've got
89

89

00:03:31,810  -->  00:03:34,090
that option available to you, you can see
90

90

00:03:34,090  -->  00:03:35,770
here that the base interpreter has been
91

91

00:03:35,770  -->  00:03:38,020
filled out for me, if for some reason
92

92

00:03:38,020  -->  00:03:40,209
that's blank then you want to come over
93

93

00:03:40,209  -->  00:03:42,100
here and click on the ellipsis and you'd
94

94

00:03:42,100  -->  00:03:43,500
never get or browse to the location
95

95

00:03:43,500  -->  00:03:45,970
where you saw python being installed
96

96

00:03:45,970  -->  00:03:48,340
previously but here we can see that
97

97

00:03:48,340  -->  00:03:49,690
that's been found automatically by
98

98

00:03:49,690  -->  00:03:52,480
IntelliJ and it should be found
99

99

00:03:52,480  -->  00:03:53,950
automatically by pycharm if you're doing
100

100

00:03:53,950  -->  00:03:56,440
if you're have installed that so
101

101

00:03:56,440  -->  00:03:57,640
generally you shouldn't need to change
102

102

00:03:57,640  -->  00:03:59,440
anything there and the only other thing
103

103

00:03:59,440  -->  00:04:02,400
you'll need to do is click on ok,
104

104

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:03,810
you can see if it's a bit of a pause
105

105

00:04:03,810  -->  00:04:05,610
there while it's actually looking and
106

106

00:04:05,610  -->  00:04:07,860
then it's added all these things for us
107

107

00:04:07,860  -->  00:04:09,750
automatically you can see that we've got
108

108

00:04:09,750  -->  00:04:11,489
this set up nicely so what I'm going to
109

109

00:04:11,489  -->  00:04:13,860
do is just swing back over to the python
110

110

00:04:13,860  -->  00:04:15,450
now I'm going to show you the screen
111

111

00:04:15,450  -->  00:04:16,680
that's popped up assuming you've
112

112

00:04:16,680  -->  00:04:18,930
followed the same steps to configure it
113

113

00:04:18,930  -->  00:04:21,030
just how we've configured this now for
114

114

00:04:21,030  -->  00:04:25,229
IntelliJ IDEA so here we are back in a
115

115

00:04:25,229  -->  00:04:27,240
pie chart and you can see that we've got
116

116

00:04:27,240  -->  00:04:28,770
some configuration here now we've got
117

117

00:04:28,770  -->  00:04:30,330
something in the project interpreter
118

118

00:04:30,330  -->  00:04:33,300
drop-down box and I can click on ok and
119

119

00:04:33,300  -->  00:04:35,310
now you've got it updated path and
120

120

00:04:35,310  -->  00:04:37,020
interpreter for the first time so we get
121

121

00:04:37,020  -->  00:04:38,880
that I'm able to complete and will just
122

122

00:04:38,880  -->  00:04:40,110
quickly go back in just so I can show
123

123

00:04:40,110  -->  00:04:43,800
you what it looks like, so now if you go
124

124

00:04:43,800  -->  00:04:46,250
back to configure and select preferences
125

125

00:04:46,250  -->  00:04:48,750
you can see now in a project interpreter
126

126

00:04:48,750  -->  00:04:50,580
we've now got some things set up we got
127

127

00:04:50,580  -->  00:04:52,979
our Python as well as pip and some setup
128

128

00:04:52,979  -->  00:04:54,330
tools, so basically it's good to go at
129

129

00:04:54,330  -->  00:04:56,400
this point one, so I'm just gonna go back
130

130

00:04:56,400  -->  00:05:00,660
down to IntelliJ okay there. Alright so
131

131

00:05:00,660  -->  00:05:01,860
basically at this point pythons
132

132

00:05:01,860  -->  00:05:04,050
configured in both IntelliJ IDEA and
133

133

00:05:04,050  -->  00:05:06,270
pycharm but there's one more change that
134

134

00:05:06,270  -->  00:05:08,580
I want to make and that's to get the IDE
135

135

00:05:08,580  -->  00:05:10,500
to show line numbers in our code and
136

136

00:05:10,500  -->  00:05:12,599
once again these steps are the same for
137

137

00:05:12,599  -->  00:05:16,050
both IntelliJ IDE and pycharm so I'm
138

138

00:05:16,050  -->  00:05:17,430
gonna come over here and click on config
139

139

00:05:17,430  -->  00:05:21,180
and go into preferences they want to
140

140

00:05:21,180  -->  00:05:24,030
come over and expand editor expand
141

141

00:05:24,030  -->  00:05:26,070
general then we want to click on
142

142

00:05:26,070  -->  00:05:28,199
appearance and what you want to do is
143

143

00:05:28,199  -->  00:05:30,599
make sure there's a check the checkbox
144

144

00:05:30,599  -->  00:05:32,490
is ticked to the left of show line
145

145

00:05:32,490  -->  00:05:34,650
numbers. Now if it isn't ticked you'll
146

146

00:05:34,650  -->  00:05:35,940
want to click it and then click and then
147

147

00:05:35,940  -->  00:05:38,490
now select ok in my case you can see
148

148

00:05:38,490  -->  00:05:41,010
that it is selected in older versions of
149

149

00:05:41,010  -->  00:05:43,169
IntelliJ IDEA when the installation
150

150

00:05:43,169  -->  00:05:45,270
process was ran we found that this
151

151

00:05:45,270  -->  00:05:47,340
wasn't checked by default and having a
152

152

00:05:47,340  -->  00:05:48,840
checked is really handy because you can
153

153

00:05:48,840  -->  00:05:50,909
see the line numbers in your code and
154

154

00:05:50,909  -->  00:05:52,949
it's really particularly useful when you
155

155

00:05:52,949  -->  00:05:54,300
get errors with the error message when
156

156

00:05:54,300  -->  00:05:55,860
it talks about line 6 for example
157

157

00:05:55,860  -->  00:05:57,449
if you've got the line numbers showing
158

158

00:05:57,449  -->  00:05:58,830
you're able to quickly find where that
159

159

00:05:58,830  -->  00:06:00,930
error is but again as you can see here
160

160

00:06:00,930  -->  00:06:02,940
that option was set by default but just
161

161

00:06:02,940  -->  00:06:05,460
to do a check anyway in either IntelliJ
162

162

00:06:05,460  -->  00:06:08,010
IDEA or PyCharm to make sure that is
163

163

00:06:08,010  -->  00:06:10,860
selected and then now finally just click ok,
164

164

00:06:10,860  -->  00:06:12,659
and at this point you're ready now to
165

165

00:06:12,659  -->  00:06:15,389
start programming in Python so moving
166

166

00:06:15,389  -->  00:06:16,529
forward now in section
167

167

00:06:16,529  -->  00:06:19,409
five, we'll write our first program so I'll
168

168

00:06:19,409  -->  00:06:22,819
see you in section five.
