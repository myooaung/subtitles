00:00:05.480  -->  00:00:08.120
Welcome to section five,
which is the basics.
2

2

00:00:08.120  -->  00:00:11.520
We're now ready finally to
actually start doing some coding.
3

3

00:00:11.520  -->  00:00:14.700
So, we've set up at this point,
whether you're on Windows, Linux, or
4

4

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:16.440
Mac, you've set up Python.
5

5

00:00:16.440  -->  00:00:19.370
You've set up Intelli J idea, the IDE,
6

6

00:00:19.370  -->  00:00:23.070
the integrated development environment
we're gonna be using for this course.
7

7

00:00:23.070  -->  00:00:25.080
We're now ready to start coding.
8

8

00:00:25.080  -->  00:00:29.000
So specifically in this section,
we're going to learn about variables,
9

9

00:00:29.000  -->  00:00:31.600
what they are, but
also how to use them in Python.
10

10

00:00:31.600  -->  00:00:34.680
We're also going to look at string
formatting, what that is, and
11

11

00:00:34.680  -->  00:00:37.700
get our feet wet with some coding,
so lets make a start.
