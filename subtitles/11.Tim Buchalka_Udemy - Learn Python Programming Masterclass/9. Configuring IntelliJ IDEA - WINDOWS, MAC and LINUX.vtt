00:00:03.930  -->  00:00:08.559
In this video we want to configure
IntelliJ IDEA so that we can actually start

2

00:00:08.559  -->  00:00:12.280
some Python coding. So what we need to do
is two things; firstly we need to

3

00:00:12.280  -->  00:00:17.530
download and install a plugin for Python,
and secondly, we need to associate the

4

00:00:17.530  -->  00:00:21.070
Python install that we've done
previously in the course, to IntelliJ

5

00:00:21.070  -->  00:00:25.880
IDEA so that they actually work together.
So let's start with the plug-in. We're going to configure.

6

00:00:25.880  -->  00:00:35.040
We're going to select plugins,
and up here under search I'm going to search for Python.

7

00:00:35.040  -->  00:00:37.920
You can see here that we've got this
huge version here, Python Community

8

00:00:37.920  -->  00:00:41.040
Edition - that's the one we want. I'm
going to select on install. We know we

9

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:47.340
got the right one because it's 1.1
million installs. Click on Install, let that download.

10

00:00:47.340  -->  00:00:52.760
We want to restart the IDE, so
restart IntelliJ IDEA so that that

11

00:00:52.770  -->  00:00:56.489
plug-in takes effect, and we'll need that
and basically, that just sets up

12

00:00:56.489  -->  00:01:00.629
IntelliJ IDEA so we can use Python. It
looks like IntelliJ is not going to

13

00:01:00.629  -->  00:01:04.140
restart so I'm just going to start it
again manually. Not sure why it didn't

14

00:01:04.140  -->  00:01:07.950
restart , but in any event we're gonna go now to Configure, and we want to

15

00:01:07.950  -->  00:01:11.760
select Structure for new projects, so
click on that.

16

00:01:11.760  -->  00:01:16.620
Now once we get to this screen you might find that you've come into the screen for the first time down there,

17

00:01:16.620  -->  00:01:20.340
so click on Project if that's the
case, and depending if you're in my Java

18

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:23.820
master class or not, you may already have
an existing option here. So you may see

19

00:01:23.820  -->  00:01:28.110
something that says no SDK, or you may 
see something that says Java version 11,

20

00:01:28.110  -->  00:01:31.229
or whatever version it is. So if you see
something there already and it doesn't

21

00:01:31.229  -->  00:01:36.320
say no SDK, you can just click on New. In actual fact, in either way, you can do that.

22

00:01:36.320  -->  00:01:39.620
Clearly you can see in the drop down there's no Python option there,

23

00:01:39.620  -->  00:01:43.800
so I'm going to click on New. I'm
going to select Python SDK, noting that

24

00:01:43.800  -->  00:01:47.819
that's an option because we've installed
the plug-in. Click on that, and what

25

00:01:47.819  -->  00:01:52.110
should happen is that automatically,
it'll find the Python installation for

26

00:01:52.110  -->  00:01:55.349
us, and actually in this case, the base
interpreter was found for us and we

27

00:01:55.349  -->  00:01:58.890
didn't need to do anything else for that
to take effect. That brings up this

28

00:01:58.890  -->  00:02:02.610
rather intimidating new screen, but look,
don't worry too much about it because it

29

00:02:02.610  -->  00:02:05.459
is fairly straightforward and we're not
going to talk a lot about this virtual

30

00:02:05.459  -->  00:02:09.929
env environment, you know virtual env
environment, suffice to say we need this

31

00:02:09.929  -->  00:02:13.920
to actually be working. So what we're
going to do is look at those a lot later

32

00:02:13.920  -->  00:02:17.930
in the course. Alright, so once we've
reached this section, this is the virtual

33

00:02:17.930  -->  00:02:22.860
env environment page, and without going
into too much detail at the moment now

34

00:02:22.860  -->  00:02:27.150
about it, basically it's a way of keeping
your Python environment separate, so that

35

00:02:27.150  -->  00:02:30.780
things you install for one project don't
affect other projects which you may be

36

00:02:30.780  -->  00:02:33.630
working on. We're going to look at those
later in the course from the command

37

00:02:33.630  -->  00:02:36.520
line so I won't be discussing the
options in detail, and that's because

38

00:02:36.520  -->  00:02:40.200
this is a Python course, after all, and
not an intelliJ one. But once we have

39

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:43.709
explained more about virtual env later in
the course, these options will make more

40

00:02:43.709  -->  00:02:47.280
sense. For now though, you want to make
sure you've got virtual env environment

41

00:02:47.280  -->  00:02:50.460
selected which we have,
in the left hand side of the page.

42

00:02:50.460  -->  00:02:53.420
I'm going to leave the new environment
selected, as you can see there. I'm going

43

00:02:53.430  -->  00:02:57.810
to tick both boxes; the Inherit global
site packages box, check box, as well as

44

00:02:57.810  -->  00:03:02.580
the Make available to all projects check
box, as well. So the location should be in

45

00:03:02.580  -->  00:03:05.490
your home directory and it is for me, and
obviously, this will look slightly

46

00:03:05.490  -->  00:03:09.380
different depending on whether you're on
a Windows machine, a Mac or a Linux machine.

47

00:03:09.380  -->  00:03:12.860
Now if you're only planning to use
one version of Python, you can leave this

48

00:03:12.860  -->  00:03:17.920
unchanged - you don't need to change the
location. Otherwise just add Python 3.7.3

49

00:03:17.920  -->  00:03:20.480
which was the version we installed, or whatever version

50

00:03:20.490  -->  00:03:23.790
of python you installed, to the end of
that. I'm going to do that just so you

51

00:03:23.790  -->  00:03:26.400
can see how to use different versions of
Python if you ever wanted to do,

52

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:30.240
so I'm going to put, in my case, a backslash because I'm
doing this on Windows. You put a forward

53

00:03:30.240  -->  00:03:34.280
slash if you're on a Mac, and I'll put python, and what I'll do is I'll just put 3.7,

54

00:03:34.280  -->  00:03:38.580
I might put dot 3 on the
end. Just 3.7 is fine.

55

00:03:38.580  -->  00:03:41.460
So you can see my location, the C colon
backslash users backslash render

56

00:03:41.460  -->  00:03:46.500
backslash venv backslash Python 3.7.

57

00:03:46.500  -->  00:03:48.680
And you saw that under base interpreter,

58

00:03:48.680  -->  00:03:53.780
IntelliJ automatically found the
installation of Python 3, or Python 3.7

59

00:03:53.790  -->  00:03:57.150
in our case, 3.7.3, that we installed previously in

60

00:03:57.150  -->  00:04:00.330
the course, so it found that for us
automatically. If by chance it didn't,

61

00:04:00.330  -->  00:04:03.780
you'll need to navigate to the folder
where it was installed, and select it.

62

00:04:03.780  -->  00:04:06.900
In our case again, as I said, it's found it
for us so we don't need to do anything.

63

00:04:06.900  -->  00:04:10.800
You would need to change that, if
under base interpreter there was nothing showing.

64

00:04:10.800  -->  00:04:14.580
Alright I'm gonna click on OK there.

65

00:04:14.580  -->  00:04:17.220
You can see it's creating a virtual environment.

66

00:04:17.220  -->  00:04:20.120
Python is now selected under project SDK, and we're

67

00:04:20.130  -->  00:04:23.310
actually good to go. So I'm gonna click
on OK to that and there's a few other

68

00:04:23.310  -->  00:04:26.460
little things we'll need to do now. Click
on OK. We need to come down here to

69

00:04:26.460  -->  00:04:31.760
configure, and select settings, and on a
Mac that'll be preferences. So I check that,

70

00:04:31.760  -->  00:04:37.860
or select that. We want to start by going 
over here to Editor, and then General.

71

00:04:37.860  -->  00:04:42.150
I'm gonna start with auto import. I want to make
sure there's a check to the left, to the

72

00:04:42.150  -->  00:04:46.200
left hand side of Add unambiguous
imports on the fly, as well as a checkbox

73

00:04:46.200  -->  00:04:50.660
on Optimize imports on the fly. Then we
want to come down to Appearance.

74

00:04:50.660  -->  00:04:56.120
Make sure that Show line numbers is selected. And finally, come down to Code Folding.

75

00:04:56.130  -->  00:05:01.050
You want to make sure to deselect Imports,
deselect One-line methods,

76

00:05:01.050  -->  00:05:04.080
deselect Closures and Generic
constructor and Method parameters.

77

00:05:04.080  -->  00:05:08.080
So what we're trying to do here is just
make sure that all the code is showing

78

00:05:08.080  -->  00:05:11.320
on the screen and we're not getting any
code folding, which is a way to

79

00:05:11.320  -->  00:05:15.520
hide code for more experienced developers. If
you're dealing with code that is very

80

00:05:15.530  -->  00:05:19.040
mundane, it can be a good idea to hide
some of that so you can focus on what

81

00:05:19.040  -->  00:05:21.229
you're working on, but, when we're
starting out learning a new programming

82

00:05:21.229  -->  00:05:25.180
language it's a good idea to show all
the code, and that's what we're doing there.

83

00:05:25.180  -->  00:05:28.880
We're configuring it so that is
the case. So I'm going to click on OK,

84

00:05:28.880  -->  00:05:32.980
and at this point we're actually done. The
configuration of IntelliJ IDEA is now complete,

85

00:05:32.980  -->  00:05:37.260
and we can move on and start
programming in the next video.
