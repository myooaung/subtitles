00:00:05.240  -->  00:00:08.580
So it's a tradition, when learning any new programming language,

2

00:00:08.580  -->  00:00:12.520
that the first program you write should print out the text Hello World,

3

00:00:12.520  -->  00:00:14.740
and we're going to do just that in this video.

4

00:00:14.740  -->  00:00:21.520
So start Intellij DEA, as I have, and choose Create New Project from the Main menu.

5

00:00:21.520  -->  00:00:27.760
Now if you're using a different IDE or editor, use its command for creating a new Python project.

6

00:00:27.760  -->  00:00:31.160
So we want to select Python, on the left hand side, as I've done here,

7

00:00:31.160  -->  00:00:39.080
and also make sure you've got a valid Python SDK selected at the top right, and click on Next.

8

00:00:39.080  -->  00:00:42.940
Once you get to this screen, you can type in the project name.

9

00:00:42.940  -->  00:00:47.620
So I'm just going type in there, Hello World.

10

00:00:47.620  -->  00:00:52.020
Now I don't like using spaces in the names of things, as that can cause problems.

11

00:00:52.020  -->  00:00:54.940
To make the name more readable, I've used Pascal case.

12

00:00:54.940  -->  00:00:59.660
I've used a capital H for the word Hello, and W for the word World.

13

00:00:59.660  -->  00:01:05.840
Now you can change the location if you want, but make sure you don't put one project inside another project directory

14

00:01:05.840  -->  00:01:10.080
So what I'm going to do, and I'll fix up that spelling first,

15

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:14.880
I'm going to move to a new folder, just to show you what you would do, the first time you're setting this up.

16

00:01:14.880  -->  00:01:16.680
Then come to the folder.

17

00:01:16.680  -->  00:01:19.780
That's my main folder where I've got all my different programming languages.

18

00:01:19.780  -->  00:01:22.640
I'm going to create a new project.

19

00:01:22.640  -->  00:01:23.560
I need folder, rather, and I'm going to call

20

00:01:23.560  -->  00:01:33.200
this one python-masterclass-remaster-shared, and this is just a format that I've used on my computer.

21

00:01:33.200  -->  00:01:37.260
Alright, so scrolling up here, i'm gonna do the same thing that I've done for my java masterclass.

22

00:01:37.260  -->  00:01:44.080
I'm gonna create a subfolder called current Java masterclass remaster, but we're going to obviously call that Python.

23

00:01:44.080  -->  00:01:47.500
And this is just the way that I've set things up:

24

00:01:47.500  -->  00:01:57.420
python-masterclass-remaster, and I think I called it current at the start, so I'll put that current,

25

00:01:57.420  -->  00:02:01.100
and that's where all my projects are going to go, in that folder.

26

00:02:01.100  -->  00:02:06.140
Now the first time you do that, you create a new folder. If we look at the end of this project location,

27

00:02:06.140  -->  00:02:08.340
note that it hasn't got the project name there.

28

00:02:08.340  -->  00:02:16.360
So what you'll need to do for the very first project, is put a slash in there, and HelloWorld, being the name of the project.

29

00:02:16.360  -->  00:02:21.040
Subsequent times that you create new projects, it'll automatically find this project location,

30

00:02:21.040  -->  00:02:23.060
and put the project name after it.

31

00:02:23.060  -->  00:02:27.480
Alright, so at this point now that I've done that, I'm going to click on Finish.

32

00:02:27.480  -->  00:02:29.860
You're prompted now, do we want to create that folder?

33

00:02:29.860  -->  00:02:35.880
This is, I know it's a long path, but this is the path that I'm storing my files on a network drive,  so for me that's valid.

34

00:02:35.880  -->  00:02:40.660
You would choose whichever folder you wanted to, and make sure that was valid and then click OK.

35

00:02:40.660  -->  00:02:43.640
At this point, IntelliJ is setting up the project.

36

00:02:43.640  -->  00:02:47.820
Now it won't take long but it's a good idea not to do anything until it's finished.

37

00:02:47.820  -->  00:02:51.360
So you can see the messages down there
in the status bar, at the bottom of the screen.

38

00:02:51.360  -->  00:02:58.000
Wait for these to disappear, and you'll see IntelliJ uploading skeletons, whatever that means, and indexing the project,

39

00:02:58.000  -->  00:03:06.740
and then the project's been built and we should see the project pane open, and we'll be able to see some files there.

40

00:03:06.740  -->  00:03:09.760
Alright, so you can see now the project
pane open. There's no more,

41

00:03:09.760  -->  00:03:13.300
well actually there is a bit, there's the updating skeletons message you can see down the bottom there.

42

00:03:13.300  -->  00:03:15.340
So we'll just give that a moment to finish.

43

00:03:15.340  -->  00:03:18.900
Once it's done that, we can get started.

44

00:03:18.900  -->  00:03:25.180
Alright, so you can see now it's finally finished. There's now no more working messages appearing in the status bar.

45

00:03:25.180  -->  00:03:29.040
So what we want to do is create a new file for our program.

46

00:03:29.040  -->  00:03:32.360
So you want to make sure the project pane is open and you can see it is there.

47

00:03:32.360  -->  00:03:35.480
If it wasn't, by the way, you can come over here and click on project,

48

00:03:35.480  -->  00:03:39.420
and that will open and close the project tab. So make sure that's open.

49

00:03:39.420  -->  00:03:42.840
So at the top of the project pane in bold,
is the name of our project.

50

00:03:42.840  -->  00:03:45.060
That's Hello World in this case.

51

00:03:45.060  -->  00:03:47.880
So make sure that you click on this, which I'm doing now,

52

00:03:47.880  -->  00:03:52.920
before we do the next step, and once we do that the file menu changes, depending on what you've got selected.

53

00:03:52.920  -->  00:03:56.120
So after clicking on the Hello World project, which I've just done,

54

00:03:56.120  -->  00:04:01.380
I can either right click and select New, Python File.

55

00:04:01.380  -->  00:04:07.300
Alternatively, I could come up here after selecting that and click on File, New, Python File.

56

00:04:07.300  -->  00:04:13.380
Either way will do the same thing. Okay, I'm going to call this one helloworld.

57

00:04:13.380  -->  00:04:16.400
Then note that I've typed it all in lowercase with no spaces.

58

00:04:16.400  -->  00:04:23.700
IntelliJ will automatically add the dot py extension to the file, which is what Python files typically have as their source file,

59

00:04:23.700  -->  00:04:28.940
but if your IDE or editor doesn't do that, then you would type in the full name, helloworld.py

60

00:04:28.940  -->  00:04:30.580
I'm gonna click on OK

61

00:04:30.580  -->  00:04:35.440
and we can see there in the project pane to the left, that it has been named with helloworld.py.

62

00:04:35.440  -->  00:04:39.400
So at this point we've now got a new Python file open in the editor.

63

00:04:39.400  -->  00:04:43.260
I'll talk a bit more about these files and directories in the project pane later.

64

00:04:43.260  -->  00:04:50.060
The best advice I can give at the moment, is that if you didn't create a file or a directory,  then don't mess with it.

65

00:04:50.060  -->  00:04:55.000
You'll get strange problems if you try and put anything in that
.idea directory, for example.

66

00:04:55.000  -->  00:05:00.240
The only thing we're interested in at the moment, are the .py files that we create,

67

00:05:00.240  -->  00:05:04.240
and obviously helloworld.py is the one that we've created for this project.

68

00:05:04.240  -->  00:05:10.560
And for the moment they should all be created inside, directly inside, the HelloWorld project structure,

69

00:05:10.560  -->  00:05:12.280
and that's what we've done here.

70

00:05:12.280  -->  00:05:17.160
Alright, so in terms of the actual code for our first program, it's extremely simple.

71

00:05:17.160  -->  00:05:24.040
We're going to come up and start typing print left parenthesis, noting that a right one gets added for us automatically,

72

00:05:24.040  -->  00:05:28.300
single quote, noting that a second single quote gets added automatically,

73

00:05:28.300  -->  00:05:33.340
and if you're using another IDE or editor, you'll need to perhaps enter those manually yourself.

74

00:05:33.340  -->  00:05:38.680
We're going to type Hello, World and an exclamation mark,

75

00:05:38.680  -->  00:05:41.820
and that's literally it. That's our first Python program.

76

00:05:41.820  -->  00:05:47.780
To run the program, we want to right click anywhere here in the editor window, which is where we've typed our code,

77

00:05:47.780  -->  00:05:52.160
right click and click on Run Helloworld.

78

00:05:52.160  -->  00:05:55.620
You can see straight away, the output appears in the run window at the bottom,

79

00:05:55.620  -->  00:05:58.560
and that's initially configured to be at the bottom of the screen,

80

00:05:58.560  -->  00:06:01.200
and we can see the output, Hello World!

81

00:06:01.200  -->  00:06:03.760
And that's our first Python program.

82

00:06:03.760  -->  00:06:08.820
Although it's very simple, our Hello World program does include a few important basics.

83

00:06:08.820  -->  00:06:12.240
Firstly, we've used the Python function print.

84

00:06:12.240  -->  00:06:14.140
Python has many functions,

85

00:06:14.140  -->  00:06:19.260
such as mathematical functions like round, to round the number of digits after the decimal point

86

00:06:19.260  -->  00:06:25.740
and char, chr and ord, to convert characters to their numeric representations and vice-versa,

87

00:06:25.740  -->  00:06:27.240
as well as many more.

88

00:06:27.240  -->  00:06:30.580
You can also define your own functions, as we'll see later.

89

00:06:30.580  -->  00:06:34.640
In the next video, we'll see more ways to use the print function.

90

00:06:34.640  -->  00:06:37.520
See you in the next video.
