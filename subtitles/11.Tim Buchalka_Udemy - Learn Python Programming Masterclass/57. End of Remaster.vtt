00:00:04.040  -->  00:00:09.120
Alright, so you've reached the end of a
new content. Refer to the video at the

2

00:00:09.160  -->  00:00:11.840
start of the course called 
Course Remaster in progress,

3

00:00:11.840  -->  00:00:15.980
if you're unsure what I'm talking about here.
So we're releasing, just as a recap,

4

00:00:15.980  -->  00:00:20.740
an entire section of the new content that we're
remastering, at a time, rather than doing

5

00:00:20.740  -->  00:00:23.769
it a video at a time.
So the Work in Progress for a section

6

00:00:23.769  -->  00:00:26.890
can be checked out here in this section,
and you've obviously reached the latest,

7

00:00:26.890  -->  00:00:30.160
or the last video, telling you that's
where we're up to at the moment.

8

00:00:30.160  -->  00:00:34.300
So once I complete this section, we then move it
into the main course area,

9

00:00:34.300  -->  00:00:37.900
and that's when it replaces the older content.
But this is, sort of, like an early access

10

00:00:37.960  -->  00:00:42.420
or work in progress section, that you can
refer to. Keep in mind also, just as a recap,

11

00:00:42.420  -->  00:00:45.960
and I did mention this in the video
at the top, that the older content,

12

00:00:46.000  -->  00:00:48.600
the current content in the course
that hasn't yet been updated,

13

00:00:48.600  -->  00:00:52.900
that's still a hundred percent relevant and can be used,
and should be used, until such time

14

00:00:52.900  -->  00:00:56.760
as we get to re rendering all this course.
So I'm just basically, what we're doing here is

15

00:00:56.760  -->  00:01:01.260
we're raising the stakes and making the course better,
with new stuff and new recording.

16

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:05.700
So my advice here is don't actually
wait for new sections to be done.

17

00:01:05.700  -->  00:01:09.070
Just go for it now and when
you get to the stage of seeing that a

18

00:01:09.070  -->  00:01:12.920
new section has been replaced, or the
section has been replaced with the new content,

19

00:01:12.920  -->  00:01:16.520
sure you can go back and watch
it then. But while you're waiting,

20

00:01:16.520  -->  00:01:20.000
go through the course as it is. Alright I'm
waffling, so I'm going to stop here now.

21

00:01:20.000  -->  00:01:22.940
We'll see you in another video.
