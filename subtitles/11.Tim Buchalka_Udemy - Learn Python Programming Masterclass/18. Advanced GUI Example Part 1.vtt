00:00:05.600  -->  00:00:10.730
so in the previous video we talked about
creating an advanced screen to give you
2

2

00:00:10.730  -->  00:00:14.610
an idea on how to go about building a
more complex screen interface and I just
3

3

00:00:14.610  -->  00:00:19.270
want to show the screens once again
the one on the right hand side obviously
4

4

00:00:19.270  -->  00:00:23.230
they're both the same screen but the one
on the left hand side is showing you how
5

5

00:00:23.230  -->  00:00:26.980
it's set up in a grid layouts so you can see the orange lines showing you the
6

6

00:00:26.980  -->  00:00:32.000
columns and rows and on the right hand
side is the actual screen will try to
7

7

00:00:32.000  -->  00:00:36.770
build without the grid lines
so let's make a start on creating that now
8

8

00:00:36.770  -->  00:00:37.670
in this video
9

9

00:00:37.670  -->  00:00:41.890
we're going to do is open up the file that
we're working on the previous video we are
10

10

00:00:41.890  -->  00:00:46.210
going to copy some code I'm going to
copy this first bit up to and including
11

11

00:00:46.210  -->  00:00:51.810
the main line that geometry line copy all of
that taje a copy and I'm gonna go ahead and
12

12

00:00:51.810  -->  00:00:56.630
create a new file right click click on
new click on Python file and I'm gonna
13

13

00:00:56.630  -->  00:01:04.490
call this one screen and paste in that code
that's just our basic starting code instead of
14

14

00:01:04.490  -->  00:01:11.940
hello world what I'm gonna do is call it grid
demo and we are going to leave the defaults
15

15

00:01:11.940  -->  00:01:18.090
their 640 by 480 and then of course the
offsets that we had previously we are gonna
16

16

00:01:18.090  -->  00:01:23.930
use those as well ok just bring up on the screen we want to add
the label first the labels on the first
17

17

00:01:23.930  -->  00:01:29.150
line and notice how it spans multiple columns across we need to do the code for
18

18

00:01:29.150  -->  00:01:35.730
that as well so type....
19

19

00:01:35.730  -->  00:01:41.950
.....
20

20

00:01:41.950  -->  00:02:04.550
......
21

21

00:02:04.550  -->  00:02:09.320
...so lets run it and see what it looks like
22

22

00:02:09.320  -->  00:02:16.460
now even thought we specified column
span equals 3 notice how it is still over to the
23

23

00:02:16.460  -->  00:02:20.920
left hand side and you would think that
it should be centered because the
24

24

00:02:20.920  -->  00:02:25.850
default value for sticky is centered but the
reason is we haven't given weights to the
25

25

00:02:25.850  -->  00:02:29.990
columns or put anything in them so they don't
really exist until that point so we have
26

26

00:02:29.990  -->  00:02:33.930
to sort of imagined them do in order to lay
everything out so once we set the weights
27

27

00:02:33.930  -->  00:02:37.040
columns the labels should be
re-positioned correctly
28

28

00:02:37.040  -->  00:02:41.570
let's go back and actually do that now
come down here before the main loop because of course
29

29

00:02:41.570  -->  00:02:50.040
that's the last statement......
30

30

00:02:50.040  -->  00:02:59.240
....lets go
ahead and copy some of this.....
31

31

00:02:59.240  -->  00:03:06.920
......
32

32

00:03:06.920  -->  00:03:13.390
....so that's our columns
configured then we need to do the same
33

33

00:03:13.390  -->  00:03:28.660
thing for our rows so.....
34

34

00:03:28.660  -->  00:03:36.240
......
35

35

00:03:36.240  -->  00:03:42.330
...so row 0 only contains
36

36

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:47.570
the headings so files list box is going start
therefor on row 1 column 0 in case you're wondering but before
37

37

00:03:47.570  -->  00:03:56.300
we see that lets just run this and what I need to do is close the one from last time and there it is you can see it
38

38

00:03:56.300  -->  00:04:04.450
is a bit more centered now and if we look at our
images notice how
39

39

00:04:04.450  -->  00:04:08.430
it's basically moved over a little bit
but it's still not fully moved over to
40

40

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:12.520
where we perhaps think it should be but
as we continue on in the demo will see
41

41

00:04:12.520  -->  00:04:13.230
that should work
42

42

00:04:13.230  -->  00:04:18.710
incidentally these screen shots were
taken on Linux and so really only
43

43

00:04:18.710  -->  00:04:23.080
looking at the first part here the part above that is from the previous software that it comes with
44

44

00:04:23.080  -->  00:04:26.790
the MAC so that is why it does look a little bit
different
45

45

00:04:26.790  -->  00:04:33.140
ok so what to do next is add the listbox
let's go ahead and do that is gonna be
46

46

00:04:33.140  -->  00:04:40.680
right under the row configure file list will call it.....
47

47

00:04:40.680  -->  00:04:44.500
......
48

48

00:04:44.500  -->  00:05:03.310
.......
49

49

00:05:03.310  -->  00:05:08.640
......just like the column span we defined on line 12 rows span
50

50

00:05:08.640  -->  00:05:14.920
does the similar thing but for rows we are gonna set that to 2 and we want to configure our
51

51

00:05:14.920  -->  00:05:21.470
list box so....
52

52

00:05:21.470  -->  00:05:29.420
...and just to be clear with
53

53

00:05:29.420  -->  00:05:33.380
the sticky we are position the listbox
against the left-hand edge of the cell
54

54

00:05:33.380  -->  00:05:37.950
we've done that by specifying west
and expanded to fill the entire cell
55

55

00:05:37.950  -->  00:05:42.130
by also specifying east so we start of
west and went east we've also caused it to
56

56

00:05:42.130  -->  00:05:46.170
expand to fill the entire height north and south so it's going to take up two rows
57

57

00:05:46.170  -->  00:05:49.560
in the final layout and of course row span equals 2 does so that's why we're
58

58

00:05:49.560  -->  00:05:54.950
actually specifying in sticky nsew so we want it to get to expand the entire height and
59

59

00:05:54.950  -->  00:06:00.360
the entire width for those rows and I
mentioned that we added sunken and you
60

60

00:06:00.360  -->  00:06:05.440
can see there there is other options you can
choose flat grooved raised ridge solid
61

61

00:06:05.440  -->  00:06:08.630
as well as sunken so feel free to
experiment to see what they look like
62

62

00:06:08.630  -->  00:06:15.430
I'm just gonna use sunken for this and what I'm gonna
do is create some code to populate the list
63

63

00:06:15.430  -->  00:06:19.500
box so instead of having to type up a long
list of items manually what we're going
64

64

00:06:19.500  -->  00:06:22.650
to do is we are going to generate one by
getting a directory listing of where we use
65

65

00:06:22.650  -->  00:06:27.590
folder now on a Mac which right now on a
Linux I'm gonna type on a command and
66

66

00:06:27.590  -->  00:06:30.920
if your in Windows you need to just
change and I'll actually tell you what to
67

67

00:06:30.920  -->  00:06:40.080
command to type if you're on Windows being on Mac
I'm gonna type....abreviated for
68

68

00:06:40.080  -->  00:06:44.050
list directory and OS is the
operating system code and what we need
69

69

00:06:44.050  -->  00:06:54.040
to do is come back here in order to do
that and put an import.....
70

70

00:06:54.040  -->  00:06:55.840
.....
71

71

00:06:55.840  -->  00:07:01.790
....and what I'm gonna do is put in a directory which is....and that's applicable for
72

72

00:07:01.790  -->  00:07:06.690
as I mentioned if your on a Mac or Linux
now if not
73

73

00:07:06.690  -->  00:07:19.100
if your on a Windows machine instead of typing...../usr/bin
instead we type this.....
74

74

00:07:19.100  -->  00:07:23.200
so basically replace the entire thing with
a single quotes we've replace that with
75

75

00:07:23.200  -->  00:07:28.190
the / windows / system32 and that should
work give you a listing of some files
76

76

00:07:28.190  -->  00:07:35.060
that are actually in your Windows folder the indented code is going to be....
77

77

00:07:35.060  -->  00:07:44.910
...so it is going to
basically add the file name in case you're
78

78

00:07:44.910  -->  00:07:48.280
wondering Tkinter.END when you're
inserting an item to a list box you
79

79

00:07:48.280  -->  00:07:53.920
need to specify the insertion point so we are
using the Tkinter constant called end and
80

80

00:07:53.920  -->  00:07:56.980
that places each entry at the end of the
list as they are added so you specified
81

81

00:07:56.980  -->  00:08:02.190
a number for example we are changing Tkinter.END
into the number zero and the list is going to appear
82

82

00:08:02.190  -->  00:08:06.750
in reverse because each item is going to be inserted at
the start of the list instead of the end we gonna leave it
83

83

00:08:06.750  -->  00:08:13.230
at how it is now so lets run that
and see that it's working.....
84

84

00:08:13.230  -->  00:08:18.040
....lets just run it
85

85

00:08:18.040  -->  00:08:20.100
again
86

86

00:08:20.100  -->  00:08:25.950
and look at our code and you can see there's a list of
file names that have been populated in their
87

87

00:08:25.950  -->  00:08:29.350
but notice at the moment if you go back to what
we're trying to achieve with our interface
88

88

00:08:29.350  -->  00:08:33.940
will need to add a scroll bar so were gonna do
that next so that we can actually see
89

89

00:08:33.940  -->  00:08:48.530
what a scroll bar would look like so close that down come back to the code and add a scroll bar and will type....
90

90

00:08:48.530  -->  00:08:53.330
.....yes it is a different component it's not part of the list box
91

91

00:08:53.330  -->  00:09:01.970
......
92

92

00:09:01.970  -->  00:09:08.430
.....obviously it needs to be vertical to match
up with the list box so....
93

93

00:09:08.430  -->  00:09:09.230
.....
94

94

00:09:09.230  -->  00:09:13.410
....and next we are gonna type something we haven't
95

95

00:09:13.410  -->  00:09:19.520
talked about before which is command
so come back here command....
96

96

00:09:19.520  -->  00:09:27.720
...so as I've mention we haven't seen command before but
97

97

00:09:27.720  -->  00:09:32.780
this is how actions are associated with
widgets and UI events so here command is set
98

98

00:09:32.780  -->  00:09:36.700
to the wide view method of the list box
and if you control click on wide view and if I do that
99

99

00:09:36.700  -->  00:09:42.390
now you can see that it's
used to query and change the vertical
100

100

00:09:42.390  -->  00:09:44.370
position and if the scroll bar was
101

101

00:09:44.370  -->  00:09:49.620
horizontal then we would have to use xview instead of yview
to handle horizontal in this case we are
102

102

00:09:49.620  -->  00:09:56.090
vertical so we are good to go with that
and on the next line......
103

103

00:09:56.090  -->  00:10:04.910
......
104

104

00:10:04.910  -->  00:10:14.480
...we want it to basically come down to be the same
length as the list box so there is one
105

105

00:10:14.480  -->  00:10:17.520
further step involved in linking the
scroll box to the list box and that
106

106

00:10:17.520  -->  00:10:21.850
using the y scroll Command Option
of the list box and that the
107

107

00:10:21.850  -->  00:10:26.480
list box call the set method of the
scroll bar when it changes and the reason it might
108

108

00:10:26.480  -->  00:10:30.490
change is for example if more items were
added or its scrolled using the keyboard
109

109

00:10:30.490  -->  00:10:34.220
or mouse wheel now if the scroll bar was horizontal
then we would use a different commands so
110

110

00:10:34.220  -->  00:10:37.890
but in this case its vertical so I'm going to type....
111

111

00:10:37.890  -->  00:10:46.110
......
112

112

00:10:46.110  -->  00:10:59.230
.....and that should be that so if we run that.....
113

113

00:10:59.230  -->  00:11:02.340
you can see we've got
scrolling implemented which is pretty
114

114

00:11:02.340  -->  00:11:08.350
cool we should be able to also
scroll with our key pressing the up and down arrow
115

115

00:11:08.350  -->  00:11:12.620
key so that's cool we are making some
progress here our interface is starting to come
116

116

00:11:12.620  -->  00:11:16.800
together and you can see that the
brilliant part of TKinter in Python
117

117

00:11:16.800  -->  00:11:20.930
in general is it at this very few commands
that need to be typed to achieve quite a
118

118

00:11:20.930  -->  00:11:24.840
significant graphical user interface
which is pretty cool ok so next what we
119

119

00:11:24.840  -->  00:11:32.050
want to do is start looking we need to add a label frame first and if we bring the image back on the screen again we
120

120

00:11:32.050  -->  00:11:35.700
want to actually create a frame and
settle this up so this heading
121

121

00:11:35.700  -->  00:11:40.740
to save file details and we went to
actually have these radio buttons all
122

122

00:11:40.740  -->  00:11:46.560
showing on the screen there so
let's go ahead and do that add that and I'll make a note
123

123

00:11:46.560  -->  00:12:00.520
.....
124

124

00:12:00.520  -->  00:12:30.710
......
125

125

00:12:30.710  -->  00:12:39.170
...now what we're
doing is we're creating 3 radio
126

126

00:12:39.170  -->  00:12:42.270
buttons that all share the same variable
and the reason we doing this is
127

127

00:12:42.270  -->  00:12:45.870
only one can be selected any one time
so as you click on each one the one that
128

128

00:12:45.870  -->  00:12:50.030
was previously selected is automatically
un-selected now the mechanism to do this
129

129

00:12:50.030  -->  00:12:54.870
in Python relies on the Tkinter
control variables that can be bound to
130

130

00:12:54.870  -->  00:12:57.450
one or more widgets and that's what we
gonna be doing here we've created this
131

131

00:12:57.450  -->  00:13:07.960
tkinter.IntVar to do that and you'll see how that will work shortly.....
132

132

00:13:07.960  -->  00:13:11.490
.....
133

133

00:13:11.490  -->  00:13:17.930
......
134

134

00:13:17.930  -->  00:13:24.300
.....because the
135

135

00:13:24.300  -->  00:13:28.850
frame itself is attached to the main window
so the text for the first one if you recall was
136

136

00:13:28.850  -->  00:13:38.250
file name so I'm gonna add that....
137

137

00:13:38.250  -->  00:13:42.910
......and do the same to the other two
138

138

00:13:42.910  -->  00:13:50.300
buttons we just change references
so....
139

139

00:13:50.300  -->  00:13:54.950
...because each button you click we want a different value so we can
140

140

00:13:54.950  -->  00:13:59.680
pragmatically determine which
button is clicked and time stamp was the
141

141

00:13:59.680  -->  00:14:06.300
text for the third one and second one was path so that's how we associate and its
142

142

00:14:06.300  -->  00:14:09.740
going to be one variable that we can
query and we'll know depending on the
143

143

00:14:09.740  -->  00:14:13.990
value of that rbValue whether it's one
two or three as to which radio button was
144

144

00:14:13.990  -->  00:14:26.170
actually clicked so lets just go ahead and add
it......
145

145

00:14:26.170  -->  00:14:39.360
.....
146

146

00:14:39.360  -->  00:14:44.490
......and what will also do just out of
147

147

00:14:44.490  -->  00:14:51.080
interest and here I'm gonna do.....
148

148

00:14:51.080  -->  00:14:55.440
.....and by adding that
149

149

00:14:55.440  -->  00:15:00.630
we can get a printout of the number as
the radio button is clicked so you can confirm that
150

150

00:15:00.630  -->  00:15:04.640
it is actually doing the right things and we should be able to run that
151

151

00:15:04.640  -->  00:15:11.920
so let's run that and see that it's
working and notice we got our radio buttons now and now if I click on
152

152

00:15:11.920  -->  00:15:16.140
and we are not going to get output now until I
actually close the program down because
153

153

00:15:16.140  -->  00:15:21.990
we are obviously looping here on this line 51
but given the default value has change we should get a
154

154

00:15:21.990  -->  00:15:26.380
value of 2 if I close this down you can see
that 2 has come up there and just to
155

155

00:15:26.380  -->  00:15:32.080
confirm run again this time
I'm going to select option three their
156

156

00:15:32.080  -->  00:15:35.790
which is that one close it down
we have the value of 3 so you can see
157

157

00:15:35.790  -->  00:15:40.860
that we're actually getting the right value and we are just fine and incidentally the other thing I didn't
158

158

00:15:40.860  -->  00:15:45.880
point out was the label frame on line 38
the reason I chose label
159

159

00:15:45.880  -->  00:15:51.430
frame their as a frame is it's very similar to
frames we have use previously but it allows
160

160

00:15:51.430  -->  00:15:55.050
a caption to be sent using the text
option and you can see that on line
161

161

00:15:55.050  -->  00:15:58.840
38 I've added the text option which is cool but it
also adds that border
162

162

00:15:58.840  -->  00:16:04.540
s o it draws a border around the content such so just
run it again should have mentioned that earlier so can
163

163

00:16:04.540  -->  00:16:10.180
see it's allowed us to actually add the text about the actual name and its
164

164

00:16:10.180  -->  00:16:14.010
also drawn this border around it so its
pretty neat so its ideal for like a set of
165

165

00:16:14.010  -->  00:16:19.510
radio buttons that we got on the screen
there now ok so close that and on
166

166

00:16:19.510  -->  00:16:24.020
line 53 .get that is obviously
retrieving the value wherever the
167

167

00:16:24.020  -->  00:16:27.350
previous button has been
selected and we can do that
168

168

00:16:27.350  -->  00:16:30.080
pragmatically then to determine the
course of action depending on which radio
169

169

00:16:30.080  -->  00:16:34.200
button was actually clicked there's also
a .set as you can see where we set the
170

170

00:16:34.200  -->  00:16:41.210
initial default values so if change that
to 2 and run again what that will do is
171

171

00:16:41.210  -->  00:16:45.590
give you or it should default the middle
radio button as you can see there that's
172

172

00:16:45.590  -->  00:16:49.120
the default option in case you're
wondering how it determines how many
173

173

00:16:49.120  -->  00:16:54.480
radio buttons it is because we
specify rbValue on line 44 to 46
174

174

00:16:54.480  -->  00:16:59.660
it know because that's that special type of an IntVar part of TKinter it knows how many radio
175

175

00:16:59.660  -->  00:17:02.430
buttons because we're assigning that
multiple times and of course we're
176

176

00:17:02.430  -->  00:17:05.980
setting the value as well ok so I'm
going to finish this video here now
177

177

00:17:05.980  -->  00:17:11.050
in the next video we'll continue on and will
start looking at the other elements from
178

178

00:17:11.050  -->  00:17:12.630
the GUI so see you in the next video
