00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:08,200
<v Narrator>In the last video, we created a simple class</v>
2

2

00:00:08,200  -->  00:00:10,270
that can store itself into a database
3

3

00:00:10,270  -->  00:00:12,710
and also initialise itself from the database
4

4

00:00:12,710  -->  00:00:17,010
if that database exists and the data is in the table.
5

5

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:20,550
So, we should now have a few records in our accounts table
6

6

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:24,050
and up until now we used the sqlite command line interface
7

7

00:00:24,050  -->  00:00:25,800
to view our database.
8

8

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:27,720
Now it's important to know how to do that
9

9

00:00:27,720  -->  00:00:30,000
and also how to use the SQL commands,
10

10

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:31,430
but now that we're back in IlelliJ,
11

11

00:00:31,430  -->  00:00:34,120
there's actually an easy way to database view,
12

12

00:00:34,120  -->  00:00:36,730
so we're gonna be talking about that in this video.
13

13

00:00:36,730  -->  00:00:38,720
Now I've closed the run window from the last video
14

14

00:00:38,720  -->  00:00:40,470
because we're gonna need the space
15

15

00:00:40,470  -->  00:00:42,740
and if you haven't already done it,
16

16

00:00:42,740  -->  00:00:45,670
split line five like I've done here over two lines,
17

17

00:00:45,670  -->  00:00:47,500
because that will actually get rid of one of the warnings
18

18

00:00:47,500  -->  00:00:49,250
over here in the right hand side,
19

19

00:00:49,250  -->  00:00:51,120
but I've already done that so consequentially,
20

20

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:53,290
I haven't actually got that warning.
21

21

00:00:53,290  -->  00:00:56,510
Now, each line of SQL though, if we have a look at it
22

22

00:00:56,510  -->  00:00:58,790
and just come over here, has basically got the same
23

23

00:00:58,790  -->  00:01:00,970
error message, "No data sources are configured
24

24

00:01:00,970  -->  00:01:02,690
"to run this SQL."
25

25

00:01:02,690  -->  00:01:04,720
And you can see there's a few there.
26

26

00:01:04,720  -->  00:01:07,390
And also down here, there's one.
27

27

00:01:08,540  -->  00:01:11,430
And as I said in the last video, that's not a warning
28

28

00:01:11,430  -->  00:01:15,250
about our pathing code, it's IntelliJ advising us
29

29

00:01:15,250  -->  00:01:17,370
that it could check our SQL statements for us
30

30

00:01:17,370  -->  00:01:20,040
if we configured a data source.
31

31

00:01:20,040  -->  00:01:21,880
So what we're gonna do is start by opening
32

32

00:01:21,880  -->  00:01:25,050
the Database Tool window, we can go down or up I should say
33

33

00:01:25,050  -->  00:01:28,550
to View, Tool Windows and select Database.
34

34

00:01:33,590  -->  00:01:35,590
I could also have clicked on Database over here
35

35

00:01:35,590  -->  00:01:38,040
on the right hand side.
36

36

00:01:38,040  -->  00:01:41,210
Now from here what we can do is create a data source.
37

37

00:01:41,210  -->  00:01:43,540
We can do that with Control End or Command End,
38

38

00:01:43,540  -->  00:01:45,160
depending on your operating system,
39

39

00:01:45,160  -->  00:01:48,380
alternatively we can just click on this little plus,
40

40

00:01:48,380  -->  00:01:49,640
on the top left here.
41

41

00:01:49,640  -->  00:01:51,270
But the other way of doing it is just to drag
42

42

00:01:51,270  -->  00:01:53,790
the database file into the window.
43

43

00:01:53,790  -->  00:01:55,460
Now this only works if the file has got
44

44

00:01:55,460  -->  00:01:59,850
the correct extension, now IntelliJ uses the Windows system
45

45

00:01:59,850  -->  00:02:02,660
where the file extension determines the type of the file.
46

46

00:02:02,660  -->  00:02:04,860
And that's why it was important to give the database
47

47

00:02:04,860  -->  00:02:08,910
a .sqlite extension, even on Linus or OSX.
48

48

00:02:08,910  -->  00:02:11,070
Those two operating systems don't use file extensions
49

49

00:02:11,070  -->  00:02:13,360
in the same way, but IntelliJ
50

50

00:02:13,360  -->  00:02:15,670
does rely on them on all platforms.
51

51

00:02:15,670  -->  00:02:17,990
So what we can do is over here is, we can drag on
52

52

00:02:17,990  -->  00:02:22,130
this accounts.sqlite and drag it and drop it
53

53

00:02:22,130  -->  00:02:25,470
into the Database pane and you can see when I did that
54

54

00:02:25,470  -->  00:02:27,750
we've now got an entry showing.
55

55

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:30,420
And I'll just move this over a little bit.
56

56

00:02:30,420  -->  00:02:32,630
So, now that I've done that, you can see that
57

57

00:02:32,630  -->  00:02:34,550
some of the errors have disappeared,
58

58

00:02:34,550  -->  00:02:35,990
but we've still got some other ones here,
59

59

00:02:35,990  -->  00:02:38,730
one "Unable to resolve column 'balance'",
60

60

00:02:38,730  -->  00:02:39,910
but the ones that have disappeared
61

61

00:02:39,910  -->  00:02:43,890
are the ones relating to creation of the tables.
62

62

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:46,250
The reason that it's disappeared is that
63

63

00:02:46,250  -->  00:02:48,970
IntelliJ now knows the names of the tables
64

64

00:02:48,970  -->  00:02:51,790
and actually recognises the data source.
65

65

00:02:51,790  -->  00:02:53,700
Now we still got warnings, as I mentioned,
66

66

00:02:53,700  -->  00:02:55,980
that we can't resolve the column names
67

67

00:02:55,980  -->  00:02:57,280
and that's because InelliJ doesn't have
68

68

00:02:57,280  -->  00:03:00,370
the correct driver for sqlite databases.
69

69

00:03:00,370  -->  00:03:01,880
So the first time you do this, you'll need
70

70

00:03:01,880  -->  00:03:05,660
to instal the drivers for whichever database you're using.
71

71

00:03:05,660  -->  00:03:08,060
And that's why accounts in the Database window
72

72

00:03:08,060  -->  00:03:10,150
is underlined as you can see here.
73

73

00:03:10,150  -->  00:03:13,980
And if I hover over it, you can see we've got a message
74

74

00:03:13,980  -->  00:03:17,350
"Can't find the driver, open preferences to download".
75

75

00:03:17,350  -->  00:03:19,230
So we're gonna right click on this database now
76

76

00:03:19,230  -->  00:03:21,060
and select Properties.
77

77

00:03:23,380  -->  00:03:24,560
And there is a link down here where it says
78

78

00:03:24,560  -->  00:03:29,330
Download missing driver files, so click on that.
79

79

00:03:29,330  -->  00:03:30,810
And hopefully you can see that it's downloaded
80

80

00:03:30,810  -->  00:03:33,090
the relevant files for us automatically
81

81

00:03:33,090  -->  00:03:34,920
and I can click on OK.
82

82

00:03:36,790  -->  00:03:38,330
And you can see the errors have now disappeared,
83

83

00:03:38,330  -->  00:03:40,330
the warnings rather have disappeared,
84

84

00:03:40,330  -->  00:03:42,610
the underline on accounts has disappeared
85

85

00:03:42,610  -->  00:03:46,800
and IntelliJ is now fully aware of the data source
86

86

00:03:46,800  -->  00:03:50,620
and as well as the tables and columns within that.
87

87

00:03:50,620  -->  00:03:53,920
All right, so I just wanna show you a quick slide here,
88

88

00:03:53,920  -->  00:03:56,030
if you're using Windows, because this step
89

89

00:03:56,030  -->  00:04:00,200
you might actually get a Windows Security Alert popup.
90

90

00:04:01,080  -->  00:04:02,950
So this is the dialogue that I'm talking about
91

91

00:04:02,950  -->  00:04:05,150
and again, this is only a Windows thing,
92

92

00:04:05,150  -->  00:04:09,050
so you may actually get this popup on your computer.
93

93

00:04:09,050  -->  00:04:12,420
So if you do get that, it's important
94

94

00:04:12,420  -->  00:04:15,390
to allow access on private networks.
95

95

00:04:15,390  -->  00:04:17,190
So righter strangely, the dialogue appears
96

96

00:04:17,190  -->  00:04:19,340
with Public networks already ticked
97

97

00:04:19,340  -->  00:04:21,130
and you probably don't want to allow that.
98

98

00:04:21,130  -->  00:04:23,290
So Untick Pulic networks and make sure
99

99

00:04:23,290  -->  00:04:25,730
you tick Private networks before clicking
100

100

00:04:25,730  -->  00:04:27,750
the Allow access button, so I'm just gonna bring
101

101

00:04:27,750  -->  00:04:29,210
that on the screen again while I'm talking
102

102

00:04:29,210  -->  00:04:32,500
just so you can see that image, if you don't allow access
103

103

00:04:32,500  -->  00:04:34,870
on Private networks, you'll get all sorts of problems
104

104

00:04:34,870  -->  00:04:38,880
with updates and so forth, so again, what we need to do here
105

105

00:04:38,880  -->  00:04:43,070
if Public networks is ticked and you do get this dialogue,
106

106

00:04:43,070  -->  00:04:44,490
you probably don't want to allow that,
107

107

00:04:44,490  -->  00:04:46,890
so you untick Public networks and make sure
108

108

00:04:46,890  -->  00:04:48,920
you tick Private networks before clicking
109

109

00:04:48,920  -->  00:04:50,990
on the Allow access button.
110

110

00:04:50,990  -->  00:04:52,460
All right, so back to the slide.
111

111

00:04:52,460  -->  00:04:54,900
So notice that this dialogue may appear again,
112

112

00:04:54,900  -->  00:04:58,070
after a Java update, so it is a persistent setting,
113

113

00:04:58,070  -->  00:05:00,830
but a new of Java will trigger it again.
114

114

00:05:00,830  -->  00:05:03,520
And again, this is only a Windows thing.
115

115

00:05:03,520  -->  00:05:05,760
Okay, so now that we've got the right drivers,
116

116

00:05:05,760  -->  00:05:08,820
the warnings disappear and IntelliJ can verify
117

117

00:05:08,820  -->  00:05:10,410
our table and column names as you can see.
118

118

00:05:10,410  -->  00:05:13,290
So that's pretty cool, but it does actually get better.
119

119

00:05:13,290  -->  00:05:17,930
And I'm just gonna expand this out a little bit again.
120

120

00:05:17,930  -->  00:05:20,260
And if we now expand this, we can see that
121

121

00:05:20,260  -->  00:05:22,990
it's showing us helpfully the list of tables
122

122

00:05:22,990  -->  00:05:24,860
and we can expand those further and actually see
123

123

00:05:24,860  -->  00:05:27,870
the columns within tables and note that
124

124

00:05:27,870  -->  00:05:31,900
for the transactions table, time is showing as TEXT
125

125

00:05:31,900  -->  00:05:34,210
rather than TIMESTAMP and you'll only see
126

126

00:05:34,210  -->  00:05:37,940
the normal sqlite types when you the schema this way,
127

127

00:05:37,940  -->  00:05:40,740
so it's not actually perfect, you do have to take care
128

128

00:05:40,740  -->  00:05:43,280
if you modify any nonstandard columns from here,
129

129

00:05:43,280  -->  00:05:44,660
but it's still a very useful feature
130

130

00:05:44,660  -->  00:05:46,900
and makes life a lot easier.
131

131

00:05:46,900  -->  00:05:49,750
Now you can also double click on the table names
132

132

00:05:49,750  -->  00:05:53,160
or use the Table Editor button on the toolbar,
133

133

00:05:53,160  -->  00:05:54,510
which is this button here, which is greyed out,
134

134

00:05:54,510  -->  00:05:57,800
because I haven't selected a table.
135

135

00:05:57,800  -->  00:06:00,320
Clicking on that actually gives us a list
136

136

00:06:00,320  -->  00:06:03,090
of entries that are actually in the database.
137

137

00:06:03,090  -->  00:06:05,090
Or specifically in that table.
138

138

00:06:05,090  -->  00:06:07,000
And up here, you've actually got an entry
139

139

00:06:07,000  -->  00:06:08,490
where you can actually add a new row
140

140

00:06:08,490  -->  00:06:10,940
and because we've got accounts open,
141

141

00:06:10,940  -->  00:06:13,860
this toolbar is relating to the accounts table,
142

142

00:06:13,860  -->  00:06:15,450
we can actually add a new record if we want,
143

143

00:06:15,450  -->  00:06:19,190
so I click on that and double click into the record,
144

144

00:06:19,190  -->  00:06:21,630
or into the column rather, enter a new name
145

145

00:06:21,630  -->  00:06:25,120
say Michael, I can tab or double click on the balance
146

146

00:06:25,120  -->  00:06:28,700
and let's put in 500, press enter there.
147

147

00:06:28,700  -->  00:06:31,230
So we add another record, we need another Terry,
148

148

00:06:31,230  -->  00:06:34,310
so let's double click type Terry in here,
149

149

00:06:34,310  -->  00:06:37,310
and and we put in an amount of zero.
150

150

00:06:38,340  -->  00:06:39,980
Now we get an error or rather,
151

151

00:06:39,980  -->  00:06:42,740
we should get an error but we don't yet.
152

152

00:06:42,740  -->  00:06:44,770
Now note that the two new entries
153

153

00:06:44,770  -->  00:06:47,780
are highlighted in green here, we've added the rows
154

154

00:06:47,780  -->  00:06:49,900
but the change hasn't been commuted to the database,
155

155

00:06:49,900  -->  00:06:51,480
that's why it's in green.
156

156

00:06:51,480  -->  00:06:54,210
So two buttons have become available up here on the toolbar
157

157

00:06:54,210  -->  00:06:56,490
and they're quite small though so might have to
158

158

00:06:56,490  -->  00:06:58,810
sort of squinch your eyes to see them.
159

159

00:06:58,810  -->  00:07:01,050
So I've got this one here, which is gonna be Submit
160

160

00:07:01,050  -->  00:07:04,500
and we've got this one here which is Revert.
161

161

00:07:04,500  -->  00:07:07,340
And notice that it wasn't active, the Revert button
162

162

00:07:07,340  -->  00:07:11,000
until I selected a record, so if I've got Terry selected
163

163

00:07:11,000  -->  00:07:15,920
clicking on Revert once removes and if I click on it again
164

164

00:07:15,920  -->  00:07:19,190
that's removed Michael as well and it's now disabled
165

165

00:07:19,190  -->  00:07:21,720
because of course everything's been commuted to the database
166

166

00:07:21,720  -->  00:07:24,120
and there's nothing to update or revert.
167

167

00:07:24,120  -->  00:07:28,290
All right, so we're gonna add those two entries again.
168

168

00:07:31,230  -->  00:07:34,070
Michael, 500 and also Terry, zero.
169

169

00:07:39,740  -->  00:07:42,830
This time I'm gonna submit the change
170

170

00:07:42,830  -->  00:07:44,990
and notice we've got an error down the bottom.
171

171

00:07:44,990  -->  00:07:46,820
Abort due to constraint violation
172

172

00:07:46,820  -->  00:07:49,950
(UNIQUE constraint failed: accounts.name)
173

173

00:07:49,950  -->  00:07:52,180
So why are we actually getting this error?
174

174

00:07:52,180  -->  00:07:54,950
Well, it's because the name column is the primary key
175

175

00:07:54,950  -->  00:07:57,980
and primary key fields have to be unique.
176

176

00:07:57,980  -->  00:07:59,690
And right down the bottom of the screen you can see
177

177

00:07:59,690  -->  00:08:01,970
that it's even showing you the SQL that
178

178

00:08:01,970  -->  00:08:05,640
it was trying to use to add these records to the database,
179

179

00:08:05,640  -->  00:08:08,070
So in this case it's failed, again, because of
180

180

00:08:08,070  -->  00:08:12,230
the unique constraint as duplicating the name Terry.
181

181

00:08:13,970  -->  00:08:15,750
So let's go ahead and make this new Terry unique,
182

182

00:08:15,750  -->  00:08:20,310
so I'll put Terry and we'll put TerryG there this time.
183

183

00:08:20,310  -->  00:08:23,080
And if I submit this time, you'll see
184

184

00:08:23,080  -->  00:08:26,990
that it worked successfully and the entries are no longer
185

185

00:08:26,990  -->  00:08:28,620
in green which tells us that they've been actually
186

186

00:08:28,620  -->  00:08:30,450
added to the database.
187

187

00:08:32,020  -->  00:08:35,030
At this point I can't then Revert the change
188

188

00:08:35,030  -->  00:08:36,300
and just to show you something here, if I change
189

189

00:08:36,300  -->  00:08:39,460
this TerryG to TerryH, whoops, TerryH,
190

190

00:08:45,460  -->  00:08:48,220
we can then revert that change if we want to.
191

191

00:08:48,220  -->  00:08:50,330
Now on some operating systems you may get
192

192

00:08:50,330  -->  00:08:53,020
something weird happen here, sometimes you might find
193

193

00:08:53,020  -->  00:08:56,720
that the Revert button doesn't get enabled
194

194

00:08:56,720  -->  00:08:58,260
and what you may have to do is click on
195

195

00:08:58,260  -->  00:09:01,030
this little circular arrow thing here
196

196

00:09:01,030  -->  00:09:03,280
to actually refresh the table and then you'll find
197

197

00:09:03,280  -->  00:09:05,010
that you'll be able to use the revert button.
198

198

00:09:05,010  -->  00:09:07,410
But as you see it didn't occur on my Mac,
199

199

00:09:07,410  -->  00:09:10,630
but it may occur on Windows or Linux sometimes,
200

200

00:09:10,630  -->  00:09:14,990
I believe it's possibly a bug with IntelliJ.
201

201

00:09:14,990  -->  00:09:18,890
Right so, at this point now, we've actually got an account
202

202

00:09:18,890  -->  00:09:21,940
for each member of my department and that's really
203

203

00:09:21,940  -->  00:09:24,870
the IntelliJ Database Viewer in a nutshell.
204

204

00:09:24,870  -->  00:09:28,560
Now you can actually use this Database Viewer
205

205

00:09:28,560  -->  00:09:30,960
to view a range of different databases
206

206

00:09:30,960  -->  00:09:32,470
and obviously you can't drag things like
207

207

00:09:32,470  -->  00:09:34,750
Microsoft SQL Server databases into the window
208

208

00:09:34,750  -->  00:09:37,110
to configure it, so if that's the case
209

209

00:09:37,110  -->  00:09:38,740
and you want to do that, you come up here
210

210

00:09:38,740  -->  00:09:42,070
and you click on plus, the top left of the Database window
211

211

00:09:42,070  -->  00:09:43,990
and you choose the Data Source that you want,
212

212

00:09:43,990  -->  00:09:46,390
Data Source, you can see there's quite a few there,
213

213

00:09:46,390  -->  00:09:48,200
and you select the appropriate database type
214

214

00:09:48,200  -->  00:09:50,050
from the listing, configure your connexion.
215

215

00:09:50,050  -->  00:09:54,480
So for example you if I choose SQL Server (Microsoft)
216

216

00:09:54,480  -->  00:09:56,830
we have the usual configuration options for
217

217

00:09:56,830  -->  00:09:59,360
connecting to a SQL server database.
218

218

00:09:59,360  -->  00:10:01,400
Now if you've never used SQL server, don't worry about it,
219

219

00:10:01,400  -->  00:10:03,470
I'm just showing you what's possible,
220

220

00:10:03,470  -->  00:10:06,680
if you do need to connect to a SQL Server or Oracle
221

221

00:10:06,680  -->  00:10:09,400
or DB2 or whatever, the database admins will
222

222

00:10:09,400  -->  00:10:12,120
give you the details to enter into this form anyway.
223

223

00:10:12,120  -->  00:10:15,460
All right, so I'm gonna Cancel this.
224

224

00:10:15,460  -->  00:10:17,080
All right, so there's one more thing that I wanna cover
225

225

00:10:17,080  -->  00:10:20,170
before we move on, now we're going to be looking at
226

226

00:10:20,170  -->  00:10:23,260
committing and rolling back database transactions.
227

227

00:10:23,260  -->  00:10:26,320
But we've also got a table called transactions
228

228

00:10:26,320  -->  00:10:29,820
that stores data of financial transactions.
229

229

00:10:29,820  -->  00:10:31,850
Now using the same word for both of these things
230

230

00:10:31,850  -->  00:10:35,020
is going to get confusing very quickly.
231

231

00:10:35,020  -->  00:10:36,520
So what we're going to do is rename
232

232

00:10:36,520  -->  00:10:39,370
our transactions table to history.
233

233

00:10:39,370  -->  00:10:41,310
Now renaming tables and columns is something
234

234

00:10:41,310  -->  00:10:43,270
you may need to do, which is why
235

235

00:10:43,270  -->  00:10:47,270
I've contrived to this excuse to show you how to do it.
236

236

00:10:47,270  -->  00:10:48,690
So firstly, I want to close down
237

237

00:10:48,690  -->  00:10:52,270
this Database Viewer window for accounts
238

238

00:10:52,270  -->  00:10:55,160
to go back to our code and I'm gonna close down
239

239

00:10:55,160  -->  00:10:56,910
the database for now.
240

240

00:11:00,970  -->  00:11:02,930
So the first thing we need to do is to make a change
241

241

00:11:02,930  -->  00:11:05,580
to the code so that we don't go creating
242

242

00:11:05,580  -->  00:11:09,030
a new row for Terry, so we come down here,
243

243

00:11:09,030  -->  00:11:11,120
on line 53, and we're gonna make
244

244

00:11:11,120  -->  00:11:14,530
that Account equals TerryG, instead of Terry,
245

245

00:11:14,530  -->  00:11:17,670
so we avoid any problems with violating
246

246

00:11:17,670  -->  00:11:20,350
the unique constraint and the other thing I wanna do
247

247

00:11:20,350  -->  00:11:22,950
is now retrieve those two entries,
248

248

00:11:22,950  -->  00:11:26,770
actually we'll change that to TerryJ,
249

249

00:11:26,770  -->  00:11:28,760
so we wanna retrieve the two entries that we've created
250

250

00:11:28,760  -->  00:11:32,930
in the Database Viewer, so michael = Account("Michael")
251

251

00:11:38,280  -->  00:11:42,300
and then also terryG, which again we added
252

252

00:11:42,300  -->  00:11:46,470
in the Database Viewer, = Account("TerryG"), all right.
253

253

00:11:49,540  -->  00:11:51,120
So if you run this.
254

254

00:11:53,320  -->  00:11:56,580
You can see we've got, I'll just scroll this up a little bit
255

255

00:11:56,580  -->  00:11:58,130
just to expand this a little bit higher
256

256

00:11:58,130  -->  00:12:01,380
so we can see everything, we can see that all six objects
257

257

00:12:01,380  -->  00:12:04,150
are being populated from the database.
258

258

00:12:04,150  -->  00:12:05,790
So the first one for John and then we've got one
259

259

00:12:05,790  -->  00:12:09,000
for Graham, Eric, Michael and TerryG.
260

260

00:12:09,000  -->  00:12:12,010
And if I just run that again, we can now that I've done that
261

261

00:12:12,010  -->  00:12:15,740
I've got six retrievals here, we've got John, TerryJ,
262

262

00:12:15,740  -->  00:12:19,400
Graham, Eric, Michael and TerryG, so all six now
263

263

00:12:19,400  -->  00:12:21,630
are being populated from the database.
264

264

00:12:21,630  -->  00:12:24,400
And if you recall with the Michael record,
265

265

00:12:24,400  -->  00:12:26,430
we didn't specify an account balance,
266

266

00:12:26,430  -->  00:12:30,300
but you can see here that the balance is showing as five,
267

267

00:12:30,300  -->  00:12:33,020
so that was retrieved from the accounts table.
268

268

00:12:33,020  -->  00:12:35,830
All right, so to modify the transactions table,
269

269

00:12:35,830  -->  00:12:38,220
how do we actually go about making that change?
270

270

00:12:38,220  -->  00:12:39,560
Well, we open the Database window again,
271

271

00:12:39,560  -->  00:12:42,000
I can also click over here to open that.
272

272

00:12:42,000  -->  00:12:45,620
And if we come over here now to the transactions table,
273

273

00:12:45,620  -->  00:12:49,760
I can right click and choose Modify Table,
274

274

00:12:49,760  -->  00:12:52,440
and in the Modify Table dialogue, we can just
275

275

00:12:52,440  -->  00:12:54,200
type the new name for the table,
276

276

00:12:54,200  -->  00:12:56,280
replace the existing name transactions,
277

277

00:12:56,280  -->  00:13:00,300
which I mentioned we're gonna do and change that to history.
278

278

00:13:00,300  -->  00:13:03,070
And notice on the bottom that IntelliJ is helpfully
279

279

00:13:03,070  -->  00:13:05,890
showing the SQL command that it's gonna execute
280

280

00:13:05,890  -->  00:13:09,020
to perform the action, so that's honestly pretty cool.
281

281

00:13:09,020  -->  00:13:10,570
You know, but have in mind though, this doesn't
282

282

00:13:10,570  -->  00:13:12,650
mean that we can now forget all the SQL movement
283

283

00:13:12,650  -->  00:13:14,810
so far in the course though.
284

284

00:13:14,810  -->  00:13:16,760
So I'm gonna Execute the SQL statement,
285

285

00:13:16,760  -->  00:13:19,590
IntelliJ checks at our code, will check to see our code
286

286

00:13:19,590  -->  00:13:22,920
to see if anything in there will also need to change,
287

287

00:13:22,920  -->  00:13:27,150
so I click on Execute, you can see that it's telling us here
288

288

00:13:27,150  -->  00:13:30,240
that we need to make a change, because it's still referring
289

289

00:13:30,240  -->  00:13:33,490
to the transactions table, so keep in mind that IntelliJ
290

290

00:13:33,490  -->  00:13:36,790
doesn't yet take care of changing the code for us
291

291

00:13:36,790  -->  00:13:39,840
until we actually go ahead and click on Do Refactor.
292

292

00:13:39,840  -->  00:13:42,690
So click on Do Refactor and you can see over here
293

293

00:13:42,690  -->  00:13:44,850
obviously history is now the name,
294

294

00:13:44,850  -->  00:13:46,730
so I'm gonna close that off, database.
295

295

00:13:46,730  -->  00:13:48,560
But the other thing that we need to change though
296

296

00:13:48,560  -->  00:13:51,200
is here on line five, noting that it hasn't changed
297

297

00:13:51,200  -->  00:13:53,640
the transactions table there, so we need to change that
298

298

00:13:53,640  -->  00:13:58,410
to history and lastly I'm gonna show you is this is also
299

299

00:13:58,410  -->  00:14:00,890
an option here, when we go to our table
300

300

00:14:00,890  -->  00:14:03,740
in the Database Viewer, we right click that,
301

301

00:14:03,740  -->  00:14:06,870
we can click on Rename, but doesn't do the same check
302

302

00:14:06,870  -->  00:14:10,280
in the source code, so for that reason I think it's better
303

303

00:14:10,280  -->  00:14:11,830
for you to use the Modify Table
304

304

00:14:11,830  -->  00:14:14,220
and that's we used that in this video.
305

305

00:14:14,220  -->  00:14:16,700
All right, and we'll just run this again
306

306

00:14:16,700  -->  00:14:19,070
to make sure it still works.
307

307

00:14:19,070  -->  00:14:20,490
And we still got the same results,
308

308

00:14:20,490  -->  00:14:22,280
we're now using the new table.
309

309

00:14:22,280  -->  00:14:24,710
All right, so let's now remove the confusion
310

310

00:14:24,710  -->  00:14:26,500
around the word transaction, so I'm gonna
311

311

00:14:26,500  -->  00:14:28,900
stop the video here and in the next video,
312

312

00:14:28,900  -->  00:14:31,020
we're gonna continue on with our accounts programme
313

313

00:14:31,020  -->  00:14:32,570
and rolling back transactions.
314

314

00:14:32,570  -->  00:14:34,740
See you in the next video.
