00:00:04.670  -->  00:00:08.290
In this video, we're going to produce the
menu for a juke box

2

00:00:38.120  -->  00:00:46.840
Alright, so let's create a new file.
I'm going to call this one demo.py.

3

00:00:46.840  -->  00:00:49.980
I'm gonna paste the code in.

4

00:00:51.440  -->  00:00:57.540
So I'm going to run this first. Now that 
it's running, I'm gonna come over here,

5

00:00:57.540  -->  00:01:03.440
click on the cog. Then I'm gonna choose 
View Mode, or set View Mode, to Window.

6

00:01:03.440  -->  00:01:05.900
Then what I'm going to do is,
just make this window so it's a little bit

7

00:01:05.900  -->  00:01:09.060
bigger, so you I see more of the
output, but I'm also going to make sure I

8

00:01:09.060  -->  00:01:13.020
leave enough room for the subtitles to
still be displayed at the bottom of the screen.

9

00:01:13.020  -->  00:01:16.080
Alright, so now the program's running, 
we've got a menu showing our albums

10

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:20.200
from our albums list. We can
enter any of the options from 1 to 4,

11

00:01:20.200  -->  00:01:25.820
to select an album. I'm going to choose
option 3, Nightflight. Next, we see the

12

00:01:25.830  -->  00:01:30.149
songs on the album I chose. Once again,
there's 4 options, as you can see.

13

00:01:30.149  -->  00:01:36.600
I'll select Reaper of the Glory, option 3. If
this was a real juke box, the song would

14

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:41.320
now be playing. The main menu's appeared
again, showing the album's, once more.

15

00:01:41.320  -->  00:01:46.920
I'll try option 2 is time, Bad Company, and
this time you can see, we've got 8 tracks

16

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:52.380
to choose from. Seagull's a good one -
option 8 - so I'm going to select that. OK.

17

00:01:52.380  -->  00:01:56.240
So that's what our program's going to
do. It'll present the songs available,

18

00:01:56.240  -->  00:02:01.440
for each album that we select. If you enter
an invalid choice, the program exits.

19

00:02:01.440  -->  00:02:06.280
0 is invalid, and so is any number
greater than the last album or song.

20

00:02:06.280  -->  00:02:10.620
Make sure you only enter whole numbers, though.
Entering text will crash the program.

21

00:02:10.620  -->  00:02:14.700
We look at how to handle that, later in the
course. I'll finish here by entering 7

22

00:02:14.700  -->  00:02:21.200
to quit the program, and in the next video,
we'll start writing the code for this program.

23

00:02:21.200  -->  00:02:24.320
See you in the next video.
