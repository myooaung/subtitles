1

00:00:05,380  -->  00:00:10,840
so what we need to do now is implement the deal_ dealer function now this
2

2

00:00:10,840  -->  00:00:15,690
turns out to be very similar to the deal_player function but because
3

3

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:20,050
the players turn has finished by the
time the dealer gets more cards what we
4

4

00:00:20,050  -->  00:00:24,000
can do here in this function is we can
add a bit of extra code to check to see
5

5

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:28,120
who is actually won the game because of
course the only check we got at the moment
6

6

00:00:28,120  -->  00:00:32,220
is on line 69 to check to see whether
the dealer wins so we need see whether the
7

7

00:00:32,220  -->  00:00:36,130
player wins as well we need more details
in addition to that because the moment
8

8

00:00:36,130  -->  00:00:39,800
we are only really basically checking to
see at the moment if the players busted if the
9

9

00:00:39,800  -->  00:00:44,500
scores greater than 21 could be a situation of
course we're both a dealer and the player got
10

10

00:00:44,500  -->  00:00:48,750
cards less than 21 we need to do
that check as well as well as checking
11

11

00:00:48,750  -->  00:00:55,220
to see whether the dealer is busted so lets make a start so go up here and start
12

12

00:00:55,220  -->  00:00:58,220
typing....
13

13

00:00:58,840  -->  00:01:10,230
...and we need to add the score so dealer.....
14

14

00:01:10,230  -->  00:01:23,410
....and then we
15

15

00:01:23,410  -->  00:01:29,280
want to show that on the screens so.....
16

16

00:01:29,280  -->  00:01:39,870
.....and we now need to do some
checking to see whether it's game over
17

17

00:01:39,870  -->  00:01:49,270
so what we want to do first is get the players score
again so....
18

18

00:01:49,270  -->  00:01:54,310
....so what is the score for the
player currently then would need to do
19

19

00:01:54,310  -->  00:01:59,050
some testing here to see who's won or if anyone has won so.....
20

20

00:01:59,050  -->  00:02:06,240
....
21

21

00:02:07,040  -->  00:02:10,180
....
22

22

00:02:10,180  -->  00:02:17,030
...which may already been set on line 76 but we gonna put it
23

23

00:02:17,030  -->  00:02:23,330
here anyway just in case we need to
put...
24

24

00:02:23,330  -->  00:02:31,790
....so either way the
25

25

00:02:31,790  -->  00:02:38,400
dealer is lost in this situation then the
player won so put.....
26

26

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:47,680
.....
27

27

00:02:47,680  -->  00:02:52,260
...so we already establish
the both the player and the dealer
28

28

00:02:52,260  -->  00:02:56,950
haven't gone busted at this point
because we've done those checks on line 66
29

29

00:02:56,950  -->  00:03:00,530
and 68 so we know that they're both
less than 21 so now we are
30

30

00:03:00,530  -->  00:03:03,850
doing a test to see whether the dealer
score is greater than the player score
31

31

00:03:03,850  -->  00:03:14,340
then we are going to put....
32

32

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:19,730
....can you think what that
last possibility is well the last
33

33

00:03:19,730  -->  00:03:24,090
possibilities is a draw we've done everything else we've done all the tests to see whether both the player and the
34

34

00:03:24,090  -->  00:03:27,870
dealer had gone bust or whether the
players score or the dealer score is
35

35

00:03:27,870  -->  00:03:32,920
greater than 21 or the dealer scorer is less than players score so we have determined that
36

36

00:03:32,920  -->  00:03:42,430
the player can win as well and anything
left to do is going to be a draw so......
37

37

00:03:42,430  -->  00:03:48,570
....because obviously if both score is the same if it gets to this
point that should be our method so it's
38

38

00:03:48,570  -->  00:03:51,800
really quite simple no matter what the
dealers score is if the player went bust
39

39

00:03:51,800  -->  00:03:56,040
and the dealer wins so that's the
first condition tested if the players
40

40

00:03:56,040  -->  00:04:00,120
not bust the player wins if their score
is higher than the dealer or the dealer
41

41

00:04:00,120  -->  00:04:05,960
went bust and obviously we get down
that last else on line 72 any outcome means a draw
42

42

00:04:05,960  -->  00:04:11,750
alright so we should have the basis for a
game here so lets run this and see what it does
43

43

00:04:11,750  -->  00:04:19,290
so let's see whether it actually works
we are gonna put dealer well will actually do the player first the
44

44

00:04:19,290  -->  00:04:22,800
players got an 11 an ace which is
scored 11 which
45

45

00:04:22,800  -->  00:04:27,880
is correct for the first ace dealer its got a 10 and according this the player has won
46

46

00:04:27,880  -->  00:04:35,750
and we continue on player dealer and its still not quite working at this
47

47

00:04:35,750  -->  00:04:39,560
stage but we've got the basis on here its
actually doing some basic calculation
48

48

00:04:39,560  -->  00:04:44,280
but obviously we need we still need to
do a bit of work here because when we first
49

49

00:04:44,280  -->  00:04:54,910
started it and I'll just run it again player dealer we are getting a message immediately that
50

50

00:04:54,910  -->  00:04:59,220
the dealer wins because the score was
greater than the players so its a lil bit
51

51

00:04:59,220  -->  00:05:03,100
disconcerting that because that message shouldn't really
be appearing until the dealer has finished
52

52

00:05:03,100  -->  00:05:08,190
playing or player has gone bust so it's correct it's actually processing this
53

53

00:05:08,190  -->  00:05:11,450
function correctly but we need to
actually put an extra condition in to
54

54

00:05:11,450  -->  00:05:16,360
have the game go as far as it can before it actually
showing who wins so I guess it'd be
55

55

00:05:16,360  -->  00:05:19,760
more accurate to say that deal is
winning so far this point in time click on
56

56

00:05:19,760  -->  00:05:30,760
player again and obviously we got a bit of work here to do still so let's go ahead and continue
57

57

00:05:30,760  -->  00:05:35,040
looking at this so one advantage of
creating functions that perform specific
58

58

00:05:35,040  -->  00:05:39,200
tasks is that they can be used whenever
you need the functionality that they
59

59

00:05:39,200  -->  00:05:43,110
provide and we saw an example of
that with score_hand which we
60

60

00:05:43,110  -->  00:05:46,570
used in a number of places which
is pretty handy that we only written that
61

61

00:05:46,570  -->  00:05:51,200
code once and we are able to call it multiple
times so in the main program we really
62

62

00:05:51,200  -->  00:05:54,700
don't want the dealer to play they turn as their initial cards are dealt we just
63

63

00:05:54,700  -->  00:05:58,950
just want them to deal a card and stored
in their hands so what we gonna do is
64

64

00:05:58,950  -->  00:06:08,030
make a change their go down to the bottom so after
here after the deal_hand we
65

65

00:06:08,030  -->  00:06:10,810
are setting up those entries to be empty
66

66

00:06:10,810  -->  00:06:15,910
where we are starting after that we want to put.....so
67

67

00:06:15,910  -->  00:06:23,690
the player gets the first card automatically and.....
68

68

00:06:23,690  -->  00:06:28,950
....
69

69

00:06:32,060  -->  00:06:36,940
..so what we want to deal player again so we want to deal first basically the player is gonna get two cards which
70

70

00:06:36,940  -->  00:06:40,470
is how blackjack works and the dealer
is going to have one and if we run that
71

71

00:06:40,470  -->  00:06:52,080
again lets see what that looks like so its definitely getting better now we haven't got any initial scores showing up we got the
72

72

00:06:52,080  -->  00:06:56,330
correctly showing the player score to be 13 we got a problem here though the
73

73

00:06:56,330  -->  00:07:01,480
dealer score is showing 0 for some
reason so it could be a bug or something
74

74

00:07:01,480  -->  00:07:04,170
that we've introduced here because the dealer score should be
75

75

00:07:04,170  -->  00:07:08,600
calculated and it should actually initially
be 9 so its getting better but its still not
76

76

00:07:08,600  -->  00:07:12,750
correct yet because the person playing the
game has to click the button for each of
77

77

00:07:12,750  -->  00:07:17,080
the dealers cards and once we clicked it
then incorrectly does the score but it didn't do
78

78

00:07:17,080  -->  00:07:20,700
that initially but we wouldn't
ordinarily want that to happen the
79

79

00:07:20,700  -->  00:07:23,760
computer should really play the part of
the dealer and all the player should do is
80

80

00:07:23,760  -->  00:07:28,030
click their own button for more cards or
click dealer button once they want to stick
81

81

00:07:28,030  -->  00:07:32,360
so the deal_dealer function
that's called when the dealers
82

82

00:07:32,360  -->  00:07:35,760
button is clicked will need to score
the dealer's hand which only has a
83

83

00:07:35,760  -->  00:07:40,170
single card to begin with and then
automatically keep dealing more cards until
84

84

00:07:40,170  -->  00:07:45,360
the dealer score is greater than or equal
to 17 or the dealer goes bust and once
85

85

00:07:45,360  -->  00:07:49,660
that has happen the score are then check and
the results are displayed so let's go back
86

86

00:07:49,660  -->  00:07:59,170
and make a change to the code for that on deal_dealer function so we
87

87

00:07:59,170  -->  00:08:03,480
got the dealer score calculated correctly so
what we gonna do is I'm going to temporarily
88

88

00:08:03,480  -->  00:08:07,070
cut that because we're gonna put that
back on some code in a minute so the dealer
89

89

00:08:07,070  -->  00:08:13,380
score so its calculated at first then
what we want to do is put.....
90

90

00:08:13,380  -->  00:08:17,610
....
91

91

00:08:18,820  -->  00:08:23,820
...so in other
words basically what a dealer score is 0 or less
92

92

00:08:23,820  -->  00:08:28,760
than 17 and remember we establish the
rules that if scores less than seventeen
93

93

00:08:28,760  -->  00:08:33,130
the dealer would
automatically grab another card and that is what
94

94

00:08:33,130  -->  00:08:34,570
we do with that code
95

95

00:08:34,570  -->  00:08:40,280
and then the other thing we need to do is after we've
appended we then calculate the score again so come back
96

96

00:08:40,280  -->  00:08:46,980
down here will copy this bit of code put that in
there and then we actually show the score
97

97

00:08:46,980  -->  00:08:50,220
on the screens so basically what
happened is we got to deal_dealer
98

98

00:08:50,220  -->  00:08:56,090
it should automatically keep dealing
cards for us until it gets to score of
99

99

00:08:56,090  -->  00:08:59,840
17 or higher and obviously it could still bust and
then the rest of the code will be executed
100

100

00:08:59,840  -->  00:09:05,610
on line 67 down and we can establish
whether there's been a win or a loss and
101

101

00:09:05,610  -->  00:09:09,240
the reason on line 61 were actually
calculating the score there is we are
102

102

00:09:09,240  -->  00:09:13,770
dealing with the the score for the card
that's initially dealt when we first
103

103

00:09:13,770  -->  00:09:17,310
start because you saw that when I ran this the previous time the dealer score
104

104

00:09:17,310  -->  00:09:21,240
showing a 0 so that's why we are calculating that score first and then were actually
105

105

00:09:21,240  -->  00:09:25,960
adding the score each time another cards dealt
so looking down the code we've got the
106

106

00:09:25,960  -->  00:09:32,260
code down here so we got deal_player which draws the player card deal_hand
107

107

00:09:32,260  -->  00:09:37,810
.append which actually called the dealer_card function to
108

108

00:09:37,810  -->  00:09:41,780
deal the first card of the dealer and then we deal the card for the player again
109

109

00:09:41,780  -->  00:09:47,260
so what should happen now is that
we'll see two cards for the player and
110

110

00:09:47,260  -->  00:09:52,610
two cards or more for the dealer
depending on what the score was so lets try running
111

111

00:09:52,610  -->  00:09:55,610
then see what happens
112

112

00:09:59,310  -->  00:10:05,720
so now when we click dealer you notice how it went through and automatically selected the extra cards so
113

113

00:10:05,720  -->  00:10:10,400
what basically won the game at that point and we got
no play again button at the moments so we need to
114

114

00:10:10,400  -->  00:10:21,920
stop and start again and run again you can
see the dealer has got 18 compared to 9
115

115

00:10:21,920  -->  00:10:26,610
now its still not really working correctly
because what we really need to do is
116

116

00:10:26,610  -->  00:10:36,840
change this run it again so basically its the
wrong button that I'm actually pressing so we got the score
117

117

00:10:36,840  -->  00:10:41,650
their players got a score of 19 at the
moment so if we want another card we
118

118

00:10:41,650  -->  00:10:47,960
click on player to get another card and obviously we didn't get a bust we got to 21 so the dealer now when we click
119

119

00:10:47,960  -->  00:10:51,080
the dealer button once and it's going right
through and finish the dealer shot and
120

120

00:10:51,080  -->  00:10:53,800
that's really the point I was making the
player wins because we've got to
121

121

00:10:53,800  -->  00:10:56,890
seventeen you remember the score has to be less than 17 otherwise it would keep
122

122

00:10:56,890  -->  00:11:02,650
dealing another card so we got to 17 at that
point we actually won so will try it
123

123

00:11:02,650  -->  00:11:12,460
again ok we got a score of 16 we are gonna click on player
again to get another card and obviously
124

124

00:11:12,460  -->  00:11:16,390
we've gone bust so we gone over 21 so the
dealer has correctly won their so
125

125

00:11:16,390  -->  00:11:18,810
that's good that's also working run it
again
126

126

00:11:18,810  -->  00:11:21,810
just run it a few more times to make sure
it's working correctly
127

127

00:11:22,590  -->  00:11:27,000
we got a score of 14 lets click on trying another
card we get to 20 which is good so let's
128

128

00:11:27,000  -->  00:11:31,390
now click on dealer and see what the
dealer does the dealer got to 25 and the dealer
129

129

00:11:31,390  -->  00:11:33,560
busts so player wins
130

130

00:11:33,560  -->  00:11:37,330
ok try it again and see what I hope we can
get a draw here just to confirm that's
131

131

00:11:37,330  -->  00:11:43,940
working as well so player got a score of 14 player I've busted the dealer wins that's correct
132

132

00:11:47,510  -->  00:11:57,400
ok score of 17 I'm gonna hold on that so click on dealer and
the dealer wins with a score of 21 so I'll
133

133

00:11:57,400  -->  00:12:01,490
try one more time to see whether we can
happen to get a draw but you can see all the other are working
134

134

00:12:01,490  -->  00:12:04,490
now so run that one more time
135

135

00:12:05,540  -->  00:12:09,690
with a bit of luck will get the score being equal so
we got a score 15 I'm gonna stick to that
136

136

00:12:09,690  -->  00:12:13,880
so I'm just going to click on a dealer and
the player wins because the dealer bust so
137

137

00:12:13,880  -->  00:12:17,880
I won't do that but basically the code
should work for the draw we've seen all
138

138

00:12:17,880  -->  00:12:21,810
the other scenarios what seems to be
working correctly which is great so the
139

139

00:12:21,810  -->  00:12:25,630
programs now playing a
reasonable game of blackjack and all the
140

140

00:12:25,630  -->  00:12:29,490
dealing is being taken care of by the
computer so it's a bit annoying having
141

141

00:12:29,490  -->  00:12:33,360
to close the window and run the program
again though for a new game and I think
142

142

00:12:33,360  -->  00:12:36,980
it's about time for challenges so will
talk about that and also talked about
143

143

00:12:36,980  -->  00:12:42,060
will also go through one more time about some
global variables comments that you might find
144

144

00:12:42,060  -->  00:12:45,590
interesting and then work on a challenge
and the challenges is gonna be for
145

145

00:12:45,590  -->  00:12:49,340
you to come up with a new game button start
a new game so we don't have to stop and
146

146

00:12:49,340  -->  00:12:53,710
start the game each time like you've
seen me do so we will look at doing that in the
147

147

00:12:53,710  -->  00:12:54,020
