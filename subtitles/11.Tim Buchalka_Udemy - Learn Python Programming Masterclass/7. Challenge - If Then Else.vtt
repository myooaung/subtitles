1

00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:07.530
Okay, so it's now time for a challenge.
2

2

00:00:07.530  -->  00:00:10.510
From this point forward in the course,
anytime we learn something new,
3

3

00:00:10.510  -->  00:00:12.540
I'm going to issue a challenge.
4

4

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:15.620
I'm going to actually type it on
the screen shortly, and the idea is for
5

5

00:00:15.620  -->  00:00:17.190
you to actually go a way.
6

6

00:00:17.190  -->  00:00:20.120
An attempt to solve this challenge,
and actually write some code.
7

7

00:00:20.120  -->  00:00:21.940
And so,
you pause the video while that happens.
8

8

00:00:21.940  -->  00:00:22.730
And then you write the code.
9

9

00:00:22.730  -->  00:00:25.320
And then, you'll come back, and
actually check the results.
10

10

00:00:25.320  -->  00:00:25.870
So, what I'll do is,
11

11

00:00:25.870  -->  00:00:28.860
I'll actually show you my interpretation
of the challenge, and the solution.
12

12

00:00:28.860  -->  00:00:29.890
[INAUDIBLE] To the challenge.
13

13

00:00:29.890  -->  00:00:32.770
And then, you'll actually look at that,
and compare your challenge to it, and
14

14

00:00:32.770  -->  00:00:36.000
hopefully, you'll learn a lot more about
what you've actually just learned.
15

15

00:00:36.000  -->  00:00:38.170
So, let's go, and get started.
16

16

00:00:38.170  -->  00:00:41.720
And I'm gonna type in our first challenge,
which of course is for the if statement.
17

17

00:00:55.550  -->  00:00:58.850
Okay, so here is your first
challenge in the course.
18

18

00:00:58.850  -->  00:01:01.690
So, the idea is to write
a small program to ask for
19

19

00:01:01.690  -->  00:01:06.290
a name from the keyboard for the user
to type in a name and also an age.
20

20

00:01:06.290  -->  00:01:08.770
When both values have been
entered from a keyboard
21

21

00:01:08.770  -->  00:01:12.270
check if a person it the right
age to go on an 18-30 holiday.
22

22

00:01:12.270  -->  00:01:17.320
And an 18-30 holiday, what that means
is they must be over the age of 18 and
23

23

00:01:17.320  -->  00:01:21.790
under the age of 31, and
if they are, so if they are 18 or
24

24

00:01:21.790  -->  00:01:24.560
over and under 31, welcome to the holiday.
25

25

00:01:24.560  -->  00:01:27.150
Otherwise, print a polite
message refusing them entry.
26

26

00:01:27.150  -->  00:01:27.840
And that was a typo there.
27

27

00:01:27.840  -->  00:01:31.340
Should be otherwise print a polite
message refusing them entry.
28

28

00:01:31.340  -->  00:01:34.530
Alright, so I'll ask you now to pause
the video, and actually go away, and
29

29

00:01:34.530  -->  00:01:36.900
try and come up with the solution to this.
30

30

00:01:36.900  -->  00:01:41.000
And when you're ready, start the video
again, and I'll actually show you how
31

31

00:01:41.000  -->  00:01:44.240
my solution works, and
you can check that against your answer.
32

32

00:01:44.240  -->  00:01:45.240
So, pause the video now.
33

33

00:01:49.560  -->  00:01:50.120
Okay.
34

34

00:01:50.120  -->  00:01:50.650
How did you get on?
35

35

00:01:50.650  -->  00:01:51.450
Did you figure it out?
36

36

00:01:51.450  -->  00:01:53.590
Did you have a good
attempt at the challenge.
37

37

00:01:53.590  -->  00:01:55.530
And hopefully,
you've figured out a solution to it.
38

38

00:01:55.530  -->  00:01:58.960
So, let's now, go ahead and
actually come up with a solution.
39

39

00:01:58.960  -->  00:02:01.060
Now, bearing in mind with all challenges,
40

40

00:02:01.060  -->  00:02:05.250
there's quite often multiple
ways to actually achieve things.
41

41

00:02:05.250  -->  00:02:08.880
And the thing to keep in mind with this
is that just because you haven't typed
42

42

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:10.000
a challenge, or
43

43

00:02:10.000  -->  00:02:14.430
solution that's not identical to mine
doesn't mean that you got it wrong.
44

44

00:02:14.430  -->  00:02:18.120
The end result is whether your program
has achieved the goals set up in
45

45

00:02:18.120  -->  00:02:18.910
the challenge.
46

46

00:02:18.910  -->  00:02:22.990
If it has achieved those goals, then you
know, that you've got a good solution.
47

47

00:02:22.990  -->  00:02:23.700
So, keep that in mind.
48

48

00:02:23.700  -->  00:02:24.700
Let's get started.
49

49

00:02:24.700  -->  00:02:26.040
So, first step.
50

50

00:02:26.040  -->  00:02:27.960
Write a small program to ask for
a name and an age.
51

51

00:02:27.960  -->  00:02:30.500
So we obviously, need to ask for
a name and the age.
52

52

00:02:30.500  -->  00:02:33.920
So, I can type name equals input.
53

53

00:02:37.660  -->  00:02:39.160
Please enter, your name.
54

54

00:02:39.160  -->  00:02:44.500
And then, put age equals
55

55

00:02:44.500  -->  00:02:49.490
int, input, how old are you?
56

56

00:02:49.490  -->  00:02:55.770
And we'll put a placement field in there,
and .format will actually use name.
57

57

00:02:55.770  -->  00:02:56.440
That was optional,
58

58

00:02:56.440  -->  00:03:00.130
you didn't have to actually print the name
out but that won't be bad if we do that.
59

59

00:03:00.130  -->  00:03:03.540
Okay, so the next thing we need to do,
is now we've got the name and the age,
60

60

00:03:03.540  -->  00:03:08.040
it's time to see whether the appropriate
age to go through to this 18-30 holiday,
61

61

00:03:08.040  -->  00:03:11.420
and that's obviously to be over 18 and
under 31.
62

62

00:03:11.420  -->  00:03:14.310
I think I said before that it was 18 or
older.
63

63

00:03:14.310  -->  00:03:17.650
But, I've actually typed it as over 18 and
under 31.
64

64

00:03:17.650  -->  00:03:22.670
So, it's up to you if you want to
actually put greater than or equal to 18.
65

65

00:03:22.670  -->  00:03:24.920
Obviously, the correct
solution will be either.
66

66

00:03:24.920  -->  00:03:25.530
Okay.
67

67

00:03:25.530  -->  00:03:26.360
So, let's just try it.
68

68

00:03:26.360  -->  00:03:29.630
So, what I'm going to do, I'm going
to actually assume that it's an 18-30
69

69

00:03:29.630  -->  00:03:33.960
holiday, so as long as they're within
that range, 18 to 30, they're good to go.
70

70

00:03:33.960  -->  00:03:39.500
So, one option would be to put
if 18 is less than equal to age,
71

71

00:03:39.500  -->  00:03:41.720
which is less than 31.
72

72

00:03:43.090  -->  00:03:43.590
Print.
73

73

00:03:45.480  -->  00:03:49.930
Welcome to club 18-30 holidays.
74

74

00:03:51.410  -->  00:03:54.170
You replace with field (0).format name.
75

75

00:03:56.950  -->  00:04:02.460
Else, print I'm sorry,
76

76

00:04:02.460  -->  00:04:08.660
our holidays are only for
seriously cool people.
77

77

00:04:09.710  -->  00:04:11.730
And so,
we've actually fulfilled the criteria.
78

78

00:04:11.730  -->  00:04:15.250
If they are, we welcome them to the
holiday, if they're in that date range.
79

79

00:04:15.250  -->  00:04:17.480
Otherwise, we put a polite
message refusing them entry.
80

80

00:04:19.000  -->  00:04:20.050
We'll run that challenge.
81

81

00:04:20.050  -->  00:04:21.060
Now, we'll enter our name.
82

82

00:04:21.060  -->  00:04:21.810
I'll put Tim.
83

83

00:04:21.810  -->  00:04:23.710
How old are you Tim?
84

84

00:04:23.710  -->  00:04:25.240
And notice I made a mistake there.
85

85

00:04:25.240  -->  00:04:26.940
I should've actually put a space there.
86

86

00:04:26.940  -->  00:04:29.570
Probably better to put a question mark
because it actually is a question.
87

87

00:04:29.570  -->  00:04:30.650
And then, that space as well.
88

88

00:04:30.650  -->  00:04:31.730
So, we'll try running that again.
89

89

00:04:34.470  -->  00:04:35.740
Tim.
90

90

00:04:35.740  -->  00:04:36.470
How old are you Tim?
91

91

00:04:36.470  -->  00:04:39.120
21.
Welcome to club 1830 Holidays Tim.
92

92

00:04:39.120  -->  00:04:41.360
Alright, so that's so far so good.
93

93

00:04:41.360  -->  00:04:42.740
So, let's actually try another scenario.
94

94

00:04:42.740  -->  00:04:44.020
Tim.
18.
95

95

00:04:44.020  -->  00:04:47.050
Welcome to club 1830 Holidays Tim.
96

96

00:04:47.050  -->  00:04:48.620
Yes, we still fulfilled it.
97

97

00:04:48.620  -->  00:04:51.880
But now if we type Tim again,
or type Thomas.
98

98

00:04:51.880  -->  00:04:53.980
Thomas [INAUDIBLE] something different.
99

99

00:04:53.980  -->  00:04:54.740
17.
100

100

00:04:54.740  -->  00:04:57.940
I'm sorry our holidays are only for
seriously cool people.
101

101

00:04:57.940  -->  00:04:59.420
So obviously, this 17 is working,
102

102

00:04:59.420  -->  00:05:03.600
and if we actually do another
test here we can put Brian 31.
103

103

00:05:03.600  -->  00:05:07.120
I'm sorry our holidays are only for
seriously cool people.
104

104

00:05:07.120  -->  00:05:08.520
So, that's working as well.
105

105

00:05:08.520  -->  00:05:13.150
So, this was one way to actually test,
and obviously, that's just one way, but
106

106

00:05:13.150  -->  00:05:15.720
we could also have done,
if I comment that out,
107

107

00:05:15.720  -->  00:05:21.000
we could quite easily also have
put if age is greater than or
108

108

00:05:21.000  -->  00:05:25.820
equal to 18 and age is less than 31.
109

109

00:05:25.820  -->  00:05:28.110
We could have done that, and
110

110

00:05:28.110  -->  00:05:32.630
if we run that it'll actually
give us the same result.
111

111

00:05:32.630  -->  00:05:37.470
So, if I put 17 in there,
excluded as we should be.
112

112

00:05:37.470  -->  00:05:38.500
Tim.
18.
113

113

00:05:38.500  -->  00:05:40.400
Welcome to Club 1830 Holidays Tim.
114

114

00:05:40.400  -->  00:05:41.870
That's correct.
115

115

00:05:41.870  -->  00:05:48.270
And likewise try 31, we should be
excluded cuz the range was 18 to 30.
116

116

00:05:48.270  -->  00:05:50.450
And the last one, Tim, say 25 or
117

117

00:05:50.450  -->  00:05:54.050
actually put 5 [INAUDIBLE], actually
was going to say I put 5 there, but
118

118

00:05:54.050  -->  00:05:56.570
I actually typed ahead, and
did actually put 25, so that's correct.
119

119

00:05:56.570  -->  00:05:58.850
So, there you go,
that's the first challenge, and again so
120

120

00:05:58.850  -->  00:06:01.730
depending on your answer if you
did it a different way there,
121

121

00:06:01.730  -->  00:06:05.420
you could have used even the or,
as we talked about in this lesson, or
122

122

00:06:05.420  -->  00:06:10.490
in the previous parts of this if statement
lessons, the two previous videos.
123

123

00:06:10.490  -->  00:06:11.410
That would've been correct.
124

124

00:06:11.410  -->  00:06:14.430
The main thing is that you're able to
actually check that they're actually
125

125

00:06:14.430  -->  00:06:15.020
within that range.
126

126

00:06:15.020  -->  00:06:17.370
And if they were in your program,
congratulations.
127

127

00:06:17.370  -->  00:06:18.120
You did well.
128

128

00:06:18.120  -->  00:06:20.260
Okay.
That's it for the if statement, so
129

129

00:06:20.260  -->  00:06:21.860
we've gone through and
learned how to do that.
130

130

00:06:21.860  -->  00:06:23.720
We've also gone through a challenge.
131

131

00:06:23.720  -->  00:06:26.480
In the next video, we're gonna
start looking at for-loops which is
132

132

00:06:26.480  -->  00:06:30.710
a way to actually repeat certain code, or
code blocks a certain amount of times, so
133

133

00:06:30.710  -->  00:06:31.980
I'll see you in that next video.
