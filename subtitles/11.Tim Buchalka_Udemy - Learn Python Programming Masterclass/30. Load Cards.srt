00:00:05,360  -->  00:00:11,020
ok so moving on with our blackjack program I've made a bit of a typo on line 24 it should read
2

2

00:00:11,020  -->  00:00:17,950
embedded frame to hold the card images ok so moving on line 31 we are about
3

3

00:00:17,950  -->  00:00:24,460
to do the player card frame now so we will just
type a comment about that so....
4

4

00:00:24,460  -->  00:00:35,650
.....
5

5

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:45,220
.......
6

6

00:00:46,500  -->  00:00:55,880
......
7

7

00:00:55,880  -->  00:01:02,550
...so hopefully
you're following along with a lot of
8

8

00:01:02,550  -->  00:01:06,090
this TKinter code now because we have
discussed a pretty well all of this in
9

9

00:01:06,090  -->  00:01:10,550
previous videos so I just a bit more of
a complex interface we've created before
10

10

00:01:10,550  -->  00:01:19,330
alright so next is the buttons so lets add a button frame so...
11

11

00:01:19,330  -->  00:01:43,280
.....
12

12

00:01:43,280  -->  00:01:52,680
......
13

13

00:01:52,680  -->  00:02:02,750
....
14

14

00:02:03,580  -->  00:02:10,330
......
15

15

00:02:10,330  -->  00:02:23,480
.....
16

16

00:02:24,730  -->  00:02:35,450
....so that's
the basic code done so the main windows
17

17

00:02:35,450  -->  00:02:39,640
got three widgets the label at the top
to display the result and two frames one
18

18

00:02:39,640  -->  00:02:42,280
below the other and I'll just bring up our
little
19

19

00:02:42,280  -->  00:02:47,620
image again ok so here it is on the
screen again what I'm talking so the moment
20

20

00:02:47,620  -->  00:02:52,220
as I said its got 3 widgets a label at
the top to display the result and it's
21

21

00:02:52,220  -->  00:02:56,580
also got two frames one below the other
the top most of the two frames is gonna
22

22

00:02:56,580  -->  00:03:00,320
contain the cards as you can see on the
screen there and as well as the scores for the
23

23

00:03:00,320  -->  00:03:04,990
dealer and player and the one below that
will hold the buttons as you can see right down the
24

24

00:03:04,990  -->  00:03:10,010
bottom the card frame itself contained
two other frames went one for the dealer
25

25

00:03:10,010  -->  00:03:14,050
and one for the player as well as the
labels to hold the name as well as the score
26

26

00:03:14,050  -->  00:03:18,950
so the card frame contains as I said another
two frames that will hold the cards and by
27

27

00:03:18,950  -->  00:03:22,760
putting the card images into separate
frames starting a new game is easier
28

28

00:03:22,760  -->  00:03:26,890
because we just have to destroy the
entire frame rather than trying to find
29

29

00:03:26,890  -->  00:03:31,780
out each of the card in it and destroy them
separately so this will make more sense
30

30

00:03:31,780  -->  00:03:37,110
when we come to do it so let's move onto
loading the card images so the file names of
31

31

00:03:37,110  -->  00:03:41,160
the individual images are quite well
formed and made up of the card's value
32

32

00:03:41,160  -->  00:03:44,550
when sweep followed by an underscore
so we can have a look at that we can
33

33

00:03:44,550  -->  00:03:47,770
go into here and have a look now
34

34

00:03:47,770  -->  00:03:51,890
so you can see that's the card number and underscore and then the sweep so
35

35

00:03:51,890  -->  00:03:56,000
it means that we can pragmatically load these
in pretty easily so for the cards from
36

36

00:03:56,000  -->  00:03:57,220
1 to 10
37

37

00:03:57,220  -->  00:04:00,570
we can actually load that with a simple
loop to load them all in
38

38

00:04:01,090  -->  00:04:04,110
now the face card images can be
retrieved using a second loop that runs
39

39

00:04:04,110  -->  00:04:08,380
through a list of names these ones down here jack king queen etc
40

40

00:04:08,380  -->  00:04:11,610
and by wrapping all that in
another loop that runs through the list
41

41

00:04:11,610  -->  00:04:16,080
of sweep names all 52 card images can be
loaded and this is something that the
42

42

00:04:16,080  -->  00:04:19,540
program will only have to do once but
I'm still going to create a function to
43

43

00:04:19,540  -->  00:04:23,780
do it by placing this code in its
own function the main program is going to be far
44

44

00:04:23,780  -->  00:04:28,190
less cluttered and more readable as a
result so let's go ahead and do that i'm
45

45

00:04:28,190  -->  00:04:33,310
gonna come up here and start on line 9 and
make bit of a space and put our
46

46

00:04:33,310  -->  00:04:40,140
function in their so we are going to call this load images so.....
47

47

00:04:40,140  -->  00:04:51,760
.....
48

48

00:04:51,760  -->  00:04:57,730
...because these will be ultimately be matching what's the what's
in the file name so....
49

49

00:04:57,730  -->  00:05:09,040
.....
50

50

00:05:15,240  -->  00:05:22,650
and remember earlier I mentioned about to
the TK version 8.6 is needed to use PNG
51

51

00:05:22,650  -->  00:05:31,720
files we're gonna put a test in here so...
52

52

00:05:31,720  -->  00:05:51,650
.....
53

53

00:05:51,650  -->  00:05:52,840
...so now we need to create our first loop so.....
54

54

00:05:52,840  -->  00:06:17,880
.....
55

55

00:06:18,970  -->  00:06:28,930
...remembering our range finishes one number
56

56

00:06:28,930  -->  00:06:38,490
earlier so we starting it at 1 11 and we put....which is the subfolder remembering that
57

57

00:06:38,490  -->  00:06:42,210
we add as sub folder to store the card files in or the came out of the
58

58

00:06:42,210  -->  00:06:46,600
zip file like that and were going to use.....
59

59

00:06:47,380  -->  00:07:20,340
.....
60

60

00:07:20,340  -->  00:07:21,420
......
61

61

00:07:21,420  -->  00:07:26,380
.....so that's going to be
the name that we need but now we need to retrieve it
62

62

00:07:26,380  -->  00:07:37,880
so do....and the name is the name
63

63

00:07:37,880  -->  00:07:44,230
that we've created on line 23 and then
we need to save it so....
64

64

00:07:44,230  -->  00:07:55,540
....and then finished off we've
65

65

00:07:55,540  -->  00:08:05,340
done that first bit of the loop we'll let hat loop finish and
then we do next the face cards......so from
66

66

00:08:05,340  -->  00:08:14,230
their we are going to put.....and you remember face cards on line 12 jack king and queen so we need to
67

67

00:08:14,230  -->  00:08:20,630
also get those so......and the same thing with
68

68

00:08:20,630  -->  00:08:30,350
the replacement field.......
69

69

00:08:30,350  -->  00:08:35,500
.....
70

70

00:08:37,280  -->  00:08:42,350
...so we got the right type off image
depending on the version of tkinter and
71

71

00:08:42,350  -->  00:08:51,980
then the same deal.....
72

72

00:08:51,980  -->  00:08:59,980
......
73

73

00:09:01,410  -->  00:09:04,610
.....
74

74

00:09:04,610  -->  00:09:11,170
..so we've now got our load images function written and
that should now be able to retrieve all
75

75

00:09:11,170  -->  00:09:15,490
those images we need for our game into
memory and just to note their that if you extracted
76

76

00:09:15,490  -->  00:09:19,440
the images to a different folder than what I
did make sure you do change this first
77

77

00:09:19,440  -->  00:09:23,390
part here cards / because that is going to be
looking at the current folder wherever that
78

78

00:09:23,390  -->  00:09:29,770
is for the sub folder called cards and whatever the name of the
file is so make sure you do change that if you
79

79

00:09:29,770  -->  00:09:34,610
put it in somewhere else so you need to
change both their on line 23 and also
80

80

00:09:34,610  -->  00:09:40,360
on line 29 so the card list should after this contain a
list of tuples each tuples storing
81

81

00:09:40,360  -->  00:09:45,500
the value and image each for one of the 52 cards
and the images have been loaded into
82

82

00:09:45,500  -->  00:09:49,960
Tkinter photo image objects which are
fairly basic but do allow images to be
83

83

00:09:49,960  -->  00:09:54,560
displayed easily that's what we need
to do here and what we're going to do is
84

84

00:09:54,560  -->  00:09:58,040
right on the bottom add some code to
just to test that this actually works s
85

85

00:09:58,040  -->  00:10:01,040
lets try doing so add some code so put....
86

86

00:10:02,910  -->  00:10:10,070
......
87

87

00:10:10,070  -->  00:10:18,040
...and will print cards to see what it actually happens and will just add our
88

88

00:10:18,040  -->  00:10:30,130
main loop so....and we got an error here so what have I done their I didn't put a colon their so
89

89

00:10:30,130  -->  00:10:36,050
put a colon and its pretty good and its complaining about 2 lines their so we'll add another line their to humour that so its
90

90

00:10:36,050  -->  00:10:47,610
actually happy and this other error is probably relating to tkinter camel case that probably want an extra space in their as well probably a good idea to fix those while we can you can't fix this
91

91

00:10:47,610  -->  00:10:51,860
first one up because that's got to do with
Python 2 so we'll leave that at that so
92

92

00:10:51,860  -->  00:10:56,060
if we run this now we should be able to get something it won't be very
exciting but we can at least demonstrate
93

93

00:10:56,060  -->  00:11:03,700
that things are actually working and if we tab over to our interface its obviously not working yet
94

94

00:11:03,700  -->  00:11:07,830
because we haven't added the cards
so close it down but we should be able to confirm
95

95

00:11:07,830  -->  00:11:12,500
that we got our various objects in here and
you can see this multiple objects that
96

96

00:11:12,500  -->  00:11:17,000
are the loaded so assuming it has work we'll just have to print out
97

97

00:11:17,000  -->  00:11:20,700
the cards or display them =to
confirm that they've been loaded but it
98

98

00:11:20,700  -->  00:11:26,200
seems to have loaded into the list
which is good so a new deck of cars can
99

99

00:11:26,200  -->  00:11:29,870
be created from the cards list now we imported them then we can shuffle them using
100

100

00:11:29,870  -->  00:11:33,520
the shuffle function from the
random module that we imported remember
101

101

00:11:33,520  -->  00:11:36,770
we did that in the previous video so the
program will also need to store the
102

102

00:11:36,770  -->  00:11:40,560
cards dealt to each player so before we
start creating the functions to make all
103

103

00:11:40,560  -->  00:11:41,520
of this work
104

104

00:11:41,520  -->  00:11:45,900
I'm going to initialize a dealer hand player hand list we might do that and might
105

105

00:11:45,900  -->  00:11:51,430
finish of this video and continue on to the next one so after here we can type.....
106

106

00:11:51,430  -->  00:12:04,920
.....
107

107

00:12:05,640  -->  00:12:15,390
....
108

108

00:12:15,390  -->  00:12:20,490
...its gonna sort of shuffle them in a random order which is
obviously what we want we don't our cards coming
109

109

00:12:20,490  -->  00:12:24,380
out in any sort of order the whole idea
is that we don't know what the next card is coming
110

110

00:12:24,380  -->  00:12:27,380
it's entirely random we want to create the lists to store
111

111

00:12:30,050  -->  00:12:47,770
dealers and players hand so...so just
112

112

00:12:47,770  -->  00:12:53,660
before I finish this video just a couple
of other things to note on line 73 I
113

113

00:12:53,660  -->  00:12:57,800
used the list function to create a
new list from the cards and if I've done
114

114

00:12:57,800  -->  00:13:02,460
something different for example if I hadn't change that code and made this instead
115

115

00:13:02,460  -->  00:13:09,710
commenting that out and make that....which is another way of doing it
116

116

00:13:09,710  -->  00:13:13,670
deck would then be exactly the same list
as cards so that's not necessarily a
117

117

00:13:13,670  -->  00:13:17,220
problem when just shuffling but as the
cards are dealt they may be removed from the
118

118

00:13:17,220  -->  00:13:20,900
list which could cause problems so every
game will then have fewer and fewer cards
119

119

00:13:20,900  -->  00:13:23,950
until their are none left to create new
decks from so we definitely don't want to do it
120

120

00:13:23,950  -->  00:13:28,250
that way we want to create a new
and separate list which is the way we've done on
121

121

00:13:28,250  -->  00:13:32,580
lines 73 so I'm going to finish the
video here now in the next video we're
122

122

00:13:32,580  -->  00:13:37,830
gonna go ahead and write some code to
