1

00:00:04,680  -->  00:00:10,960
In this video we want to download and
install IntelliJ IDEA for a Linux platform.

2

00:00:10,960  -->  00:00:15,420
Specifically, we're going to be
using Ubuntu 18.04.01.

3

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:20,600
The reason for that is the LTS, the long-term
support version of Ubuntu, as of the time

4

00:00:20,610  -->  00:00:24,779
I'm recording this video. Now what I want
to do is firstly show you the two

5

00:00:24,779  -->  00:00:29,130
versions that are available. So I've gone
to jetbrains.com. Now you won't need to

6

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:32,360
do that and that's because the commands
I'm going to be showing you are from the

7

00:00:32,360  -->  00:00:35,720
command line to do the installation. I
just want to show you the two versions.

8

00:00:35,720  -->  00:00:38,880
So I'm going to go into tools here and
click on IntelliJ IDEA.

9

00:00:38,880  -->  00:00:43,580
So that's the Integrated Development Environment, or
editor, we will be using for this course.

10

00:00:43,580  -->  00:00:46,960
I'll just click on Yes to accept that, to
close the cookies declaration.

11

00:00:46,960  -->  00:00:50,820
I'm going to go to Download again, purely just to show
you the various versions. So we've got two

12

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:55,380
versions there. We've got an Ultimate
Edition, which is a paid tool,

13

00:00:55,420  -->  00:00:59,880
and a Community Edition, which is a free one. In
this course the Community Edition will

14

00:00:59,880  -->  00:01:04,110
do everything you need, so there's no
need to pay for IntelliJ unless you're

15

00:01:04,110  -->  00:01:06,960
doing some more professional things. You
can see over here to the left we've got

16

00:01:06,960  -->  00:01:11,490
JavaScript, Java Enterprise Edition,
Spring and so on and so forth, so if you

17

00:01:11,490  -->  00:01:15,390
need that extra functionality in the
future, you can come back and grab the

18

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:19,700
Ultimate Edition. You will need to pay
for that, although there is a free 30-day trial,

19

00:01:19,700  -->  00:01:23,060
but I think the Community Edition
will do everything you need to do.

20

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:25,350
So let's close that page down because I
mentioned we're going to be using the

21

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:27,780
command line for this.

22

00:01:27,780  -->  00:01:30,120
I'm going to open
a terminal window, clicking on

23

00:01:30,120  -->  00:01:33,220
activities. I'm just going to type the
first letter T, brings this up.

24

00:01:33,220  -->  00:01:39,220
I'm gonna click on terminal. Now there's two commands here. If you want to install the Community Edition,

25

00:01:39,220  -->  00:01:42,840
I'll type in the command first.
So it's gonna be sudo space snap space

26

00:01:42,840  -->  00:01:52,980
install space intellij - idea, being
the name of the IDE - community.

27

00:01:52,980  -->  00:01:58,100
Now replace community with ultimate if you
want to install the Ultimate Edition,

28

00:01:58,110  -->  00:02:02,729
the paid version of IntelliJ, remembering
that you'll get a 30 day trial if you

29

00:02:02,729  -->  00:02:05,820
want to do that. In my case I'm going to
install the free and open-source

30

00:02:05,820  -->  00:02:09,119
Community Edition, so I'm going to leave
the word community there, and then I've got

31

00:02:09,120  -->  00:02:18,040
a space - - classic.
Press enter there. I'm going to type in my password.

32

00:02:18,040  -->  00:02:23,600
That's now going to download and then
install the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA,

33

00:02:23,600  -->  00:02:27,420
directly down to, or into, our Linux distro,

34

00:02:27,420  -->  00:02:34,760
so this version of Linux that we're running, which again, was Ubuntu 18.04.1

35

00:02:34,760  -->  00:02:37,900
Okay, you can see the download is
completed. It's now installing,

36

00:02:37,900  -->  00:02:43,140
and you can see, in this case for me, it's installed the 2019.1.3 version,

37

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:48,500
which is, as of the time I'm recording this video, the latest version of the IntelliJ Community Edition.

38

00:02:48,500  -->  00:02:51,180
Alright, so we've actually now,
successfully downloaded and

39

00:02:51,190  -->  00:02:54,460
installed that. What we can do is start,
until startup, we can come back to

40

00:02:54,460  -->  00:02:59,860
activities, and we can just type in IN,
noting that we've now got an IntelliJ

41

00:02:59,860  -->  00:03:05,200
IDEA icon there. We and click on that,
and close down our command window.

42

00:03:05,200  -->  00:03:08,860
Give that a moment to start. We're gonna go through some of the settings now, just to

43

00:03:08,860  -->  00:03:13,060
show you what happens here. So
firstly, when we first kick

44

00:03:13,060  -->  00:03:16,680
on and start IntelliJ IDEA for the first
time, we've got an option to

45

00:03:16,680  -->  00:03:20,160
Import settings from a previous installation.
That would be the top option, Config or

46

00:03:20,170  -->  00:03:23,530
installation folder, and that would be, if
you've got an old version you want to

47

00:03:23,530  -->  00:03:27,240
import the settings. Perhaps
you've configured it in a specific way.

48

00:03:27,240  -->  00:03:30,910
If you want to do that, click on that, and
then navigate to that folder. In my case,

49

00:03:30,910  -->  00:03:37,800
this a brand new installation. I'm going to check,
or leave selected, Do not import settings, and click OK.

50

00:03:37,800  -->  00:03:40,660
Next I'm going to agree to JetBrains Privacy Policy by

51

00:03:40,660  -->  00:03:44,220
checking the checkbox,
and click on Continue.

52

00:03:44,220  -->  00:03:49,160
We've got the option to send anonymous usage statistics to JetBrains.

53

00:03:49,160  -->  00:03:53,400
I'm gonna click on Don't send, but obviously,
you can choose the other option if you prefer.

54

00:03:53,400  -->  00:03:58,420
We've then got a choice of theme. Do we want to use a dark background with Darcula, or light.

55

00:03:58,420  -->  00:04:01,640
I'm going to select light, only because
that's better for video purposes,

56

00:04:01,640  -->  00:04:05,920
but generally I recommend Darcula for
developing, and that's from my normal

57

00:04:05,920  -->  00:04:10,540
development machine. I would, or do certainly use dark background.

58

00:04:10,540  -->  00:04:13,840
Click on Next for default plugins.
I'm not going to change anything there.

59

00:04:13,840  -->  00:04:17,840
You've got the options to disable or
remove some options if you want.

60

00:04:17,840  -->  00:04:21,360
Those things are fine, as is. I don't think we need to change anything there,

61

00:04:21,360  -->  00:04:25,900
noting you can always go back later and make these
changes if you want to. I'm not going to

62

00:04:25,900  -->  00:04:29,800
do anything. I'm going to click on Next,
and I've got the option to install these

63

00:04:29,800  -->  00:04:32,379
three things. We won't be using them in the course,

64

00:04:32,380  -->  00:04:34,940
so therefore I'm not going to
change anything there either.

65

00:04:34,940  -->  00:04:38,720
I'm gonna click on Start using
IntelliJ IDEA,

66

00:04:38,720  -->  00:04:42,720
and you can see that's fired up IntelliJ IDEA.

67

00:04:42,720  -->  00:04:47,780
Alright, so at this point we've now successfully
installed IntelliJ IDEA on our Linux platform.

68

00:04:47,780  -->  00:04:52,080
There is a little bit more configuration we need to do, and there's a separate video in the course for configuring

69

00:04:52,080  -->  00:04:58,600
IntelliJ IDEA, and that video is for all
versions of IntelliJ; for Windows, Mac and Linux.

70

00:04:58,600  -->  00:05:01,930
But the good news is that now that
you've got to this stage and IntelliJ is

71

00:05:01,930  -->  00:05:06,120
booted, the interface is pretty much
identical for all three platforms, so

72

00:05:06,120  -->  00:05:09,780
fast forward now to that video, or go
to that video in the course, and do the

73

00:05:09,780  -->  00:05:13,680
remaining configuration and then we'll
be ready to start programming in this course.

74

00:05:13,680  -->  00:05:16,760
I'll see you in that next video.
