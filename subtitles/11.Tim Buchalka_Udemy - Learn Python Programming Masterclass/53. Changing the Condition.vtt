00:00:04.540  -->  00:00:10.160
So I said that you may have used the
condition, on line 2, instead of while True.

2

00:00:10.160  -->  00:00:16.200
If we do that, we can remove the break on
line 4. The loop will terminate when

3

00:00:16.200  -->  00:00:20.280
the condition becomes false and then
there's no need to break out of it.

4

00:00:20.280  -->  00:00:26.200
So let's have a go at doing that, so I'm going to
select up here, down to, before the choice there,

5

00:00:26.200  -->  00:00:29.890
and delete that.
So I've deleted the True and the if and

6

00:00:29.890  -->  00:00:33.489
we've now got while choice is equal to
zero. So we want to keep looping while

7

00:00:33.489  -->  00:00:36.609
choice doesn't equal zero, so that
condition has to be reversed,

8

00:00:36.609  -->  00:00:45.680
so that's going to be not equal. We can
now remove the break. Let's do that,

9

00:00:45.680  -->  00:00:53.120
then we need to change the elif, that's on line three,
to an if, because of course, there's no if now.

10

00:00:53.120  -->  00:00:57.699
We've deleted that first if, like
so. That's fixed the errors, as you can see.

11

00:00:57.699  -->  00:01:01.120
This code produces the same effect
as the previous version. Don't just take

12

00:01:01.120  -->  00:01:03.850
my word for it, though.Test the program to
make sure that it still works as

13

00:01:03.850  -->  00:01:14.260
expected. I'm going to run that to make
sure one -  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, zero.

14

00:01:14.260  -->  00:01:18.520
As you can see, it's still working as it was before.
So that's two different ways to do the

15

00:01:18.520  -->  00:01:23.080
same thing. So I actually prefer this code,
compared to the previous version that

16

00:01:23.080  -->  00:01:26.770
had while True, because line two is now
clearer about what causes the loop to

17

00:01:26.770  -->  00:01:31.180
terminate. When you see while True, you
have to read further into the code to

18

00:01:31.180  -->  00:01:35.380
work out when the loop will terminate,
and how. Both solutions, though, work fine,

19

00:01:35.380  -->  00:01:38.740
and there's little difference between
them. Alright so that's the end of this

20

00:01:38.740  -->  00:01:42.190
section now. In the next section, we'll
start looking at other sequence types;

21

00:01:42.190  -->  00:01:48.420
namely lists ranges and tuples.
See you in the next section.
