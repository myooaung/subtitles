00:00:04.400  -->  00:00:07.400
Hello and welcome to
The Complete Python Developer Course.
2

2

00:00:07.400  -->  00:00:12.010
My name is Tim Buchalka and this guy is
my co-instructor, Jean Paul Roberts.
3

3

00:00:12.010  -->  00:00:14.840
And we're here to actually help you
become a great Python developer.
4

4

00:00:14.840  -->  00:00:18.150
We're going to do absolutely
everything in our power to do so.
5

5

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:21.030
So please actually watch through to
the end of this video because there's some
6

6

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:23.910
important tips on how to get
the most out of this course.
7

7

00:00:23.910  -->  00:00:27.590
Which ultimately means you can
become a better programmer sooner.
8

8

00:00:27.590  -->  00:00:30.110
And the other thing to keep in mind is,
particularly in this video,
9

9

00:00:30.110  -->  00:00:34.810
I also talk about the fact that there's
set up videos for each operating system.
10

10

00:00:34.810  -->  00:00:36.380
For Windows, for Mac, and for Linux,
11

11

00:00:36.380  -->  00:00:38.830
so you need to make sure that
you go to the relevant area.
12

12

00:00:38.830  -->  00:00:41.050
But again,
it's all explained in this video.
13

13

00:00:41.050  -->  00:00:44.070
So, I'll share over now to the slides and
watch to the end of the video and
14

14

00:00:44.070  -->  00:00:48.610
then we can actually get started coding So
who are the instructors?
15

15

00:00:48.610  -->  00:00:50.490
Well firstly, my name is Tim Buchalka and
16

16

00:00:50.490  -->  00:00:54.770
I've actually been a software
developer for over 30 years.
17

17

00:00:54.770  -->  00:00:57.260
I'm also the creator of the Android and
18

18

00:00:57.260  -->  00:00:61.040
Java courses on Udemy
with 34,000 students.
19

19

00:00:61.040  -->  00:01:05.280
And I've previously worked in software
development for companies like Mitsubishi,
20

20

00:01:05.280  -->  00:01:06.420
Saab and so on.
21

21

00:01:06.420  -->  00:01:11.750
I like to also introduce my co instructor,
Jean Paul Roberts and
22

22

00:01:11.750  -->  00:01:14.920
like myself Jean Paul has been actually
working in the industry for a long time.
23

23

00:01:14.920  -->  00:01:18.240
He's been a software developer
also actually for 30 years or for
24

24

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:22.950
over 30 years, 15 years of that it's
been actually he worked at IBM and
25

25

00:01:22.950  -->  00:01:25.540
in addition three years
teaching at a University.
26

26

00:01:27.330  -->  00:01:28.920
So in this course you learn from the best.
27

27

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:32.300
We're going to combine 60 plus
years of software development and
28

28

00:01:32.300  -->  00:01:33.900
teaching experience.
29

29

00:01:33.900  -->  00:01:35.860
And we know how to help
you succeed with Python.
30

30

00:01:35.860  -->  00:01:42.720
So another thing to keep in mind here is
the course is constantly being updated.
31

31

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:44.900
This is not a static course so.
32

32

00:01:45.980  -->  00:01:48.580
New content is actually
coming out each week.
33

33

00:01:48.580  -->  00:01:51.200
So do keep checking back for new content.
34

34

00:01:51.200  -->  00:01:55.296
That's one of the things that I'm
myself on in previous courses.
35

35

00:01:55.296  -->  00:02:00.650
Some of my courses had been updated
continually for a period of 12 months.
36

36

00:02:00.650  -->  00:02:01.130
And you'll find with this course,
37

37

00:02:01.130  -->  00:02:03.470
we're constantly adding
new content all the time.
38

38

00:02:03.470  -->  00:02:08.230
So do make sure you check back for
that content So
39

39

00:02:08.230  -->  00:02:12.420
I'm going to now just give you a few tips
on how to get the most out of this course.
40

40

00:02:12.420  -->  00:02:14.310
Firstly it is designed
to be done in order.
41

41

00:02:14.310  -->  00:02:17.870
Section by section, and
we do suggest you take the time to
42

42

00:02:17.870  -->  00:02:22.110
type in all the code as you go through,
and also complete the challenges.
43

43

00:02:22.110  -->  00:02:25.070
Now what the challenges are are a
mechanism that's actually built into
44

44

00:02:25.070  -->  00:02:28.290
the course But we set you a challenge and
you actually go in and
45

45

00:02:28.290  -->  00:02:32.910
create the code to solve the challenge and
then you can come back and
46

46

00:02:32.910  -->  00:02:35.710
actually check the solution
with the code on screen.
47

47

00:02:35.710  -->  00:02:38.150
So we actually show you
our solution as well.
48

48

00:02:38.150  -->  00:02:40.650
And by doing that you really will
get the most out of this course.
49

49

00:02:42.520  -->  00:02:45.120
In addition, the other thing to know
is we've actually got sections for
50

50

00:02:45.120  -->  00:02:47.480
Windows, Mac and Linux.
51

51

00:02:48.480  -->  00:02:50.570
So depending on your operating
system after watching this video,
52

52

00:02:50.570  -->  00:02:53.310
you want to go to that relevant
section of the course Which is
53

53

00:02:53.310  -->  00:02:56.480
basically setting up
the tools that you need.
54

54

00:02:56.480  -->  00:03:00.870
So again, Windows, Mac and Linux you go to
the relevant section, setup the tools and
55

55

00:03:00.870  -->  00:03:03.390
then after that you actually
move on to section five.
56

56

00:03:03.390  -->  00:03:06.440
This is where you actually start coding.
57

57

00:03:06.440  -->  00:03:09.970
So do that after you've actually set
up the tools in the relevant section.
58

58

00:03:09.970  -->  00:03:12.170
Section two being for
Windows, section three for
59

59

00:03:12.170  -->  00:03:14.920
Mac, In section four across Linux.
60

60

00:03:17.560  -->  00:03:19.070
If you actually need help at any time,
61

61

00:03:19.070  -->  00:03:22.930
make sure you use the discussions feature
which is part of this course, and
62

62

00:03:22.930  -->  00:03:25.270
one of us will actually get back
to you as soon as possible.
63

63

00:03:25.270  -->  00:03:28.020
There's actually a button you can actually
click, and you actually leave a message.
64

64

00:03:28.020  -->  00:03:31.730
You can leave screen shots,
you can leave And code and so forth and
65

65

00:03:31.730  -->  00:03:33.970
we will get back to and reply there and
66

66

00:03:33.970  -->  00:03:37.110
you'll actually be able to get
an answer to any queries that you have.
67

67

00:03:37.110  -->  00:03:40.710
And the other important thing is that all
the source code we show you, including
68

68

00:03:40.710  -->  00:03:44.815
the challenges is actually available for
download in the course if you need to.
69

69

00:03:44.815  -->  00:03:48.735
So sometimes it's a good idea if you can't
get a particular bit of code working
70

70

00:03:48.735  -->  00:03:52.865
to check our source code which we've
tested and ensured does work and try that,
71

71

00:03:52.865  -->  00:03:54.205
download that, put that on your computer.
72

72

00:03:54.205  -->  00:03:56.132
Install it and run it.
73

73

00:03:56.132  -->  00:03:59.312
And from there you sort of try
figuring out where you actually
74

74

00:03:59.312  -->  00:04:00.432
went wrong with your code.
75

75

00:04:00.432  -->  00:04:01.312
It's actually a great way,
76

76

00:04:01.312  -->  00:04:05.392
a great skill to learn debugging,
which is the concept of actually fixing
77

77

00:04:05.392  -->  00:04:08.432
errors in programs because that will
make you ultimately a better programmer.
78

78

00:04:10.622  -->  00:04:13.712
Lastly, I'd like to finish off by saying,
don't give up.
79

79

00:04:13.712  -->  00:04:17.392
Expect that learning to program
will take time to master, but make
80

80

00:04:17.392  -->  00:04:21.000
sure you do actually go through and do
all the challenges, type in all the code.
81

81

00:04:21.000  -->  00:04:23.100
And if you re watch the videos as well.
82

82

00:04:23.100  -->  00:04:25.560
Sometimes the first time
you watch a video and
83

83

00:04:25.560  -->  00:04:29.430
learn a particular concept it can stand
to be a little bit overwhelming, but
84

84

00:04:29.430  -->  00:04:32.550
if you re-watch the video and re-study it
you'll find things become a lot easier.
85

85

00:04:32.550  -->  00:04:34.810
So keep at it and don't give up, ok so
86

86

00:04:34.810  -->  00:04:37.860
that's the end of the first
introductory video.
87

87

00:04:37.860  -->  00:04:41.240
At this time now, move forward to the
relevant section which again is section
88

88

00:04:41.240  -->  00:04:45.580
two for Windows, section three if
you're on a Mac, and section four
89

89

00:04:45.580  -->  00:04:49.110
if you are on Linux, and after that keep
to section five and we'll start coding.
90

90

00:04:49.110  -->  00:04:49.610
Cheers for now
