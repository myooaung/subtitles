00:00:05,380  -->  00:00:09,510
in the previous video we did our
first part of the challenge and that's
2

2

00:00:09,510  -->  00:00:15,510
where we set up this cave underscore initialize dot py
which ultimately save
3

3

00:00:15,510  -->  00:00:20,140
our locations and vocabulary
dictionaries to convert them to shelves
4

4

00:00:20,140  -->  00:00:25,230
what we wanna do now is we want to change
the code that runs the game the actual
5

5

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:29,490
game itself and make the changes so that
instead of using a dictionary it uses
6

6

00:00:29,490  -->  00:00:33,900
the shelves created we created in this so what I'm going
to do is go back to
7

7

00:00:33,900  -->  00:00:39,380
challenge you see that cave_game.py that is the file name we want to use for the
8

8

00:00:39,380  -->  00:00:47,430
game part of it so we are going to
create that new python and its going to be
9

9

00:00:47,430  -->  00:00:53,580
cave_game.py and what I'm gonna
start with is just a copy this code in line 45
10

10

00:00:53,580  -->  00:01:00,060
from the challenge.py through to the
end and paste that to
11

11

00:01:00,060  -->  00:01:04,650
cave_game.py so that's the basic
game so obviously we got some erros showing
12

12

00:01:04,650  -->  00:01:09,000
at the moment because we haven't got the
locations and the vocabulary set up so we
13

13

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:13,740
need to actually do that we need to come
up here initially on line 1 we need to
14

14

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:21,210
import shelve of course because we are going to use the shelve module.....
15

15

00:01:35,010  -->  00:01:45,630
and the other thing we need
to do while we remember is down here we ill close
16

16

00:01:45,630  -->  00:01:52,480
them so....always have to do that
17

17

00:01:52,480  -->  00:01:59,020
remember, if we are not using with to close things manually which is we have done there
18

18

00:01:59,020  -->  00:02:03,760
the other change we need to make is on line 6
you notice it currently we got loc equals
19

19

00:02:03,760  -->  00:02:07,990
one and that's an integer I want to
change that so its initialize to a
20

20

00:02:07,990  -->  00:02:12,810
string because of course if you recall
in cave_initilaize.py we
21

21

00:02:12,810  -->  00:02:17,600
set it up so we will use strings because
of course shelves need to use strings
22

22

00:02:17,600  -->  00:02:21,540
as keys s so because locations is gonna
be key ultimately that will need to be
23

23

00:02:21,540  -->  00:02:26,850
a string so I'm gonna put single quotes around that
so that is now a string and the other thing we need to do then
24

24

00:02:26,850  -->  00:02:30,510
is on line 12 we're testing to see
whether 0 has been received
25

25

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:35,480
because it's a string we need to do a test
against a string string comparison and
26

26

00:02:35,480  -->  00:02:42,680
that's going to be two single quotes to do that comparison now
27

27

00:02:42,680  -->  00:02:45,600
that should be it so what we'll do is
we'll give this a run just to make sure
28

28

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:53,640
that does work and I'm going to run this
the first time so that, and just check
29

29

00:02:53,640  -->  00:03:03,710
the I called that he correct name......vocabulary that should be correct we will just
30

30

00:03:03,710  -->  00:03:10,480
run it again you can see the problem here was in a line 8
so lets checked that out
31

31

00:03:10,480  -->  00:03:15,880
and we acutally see that so lets close this down so it is having a
problem there with line 8 at which is
32

32

00:03:15,880  -->  00:03:19,620
available exits and the
problem is if we run it again to check, it is
33

33

00:03:19,620  -->  00:03:25,120
having a problem with the keys
themselves so let's go back to cave_initialize
34

34

00:03:25,120  -->  00:03:29,980
just to make sure that I
haven't messed up something and that seems
35

35

00:03:29,980  -->  00:03:35,050
that I've made that error again the one I made about
three or four times or more in this
36

36

00:03:35,050  -->  00:03:40,180
course is of course when I ran the
initialize hadn't been set up the first
37

37

00:03:40,180  -->  00:03:43,460
time and I can see that it hasn't been set
up so consequently the error we are getting
38

38

00:03:43,460  -->  00:03:49,390
here when we run these cave_game I'm running
now is basically saying well those files
39

39

00:03:49,390  -->  00:03:52,890
don't exists and the reason they don't
exist is of course I didn't run it so
40

40

00:03:52,890  -->  00:03:57,140
what happened was the challenge code
was actually run or actually more likely the
41

41

00:03:57,140  -->  00:04:00,570
example.py was run and I wasn't
really paying attention to the screen
42

42

00:04:00,570  -->  00:04:04,820
which I should have so what we need to
do now is go back to cave_initialize.py
43

43

00:04:04,820  -->  00:04:10,860
that's correct as it is right click
that run cave_initialize that's going to
44

44

00:04:10,860  -->  00:04:16,040
create a our shelves witch I should have
done and then go back to cave_game than
45

45

00:04:16,040  -->  00:04:24,430
any other code changes we should be able to run that as well and now we are not getting an error what a surprised Tim if you acutally rung the right file it might work
46

46

00:04:24,430  -->  00:04:28,240
and we will do a bit a testing to make sure that
it's working
47

47

00:04:28,240  -->  00:04:34,690
so go north and we're getting an error
there and ok int object has no attribute
48

48

00:04:34,690  -->  00:04:38,650
I think what I've done is I've forgotten to
change something in the cave_initialize
49

49

00:04:38,650  -->  00:04:43,080
so I'll close this down and go
back and have a look and actually what I
50

50

00:04:43,080  -->  00:04:47,310
haven't done which I should have done
you notice we are using a key for the locations it
51

51

00:04:47,310  -->  00:04:53,040
was an integer and I change this correctly to a string but the location
52

52

00:04:53,040  -->  00:04:58,740
is also used in the exits as you can see
in the named exits and I haven't changed
53

53

00:04:58,740  -->  00:05:02,570
the value to a string now the values has to be
string because we gonna be comparing the
54

54

00:05:02,570  -->  00:05:07,150
string value here to the location we entered there so we could convert
55

55

00:05:07,150  -->  00:05:10,700
that to an integer but  probably the
best practices because we are gonna be
56

56

00:05:10,700  -->  00:05:14,340
continually converting it to get the
data right the first time so in that
57

57

00:05:14,340  -->  00:05:18,170
situation I recommend you do is you
changed the data type your going to be using
58

58

00:05:18,170  -->  00:05:21,100
which in this case is gonna be
string so I'm gonna change all of these
59

59

00:05:21,100  -->  00:05:31,040
to strings...and that should fix the problem once we are done with it
60

60

00:05:31,040  -->  00:05:43,990
you can see that IntelliJ tries to be helpful
61

61

00:05:43,990  -->  00:05:49,260
I've put a single quote around before a number that's fine but if I put it after it adds two because it thinks you
62

62

00:05:49,260  -->  00:05:52,620
wanna put some numbers something in the
middle of it so it all a matter of cursor
63

63

00:05:52,620  -->  00:06:01,340
position to get this right
64

64

00:06:01,340  -->  00:06:22,950
....and we should find that it will work after we do this, couple more to do, and that should be that so what we've done is we've
converted
65

65

00:06:22,950  -->  00:06:28,620
hopefully all of them hopefully I didn't miss some strings and actually there is a couple I miss
66

66

00:06:28,620  -->  00:06:41,730
there Tim what are you doing? so now I think we are done, no there is still another one, goodness I'm having a bad day
67

67

00:06:41,730  -->  00:06:46,730
Ok I cannot see any more now so what we're
going to do is rerun this we should recreate
68

68

00:06:46,730  -->  00:06:51,460
the shelve and then when we go back to cave and its going to work
so again just to be clear the reason it
69

69

00:06:51,460  -->  00:06:52,490
wasn't working
70

70

00:06:52,490  -->  00:06:57,770
was we converted the locations two
strings here and then in here we had a
71

71

00:06:57,770  -->  00:07:03,150
location and direction to go to but we
also had the location stores integer so
72

72

00:07:03,150  -->  00:07:06,560
what was happening was there was a
string integer comparison taking place
73

73

00:07:06,560  -->  00:07:12,860
in here so it successfully printed
it out but when we try to do a comparison but we ultimately
74

74

00:07:12,860  -->  00:07:18,050
crash because it was that string and
int comparison that is occurring in game so
75

75

00:07:18,050  -->  00:07:22,140
lets go back to first to cave_initialize right click that and run that to
76

76

00:07:22,140  -->  00:07:31,050
recreate the shelve that's been done so if we go back to cave_game
right click and run that a see if its going to
77

77

00:07:31,050  -->  00:07:43,370
work for us so type north south east west will
try typing north that's good and try typing quit
78

78

00:07:43,370  -->  00:07:44,230
and that is it so
79

79

00:07:44,230  -->  00:07:49,810
albeit with a bit of bother we got to actually the
end and I managed to get this working so
80

80

00:07:49,810  -->  00:07:54,780
that's good so that was our solution the solution
myself and JP came up with so hope you
81

81

00:07:54,780  -->  00:07:58,640
enjoy that and what was quite
interesting I felt was that really there is
82

82

00:07:58,640  -->  00:08:02,900
very few changes required to the actual
game so we swipe out the dictionary
83

83

00:08:02,900  -->  00:08:04,400
that was in the game
84

84

00:08:04,400  -->  00:08:10,980
quite easily by replacing the lines 3 and 4, 34 and 35 and we had to little tests
85

85

00:08:10,980  -->  00:08:14,720
we need to change we need to
change the test on line 12
86

86

00:08:14,720  -->  00:08:19,730
and also change the variable type from
an integer to a string on line 6 and of
87

87

00:08:19,730  -->  00:08:24,140
course the bulk of the changes
were in the data in this format where we
88

88

00:08:24,140  -->  00:08:28,610
actually wrote the correct
dictionaries to shelves so this is
89

89

00:08:28,610  -->  00:08:32,510
what we always recommend you do is get
you data correct so don't write the
90

90

00:08:32,510  -->  00:08:37,870
program to sort of manipulate problems
in the data so in other words what
91

91

00:08:37,870  -->  00:08:41,000
I could have done there was I mention
when I was converting these which
92

92

00:08:41,000  -->  00:08:44,440
should have been two strings by putting
the single quotes around them we could
93

93

00:08:44,440  -->  00:08:47,500
come back to the code here and
started doing a comparison and checking
94

94

00:08:47,500  -->  00:08:51,930
converting integers back to strings and
so forth and doing comparison like that
95

95

00:08:51,930  -->  00:08:56,680
but that would all be sort of coding to
cover up the fact that time we made a
96

96

00:08:56,680  -->  00:09:00,540
mistake with our data by getting the
data correct it means we don't have
97

97

00:09:00,540  -->  00:09:05,710
to do any extra coding in the game and that
applies to a lot of coding in general
98

98

00:09:05,710  -->  00:09:10,370
getting the data correct is a great first step
to being able to with a minimal amount of
99

99

00:09:10,370  -->  00:09:16,680
code go through and manipulate use that data as we did so as it
turns out there's very few lines of code
100

100

00:09:16,680  -->  00:09:21,060
that were needed to get the
game working with shelves so that's it
101

101

00:09:21,060  -->  00:09:25,590
that's the shelve challenge I hope you've
enjoyed that so that's actually also the
102

102

00:09:25,590  -->  00:09:29,890
end of this section so in the next
section we gonna be starting to talk
103

103

00:09:29,890  -->  00:09:34,140
about modules and functions so we look
forward to taking you through that and
104

104

00:09:34,140  -->  00:09:35,470
we'll see you in the next section
