1

00:00:03,980  -->  00:00:09,270
In this video, we're going to download
and install IntelliJ IDEA, which is the

2

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:12,360
editor or IDE, Integrated Development
Environment,

3

00:00:12,360  -->  00:00:16,260
we're going to be using to create
programs in this course. So what we need

4

00:00:16,260  -->  00:00:21,660
to do is start out by going to jetbrains.com, and
Jetbrains is the creator of the

5

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:26,370
IntelliJ IDEA product. So I'll go to
their website. I'm going to come down to

6

00:00:26,370  -->  00:00:31,900
the Tools menu, hover over that. Move on
down to IntelliJ IDEA.

7

00:00:31,900  -->  00:00:39,300
I'm going to click over here to  Yes I agree, just to remove that little pop-up. I'm going to select Download.

8

00:00:39,300  -->  00:00:41,999
Then when we do that there's
two options here; we've got the Ultimate

9

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:46,700
Edition, noting that it's also
available for Mac OS and Linux as well.

10

00:00:46,700  -->  00:00:50,280
So we've got the Ultimate Edition and the
Community Edition. So we can use the

11

00:00:50,280  -->  00:00:53,720
Community Edition in this course and
that's completely free and open source.

12

00:00:53,720  -->  00:00:56,010
There's no cost, and there's never
going to be a cost to use it - it's

13

00:00:56,010  -->  00:00:59,480
completely free. The Ultimate Edition,
out of interest, is available if you're

14

00:00:59,480  -->  00:01:03,120
looking at some extra tools. That's more
for professional developers; things like

15

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:06,660
Java Enterprise Edition and Spring and
so on and so forth. But we're going to be

16

00:01:06,660  -->  00:01:12,080
using the Community Edition so I'm going
to click on over here to download it.

17

00:01:12,080  -->  00:01:15,460
Then I'm gonna select Run, noting that you
may have to save this to a folder

18

00:01:15,460  -->  00:01:21,260
somewhere and double click it, once it's downloaded,
if your browser doesn't allow you to do what I've just done.

19

00:01:21,260  -->  00:01:22,720
So we'll give that a moment to complete now.

20

00:01:22,720  -->  00:01:28,800
I'll just fast-forward this a bit. Alright, you can see we're just about done now

21

00:01:29,960  -->  00:01:33,040
Okay, when this pop-up comes up I'm going
to click on Yes that we're going to

22

00:01:33,040  -->  00:01:36,940
allow this app to make changes. I'm going
to close down the browser at this point

23

00:01:36,940  -->  00:01:40,400
because we've finished with that. We're
going to go through the installation setup.

24

00:01:40,420  -->  00:01:45,660
I'm going to click on Next. I'm going to  click on Next again.

25

00:01:45,680  -->  00:01:51,120
Alright so this little pop-up, you need to specify whether you're a 32-bit or a 64-bit user.

26

00:01:51,120  -->  00:01:55,800
Now nine times out of ten you will select 64-bit, but if you know that your operating

27

00:01:55,840  -->  00:01:59,300
system is 32-bit then that will be the
box you'll check.

28

00:01:59,300  -->  00:02:03,760
You can optionally update the context menu to add an option to Open folders project.

29

00:02:03,760  -->  00:02:07,119
I don't actually use that so I'm going to leave that
unchecked, and I'm going to create these

30

00:02:07,120  -->  00:02:13,230
associations; the dot Java, the dot groovy
and doc Kt which is for Kotlin,

31

00:02:13,230  -->  00:02:17,680
because that's useful if you want to
edit those particular files in this

32

00:02:17,680  -->  00:02:22,000
IntelliJ IDEA product as well. So
generally, I would suggest you just click

33

00:02:22,000  -->  00:02:24,780
those options anyway, even if you don't
think you're going to use them at the moment.

34

00:02:24,780  -->  00:02:30,240
Click on Next, Install, and this is now
installing IntelliJ IDEA.

35

00:02:30,240  -->  00:02:34,940
Once this is completed there's a few little minor installation configurations we need to set

36

00:02:34,940  -->  00:02:37,900
before we end the video.

37

00:02:40,760  -->  00:02:46,100
Alright, just about finished, as we can
see now.

38

00:02:46,100  -->  00:02:50,960
Alright, the next thing I suggest you do is check the Run IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, because there's a

39

00:02:50,960  -->  00:02:53,600
few things we need to set up. Click on
Finish.

40

00:02:53,600  -->  00:02:57,390
Eventually this little pop-up will come
up. We've got the option to select a Config

41

00:02:57,390  -->  00:03:01,770
or installation folder, or Do not import
settings. Do not import settings if this

42

00:03:01,770  -->  00:03:05,280
is the first time you've used IntelliJ
IDEA. Set that. The Configure

43

00:03:05,280  -->  00:03:09,400
installation folder is there if you want
to import settings from a previous installation.

44

00:03:09,400  -->  00:03:11,160
In our case, we're not
going to do that so I'm going to click

45

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:16,620
on OK, after selecting or making sure
that Do not import settings is selected.

46

00:03:16,620  -->  00:03:20,970
We're gonna accept JetBrains Privacy
Policy by clicking the check box and

47

00:03:20,970  -->  00:03:24,900
clicking on Continue.
You've got the options to send JetBrains

48

00:03:24,900  -->  00:03:28,590
usage anonymous statistics. I'm gonna
click on Don't send but you're free

49

00:03:28,590  -->  00:03:33,680
to select and choose to send
those statistics if you wish.

50

00:03:33,680  -->  00:03:36,360
Next we're prompted as to whether we
want a dark background, which is

51

00:03:36,360  -->  00:03:39,840
generally easier on the eyes when you're
programming, or a light background.

52

00:03:39,840  -->  00:03:42,600
Now I'm going to choose light because that
tends to come out better in the videos,

53

00:03:42,600  -->  00:03:47,020
but if you want to choose the darkula
theme, the darker one, then do that,

54

00:03:47,020  -->  00:03:50,640
noting that you can always go back into
settings later and change this.

55

00:03:50,640  -->  00:03:54,060
So I'm gonna click on next. I'm going to leave this
screen alone, noting that the screen will

56

00:03:54,060  -->  00:03:57,780
be different, if you've chosen the
ultimate edition of IntelliJ.

57

00:03:57,780  -->  00:04:02,840
We don't need to make any changes there, we can
just leave everything as it is. Click on Next.

58

00:04:02,840  -->  00:04:05,100
Same deal there, I'm not going to
change anything. You can always come back

59

00:04:05,100  -->  00:04:08,610
and install these things later, if that's
something that you want to do. We won't

60

00:04:08,610  -->  00:04:14,600
be using any of those in the course, and
click on Start using IntelliJ IDEA.

61

00:04:15,020  -->  00:04:18,410
Alright, so at this point we're now
done. We've now successfully installed

62

00:04:18,410  -->  00:04:22,190
IntelliJ IDEA. So now that we've done
that we do have a few minor

63

00:04:22,190  -->  00:04:25,880
configurations that we need to finish
off. Specifically, what we need to do is

64

00:04:25,880  -->  00:04:29,060
configure it for the software
development kit, so that we can start

65

00:04:29,060  -->  00:04:32,900
creating programs in this course, but
we're going to do that in a separate video.

66

00:04:32,900  -->  00:04:35,720
I'll end the video now, and we'll
see you in the next video where we start

67

00:04:35,720  -->  00:04:39,060
making a few other changes to configure
IntelliJ IDEA.

68

00:04:39,060  -->  00:04:42,240
So I'll see you in that next video.
