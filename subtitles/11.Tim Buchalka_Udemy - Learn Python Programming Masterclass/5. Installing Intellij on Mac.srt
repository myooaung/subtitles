00:00:03,980  -->  00:00:06,330
In this video we're gonna go ahead and
2

2

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:09,450
download and install IntelliJ IDEA which
3

3

00:00:09,450  -->  00:00:10,920
is the editor or the integrated
4

4

00:00:10,920  -->  00:00:13,200
development environment or IDE that
5

5

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:14,580
we're going to be using in this course
6

6

00:00:14,580  -->  00:00:17,039
for our path and programs. Now there are
7

7

00:00:17,039  -->  00:00:18,960
other IDEs available for python
8

8

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:20,970
programming and if you're happy with the
9

9

00:00:20,970  -->  00:00:23,789
IDE that you're using that's fine,
10

10

00:00:23,789  -->  00:00:25,289
there's no need to install another one
11

11

00:00:25,289  -->  00:00:27,750
we had to pick one for this course but
12

12

00:00:27,750  -->  00:00:29,609
you can take this course with any IDE
13

13

00:00:29,609  -->  00:00:32,730
that supports Python. In this particular
14

14

00:00:32,730  -->  00:00:35,309
video is for the Mac platform, if you're
15

15

00:00:35,309  -->  00:00:36,719
running on Windows or you're running on
16

16

00:00:36,719  -->  00:00:38,700
Linux, there are separate videos for both
17

17

00:00:38,700  -->  00:00:40,260
those operating systems in this course,
18

18

00:00:40,260  -->  00:00:42,660
so refer to those videos that's
19

19

00:00:42,660  -->  00:00:44,370
appropriate but if you're on a Mac
20

20

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:45,390
you're in the right place,
21

21

00:00:45,390  -->  00:00:47,879
so let's get started. So JetBrains makes
22

22

00:00:47,879  -->  00:00:50,610
two IDEs that are suitable for python
23

23

00:00:50,610  -->  00:00:52,890
programming that's IntelliJ IDEA and
24

24

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:55,969
pycharm, so let's go to JetBrains.com
25

25

00:00:55,969  -->  00:00:58,649
jetbrains being the people who have
26

26

00:00:58,649  -->  00:01:00,960
created these products and have a look
27

27

00:01:00,960  -->  00:01:02,930
at their website,
28

28

00:01:02,930  -->  00:01:05,000
don't forget they want to click on tools
29

29

00:01:05,000  -->  00:01:09,740
and the two products here that will
30

30

00:01:09,740  -->  00:01:11,960
actually work for this course are
31

31

00:01:11,960  -->  00:01:16,580
IntelliJ IDEA as well as PyCharm. Now for
32

32

00:01:16,580  -->  00:01:18,740
Python programming effectively they're
33

33

00:01:18,740  -->  00:01:19,790
identical they're gonna look identical
34

34

00:01:19,790  -->  00:01:22,610
I'm going to be using IntelliJ IDEA
35

35

00:01:22,610  -->  00:01:24,770
and download and install that but if you
36

36

00:01:24,770  -->  00:01:26,720
want to use PyCharm instead everything
37

37

00:01:26,720  -->  00:01:29,060
will look almost exactly the same in the
38

38

00:01:29,060  -->  00:01:31,640
videos. Pycharm got the advantage that
39

39

00:01:31,640  -->  00:01:33,170
you don't have to install a python
40

40

00:01:33,170  -->  00:01:35,420
plugin it's basically a version of
41

41

00:01:35,420  -->  00:01:38,509
IntelliJ IDEA that only does Python the
42

42

00:01:38,509  -->  00:01:40,610
idea of IntelliJ IDEA is that you can
43

43

00:01:40,610  -->  00:01:42,050
install it for a whole range of
44

44

00:01:42,050  -->  00:01:44,570
languages so if you plan to program in
45

45

00:01:44,570  -->  00:01:46,220
other languages and that's an example
46

46

00:01:46,220  -->  00:01:48,229
the Learn Programming Academy has got
47

47

00:01:48,229  -->  00:01:50,360
to Java master class that uses IntelliJ
48

48

00:01:50,360  -->  00:01:53,960
IDEA, in that situation IntelliJ IDEA may
49

49

00:01:53,960  -->  00:01:55,970
be more suitable and for that reason we
50

50

00:01:55,970  -->  00:01:57,590
suggested you actually go ahead and
51

51

00:01:57,590  -->  00:02:00,080
install IntelliJ IDE but hover over
52

52

00:02:00,080  -->  00:02:01,670
whichever one you want to see here and
53

53

00:02:01,670  -->  00:02:04,159
then click on download. Now the IDEs
54

54

00:02:04,159  -->  00:02:06,470
come in two flavors we've got the
55

55

00:02:06,470  -->  00:02:09,289
professional Edition Pycharm we've
56

56

00:02:09,289  -->  00:02:11,270
also got a Community Edition and an
57

57

00:02:11,270  -->  00:02:12,950
IntelliJ IDEA has got an Ultimate
58

58

00:02:12,950  -->  00:02:16,160
Edition in a community edition. Now
59

59

00:02:16,160  -->  00:02:17,930
the ultimate or professional editions
60

60

00:02:17,930  -->  00:02:20,569
they are the paid versions you can use
61

61

00:02:20,569  -->  00:02:22,790
them as an honor trial basis for 30 days
62

62

00:02:22,790  -->  00:02:24,980
but after that you have to purchase a
63

63

00:02:24,980  -->  00:02:27,170
license to continue using them the
64

64

00:02:27,170  -->  00:02:29,000
community editions on the other hand are
65

65

00:02:29,000  -->  00:02:32,239
free for personal use now the community
66

66

00:02:32,239  -->  00:02:35,120
editions have some features missing but
67

67

00:02:35,120  -->  00:02:36,440
generally they're not things you need to
68

68

00:02:36,440  -->  00:02:38,660
worry about while learning part them and
69

69

00:02:38,660  -->  00:02:40,819
there's a feature metrics on the page
70

70

00:02:40,819  -->  00:02:42,110
generally that you can actually have a
71

71

00:02:42,110  -->  00:02:43,910
look and see what the differences are so
72

72

00:02:43,910  -->  00:02:46,280
we go back to tools we go back to
73

73

00:02:46,280  -->  00:02:50,629
IntelliJ IDEA and we can scroll down and
74

74

00:02:50,629  -->  00:02:51,860
have a look here we can actually see
75

75

00:02:51,860  -->  00:02:53,530
down the bottom this feature matrix
76

76

00:02:53,530  -->  00:02:55,580
which gives us a bit of an overview of
77

77

00:02:55,580  -->  00:02:57,260
the different versions and what's
78

78

00:02:57,260  -->  00:02:59,030
included, so you can see that the
79

79

00:02:59,030  -->  00:03:00,860
Community Edition hasn't got all the
80

80

00:03:00,860  -->  00:03:03,940
features that the Ultimate Edition has
81

81

00:03:03,940  -->  00:03:05,900
but again the things that are missing
82

82

00:03:05,900  -->  00:03:07,459
out things that you generally need to
83

83

00:03:07,459  -->  00:03:10,790
worry about while in python, if all of this doesn't
84

84

00:03:10,790  -->  00:03:12,230
mean much at the moment, don't worry too
85

85

00:03:12,230  -->  00:03:13,909
much about it just install a community
86

86

00:03:13,909  -->  00:03:16,100
edition you can always change in more life
87

87

00:03:16,100  -->  00:03:19,070
then, I'm going to select download under
88

88

00:03:19,070  -->  00:03:20,870
the Community Edition download and
89

89

00:03:20,870  -->  00:03:22,910
install that one that should start off
90

90

00:03:22,910  -->  00:03:25,430
automatically in the moment and I'm just
91

91

00:03:25,430  -->  00:03:28,130
going to save that and just while that's
92

92

00:03:28,130  -->  00:03:30,680
downloading, I'm going to mention again
93

93

00:03:30,680  -->  00:03:32,330
that you don't have to install this IDE
94

94

00:03:32,330  -->  00:03:34,190
if you've already got one that
95

95

00:03:34,190  -->  00:03:35,840
you're happy with and that supports
96

96

00:03:35,840  -->  00:03:37,580
Python, you can quite happily use that
97

97

00:03:37,580  -->  00:03:39,590
for this course and because I've created
98

98

00:03:39,590  -->  00:03:41,330
courses for a number of languages I
99

99

00:03:41,330  -->  00:03:43,550
picked an IDE that supports them all in
100

100

00:03:43,550  -->  00:03:46,040
IntelliJ IDEA. Now I'm going to be
101

101

00:03:46,040  -->  00:03:47,840
showing you ways that IntelliJ can help
102

102

00:03:47,840  -->  00:03:50,030
you to find bugs in your code and some
103

103

00:03:50,030  -->  00:03:52,190
other features that modern ideas usually
104

104

00:03:52,190  -->  00:03:54,560
have to make programming easier and
105

105

00:03:54,560  -->  00:03:56,690
other ideas have similar features and
106

106

00:03:56,690  -->  00:03:58,160
once you know that something is possible
107

107

00:03:58,160  -->  00:04:00,410
you can Google how to do the same thing
108

108

00:04:00,410  -->  00:04:02,300
in any other ID that you've chosen or
109

109

00:04:02,300  -->  00:04:04,310
happened to be using, the other thing I
110

110

00:04:04,310  -->  00:04:05,720
want to mention is for the ultimate
111

111

00:04:05,720  -->  00:04:08,450
edition of IntelliJ IDEA, I can also
112

112

00:04:08,450  -->  00:04:11,150
extend the trial period if you wish so
113

113

00:04:11,150  -->  00:04:12,890
if you're considering purchasing it and
114

114

00:04:12,890  -->  00:04:14,810
you'd like more time to evaluate the
115

115

00:04:14,810  -->  00:04:16,940
Ultimate Edition you can check out our
116

116

00:04:16,940  -->  00:04:18,380
later lecture. Now I'll show you how to
117

117

00:04:18,380  -->  00:04:20,660
get a special key that you need to paste
118

118

00:04:20,660  -->  00:04:22,850
into the Ultimate Edition to get the
119

119

00:04:22,850  -->  00:04:25,310
extra 90 days trial so gives you a total
120

120

00:04:25,310  -->  00:04:28,310
of 120 days to try it out if you do want
121

121

00:04:28,310  -->  00:04:30,410
to try those extra features or as I said
122

122

00:04:30,410  -->  00:04:32,330
another alternative is just to use the
123

123

00:04:32,330  -->  00:04:34,220
Community Edition and again that's the
124

124

00:04:34,220  -->  00:04:35,630
one that I'm downloading here in this
125

125

00:04:35,630  -->  00:04:38,270
video. Alright, so I'll just give it a
126

126

00:04:38,270  -->  00:04:39,440
moment to finish now, it's just about
127

127

00:04:39,440  -->  00:04:40,700
finished you can see it downloading in
128

128

00:04:40,700  -->  00:04:42,260
the left hand corner and then we're
129

129

00:04:42,260  -->  00:04:44,840
going to continue on and continue on
130

130

00:04:44,840  -->  00:04:50,810
with the installation. Alright so you
131

131

00:04:50,810  -->  00:04:52,100
can see there that's finished now, so I'm
132

132

00:04:52,100  -->  00:04:55,190
just going to click it to start the dmg
133

133

00:04:55,190  -->  00:04:56,510
file so you just want to double click it
134

134

00:04:56,510  -->  00:04:58,550
depending where you've installed it to
135

135

00:04:58,550  -->  00:05:00,770
to start up and the process like it is
136

136

00:05:00,770  -->  00:05:02,330
for most Mac installations is
137

137

00:05:02,330  -->  00:05:03,920
pretty straightforward we're just going
138

138

00:05:03,920  -->  00:05:05,840
to drag that over into the Applications
139

139

00:05:05,840  -->  00:05:09,140
folder give them a moment to copy C
140

140

00:05:09,140  -->  00:05:15,300
copying in the top right hand corner there.
141

141

00:05:15,300  -->  00:05:17,530
Okay, so that's finished the next thing
142

142

00:05:17,530  -->  00:05:19,110
I'm going to do is just close it down
143

143

00:05:19,110  -->  00:05:23,380
and I'm going to go and run IntelliJ I'm
144

144

00:05:23,380  -->  00:05:24,669
gonna go to my applications
145

145

00:05:24,669  -->  00:05:29,500
I'm gonna run IntelliJ IntelliJ ideas
146

146

00:05:29,500  -->  00:05:33,810
see e which cities for Community Edition
147

147

00:05:33,810  -->  00:05:36,730
and you get this a verification thing
148

148

00:05:36,730  -->  00:05:44,190
popping up I give that a moment to verify
149

149

00:05:44,190  -->  00:05:46,050
okay eventually we get to this point
150

150

00:05:46,050  -->  00:05:48,980
here you click on open
151

151

00:05:48,980  -->  00:05:51,120
so usually yeah once you've done that
152

152

00:05:51,120  -->  00:05:53,070
you'll see this option pop up and it's
153

153

00:05:53,070  -->  00:05:55,020
coming up telling us that we've got the
154

154

00:05:55,020  -->  00:05:57,810
option to import some settings now this
155

155

00:05:57,810  -->  00:05:58,860
would be useful if you're running
156

156

00:05:58,860  -->  00:06:00,900
IntelliJ or you've installed a previous
157

157

00:06:00,900  -->  00:06:03,180
version and you want to retain the
158

158

00:06:03,180  -->  00:06:04,200
settings that you've configured
159

159

00:06:04,200  -->  00:06:06,960
previously in this case it hasn't found
160

160

00:06:06,960  -->  00:06:08,820
any other configurations because I
161

161

00:06:08,820  -->  00:06:10,560
haven't turned toward IntelliJ on this
162

162

00:06:10,560  -->  00:06:12,750
computer before so I'm going to leave
163

163

00:06:12,750  -->  00:06:14,400
the default selected which is doing an
164

164

00:06:14,400  -->  00:06:16,110
import settings and click ok
165

165

00:06:16,110  -->  00:06:17,880
otherwise again if there was a location
166

166

00:06:17,880  -->  00:06:20,070
that you did have the files or
167

167

00:06:20,070  -->  00:06:21,600
installation you could select that
168

168

00:06:21,600  -->  00:06:23,700
installation by using the ellipsis
169

169

00:06:23,700  -->  00:06:25,800
button over here and import those
170

170

00:06:25,800  -->  00:06:27,840
settings, but in my case I'm just going
171

171

00:06:27,840  -->  00:06:29,100
to leave the default option do not
172

172

00:06:29,100  -->  00:06:32,210
import settings and click OK
173

173

00:06:32,210  -->  00:06:35,160
now the other thing that may pop up here
174

174

00:06:35,160  -->  00:06:37,410
is you may get a privacy policy popping
175

175

00:06:37,410  -->  00:06:39,540
up asking you to accept that if that's
176

176

00:06:39,540  -->  00:06:40,980
the case you need to scroll down to the
177

177

00:06:40,980  -->  00:06:42,960
bottom for the accept button to be
178

178

00:06:42,960  -->  00:06:45,600
enabled. Now the screens actually new and
179

179

00:06:45,600  -->  00:06:48,180
I believe it relates to the privacy
180

180

00:06:48,180  -->  00:06:50,550
legislation enforce outside or inside
181

181

00:06:50,550  -->  00:06:52,860
the Europe you know they're one that's
182

182

00:06:52,860  -->  00:06:56,190
taking effect as of the 25th of May 2018
183

183

00:06:56,190  -->  00:06:58,290
it probably won't show up or shouldn't
184

184

00:06:58,290  -->  00:07:00,660
show up if you outside of that but I
185

185

00:07:00,660  -->  00:07:02,010
didn't write that when I was installing
186

186

00:07:02,010  -->  00:07:05,280
the the Linux version of IntelliJ that
187

187

00:07:05,280  -->  00:07:06,630
it did pop up for me even though I'm not
188

188

00:07:06,630  -->  00:07:08,970
in Europe, so if it does pop up bottom
189

189

00:07:08,970  -->  00:07:10,200
line is just scroll down to the bottom
190

190

00:07:10,200  -->  00:07:12,150
and click on accept but don't be too
191

191

00:07:12,150  -->  00:07:13,680
concerned if you don't see the privacy
192

192

00:07:13,680  -->  00:07:15,660
policy so after that we'll see a
193

193

00:07:15,660  -->  00:07:17,220
configuration section and we just need
194

194

00:07:17,220  -->  00:07:19,830
to set some settings and tell IntelliJ
195

195

00:07:19,830  -->  00:07:22,260
which options to use so firstly we've
196

196

00:07:22,260  -->  00:07:24,600
got the screen here for theme you can
197

197

00:07:24,600  -->  00:07:26,130
see you've got a choice of using a dark
198

198

00:07:26,130  -->  00:07:28,020
background or the dark Euler famous I
199

199

00:07:28,020  -->  00:07:30,420
call it or a white background the light
200

200

00:07:30,420  -->  00:07:32,820
theme which is the IntelliJ theme these
201

201

00:07:32,820  -->  00:07:33,960
select each one you want to work is
202

202

00:07:33,960  -->  00:07:35,130
knowing that you can always change it
203

203

00:07:35,130  -->  00:07:36,840
later so what I'm going to do is click
204

204

00:07:36,840  -->  00:07:39,180
on the light theme, click on next to go
205

205

00:07:39,180  -->  00:07:41,750
to the next part of the configuration
206

206

00:07:41,750  -->  00:07:44,430
here we've got an option to define our
207

207

00:07:44,430  -->  00:07:46,320
keys and what I would generally
208

208

00:07:46,320  -->  00:07:47,940
recommend you do is just leave the
209

209

00:07:47,940  -->  00:07:49,980
default option I've never used IDE on
210

210

00:07:49,980  -->  00:07:51,300
the left hand side and leave that as a
211

211

00:07:51,300  -->  00:07:54,290
default option and click on next
212

212

00:07:54,290  -->  00:07:57,930
we've then got an option to create a launcher
213

213

00:07:57,930  -->  00:08:00,180
so that we can open IntelliJ IDEA from
214

214

00:08:00,180  -->  00:08:02,100
the command line but I'm not going to
215

215

00:08:02,100  -->  00:08:04,380
specify or set that up because I
216

216

00:08:04,380  -->  00:08:06,330
generally just like to start GUI and
217

217

00:08:06,330  -->  00:08:07,920
actually select the projects and create
218

218

00:08:07,920  -->  00:08:10,440
them from the GUI so for that reason was
219

219

00:08:10,440  -->  00:08:12,530
kind of skip down and click on next now
220

220

00:08:12,530  -->  00:08:14,820
there's a series of plugins you can see
221

221

00:08:14,820  -->  00:08:16,410
on the screen here you can choose all
222

222

00:08:16,410  -->  00:08:18,090
sorts of things and going up nuts if you
223

223

00:08:18,090  -->  00:08:19,980
wanted to but what I'd do suggest you do
224

224

00:08:19,980  -->  00:08:21,390
at this point is just leave them as is
225

225

00:08:21,390  -->  00:08:23,400
for now and you can always come back
226

226

00:08:23,400  -->  00:08:25,650
later and go into the plugin settings
227

227

00:08:25,650  -->  00:08:27,570
within the configuration if you decide
228

228

00:08:27,570  -->  00:08:29,030
you want to install other plugins later
229

229

00:08:29,030  -->  00:08:31,260
and one other thing to note is if you're
230

230

00:08:31,260  -->  00:08:33,060
running or installing the ultimate
231

231

00:08:33,060  -->  00:08:35,190
edition of IntelliJ IDEA you'll have a
232

232

00:08:35,190  -->  00:08:36,780
lot more options to install plug-ins for
233

233

00:08:36,780  -->  00:08:38,520
that in my case I'm just going to click
234

234

00:08:38,520  -->  00:08:39,900
on next here without changing anything
235

235

00:08:39,900  -->  00:08:42,840
we get to this next screen same deal
236

236

00:08:42,840  -->  00:08:44,700
here we can change or install those
237

237

00:08:44,700  -->  00:08:45,930
things but but we're not going to be
238

238

00:08:45,930  -->  00:08:48,150
using those in this particular course, so
239

239

00:08:48,150  -->  00:08:50,220
I'm going to skip per these as well you
240

240

00:08:50,220  -->  00:08:55,620
can click on start using IntelliJ IDEA
241

241

00:08:55,620  -->  00:08:58,090
okay so you can say that IntelliJ IDEA
242

242

00:08:58,090  -->  00:09:00,340
has now started, we're now successfully
243

243

00:09:00,340  -->  00:09:03,280
installed IntelliJ IDEA what we need to
244

244

00:09:03,280  -->  00:09:06,490
do is install the Python plugin and
245

245

00:09:06,490  -->  00:09:08,110
that's a plugin that's been developed by
246

246

00:09:08,110  -->  00:09:10,060
IntelliJ, so that it supports Python
247

247

00:09:10,060  -->  00:09:13,090
within IntelliJ IDEA and if you decided
248

248

00:09:13,090  -->  00:09:15,190
to install PyCharm instead of IntelliJ
249

249

00:09:15,190  -->  00:09:18,190
IDEA you can skip this step do make sure
250

250

00:09:18,190  -->  00:09:19,840
though that you watch the next video
251

251

00:09:19,840  -->  00:09:21,790
where we configure Python and change
252

252

00:09:21,790  -->  00:09:24,160
some other useful settings but get me
253

253

00:09:24,160  -->  00:09:26,260
back to IntelliJ IDEA the Python plug-in
254

254

00:09:26,260  -->  00:09:28,210
gives IntelliJ IDEA the same
255

255

00:09:28,210  -->  00:09:30,550
capabilities as pycharm for Python
256

256

00:09:30,550  -->  00:09:32,410
programming so to get access to that I'm
257

257

00:09:32,410  -->  00:09:33,280
just going to come over here and click
258

258

00:09:33,280  -->  00:09:38,200
on configure and select plugins and I'm
259

259

00:09:38,200  -->  00:09:41,010
going to come up here and type Python
260

260

00:09:41,010  -->  00:09:42,730
you can see you've only got the one
261

261

00:09:42,730  -->  00:09:44,260
option showing up there but I can come
262

262

00:09:44,260  -->  00:09:45,550
down here click on install JetBrains
263

263

00:09:45,550  -->  00:09:47,560
plugins anyway that gives us three
264

264

00:09:47,560  -->  00:09:48,610
options but I'm going to choose the one
265

265

00:09:48,610  -->  00:09:50,620
down the bottom nobody know that's the
266

266

00:09:50,620  -->  00:09:51,490
one from jetbrains
267

267

00:09:51,490  -->  00:09:54,190
that's the official path and plug-in and
268

268

00:09:54,190  -->  00:09:57,370
then click on install so you can see
269

269

00:09:57,370  -->  00:10:00,790
that's downloading a plug-in give that a
270

270

00:10:00,790  -->  00:10:04,030
moment you'll notice this button down
271

271

00:10:04,030  -->  00:10:05,980
here changed and still got the option to
272

272

00:10:05,980  -->  00:10:08,380
restart IntelliJ IDEA whenever you
273

273

00:10:08,380  -->  00:10:10,810
install a plug-in IntelliJ IDEA wants
274

274

00:10:10,810  -->  00:10:12,490
you to restart the application so I'm
275

275

00:10:12,490  -->  00:10:14,080
going to click on restart then I'm going
276

276

00:10:14,080  -->  00:10:19,030
to click on ok this restart option comes
277

277

00:10:19,030  -->  00:10:20,230
up and I'm going to click on restart
278

278

00:10:20,230  -->  00:10:22,180
which is going to restart and then
279

279

00:10:22,180  -->  00:10:24,400
activate the python plug-in within
280

280

00:10:24,400  -->  00:10:25,930
IntelliJ IDEA we'll just give that a
281

281

00:10:25,930  -->  00:10:31,330
moment to start you can see that
282

282

00:10:31,330  -->  00:10:32,590
sometimes IntelliJ has a bit of
283

283

00:10:32,590  -->  00:10:33,850
difficulty restarting it does
284

284

00:10:33,850  -->  00:10:34,960
occasionally do that I'm just going to
285

285

00:10:34,960  -->  00:10:36,940
close that down again then I'm just
286

286

00:10:36,940  -->  00:10:40,390
going to start IntelliJ again and
287

287

00:10:40,390  -->  00:10:43,420
hopefully it'll restart correctly this time.
288

288

00:10:43,420  -->  00:10:45,460
Okay so I can see it's restarting
289

289

00:10:45,460  -->  00:10:47,050
this time so you may or may not get that
290

290

00:10:47,050  -->  00:10:48,790
a problem when you're actually going
291

291

00:10:48,790  -->  00:10:55,030
through the installation process.
292

292

00:10:55,030  -->  00:10:57,370
Okay, so you see now that IntelliJ IDEA
293

293

00:10:57,370  -->  00:10:59,740
has restarted we've got the Python
294

294

00:10:59,740  -->  00:11:01,510
plug-in installed and so I'm going to
295

295

00:11:01,510  -->  00:11:03,340
stop the video here but in the next one
296

296

00:11:03,340  -->  00:11:04,450
we want to make sure that the Python
297

297

00:11:04,450  -->  00:11:06,160
plug-in is configured correctly but we
298

298

00:11:06,160  -->  00:11:08,290
also want to change some settings just
299

299

00:11:08,290  -->  00:11:10,330
to make it a bit easier to use you know
300

300

00:11:10,330  -->  00:11:11,650
the steps in the next video will be the
301

301

00:11:11,650  -->  00:11:14,770
same for IntelliJ IDEA and pycharm so be
302

302

00:11:14,770  -->  00:11:16,270
sure to watch it even if you installed
303

303

00:11:16,270  -->  00:11:19,000
PyCharm instead of IntelliJ IDEA, so I'll
304

304

00:11:19,000  -->  00:11:21,870
see you in the next video.
