00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:07,170
<v Instructor>In the previous video,</v>
2

2

00:00:07,170  -->  00:00:10,750
we saw an easy way to check the data in our database tables.
3

3

00:00:10,750  -->  00:00:12,090
So now what we're gonna do is change
4

4

00:00:12,090  -->  00:00:15,440
our accounts class to update the balance columns
5

5

00:00:15,440  -->  00:00:17,730
and instal the transaction details,
6

6

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:19,880
which from now on are called history
7

7

00:00:19,880  -->  00:00:21,990
or are called the history.
8

8

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:23,730
So, if we actually run this again,
9

9

00:00:23,730  -->  00:00:26,000
I know we did run it at the end of the last video,
10

10

00:00:26,000  -->  00:00:28,400
but if we run it again and see the balance for John there
11

11

00:00:28,400  -->  00:00:31,070
balance on account John has ten dollars.
12

12

00:00:31,070  -->  00:00:32,810
Well that's not actually correct.
13

13

00:00:32,810  -->  00:00:36,980
And if we go over to our database viewer and check that out,
14

14

00:00:38,850  -->  00:00:41,230
we can see that on the database,
15

15

00:00:41,230  -->  00:00:44,530
we've got John showing a balance of zero.
16

16

00:00:44,530  -->  00:00:46,100
So there's a couple things we need to do here
17

17

00:00:46,100  -->  00:00:48,350
in the deposit and withdrawal methods.
18

18

00:00:48,350  -->  00:00:51,380
What we need to do is create an entry in the history table.
19

19

00:00:51,380  -->  00:00:53,880
And I'll just close this down.
20

20

00:00:56,640  -->  00:00:58,810
So I create an entry in the history table
21

21

00:00:58,810  -->  00:01:01,410
each time a deposit or withdrawal is made.
22

22

00:01:01,410  -->  00:01:03,140
And we need to update the account balance
23

23

00:01:03,140  -->  00:01:05,500
in the accounts table as well.
24

24

00:01:05,500  -->  00:01:09,220
Now, if one of these updates succeeds but the other fails,
25

25

00:01:09,220  -->  00:01:12,200
then our database would be in an inconsistent state.
26

26

00:01:12,200  -->  00:01:14,310
So this is one time when we need to make sure
27

27

00:01:14,310  -->  00:01:16,320
that all updates are performed
28

28

00:01:16,320  -->  00:01:18,690
or roll back all the updates.
29

29

00:01:18,690  -->  00:01:20,160
So I want to start by adding the code
30

30

00:01:20,160  -->  00:01:22,510
to update the two database tables.
31

31

00:01:22,510  -->  00:01:24,760
And then we're gonna look at how to cause an error
32

32

00:01:24,760  -->  00:01:28,400
so that we can roll back the transaction if necessary.
33

33

00:01:28,400  -->  00:01:31,920
All right, so let's start with the deposit method.
34

34

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:35,020
And what we're going to do is remove this line here.
35

35

00:01:35,020  -->  00:01:35,960
We'll comment it out.
36

36

00:01:35,960  -->  00:01:36,790
Or actually we'll delete it,
37

37

00:01:36,790  -->  00:01:39,950
because we're gonna replace it anyway.
38

38

00:01:39,950  -->  00:01:43,700
And we're going to do: new underscore balance
39

39

00:01:44,570  -->  00:01:47,820
is equal to self dot underscore balance
40

40

00:01:49,450  -->  00:01:50,450
plus amount.
41

41

00:01:52,770  -->  00:01:53,690
And next, we're gonna do:
42

42

00:01:53,690  -->  00:01:55,610
deposit underscore time
43

43

00:01:57,180  -->  00:01:59,290
is equal to P-Y-T-Z
44

44

00:01:59,290  -->  00:02:00,870
dot U-T-C
45

45

00:02:02,300  -->  00:02:03,300
dot localise
46

46

00:02:05,470  -->  00:02:08,970
And it's gonna be datetime.datetime.utcnow
47

47

00:02:11,710  -->  00:02:13,350
parentheses.
48

48

00:02:13,350  -->  00:02:14,180
And we're getting an error there,
49

49

00:02:14,180  -->  00:02:16,290
but we'll fix that shortly.
50

50

00:02:16,290  -->  00:02:18,460
And next line, db.execute.
51

51

00:02:20,020  -->  00:02:21,930
It's going to be UPDATE
52

52

00:02:24,590  -->  00:02:25,420
accounts
53

53

00:02:26,780  -->  00:02:27,690
SET balance
54

54

00:02:28,900  -->  00:02:30,920
is equal to question mark
55

55

00:02:30,920  -->  00:02:33,600
WHERE space, and then, in parentheses,
56

56

00:02:33,600  -->  00:02:36,190
name is equal to question mark.
57

57

00:02:37,830  -->  00:02:41,320
And then we want to provide new underscore balance.
58

58

00:02:41,320  -->  00:02:43,360
That's the first parameter.
59

59

00:02:43,360  -->  00:02:46,030
And the second one is self.name.
60

60

00:02:47,670  -->  00:02:49,650
Then that's the update for the accounts,
61

61

00:02:49,650  -->  00:02:51,580
but we also need to insert a new transaction
62

62

00:02:51,580  -->  00:02:54,590
into the history table: db.execute.
63

63

00:02:54,590  -->  00:02:57,840
That's going to be INSERT INTO history.
64

64

00:02:59,230  -->  00:03:01,860
VALUES is going to be three,
65

65

00:03:01,860  -->  00:03:04,940
so we need three question marks here.
66

66

00:03:06,300  -->  00:03:07,860
And the three parameters are gonna be
67

67

00:03:07,860  -->  00:03:10,780
deposit underscore time, self.name,
68

68

00:03:12,620  -->  00:03:14,280
and then the amount.
69

69

00:03:16,370  -->  00:03:19,190
And we want a db.commit.
70

70

00:03:19,190  -->  00:03:22,030
Then self dot underscore balance
71

71

00:03:22,030  -->  00:03:25,140
is now equal to new underscore balance.
72

72

00:03:25,140  -->  00:03:29,180
And we can leave the print on line 34 as is.
73

73

00:03:29,180  -->  00:03:31,100
All right, so what have we actually done here?
74

74

00:03:31,100  -->  00:03:33,100
Well, we started by calculating the balance
75

75

00:03:33,100  -->  00:03:35,940
into a variable called new_balance
76

76

00:03:36,870  -->  00:03:39,380
rather than updating the self dot underscore balance
77

77

00:03:39,380  -->  00:03:40,950
attribute directly.
78

78

00:03:40,950  -->  00:03:43,360
And that's because we don't want to update that attribute
79

79

00:03:43,360  -->  00:03:45,840
if the database transaction fails.
80

80

00:03:45,840  -->  00:03:47,770
So next we get the time of the transaction.
81

81

00:03:47,770  -->  00:03:49,830
This is on line 29 here.
82

82

00:03:49,830  -->  00:03:52,340
And this is exactly the same as the code we used
83

83

00:03:52,340  -->  00:03:54,760
when we created a list of financial transactions
84

84

00:03:54,760  -->  00:03:56,230
in the last section.
85

85

00:03:56,230  -->  00:03:58,120
Now, we've got errors here because we need to import
86

86

00:03:58,120  -->  00:04:00,560
the datetime and P-Y-T-Z modules.
87

87

00:04:00,560  -->  00:04:01,690
So let's just go ahead and do that now
88

88

00:04:01,690  -->  00:04:03,610
to remove those errors.
89

89

00:04:05,590  -->  00:04:06,920
Import datetime.
90

90

00:04:08,200  -->  00:04:11,610
And also import P-Y-T-Z.
91

91

00:04:11,610  -->  00:04:14,420
That fixes that error up as you can see.
92

92

00:04:14,420  -->  00:04:18,960
And next on line 32 and 33 as you can see here,
93

93

00:04:18,960  -->  00:04:21,350
we're doing the update to the accounts table.
94

94

00:04:21,350  -->  00:04:23,950
And then we're doing the insert of the new transaction
95

95

00:04:23,950  -->  00:04:26,190
into our history table.
96

96

00:04:26,190  -->  00:04:30,490
And remembering to commit on the next line down here,
97

97

00:04:30,490  -->  00:04:31,930
line 34.
98

98

00:04:31,930  -->  00:04:35,630
And finally we're updating our underscore balance attribute
99

99

00:04:35,630  -->  00:04:38,580
now that the transaction's been completed.
100

100

00:04:38,580  -->  00:04:39,760
All right, so let's just have a look here.
101

101

00:04:39,760  -->  00:04:41,590
We can run this again.
102

102

00:04:43,270  -->  00:04:46,860
And if we have a look at our database,
103

103

00:04:46,860  -->  00:04:48,530
we've now got John showing a balance
104

104

00:04:48,530  -->  00:04:51,030
of 10 dollars 30 currently,
105

105

00:04:51,030  -->  00:04:53,060
bearing in mind that we've updated the deposit method
106

106

00:04:53,060  -->  00:04:54,310
to update the database,
107

107

00:04:54,310  -->  00:04:57,110
but we haven't updated the withdrawal method yet.
108

108

00:04:57,110  -->  00:05:00,140
So we need to actually fix that to get this balance correct.
109

109

00:05:00,140  -->  00:05:02,550
And if we have a look at our history table,
110

110

00:05:02,550  -->  00:05:05,220
you can see that it's now correctly showing.
111

111

00:05:05,220  -->  00:05:06,050
There's a history,
112

112

00:05:06,050  -->  00:05:08,730
there's now a record for each of the three transactions.
113

113

00:05:08,730  -->  00:05:11,700
And obviously there's not one for withdrawing yet.
114

114

00:05:11,700  -->  00:05:14,160
And one thing you can do,
115

115

00:05:14,160  -->  00:05:16,990
you can actually drag these tables
116

116

00:05:18,730  -->  00:05:20,540
and put them somewhere else.
117

117

00:05:20,540  -->  00:05:21,830
And it's a little bit hard for me to do
118

118

00:05:21,830  -->  00:05:23,000
because I'm actually in full screen.
119

119

00:05:23,000  -->  00:05:24,390
So I won't do it now.
120

120

00:05:24,390  -->  00:05:26,300
But with the accounts and history table,
121

121

00:05:26,300  -->  00:05:28,850
we can actually drag those off the tab bar
122

122

00:05:28,850  -->  00:05:31,500
so that you can view the two tables side by side.
123

123

00:05:31,500  -->  00:05:35,150
And remember to refresh the contents of the tables
124

124

00:05:35,150  -->  00:05:36,390
using the circular arrow button.
125

125

00:05:36,390  -->  00:05:37,600
So you can click on that
126

126

00:05:37,600  -->  00:05:39,650
and then just sort of review it at any time.
127

127

00:05:39,650  -->  00:05:41,660
And that's because the view doesn't update automatically.
128

128

00:05:41,660  -->  00:05:43,890
So what I'll do is I'll just leave these here
129

129

00:05:43,890  -->  00:05:45,540
and just quickly go through them,
130

130

00:05:45,540  -->  00:05:47,650
but bearing in mind as we re-run the transactions,
131

131

00:05:47,650  -->  00:05:50,470
make sure you do actually do the refresh.
132

132

00:05:50,470  -->  00:05:51,300
All right, so anyway.
133

133

00:05:51,300  -->  00:05:52,690
Essentially you can see John's balance
134

134

00:05:52,690  -->  00:05:55,270
is $10.30, or 1,030 in integer,
135

135

00:05:57,360  -->  00:05:58,790
as an integer value.
136

136

00:05:58,790  -->  00:06:00,580
And the three transactions are showing correctly
137

137

00:06:00,580  -->  00:06:02,500
in the history table.
138

138

00:06:02,500  -->  00:06:04,450
So that bit's working fine.
139

139

00:06:04,450  -->  00:06:08,090
So the code for the withdrawal method's almost the same.
140

140

00:06:08,090  -->  00:06:10,710
So we're gonna be writing the time to the database again
141

141

00:06:10,710  -->  00:06:14,150
using exactly the same code as in the deposit method
142

142

00:06:14,150  -->  00:06:16,150
to get the current time.
143

143

00:06:16,150  -->  00:06:18,300
So before we actually go ahead and do that,
144

144

00:06:18,300  -->  00:06:19,630
I'm gonna add a modified version
145

145

00:06:19,630  -->  00:06:22,660
of the static current underscore time method
146

146

00:06:22,660  -->  00:06:23,880
that we used in the last section
147

147

00:06:23,880  -->  00:06:26,070
to calculate the correct time.
148

148

00:06:26,070  -->  00:06:28,400
Let me go ahead and do that.
149

149

00:06:32,650  -->  00:06:36,010
So I'm gonna add it in the account class.
150

150

00:06:36,010  -->  00:06:38,680
It's going to be: def underscore
151

151

00:06:40,020  -->  00:06:42,020
current underscore time.
152

152

00:06:42,890  -->  00:06:46,310
And yes, we need that leading underscore.
153

153

00:06:46,310  -->  00:06:48,510
And we're gonna return P-Y-T-Z
154

154

00:06:48,510  -->  00:06:51,170
dot U-T-C dot localise
155

155

00:06:52,700  -->  00:06:54,790
and datetime dot datetime
156

156

00:06:57,110  -->  00:06:58,030
dot utcnow.
157

157

00:07:03,680  -->  00:07:05,030
And I'll just get rid of one of those lines
158

158

00:07:05,030  -->  00:07:08,570
to keep everything kind of hunky dory.
159

159

00:07:08,570  -->  00:07:10,840
And we'll also change this.
160

160

00:07:10,840  -->  00:07:12,220
We can add an annotation there,
161

161

00:07:12,220  -->  00:07:14,200
'cause it says it can be static:
162

162

00:07:14,200  -->  00:07:16,950
@staticmethod to keep that happy.
163

163

00:07:19,270  -->  00:07:21,960
All right, so we'll change now the deposit method
164

164

00:07:21,960  -->  00:07:25,200
to use that function that we've just created.
165

165

00:07:25,200  -->  00:07:28,930
So deposit_time is now going to be equal to,
166

166

00:07:28,930  -->  00:07:30,600
here we're gonna change that to be equal to
167

167

00:07:30,600  -->  00:07:32,430
account dot underscore
168

168

00:07:33,790  -->  00:07:35,790
current underscore time.
169

169

00:07:37,080  -->  00:07:38,880
Okay, so now the withdrawal method.
170

170

00:07:38,880  -->  00:07:40,910
Let's actually get that working.
171

171

00:07:40,910  -->  00:07:41,990
So we're gonna do the same here
172

172

00:07:41,990  -->  00:07:44,530
as we did with the previous method pretty much,
173

173

00:07:44,530  -->  00:07:46,080
with the deposit method.
174

174

00:07:46,080  -->  00:07:48,530
So I'm gonna delete that first line.
175

175

00:07:48,530  -->  00:07:50,180
Delete that.
176

176

00:07:50,180  -->  00:07:51,870
And, in terms of the code,
177

177

00:07:51,870  -->  00:07:56,520
we're gonna start with new_balance is equal to
178

178

00:07:56,520  -->  00:07:59,930
self dot underscore balance minus amount.
179

179

00:08:02,250  -->  00:08:05,170
Then we're gonna do withdrawal_time
180

180

00:08:07,020  -->  00:08:10,940
is equal to account dot underscore current_time
181

181

00:08:12,600  -->  00:08:15,370
to get the current time for our history table.
182

182

00:08:15,370  -->  00:08:17,750
Then we need our two updates.
183

183

00:08:17,750  -->  00:08:18,580
We could have copied this,
184

184

00:08:18,580  -->  00:08:20,460
but I'm just going to type it out again.
185

185

00:08:20,460  -->  00:08:22,710
UPDATE accounts SET balance
186

186

00:08:25,410  -->  00:08:28,660
is equal to question mark WHERE,
187

187

00:08:28,660  -->  00:08:32,330
and name equals question mark in parentheses,
188

188

00:08:32,330  -->  00:08:36,500
and then the two parameters, new_balance and self.name.
189

189

00:08:38,990  -->  00:08:42,070
db.execute is going to be INSERT INTO
190

190

00:08:43,470  -->  00:08:44,300
history
191

191

00:08:46,330  -->  00:08:47,370
VALUES.
192

192

00:08:47,370  -->  00:08:49,400
And we're going to insert the three values
193

193

00:08:49,400  -->  00:08:52,240
like we did in the deposit method.
194

194

00:08:53,230  -->  00:08:54,060
And this time it's gonna be
195

195

00:08:54,060  -->  00:08:57,400
withdrawal underscore time, self.name.
196

196

00:08:57,400  -->  00:08:58,360
And one slight difference here,
197

197

00:08:58,360  -->  00:08:59,760
we're going to negate the amount,
198

198

00:08:59,760  -->  00:09:02,260
so it's gonna be minus amount,
199

199

00:09:03,310  -->  00:09:06,140
db.commit to save the transaction.
200

200

00:09:07,390  -->  00:09:09,520
And then we're going to update our attribute:
201

201

00:09:09,520  -->  00:09:10,770
self dot underscore balance
202

202

00:09:10,770  -->  00:09:13,690
is equal to new underscore balance.
203

203

00:09:15,830  -->  00:09:17,830
Okay, and fix that typo.
204

204

00:09:19,010  -->  00:09:20,640
All right, now before I run this code again,
205

205

00:09:20,640  -->  00:09:23,960
I need to set John's balance in the database back to zero.
206

206

00:09:23,960  -->  00:09:25,820
So let's go ahead and do that.
207

207

00:09:25,820  -->  00:09:28,140
So I'm going to just come into here,
208

208

00:09:28,140  -->  00:09:29,390
make that zero.
209

209

00:09:30,600  -->  00:09:32,900
And remembering to commit the change as well.
210

210

00:09:32,900  -->  00:09:34,020
So I've committed that.
211

211

00:09:34,020  -->  00:09:35,210
And for the history, what we're gonna do
212

212

00:09:35,210  -->  00:09:38,390
is we're just gonna delete those three transactions.
213

213

00:09:38,390  -->  00:09:39,860
We're gonna delete those.
214

214

00:09:39,860  -->  00:09:42,230
And again, I'm gonna make sure those changes are committed.
215

215

00:09:42,230  -->  00:09:44,170
So now we've got nothing in the history,
216

216

00:09:44,170  -->  00:09:46,200
there's nothing in the history record if I refresh that.
217

217

00:09:46,200  -->  00:09:47,330
There's nothing there.
218

218

00:09:47,330  -->  00:09:49,900
And for accounts, just to make sure we do a refresh,
219

219

00:09:49,900  -->  00:09:53,900
you can see that we've got a zero balance for John now.
220

220

00:09:53,900  -->  00:09:55,570
Okay, so in terms of what we've added
221

221

00:09:55,570  -->  00:09:57,630
to the withdraw method,
222

222

00:09:57,630  -->  00:10:00,610
you can see that the two methods were almost identical.
223

223

00:10:00,610  -->  00:10:02,370
And in fact, if we allow negative amounts
224

224

00:10:02,370  -->  00:10:03,400
for the deposit method,
225

225

00:10:03,400  -->  00:10:05,480
then really the only difference between them
226

226

00:10:05,480  -->  00:10:07,730
would be the first condition in each method
227

227

00:10:07,730  -->  00:10:09,540
and the value returned.
228

228

00:10:09,540  -->  00:10:11,810
So it probably makes sense to break the common code
229

229

00:10:11,810  -->  00:10:13,320
out into its own method.
230

230

00:10:13,320  -->  00:10:15,910
So let's go ahead and do that.
231

231

00:10:15,910  -->  00:10:18,830
And I'm gonna just come down here after the balance
232

232

00:10:18,830  -->  00:10:21,690
the show underscore balance method and put it in there.
233

233

00:10:21,690  -->  00:10:25,520
So def underscore save underscore update self,
234

234

00:10:27,660  -->  00:10:30,740
and then it's gonna be amount.
235

235

00:10:30,740  -->  00:10:31,570
Again, we've got an underscore
236

236

00:10:31,570  -->  00:10:33,270
in front of the save underscore update,
237

237

00:10:33,270  -->  00:10:35,610
the start of the method name.
238

238

00:10:35,610  -->  00:10:38,440
And what we're going to do is,
239

239

00:10:38,440  -->  00:10:40,260
I'm just going to copy and paste five lines
240

240

00:10:40,260  -->  00:10:42,190
from the deposit method.
241

241

00:10:42,190  -->  00:10:43,560
And one, two, three, four, five,
242

242

00:10:43,560  -->  00:10:46,670
basically right up to and including,
243

243

00:10:46,670  -->  00:10:48,730
well, it's actually six lines, isn't it?
244

244

00:10:48,730  -->  00:10:50,850
So I'm gonna copy those and paste them directly in here
245

245

00:10:50,850  -->  00:10:53,180
in the save underscore update,
246

246

00:10:53,180  -->  00:10:56,630
making sure that we've also got our last balance as well,
247

247

00:10:56,630  -->  00:10:58,260
self dot underscore balance,
248

248

00:10:58,260  -->  00:10:59,280
our update in the attribute,
249

249

00:10:59,280  -->  00:11:00,420
which we are.
250

250

00:11:00,420  -->  00:11:01,260
So that's fine.
251

251

00:11:01,260  -->  00:11:02,970
So now that we've actually done that,
252

252

00:11:02,970  -->  00:11:04,340
the deposit and withdraw methods
253

253

00:11:04,340  -->  00:11:06,190
can now use this new method
254

254

00:11:06,190  -->  00:11:08,250
with withdraw passing in a negative amount.
255

255

00:11:08,250  -->  00:11:10,790
So, we go back up here now to our deposit method.
256

256

00:11:10,790  -->  00:11:14,810
And what I'm going to do is just comment that out.
257

257

00:11:14,810  -->  00:11:17,280
Then we just need to make a call
258

258

00:11:17,280  -->  00:11:19,210
to the new method.
259

259

00:11:19,210  -->  00:11:22,550
So it's going to be: self dot underscore
260

260

00:11:23,940  -->  00:11:25,580
save underscore update.
261

261

00:11:25,580  -->  00:11:27,420
And it's going to be amount.
262

262

00:11:27,420  -->  00:11:30,010
So we're passing the amount
263

263

00:11:30,010  -->  00:11:33,180
that was passed ultimately to this method.
264

264

00:11:33,180  -->  00:11:34,900
And for the withdraw method,
265

265

00:11:34,900  -->  00:11:37,390
again for now we'll just comment this code out.
266

266

00:11:37,390  -->  00:11:38,890
And I'm leaving this in, the source,
267

267

00:11:38,890  -->  00:11:41,930
so that you've got a copy of the original version
268

268

00:11:41,930  -->  00:11:44,130
just in case you want to play around with it a bit more.
269

269

00:11:44,130  -->  00:11:45,270
But in this case, we're gonna do:
270

270

00:11:45,270  -->  00:11:49,490
self dot underscore save underscore update.
271

271

00:11:49,490  -->  00:11:51,300
But this time it's gonna be minus amount,
272

272

00:11:51,300  -->  00:11:54,780
'cause we're negating that, 'cause it's a withdrawal.
273

273

00:11:54,780  -->  00:11:55,730
But everything else should be correct
274

274

00:11:55,730  -->  00:11:58,690
now that we've actually got that method written.
275

275

00:11:58,690  -->  00:12:01,140
Now, what might I do just to make this a little bit easier,
276

276

00:12:01,140  -->  00:12:02,740
is I want to take a copy of that,
277

277

00:12:02,740  -->  00:12:04,160
paste that there,
278

278

00:12:05,870  -->  00:12:07,280
and we'll put this above the deposit,
279

279

00:12:07,280  -->  00:12:09,030
so put it on line 32.
280

280

00:12:15,570  -->  00:12:16,460
Like so.
281

281

00:12:16,460  -->  00:12:17,300
Just so we can see it,
282

282

00:12:17,300  -->  00:12:18,270
because of course that's being called
283

283

00:12:18,270  -->  00:12:20,490
by these other methods.
284

284

00:12:20,490  -->  00:12:21,940
All right, and again, just one final point is,
285

285

00:12:21,940  -->  00:12:24,390
I've marked it as private with the underscore.
286

286

00:12:24,390  -->  00:12:27,310
This is the same underscore update method
287

287

00:12:27,310  -->  00:12:30,850
to indicate that it shouldn't be used outside this class.
288

288

00:12:30,850  -->  00:12:32,810
And so let's go ahead and run this
289

289

00:12:32,810  -->  00:12:35,150
just to make sure that it works.
290

290

00:12:35,150  -->  00:12:38,270
And we've actually got an error here.
291

291

00:12:38,270  -->  00:12:39,110
We just come up here.
292

292

00:12:39,110  -->  00:12:40,310
It's because I've used self
293

293

00:12:40,310  -->  00:12:43,200
and I've indicated this is a static method,
294

294

00:12:43,200  -->  00:12:45,070
but by making sure that it was a static method
295

295

00:12:45,070  -->  00:12:47,200
of course we haven't got a self anymore.
296

296

00:12:47,200  -->  00:12:49,510
And if I'd got rid of that,
297

297

00:12:49,510  -->  00:12:50,710
that would then be valid again.
298

298

00:12:50,710  -->  00:12:52,880
But in this case, oops,
299

299

00:12:52,880  -->  00:12:55,700
we actually do want that to be set as a static method,
300

300

00:12:55,700  -->  00:12:58,800
so consequently the self shouldn't be there.
301

301

00:12:58,800  -->  00:12:59,780
So okay, we fixed that.
302

302

00:12:59,780  -->  00:13:01,780
So if we run this again,
303

303

00:13:02,870  -->  00:13:05,120
we've now got, the updates have gone through,
304

304

00:13:05,120  -->  00:13:06,350
so you can see there.
305

305

00:13:06,350  -->  00:13:08,090
But more importantly we want to check the values
306

306

00:13:08,090  -->  00:13:09,330
of accounts and history,
307

307

00:13:09,330  -->  00:13:10,940
so note that this again hasn't updated.
308

308

00:13:10,940  -->  00:13:13,760
We need to refresh, reload.
309

309

00:13:13,760  -->  00:13:14,590
And now, correctly,
310

310

00:13:14,590  -->  00:13:17,130
you've got a balance of 1,000 for John now.
311

311

00:13:17,130  -->  00:13:20,780
And if we do a refresh now on the history table,
312

312

00:13:20,780  -->  00:13:22,370
we've now got four transactions.
313

313

00:13:22,370  -->  00:13:24,640
We've got the three that we had previously,
314

314

00:13:24,640  -->  00:13:28,680
but also the $30 transaction's there as well.
315

315

00:13:28,680  -->  00:13:31,040
All right, so that seems to be all working fine,
316

316

00:13:31,040  -->  00:13:32,240
which is great.
317

317

00:13:32,240  -->  00:13:34,230
So let's move on to the next video.
318

318

00:13:34,230  -->  00:13:35,540
And in that one, we're going to start looking
319

319

00:13:35,540  -->  00:13:37,910
at how to retrieve the history data,
320

320

00:13:37,910  -->  00:13:40,310
specifically the time column.
321

321

00:13:40,310  -->  00:13:42,680
So see you in the next video.
