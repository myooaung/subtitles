00:00:05,150  -->  00:00:06,410
<v Instructor>So in the last few videos,</v>
2

2

00:00:06,410  -->  00:00:10,060
we've looked at the *args and **kwargs parameters
3

3

00:00:10,060  -->  00:00:12,480
and how we can pass on arguments that we don't need
4

4

00:00:12,480  -->  00:00:15,010
to handle or in fact don't even know about.
5

5

00:00:15,010  -->  00:00:17,540
So now it's time to create our own listbox class
6

6

00:00:17,540  -->  00:00:19,870
that includes its own scrollbar.
7

7

00:00:19,870  -->  00:00:21,770
Now if we had to start this from scratch,
8

8

00:00:21,770  -->  00:00:24,490
frankly, it would be a mammoth undertaking.
9

9

00:00:24,490  -->  00:00:26,550
We'd have to learn another language to start with,
10

10

00:00:26,550  -->  00:00:28,570
TCL, which is prounounced tickle,
11

11

00:00:28,570  -->  00:00:31,830
which is what the Python TKinter library uses
12

12

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:33,700
to produce all its GUI elements.
13

13

00:00:33,700  -->  00:00:37,180
But fortunately, we already have a working listbox class
14

14

00:00:37,180  -->  00:00:40,360
and we can inherit most of the behaviour from that.
15

15

00:00:40,360  -->  00:00:43,570
So back in jukebox.py, I'm gonna open that up again.
16

16

00:00:43,570  -->  00:00:46,080
We're going to start some work on that.
17

17

00:00:46,080  -->  00:00:48,270
We're gonna create a scrollable listbox class
18

18

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:51,820
and I'm gonna call that, unoriginally, scrollbox.
19

19

00:00:51,820  -->  00:00:53,920
So I'm gonna go start this at the top of the file
20

20

00:00:53,920  -->  00:00:58,490
and it's gonna be after the connect, the SQL connect.
21

21

00:00:58,490  -->  00:01:00,570
And we'll start this on line 10.
22

22

00:01:00,570  -->  00:01:03,990
So we're gonna start with class scrollbox
23

23

00:01:05,280  -->  00:01:07,360
and it's tkinter.listbox.
24

24

00:01:12,070  -->  00:01:13,740
And again, you have to have those two spaces there
25

25

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:16,900
between line seven and the start of the class.
26

26

00:01:16,900  -->  00:01:19,800
And now we wanna define the init method.
27

27

00:01:19,800  -->  00:01:22,510
So we're gonna do a def underscore underscore
28

28

00:01:22,510  -->  00:01:24,900
init underscore underscore, and then we're going
29

29

00:01:24,900  -->  00:01:28,270
to do parentheses, self comes up automatically,
30

30

00:01:28,270  -->  00:01:32,350
comma, space, window, comma, space, and **kwargs.
31

31

00:01:35,930  -->  00:01:38,720
And I'm gonna put a note in here for Python 2 users.
32

32

00:01:38,720  -->  00:01:40,480
So, and I'm gonna comment that out.
33

33

00:01:40,480  -->  00:01:43,890
And that would be tkinter dot listbox dot
34

34

00:01:45,670  -->  00:01:49,660
underscore underscore init underscore underscore self
35

35

00:01:49,660  -->  00:01:52,990
comma space window comma space **kwargs.
36

36

00:01:56,660  -->  00:01:58,660
So the syntax is gonna be slightly different again
37

37

00:01:58,660  -->  00:02:00,500
if you're in Python 2.
38

38

00:02:04,340  -->  00:02:06,490
But in our case, now we're going to,
39

39

00:02:06,490  -->  00:02:09,880
after that definition, to a super parentheses dot
40

40

00:02:09,880  -->  00:02:13,410
underscore underscore init, and then we're going to
41

41

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:17,580
pass as arguments window comma space, then **kwargs.
42

42

00:02:20,740  -->  00:02:23,620
And press enter, then a separate line there.
43

43

00:02:23,620  -->  00:02:27,620
And we're going to do self.scrollbar is equal to
44

44

00:02:30,250  -->  00:02:34,410
tkinter.scrollbar parentheses window comma space orient
45

45

00:02:38,240  -->  00:02:41,150
equals tkinter.VERTICAL comma space
46

46

00:02:43,760  -->  00:02:45,930
command equals self.yview.
47

47

00:02:50,470  -->  00:02:53,220
And it's just a parentheses, there's no method call there.
48

48

00:02:53,220  -->  00:02:54,960
So we're just using the right parentheses
49

49

00:02:54,960  -->  00:02:56,740
to close off the line,
50

50

00:02:56,740  -->  00:02:57,790
So what I've done there, you can see
51

51

00:02:57,790  -->  00:02:58,770
it's pretty straightforward.
52

52

00:02:58,770  -->  00:03:02,190
We started off by overwriting the init method
53

53

00:03:02,190  -->  00:03:04,060
to add a scrollbar field after calling
54

54

00:03:04,060  -->  00:03:05,520
the super.init method.
55

55

00:03:05,520  -->  00:03:07,770
So super and then there's the creation
56

56

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:09,160
of the scrollbar field.
57

57

00:03:09,160  -->  00:03:10,500
And again, the comment of that code
58

58

00:03:10,500  -->  00:03:14,520
is for Python 2 users, that's the way to init a listbox,
59

59

00:03:14,520  -->  00:03:18,010
as that would be done with Python 2's old-style classes.
60

60

00:03:18,010  -->  00:03:19,700
All right, so now that we've done that,
61

61

00:03:19,700  -->  00:03:23,140
we've defined our base class, we need to change
62

62

00:03:23,140  -->  00:03:25,550
our listbox types to scrollbox.
63

63

00:03:25,550  -->  00:03:27,890
So I come down here and we're gonna start
64

64

00:03:27,890  -->  00:03:29,580
with the artist listbox.
65

65

00:03:29,580  -->  00:03:32,240
At the moment, we've got tkinter.listbox.
66

66

00:03:32,240  -->  00:03:36,070
Let's change artistList instead to be equal to
67

67

00:03:38,000  -->  00:03:42,160
scrollbox and we'll pass the argument as mainWindow.
68

68

00:03:43,360  -->  00:03:45,810
Then we need to come down and do the same for albums.
69

69

00:03:45,810  -->  00:03:48,230
And albums we've done here, albumsList here.
70

70

00:03:48,230  -->  00:03:50,940
Instead of tkinter.listbox, we're going to
71

71

00:03:50,940  -->  00:03:53,070
make that scrollbox.
72

72

00:03:53,070  -->  00:03:57,530
Scrollbox and the arguments there is still mainWindow
73

73

00:03:57,530  -->  00:04:01,150
and listvariable equals albumLV, nothing's changed there.
74

74

00:04:01,150  -->  00:04:03,120
And then we also need to come down
75

75

00:04:03,120  -->  00:04:06,230
and do the same for songList.
76

76

00:04:06,230  -->  00:04:09,370
So that's the songList here, tkinter.listbox.
77

77

00:04:09,370  -->  00:04:12,700
We're changing that to be our scrollbox.
78

78

00:04:14,510  -->  00:04:17,510
And the arguments are still mainWindow and listvariable
79

79

00:04:17,510  -->  00:04:19,580
will equal songLV.
80

80

00:04:19,580  -->  00:04:20,990
So if we run this
81

81

00:04:24,590  -->  00:04:27,710
you can see that we've now got our scrollbox objects
82

82

00:04:27,710  -->  00:04:30,690
created instead of basic listboxes.
83

83

00:04:30,690  -->  00:04:32,770
And you can see, in fact, the scrollbar's there now.
84

84

00:04:32,770  -->  00:04:35,020
We can actually use it to scroll up and down.
85

85

00:04:35,020  -->  00:04:37,740
But essentially, the scrollbox doesn't add anything yet.
86

86

00:04:37,740  -->  00:04:41,170
But it is a good idea to test your subclasses frequently
87

87

00:04:41,170  -->  00:04:42,610
when developing them to make sure
88

88

00:04:42,610  -->  00:04:44,570
that the programme runs without any errors.
89

89

00:04:44,570  -->  00:04:46,980
And if it does error out, you'll know exactly
90

90

00:04:46,980  -->  00:04:49,030
where you were before, and it won't take you
91

91

00:04:49,030  -->  00:04:51,370
hopefully that long to figure out what's changed
92

92

00:04:51,370  -->  00:04:53,470
since the last time it was working.
93

93

00:04:53,470  -->  00:04:55,570
But in any event, now that we can replace
94

94

00:04:55,570  -->  00:04:59,350
the TKlist box class with our scrollbox subclass,
95

95

00:04:59,350  -->  00:05:02,080
we can start to add that extra functionality.
96

96

00:05:02,080  -->  00:05:03,920
So we close that down.
97

97

00:05:05,260  -->  00:05:08,970
And with our calls, we're passing on any keyword arguments
98

98

00:05:08,970  -->  00:05:11,200
to the listbox init method.
99

99

00:05:11,200  -->  00:05:13,600
So if we create one of our own scrollbox objects
100

100

00:05:13,600  -->  00:05:15,360
with a different background, for example,
101

101

00:05:15,360  -->  00:05:17,400
that would actually work fine.
102

102

00:05:17,400  -->  00:05:18,630
And just to show you what I mean by that,
103

103

00:05:18,630  -->  00:05:20,940
we can go back up to artist, the artist listbox
104

104

00:05:20,940  -->  00:05:23,190
here on line 38 and we could add
105

105

00:05:23,190  -->  00:05:27,350
an additional argument there, so background equals
106

106

00:05:28,370  -->  00:05:32,540
blue and if we run this, we get a lovely blue background
107

107

00:05:34,180  -->  00:05:36,430
from our artists scrollbox.
108

108

00:05:37,740  -->  00:05:40,330
Or listbox, to be more technically correct.
109

109

00:05:40,330  -->  00:05:41,350
So in other words, we don't have to worry
110

110

00:05:41,350  -->  00:05:43,600
about dealing with any options that the users
111

111

00:05:43,600  -->  00:05:45,410
of our scrollbox decide they want.
112

112

00:05:45,410  -->  00:05:49,700
We're just passing the lot on in the kwargs argument.
113

113

00:05:49,700  -->  00:05:51,360
Now black text though on the background's starting
114

114

00:05:51,360  -->  00:05:54,820
to look awful, so I'm going to actually undo that change
115

115

00:05:54,820  -->  00:05:57,570
and again, what I mean by that is
116

116

00:05:59,800  -->  00:06:01,500
it's not really a good look there with that blue,
117

117

00:06:01,500  -->  00:06:06,410
so I'm going to again just get rid of that blue background
118

118

00:06:06,410  -->  00:06:07,780
by just undoing it.
119

119

00:06:07,780  -->  00:06:10,300
I'm gonna go back to how it was now on line 38,
120

120

00:06:10,300  -->  00:06:11,340
but keep in mind if you do want
121

121

00:06:11,340  -->  00:06:13,860
to give your scrollboxes different colours and fonts
122

122

00:06:13,860  -->  00:06:17,350
that's fully supported via the kwargs argument now.
123

123

00:06:17,350  -->  00:06:19,670
But in our case, we've just created our own subclass
124

124

00:06:19,670  -->  00:06:22,590
of listbox that we can add extra functionality to,
125

125

00:06:22,590  -->  00:06:24,150
so let's do as the name suggests
126

126

00:06:24,150  -->  00:06:26,180
and actually add a scrollbar.
127

127

00:06:26,180  -->  00:06:28,150
So the time to do that is when our scrollbox
128

128

00:06:28,150  -->  00:06:30,680
is added to the layout manager.
129

129

00:06:30,680  -->  00:06:33,270
Now we're only going to support the grid manager
130

130

00:06:33,270  -->  00:06:34,480
and so consequently to do this
131

131

00:06:34,480  -->  00:06:36,900
we're going to override the grid method.
132

132

00:06:36,900  -->  00:06:39,750
So let's go back up to our class definition.
133

133

00:06:39,750  -->  00:06:41,530
And we're gonna add the code here.
134

134

00:06:41,530  -->  00:06:44,840
And we'll start the code here on line 18
135

135

00:06:44,840  -->  00:06:48,050
and we'll define that or override that grid method.
136

136

00:06:48,050  -->  00:06:52,870
So that's gonna be def grid, self is the first parameter,
137

137

00:06:52,870  -->  00:06:56,710
then it's comma space row, comma space column,
138

138

00:06:58,220  -->  00:07:02,390
comma space sticky is equal to nsw in single quotes,
139

139

00:07:03,850  -->  00:07:06,970
comma space rowspan is equal to one,
140

140

00:07:06,970  -->  00:07:10,630
comma space columnspan is equal to one,
141

141

00:07:10,630  -->  00:07:13,460
comma space, you guess it, kwargs.
142

142

00:07:16,060  -->  00:07:18,840
And Python 2 users, the equivalent would be
143

143

00:07:18,840  -->  00:07:22,090
tkinter.listbox.grid and I'll just type
144

144

00:07:25,220  -->  00:07:26,970
this in real quickly.
145

145

00:07:41,840  -->  00:07:44,610
Again, if you're a Python 2 user.
146

146

00:07:44,610  -->  00:07:47,320
But in our case, we're now gonna do a super method
147

147

00:07:47,320  -->  00:07:48,650
called dot grid.
148

148

00:07:50,100  -->  00:07:54,390
And it's gonna be row equals row, comma space column
149

149

00:07:54,390  -->  00:07:58,390
equals column, comma space sticky equals sticky,
150

150

00:08:01,340  -->  00:08:05,500
comma space rowspan equals rowspan, comma space columnspan
151

151

00:08:08,750  -->  00:08:12,090
equals columnspan, comma space, and yes,
152

152

00:08:13,120  -->  00:08:15,450
KWargs on the end, **kwargs.
153

153

00:08:17,780  -->  00:08:18,910
So that's the super call.
154

154

00:08:18,910  -->  00:08:22,490
Then we also wanna do a self.scrollbar.grid
155

155

00:08:24,740  -->  00:08:29,530
row equals row, comma space column equals column,
156

156

00:08:29,530  -->  00:08:33,650
comma space sticky equals in single quotes nse,
157

157

00:08:33,650  -->  00:08:36,990
comma space, and rowspan equals rowspan.
158

158

00:08:38,760  -->  00:08:42,060
And then we wanna do a self left to right square brackets
159

159

00:08:42,060  -->  00:08:44,970
and in single quotes yscrollcommand
160

160

00:08:47,510  -->  00:08:50,760
and that's equal to self.scrollbar.set.
161

161

00:08:52,590  -->  00:08:54,540
All right, so the first line in the method
162

162

00:08:54,540  -->  00:08:57,390
is calling the super, the super class's grid method
163

163

00:08:57,390  -->  00:08:58,910
and we're passing on any options that
164

164

00:08:58,910  -->  00:09:00,750
we don't wanna use in kwargs.
165

165

00:09:00,750  -->  00:09:02,480
And once again in the line above that
166

166

00:09:02,480  -->  00:09:05,270
I've included the method you'd use for Python 2,
167

167

00:09:05,270  -->  00:09:07,010
its old-style classes.
168

168

00:09:07,010  -->  00:09:09,240
Now note that all the options we have included
169

169

00:09:09,240  -->  00:09:12,600
in our definition of this method won't be present in kwargs.
170

170

00:09:12,600  -->  00:09:15,150
As we saw in the last video, any additional options
171

171

00:09:15,150  -->  00:09:17,760
that the calling code uses will just be passed on
172

172

00:09:17,760  -->  00:09:20,000
to the super classes grid method.
173

173

00:09:20,000  -->  00:09:23,600
So the remaining code is two lines starting on line 21.
174

174

00:09:23,600  -->  00:09:25,720
This is just the code we used further down the programme
175

175

00:09:25,720  -->  00:09:27,280
to display the scrollbar.
176

176

00:09:27,280  -->  00:09:30,380
Now we use the scrollbar classes grid method
177

177

00:09:30,380  -->  00:09:32,150
just like we did in the main code.
178

178

00:09:32,150  -->  00:09:34,200
So we know the row and column because they were
179

179

00:09:34,200  -->  00:09:37,070
passed into a grid method, so we can put the scrollbar
180

180

00:09:37,070  -->  00:09:39,180
at the same cell on the grid.
181

181

00:09:39,180  -->  00:09:41,690
So consequently now, our scrollbar should display
182

182

00:09:41,690  -->  00:09:43,620
its own scrollbar and we can remove
183

183

00:09:43,620  -->  00:09:46,380
the scrollbar code from the main programme.
184

184

00:09:46,380  -->  00:09:47,840
So if we come down to the main code
185

185

00:09:47,840  -->  00:09:50,620
and I'll just put that up on the screen.
186

186

00:09:50,620  -->  00:09:54,370
So after the code on line 46, we can actually
187

187

00:09:55,640  -->  00:09:57,450
delete these four lines.
188

188

00:09:57,450  -->  00:09:59,180
The blink line and then these other three lines here,
189

189

00:09:59,180  -->  00:10:03,070
the tkinter.scrollbar, the grid and the yscroll command,
190

190

00:10:03,070  -->  00:10:04,880
because we're implementing those in our class.
191

191

00:10:04,880  -->  00:10:07,300
I'm deleting that and likewise for album,
192

192

00:10:07,300  -->  00:10:08,440
if we go down, we're going to delete
193

193

00:10:08,440  -->  00:10:09,960
those four lines as well.
194

194

00:10:09,960  -->  00:10:12,350
One, two, three, four, for the same reason,
195

195

00:10:12,350  -->  00:10:15,000
we've got it in our own class.
196

196

00:10:15,000  -->  00:10:16,900
All right, so that now looks a lot neater
197

197

00:10:16,900  -->  00:10:18,070
and we haven't got the code that
198

198

00:10:18,070  -->  00:10:22,000
we copy and pasted to create the scrollbars.
199

199

00:10:22,000  -->  00:10:26,780
Let's just test the programme to make sure that it does work.
200

200

00:10:26,780  -->  00:10:30,740
And I'm gonna have a look at the output.
201

201

00:10:30,740  -->  00:10:33,380
And it actually looks like we have got a problem here.
202

202

00:10:33,380  -->  00:10:35,840
You can see, we've got a scrollbar to the left here.
203

203

00:10:35,840  -->  00:10:40,610
We've got one for albums, but we haven't got one for songs.
204

204

00:10:40,610  -->  00:10:42,380
And I click on now what I've done there.
205

205

00:10:42,380  -->  00:10:44,590
You can see the scrollbar that appears
206

206

00:10:44,590  -->  00:10:47,630
to be for artists actually works for albums.
207

207

00:10:47,630  -->  00:10:51,130
So I think I've got my sticky statement wrong.
208

208

00:10:51,130  -->  00:10:53,780
And we go back and have a look.
209

209

00:10:53,780  -->  00:10:55,190
So I've got sticky equals nsw,
210

210

00:10:55,190  -->  00:10:57,220
so we're actually trying to stick the scrollbar
211

211

00:10:57,220  -->  00:11:00,060
to the west, to the left in other words,
212

212

00:11:00,060  -->  00:11:02,530
and it should be east, because we want it
213

213

00:11:02,530  -->  00:11:05,440
to appear to the rightmost part of our listbox.
214

214

00:11:05,440  -->  00:11:07,760
So I would suspect that's probably the error.
215

215

00:11:07,760  -->  00:11:09,820
So let's just fix that, or run that rather,
216

216

00:11:09,820  -->  00:11:11,650
and see that it works.
217

217

00:11:12,860  -->  00:11:14,060
All right, that looks better to me.
218

218

00:11:14,060  -->  00:11:15,770
We've got our scrollbar here that's disabled
219

219

00:11:15,770  -->  00:11:17,660
because we haven't got any entries.
220

220

00:11:17,660  -->  00:11:19,800
And for songs, we can see there's now a scrollbar.
221

221

00:11:19,800  -->  00:11:22,430
And we've got the scrollbar that actually works
222

222

00:11:22,430  -->  00:11:24,920
for albums now, that's much better.
223

223

00:11:24,920  -->  00:11:26,610
All right, so you can see that they're all working now
224

224

00:11:26,610  -->  00:11:28,190
and that's good.
225

225

00:11:28,190  -->  00:11:31,250
Now we could improve it slightly by putting
226

226

00:11:31,250  -->  00:11:33,660
a check in to the grid method.
227

227

00:11:33,660  -->  00:11:35,310
At the moment, the scrollbar can only appear
228

228

00:11:35,310  -->  00:11:37,430
on the right of the listbox.
229

229

00:11:37,430  -->  00:11:39,210
That's assuming you've got the right sticky commands
230

230

00:11:39,210  -->  00:11:41,080
pointing, going to the right.
231

231

00:11:41,080  -->  00:11:43,720
So we could test the value of a sticky that's passed in
232

232

00:11:43,720  -->  00:11:46,760
and then if it specifies east instead of west,
233

233

00:11:46,760  -->  00:11:49,190
make the scrollbar sticky to the west.
234

234

00:11:49,190  -->  00:11:51,020
So I'm not gonna do that now, but give it a go
235

235

00:11:51,020  -->  00:11:52,540
if that's something you wanna do.
236

236

00:11:52,540  -->  00:11:56,060
All right, so I'm gonna close that down.
237

237

00:11:56,060  -->  00:11:59,070
And at this point, we've successfully subclassed
238

238

00:11:59,070  -->  00:12:02,590
the tkinter listbox to create our own scrollbox,
239

239

00:12:02,590  -->  00:12:05,170
as well as provide it some additional functionality.
240

240

00:12:05,170  -->  00:12:07,670
So this is great use of inheritance.
241

241

00:12:07,670  -->  00:12:10,250
What I'm going to do, though, is finish by splitting
242

242

00:12:10,250  -->  00:12:13,500
the old-style call to the grid method.
243

243

00:12:13,500  -->  00:12:16,400
So I'm gonna come back here and look at it on,
244

244

00:12:16,400  -->  00:12:17,810
here in the code.
245

245

00:12:18,840  -->  00:12:20,500
And what I might do is just separate this
246

246

00:12:20,500  -->  00:12:22,570
on to two lines, even though we haven't
247

247

00:12:22,570  -->  00:12:24,760
actually got an error, we have actually
248

248

00:12:24,760  -->  00:12:25,790
quite a long line there.
249

249

00:12:25,790  -->  00:12:27,000
So even though it's only a comment,
250

250

00:12:27,000  -->  00:12:29,580
what I'm going to do is after the rowspan,
251

251

00:12:29,580  -->  00:12:32,440
we'll just put this on a separate line.
252

252

00:12:32,440  -->  00:12:33,920
All right, so at this point now we're ready
253

253

00:12:33,920  -->  00:12:38,870
to continue and take this scrollbox class further.
254

254

00:12:38,870  -->  00:12:40,170
And what we'll do in the next video
255

255

00:12:40,170  -->  00:12:43,470
is we'll start work on creating a subclass of scrollbox
256

256

00:12:43,470  -->  00:12:46,230
that populates itself from the database.
257

257

00:12:46,230  -->  00:12:48,640
So see you in the next video.
