00:00:04,360  -->  00:00:10,520
Alright so this is the if challenge. So
the challenge is to write a small

2

00:00:10,520  -->  00:00:14,900
program to ask for a name and an age.
When both values have been entered, check

3

00:00:14,900  -->  00:00:18,770
if the person is the right age to go on
on an 18-30 holiday. They must be over 18

4

00:00:18,770  -->  00:00:25,370
and under 31. If they are, welcome them to
the holiday, otherwise print a, hopefully,

5

00:00:25,370  -->  00:00:30,100
polite message refusing them entry. Our
programs expect valid input.

6

00:00:30,100  -->  00:00:33,940
We'll see how to handle invalid numbers later
in the course. You don't need to deal

7

00:00:33,950  -->  00:00:38,109
with that at the moment.
Remember that human languages aren't

8

00:00:38,109  -->  00:00:42,640
always very precise. Someone counts as
over eighteen from one second after

9

00:00:42,640  -->  00:00:47,229
midnight on their birthday. Their actual
age equals 18 but they're counted as

10

00:00:47,229  -->  00:00:52,080
being over 18 when considering
things like voting or getting a credit card.

11

00:00:52,080  -->  00:00:55,059
Alright so that's a challenge. See how
you go. We'll go over the solution to

12

00:00:55,059  -->  00:00:58,530
this challenge in the next video.
