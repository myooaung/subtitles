1

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:08,730
We've seen how our program's going to
work in the last video. Now let's write

2

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:21,100
the code. I'm going to create a new
Python file here. I'm going to call it jukebox_menu.

3

00:00:21,100  -->  00:00:24,980
We're going to need our
albums list, and the obvious thing to do,

4

00:00:24,980  -->  00:00:29,520
is to copy and paste it into this file.
One problem with doing that, is that we

5

00:00:29,520  -->  00:00:33,780
have to then modify the data in two
places, if we want to add new albums.

6

00:00:33,780  -->  00:00:39,020
Python lets us import things from other
Python files, which can be a great way to

7

00:00:39,020  -->  00:00:42,780
share data between different programs.
And it's also a great way to share code

8

00:00:42,780  -->  00:00:47,100
between different programs, and we've already
seen that, when we imported the random

9

00:00:47,100  -->  00:00:51,120
module for our high-low game. We're going
to be looking at importing in more

10

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:57,620
detail, later in the course. To import the
data, we need to use the import command.

11

00:00:57,620  -->  00:01:01,520
There's several ways to import things. I'm
going to use one of those ways here now.

12

00:01:01,520  -->  00:01:07,520
I'm going to start typing from space nes -
notice that IntelliJ has provided

13

00:01:07,520  -->  00:01:13,860
auto-completion for the file name. I called
my file, if you recall, nested_data.py,

14

00:01:13,860  -->  00:01:16,820
and IntelliJ is offering that as a suggestion.

15

00:01:16,820  -->  00:01:21,920
Pressing the tab key, as I do now, selects nested
data which saves typing, and also

16

00:01:21,920  -->  00:01:27,360
avoids typing the name in incorrectly.
Alright, so we want to import albums for

17

00:01:27,360  -->  00:01:33,090
nested_data, so we need to
type import here. So space import -

18

00:01:33,090  -->  00:01:38,490
I'm going to type a there. Once again, IntelliJ is
offering suggestions here, for things

19

00:01:38,490  -->  00:01:43,560
beginning with a in the nested_data file.
You could use the cursor keys

20

00:01:43,560  -->  00:01:46,320
to move up and down the list, then press

21

00:01:46,320  -->  00:01:51,680
tab to choose the relevant options. I'm
going to select albums and press tab.

22

00:01:51,680  -->  00:01:56,240
So make sure you do choose albums, which I
did - that second option in the list.

23

00:01:56,250  -->  00:02:00,750
If you just import album without the s,
you'll get an error later. Alright, so

24

00:02:00,750  -->  00:02:06,040
that'll include the definition of our
albums list, into our jukebox_menu

25

00:02:06,040  -->  00:02:09,980
program. The list is defined in nested_data, but we've

26

00:02:09,980  -->  00:02:13,980
now made it available in this program as
well. And that's pretty cool,

27

00:02:13,980  -->  00:02:17,560
but it isn't quite as straightforward as
I've just made it look.

28

00:02:17,560  -->  00:02:22,220
And as I said, we'll look into this in detail, later.
For now, though, I wanted to show you

29

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:25,650
something strange that happens and one
way to fix it. So we're gonna go ahead

30

00:02:25,650  -->  00:02:29,430
and run this jukebox_menu program.
Now make sure you're

31

00:02:29,430  -->  00:02:32,300
executing the right file because this is
going to look very strange.

32

00:02:32,300  -->  00:02:36,860
So right-click, as I usually do, in the
editor pane, and select jukebox_menu,

33

00:02:36,860  -->  00:02:41,540
which I'm doing now, and make sure you're
running that from the context menu,

34

00:02:41,540  -->  00:02:45,329
and we get a load of output, as you can see
here, even though there's no code in our

35

00:02:45,329  -->  00:02:51,860
program yet. When you import another file,
Python executes all the code in that file.

36

00:02:51,860  -->  00:02:56,340
Now that can be very useful, but it
isn't what we want to happen here.

37

00:02:56,340  -->  00:02:59,480
Now we're gonna see another way to deal
with this. When we start writing code

38

00:02:59,480  -->  00:03:02,819
that's intended to be shared, we'll write
it slightly differently.

39

00:03:02,819  -->  00:03:07,439
For now though, if you want to share data
between different programs, then make

40

00:03:07,439  -->  00:03:11,700
sure your file contains only the data
definitions - don't include any code in

41

00:03:11,700  -->  00:03:15,870
the data file. So I'm gonna close down this
run window. And in fact, what I'll do is,

42

00:03:15,870  -->  00:03:19,380
I'll just change this for now by
clicking on the cog, go back to View Mode

43

00:03:19,380  -->  00:03:24,560
and doc, so it's back to how it was before.
I'm gonna close that down now, and what

44

00:03:24,560  -->  00:03:28,500
we want to do, we want to open up nested_data,
 so do that from a project pane,

45

00:03:28,500  -->  00:03:31,560
or because it's on screen,
I'm gonna click it on here. And we're going

46

00:03:31,560  -->  00:03:35,970
to delete everything, other than the
definition, at the top of the file - so

47

00:03:35,970  -->  00:03:43,829
everything, basically up to and including,
line 40. So you can see there, we've only

48

00:03:43,829  -->  00:03:48,360
now got our album's definition. So
basically, nested_data only includes

49

00:03:48,360  -->  00:03:52,440
our albums list and no other
code. We can import albums into as many

50

00:03:52,440  -->  00:03:56,920
other programs as we want, without
getting a load of code executed, as we saw.

51

00:03:56,920  -->  00:04:01,320
Let's check this by switching back to jukebox menu, or _menu, up here,

52

00:04:01,320  -->  00:04:05,459
and let's run it again. This time we don't

53

00:04:05,459  -->  00:04:09,389
get that unwanted output. In fact, we
don't get any output, and that's because

54

00:04:09,389  -->  00:04:14,620
we haven't written any code yet. Your IDE
may also be giving you a warning on line one,

55

00:04:14,620  -->  00:04:17,639
that you've got an unused import
statement, and you can see that I've got

56

00:04:17,640  -->  00:04:22,020
that warning here. That's fine - the warning
 will go away when we start using it.

57

00:04:22,020  -->  00:04:25,280
Alright, so I'm gonna print albums,
just so you can see that it's available.

58

00:04:25,280  -->  00:04:31,720
So let's go ahead and do that: line three,
print parentheses albums.

59

00:04:31,720  -->  00:04:39,160
You can see that warning's now disappeared. Run the program - you can see that we've got

60

00:04:39,160  -->  00:04:43,340
our albums lists printed out. Alright, so
this is one way to share objects between

61

00:04:43,340  -->  00:04:49,260
different Python programs. On line
one, we import albums from nested_data.

62

00:04:49,260  -->  00:04:54,260
The syntax is the other way around -
we've got from nested_data import albums,

63

00:04:54,260  -->  00:04:56,680
but it's still easy to understand what that means.

64

00:04:56,680  -->  00:05:00,920
Now that we've got our data available
in our jukebox_menu program,

65

00:05:00,920  -->  00:05:06,940
we can use it to produce the menus. We'll
write that code in the next video.
