00:00:04,390  -->  00:00:08,889
In this video we need to check whether
Python is set up and configured for your

2

00:00:08,889  -->  00:00:15,060
Linux installation. Now I'm running
Ubuntu 18.0 4.1, but the concept should

3

00:00:15,060  -->  00:00:21,480
be generally applicable to other Linux
distros. So let's open a terminal window first,

4

00:00:24,200  -->  00:00:30,860
and first command I'm going to type
is pythons space - - version.

5

00:00:30,860  -->  00:00:36,160
Now if you actually get a version return, and version of Python 3 point X is showing

6

00:00:36,160  -->  00:00:39,520
other than command not found, which is
showing for me, then you don't need to do

7

00:00:39,520  -->  00:00:43,120
anything else and you can probably finish
off the video. But in my case you can see

8

00:00:43,120  -->  00:00:47,180
that I've got an error and a suggestion
on how to go about installing Python.

9

00:00:47,180  -->  00:00:51,540
So what I'm going to do now is just confirm
that Python 3 also isn't available, so I

10

00:00:51,550  -->  00:00:57,940
can do that by typing Python 3 space - -
version, and in my case you can see that

11

00:00:57,940  -->  00:01:03,280
I have got Python 3.6.5 installed by default on Ubuntu.

12

00:01:03,280  -->  00:01:07,119
Now this is a brand new installation. I
haven't done any configuration, or any

13

00:01:07,119  -->  00:01:10,810
patching or anything like that. So
basically, that's probably enough for you

14

00:01:10,810  -->  00:01:14,520
if you're running ubuntu, and you won't
need to actually do anything else.

15

00:01:14,520  -->  00:01:18,220
If you do want to install the latest python
version, version 3.7.3,

16

00:01:18,220  -->  00:01:22,400
you can do so, but frankly there's
no real need to do it because there's

17

00:01:22,400  -->  00:01:26,440
not significant changes that have been
made, and you'll find that over time,

18

00:01:26,440  -->  00:01:30,140
this installation Ubuntu will actually update the Python version anyway.

19

00:01:30,140  -->  00:01:34,020
But one thing you'll need to check though, 
is we use a program, and that's PIP.

20

00:01:34,020  -->  00:01:39,640
We use a command line program called PIP, and we need to check whether that exists on this installation

21

00:01:39,640  -->  00:01:44,860
so I'm going to type pip. You can see
I've got an error there. Again, if you had

22

00:01:44,860  -->  00:01:47,770
a version come back and it did actually
report something, then chances are,

23

00:01:47,770  -->  00:01:53,920
that'll be all you'll need. But you can also
type pip3.  Let's do that just to make sure.

24

00:01:53,920  -->  00:01:56,960
That's not working either, as
you can see there. So if either of those

25

00:01:56,960  -->  00:02:01,240
commands returned PIP with a 3 point X version, then you wouldn't need

26

00:02:01,240  -->  00:02:04,480
to do anything else, but as you can see
with a brand new installation of Ubuntu,

27

00:02:04,480  -->  00:02:08,920
that didn't work for me, so therefore I
need to install at least PIP 3.

28

00:02:08,920  -->  00:02:19,040
So to do that I'm going to type sudo apt
a p t space install space python3 - pip.

29

00:02:19,040  -->  00:02:22,160
We're going to type password, my password,

30

00:02:22,160  -->  00:02:28,480
accept yes there, and that's going to
download it and install PIP, or PIP 3 in this case.

31

00:02:28,480  -->  00:02:31,180
Once that's finished we'll just check the version number to

32

00:02:31,180  -->  00:02:35,050
confirm we've got pip version 3, and
that's all we need to do before we move

33

00:02:35,050  -->  00:02:38,200
onto the next video.

34

00:02:38,200  -->  00:02:39,680
Alright so that's finished so I can

35

00:02:39,680  -->  00:02:46,390
type pip3 space - - version. We've now
got a command being returned for us.

36

00:02:46,390  -->  00:02:50,470
We've got, in this case, pip9 being
returned, so that's telling us that

37

00:02:50,470  -->  00:02:53,890
everything's good to go, and the
3 point X that I was referring to,

38

00:02:53,890  -->  00:02:58,180
by the way, over to the right hand
side, notice it says Python 3.6.

39

00:02:58,180  -->  00:03:02,290
So basically, we know that we've got a
version of PIP for Python three-point-something,

40

00:03:02,290  -->  00:03:07,080
3.6 in this particular case, because we
wouldn't want to be using PIP 2 with a

41

00:03:07,080  -->  00:03:11,980
Python 3 installation. But basically, at this
point of time we've got both Python 3,

42

00:03:11,980  -->  00:03:15,430
in our case it was, I think, 3.6.5.
I'll just check that again,

43

00:03:15,430  -->  00:03:22,420
python space - - version, python3 that should have been.
And python3 space - - version,

44

00:03:22,420  -->  00:03:25,630
we've got Python 3.6.7  installed, and we've also got

45

00:03:25,630  -->  00:03:30,180
PIP version 9.0.1, which is for Python 3.6 installed.

46

00:03:30,180  -->  00:03:33,720
So we're actually good to go at this point.  So let's end the video here,

47

00:03:33,720  -->  00:03:37,520
and in the next video we'll start going through and installing IntelliJ IDEA,

48

00:03:37,520  -->  00:03:42,420
which is the IDE we're going to be using, to write Python programs in this course.

49

00:03:42,420  -->  00:03:45,320
So see you in the next video.
