00:00:05,020  -->  00:00:07,000
in this video we're going to install the
2

2

00:00:07,000  -->  00:00:09,400
sqlite command line shell for the Linux
3

3

00:00:09,400  -->  00:00:11,980
computers now if you're using Windows or
4

4

00:00:11,980  -->  00:00:14,020
Mac refer to the previous two videos
5

5

00:00:14,020  -->  00:00:15,940
where we actually set up for those
6

6

00:00:15,940  -->  00:00:17,800
platforms but if you're running linux
7

7

00:00:17,800  -->  00:00:19,230
you're in the right place so let's get
8

8

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:22,000
started so Python includes sqlite
9

9

00:00:22,000  -->  00:00:24,130
in its standard library so we don't need
10

10

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:25,840
to install anything to use sqlite
11

11

00:00:25,840  -->  00:00:28,780
in our python programs but writing data
12

12

00:00:28,780  -->  00:00:30,310
base code straightaway isn't the
13

13

00:00:30,310  -->  00:00:32,110
easiest way to learn about sqlite
14

14

00:00:32,110  -->  00:00:34,150
and the sql language because if you
15

15

00:00:34,150  -->  00:00:35,560
get errors you have to work out if the
16

16

00:00:35,560  -->  00:00:37,540
errors in your python code or the
17

17

00:00:37,540  -->  00:00:39,360
sql statements that you actually use
18

18

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:41,320
so what we're going to do is we're going
19

19

00:00:41,320  -->  00:00:42,840
to start by using the sqlite
20

20

00:00:42,840  -->  00:00:45,090
command line shell so that we can create
21

21

00:00:45,090  -->  00:00:47,680
databases in use sql commands
22

22

00:00:47,680  -->  00:00:49,540
without having to worry about Python
23

23

00:00:49,540  -->  00:00:52,200
code at this stage now on ubuntu linux
24

24

00:00:52,200  -->  00:00:54,540
turns out this is really easy going to
25

25

00:00:54,540  -->  00:00:56,500
start by opening a terminal session so
26

26

00:00:56,500  -->  00:00:59,430
i'm just going to use the shortcut on ubuntu
27

27

00:00:59,430  -->  00:01:03,750
which is control alt t that opens the
28

28

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:07,870
windows you can see they're obviously
29

29

00:01:07,870  -->  00:01:09,130
I could have just come up here and just type
30

30

00:01:09,130  -->  00:01:11,230
terminal in there to open up that way as
31

31

00:01:11,230  -->  00:01:11,710
well
32

32

00:01:11,710  -->  00:01:13,690
alright so installing sqlite3
33

33

00:01:13,690  -->  00:01:14,860
firstly we check to see whether we've
34

34

00:01:14,860  -->  00:01:18,970
got it we type...you can see that
35

35

00:01:18,970  -->  00:01:20,530
it's saying that currently we haven't
36

36

00:01:20,530  -->  00:01:23,350
got the program installed so again on
37

37

00:01:23,350  -->  00:01:26,890
ubuntu linux we do...
38

38

00:01:26,890  -->  00:01:31,750
...
39

39

00:01:31,750  -->  00:01:35,490
....
40

40

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:37,220
and you can see that was really really
41

41

00:01:37,220  -->  00:01:38,540
quick installation is only a small
42

42

00:01:38,540  -->  00:01:40,040
program is already getting the
43

43

00:01:40,040  -->  00:01:41,670
command-line shell not the sqlite
44

44

00:01:41,670  -->  00:01:43,970
itself this point we can then check to
45

45

00:01:43,970  -->  00:01:45,960
see whether sqlite is installed
46

46

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:50,690
type...you can see instead
47

47

00:01:50,690  -->  00:01:52,260
of getting an error like we did
48

48

00:01:52,260  -->  00:01:54,510
previously we can see its showing
49

49

00:01:54,510  -->  00:01:56,820
the sqlite version number....
50

50

00:01:56,820  -->  00:01:59,180
...and incidentally you
51

51

00:01:59,180  -->  00:02:00,600
might see a slightly different version
52

52

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:02,640
number what I've got on the screen
53

53

00:02:02,640  -->  00:02:04,400
but that's ok so long as you can
54

54

00:02:04,400  -->  00:02:06,260
actually get it working and you can see
55

55

00:02:06,260  -->  00:02:07,880
that we actually started the sqlite
56

56

00:02:07,880  -->  00:02:11,100
command line shell your good to go and just
57

57

00:02:11,100  -->  00:02:13,430
keep in mind specifically with ubuntu
58

58

00:02:13,430  -->  00:02:17,010
i'm using 14.04 but if you're
59

59

00:02:17,010  -->  00:02:19,460
using Ubuntu 16.04 you will actually get
60

60

00:02:19,460  -->  00:02:21,930
a much later version but both versions
61

61

00:02:21,930  -->  00:02:23,990
will actually work fine with the course
62

62

00:02:23,990  -->  00:02:25,350
their is no prerequisites for a specific
63

63

00:02:25,350  -->  00:02:27,240
version of sqlite3
64

64

00:02:27,240  -->  00:02:29,100
alright so this point we've completed
65

65

00:02:29,100  -->  00:02:31,680
the installation type...to get
66

66

00:02:31,680  -->  00:02:33,900
out of the sqlite command line shell
67

67

00:02:33,900  -->  00:02:36,120
....to close down the terminal
68

68

00:02:36,120  -->  00:02:39,930
session and at this point we're done so
69

69

00:02:39,930  -->  00:02:41,400
let's now move on to the next video
70

70

00:02:41,400  -->  00:02:42,600
we're going to go through a bit of an
71

71

00:02:42,600  -->  00:02:45,300
introduction on using sqlite see you
72

72

00:02:45,300  -->  00:02:50,930
in the next video
