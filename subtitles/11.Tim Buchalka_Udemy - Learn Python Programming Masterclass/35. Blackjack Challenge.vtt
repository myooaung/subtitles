00:00:05.040  -->  00:00:08.560
so just before we start a challenge
there's one little bugs that I want to fix
2

2

00:00:08.560  -->  00:00:11.950
and I just want to run it again and show you
what the bug was and you probably picked this up
3

3

00:00:11.950  -->  00:00:18.490
in the last video so when we first start the dealer
4

4

00:00:18.490  -->  00:00:23.450
score is showing 0 obviously the player scores
working and the reason that's doing that
5

5

00:00:23.450  -->  00:00:28.790
if you closes this down and on the code on the bottom we've got the deal player
6

6

00:00:28.790  -->  00:00:33.870
we call the deal_player function and we actually add the card to the
7

7

00:00:33.870  -->  00:00:38.470
dealer hand and notice we are not calling a
function to print it to display anything
8

8

00:00:38.470  -->  00:00:43.870
or anything along those lines whereas the deal_player function is sort of
9

9

00:00:43.870  -->  00:00:46.690
self-contained and also outputs the
actual
10

10

00:00:46.690  -->  00:00:50.820
scores as well on the screen so what we
want to do is make quick changes there
11

11

00:00:50.820  -->  00:01:02.210
to actually show this score so its gonna be
dealer.....
12

12

00:01:02.210  -->  00:01:09.470
...so basically we are just going
to display that's score so we've drawn a
13

13

00:01:09.470  -->  00:01:12.960
card and we are going to show that on the screen once and then obviously
14

14

00:01:12.960  -->  00:01:16.550
subsequent times its going to work
automatically when we click the dealer
15

15

00:01:16.550  -->  00:01:20.590
button so if we run again now that should fix that so we got an
16

16

00:01:20.590  -->  00:01:27.020
initial score and you can see its better now we got it working even
17

17

00:01:27.020  -->  00:01:31.280
though the functions still work in that
once we pressed deal it is still going
18

18

00:01:31.280  -->  00:01:35.340
to calculate this is a better way of
actually showing and obviously I got
19

19

00:01:35.340  -->  00:01:42.560
slaughtered by dealer ok so that's
working so talking a little  bit about the challenge
20

20

00:01:42.560  -->  00:01:47.700
its is going to be quite simple because just looking
at where we're at with the game now it
21

21

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:51.800
plays a reasonably good game of blackjack
and all the dealing is now taking
22

22

00:01:51.800  -->  00:01:57.650
care of by the computer so we only need to
click on dealer once we are finish with our turn and the
23

23

00:01:57.650  -->  00:02:00.010
rest of the game finishes and the deal
24

24

00:02:00.010  -->  00:02:04.660
function deal_dealer function sort of handles that functionality to play the
25

25

00:02:04.660  -->  00:02:07.020
game as far as a computer the is concern
26

26

00:02:07.020  -->  00:02:10.170
their is a bit of annoying though which you see me to do having
to close the window and run the
27

27

00:02:10.170  -->  00:02:14.040
program again for a new game and I
mentioned in the last video it's time
28

28

00:02:14.040  -->  00:02:15.820
for a challenge so
29

29

00:02:15.820  -->  00:02:19.760
just before I do that one final comment about
global variables you probably sick about
30

30

00:02:19.760  -->  00:02:22.910
it now but we are harping on about it because
it's really important that you
31

31

00:02:22.910  -->  00:02:29.510
understand this and get it to the right mind set about how to use them so you are aware of the
32

32

00:02:29.510  -->  00:02:33.990
limitations you might be wondering why
the variables player_hand
33

33

00:02:33.990  -->  00:02:38.450
and dealer_hand are not triggering
warnings about a local variable shadowing
34

34

00:02:38.450  -->  00:02:42.180
the global ones because both the deal_player function if we go back and
35

35

00:02:42.180  -->  00:02:49.160
have a look at that as you can see the deal_player function on line 78 and
36

36

00:02:49.160  -->  00:02:53.630
the deal_dealer function
on line 64 they are both appending new
37

37

00:02:53.630  -->  00:02:57.910
cards to the corresponding list so
wouldn't that count as modifying the
38

38

00:02:57.910  -->  00:03:01.400
global variable in which make them local
because we talked about that in previous
39

39

00:03:01.400  -->  00:03:02.720
videos
40

40

00:03:02.720  -->  00:03:08.480
well the answer is that neither variable
is modified their initialized as lists
41

41

00:03:08.480  -->  00:03:11.590
if you go down and have a look
42

42

00:03:11.590  -->  00:03:18.470
we got player_hand and dealer_hand is initialization as you can see here in
43

43

00:03:18.470  -->  00:03:25.500
line 152 and 153 and continue to reference
the same lists as long as the program
44

44

00:03:25.500  -->  00:03:30.290
runs so adding items to list or removing
items from it is not modifying the list
45

45

00:03:30.290  -->  00:03:34.610
variable it always has the same value
which is a list and the contents of a list
46

46

00:03:34.610  -->  00:03:39.800
can change now adding items to a global
list is still a side effect but its not
47

47

00:03:39.800  -->  00:03:44.500
considered as dangerous as changing the
list of the variable holds for example
48

48

00:03:44.500  -->  00:03:49.820
lists exists to have items added and
removed and so consequently this is
49

49

00:03:49.820  -->  00:03:52.930
acceptable behavior and that's why
IntelliJ is not actually warning of us
50

50

00:03:52.930  -->  00:03:57.350
of that so it would still probably better to
pass the lists arguments to the
51

51

00:03:57.350  -->  00:04:02.160
functions but as we can't provide parameters to functions that are used as button
52

52

00:04:02.160  -->  00:04:05.870
commands we really don't have any choice
here but to use global list so that of
53

53

00:04:05.870  -->  00:04:11.350
course why we went ahead and did that ok so
moving on now the challenge and its going to be
54

54

00:04:11.350  -->  00:04:15.440
quite a simple one the challenges is to
add a new button to the program with the
55

55

00:04:15.440  -->  00:04:20.390
text new game now the button should call a
function that clears the cards from the
56

56

00:04:20.390  -->  00:04:26.050
screen it resets the players and dealers
hands and then starts a new game now the
57

57

00:04:26.050  -->  00:04:27.820
easiest way to clear the contents of a
58

58

00:04:27.820  -->  00:04:32.730
frame is to destroy the frame and create
a new one with the same name and in fact
59

59

00:04:32.730  -->  00:04:37.670
that's why the program has a player_card_frame and dealer_card_frame
60

60

00:04:37.670  -->  00:04:43.650
inside the card frame
itself so that's it go away and create a
61

61

00:04:43.650  -->  00:04:48.450
new button with the text new game and again the functionality clear the cards
62

62

00:04:48.450  -->  00:04:52.080
from the Screen reset the player and
dealers hands and then start a new game so
63

63

00:04:52.080  -->  00:04:58.390
pause the video go away and see if you can come up with
a solution and when you're ready to see
64

64

00:04:58.390  -->  00:05:01.980
our version of it come back and and I'll go through that with you pause the video now.....
65

65

00:05:06.540  -->  00:05:07.940
...ok so hopefully you
66

66

00:05:07.940  -->  00:05:12.700
managed to figure it out and have a
pretty good going getting it working so let's go through
67

67

00:05:12.700  -->  00:05:17.820
what our solution is to implement this and
what we're going to do is create a new
68

68

00:05:17.820  -->  00:05:23.930
function called new_game now the thing to remember here is
the most of the initialization code in
69

69

00:05:23.930  -->  00:05:28.000
the main program concern setting up the GUI and so consequently we don't need to
70

70

00:05:28.000  -->  00:05:32.590
repeat all of that every time a new game
started but the deal_card_frame
71

71

00:05:32.590  -->  00:05:38.390
and player_card_frame will need to be cleared so
72

72

00:05:38.390  -->  00:05:42.330
calling the destroy method will do that
and once that is done the list holding
73

73

00:05:42.330  -->  00:05:47.790
the hands rather will need to be cleared and the
first 3 cards dealt and we can also make
74

74

00:05:47.790  -->  00:05:50.620
a start on that now so let's do that
so I'm going to come down here after
75

75

00:05:50.620  -->  00:06:01.700
deal_player lets add the method so....and so
76

76

00:06:01.700  -->  00:06:06.410
we need to reference those global variables....
77

77

00:06:06.410  -->  00:06:25.270
....
78

78

00:06:25.270  -->  00:06:32.170
....ok so
79

79

00:06:32.170  -->  00:06:38.800
first thing we want to do is....
80

80

00:06:39.630  -->  00:06:53.810
.....
81

81

00:06:54.470  -->  00:07:02.600
....
82

82

00:07:03.330  -->  00:07:30.360
....
83

83

00:07:30.360  -->  00:07:39.330
.....and
what I could have done just scrolling down
84

84

00:07:39.330  -->  00:07:58.610
is just grab this code again....because its an identical code and obviously I could have done it as well for the dealer frame next we
85

85

00:07:58.610  -->  00:08:03.810
clear the status of the game at the top wether
dealer wins or the player wins so....
86

86

00:08:03.810  -->  00:08:10.510
..need to recreate the lists
87

87

00:08:10.510  -->  00:08:18.890
and what we can do their I can come
down here and just copy this code
88

88

00:08:18.890  -->  00:08:28.060
copy that and come back up here and paste it in....
89

89

00:08:31.260  -->  00:08:45.340
...ok so obviously we've cleared
the player hands and dealer hands now and we
90

90

00:08:45.340  -->  00:08:51.160
deal a new card and we will see also deal a new card for the dealer and another
91

91

00:08:51.160  -->  00:08:55.880
card for the player again as we've done
previously and obviously because looking
92

92

00:08:55.880  -->  00:09:00.270
at the code we also need to declare that we
want to use the global objects rather
93

93

00:09:00.270  -->  00:09:06.020
than creating local variables and that's why
we used to global key word on line
94

94

00:09:06.020  -->  00:09:11.620
88 to 91 now on Python 3 the 2
lists holding the hands could be cleared
95

95

00:09:11.620  -->  00:09:16.500
using their .clear method and that just removes
all the items for them but it doesn't create
96

96

00:09:16.500  -->  00:09:20.140
a new list so we could access to global
variables without declaring them in the
97

97

00:09:20.140  -->  00:09:24.700
function however we've also written blackjack to work with Python 2 so instead
98

98

00:09:24.700  -->  00:09:29.070
of that approach what we've done is we assigned empty
lists to the two variables you can see on
99

99

00:09:29.070  -->  00:09:33.750
line 103 and 104 and that means they do have to
be declared s global and the function
100

100

00:09:33.750  -->  00:09:38.660
for that to actually work now creating
the button itself is pretty easy we
101

101

00:09:38.660  -->  00:09:42.580
already have a frame in place so let's add
that down below the initial
102

102

00:09:42.580  -->  00:10:00.930
initialization code so....
103

103

00:10:00.930  -->  00:10:04.000
...
104

104

00:10:07.120  -->  00:10:11.940
....making sure we don't
use the brackets because we don't want
105

105

00:10:11.940  -->  00:10:16.680
to execute that we just saying this is the
function to call anytime the buttons clicked we are
106

106

00:10:16.680  -->  00:10:28.100
just gonna call that functionality then need to add it to the grid so.....
107

107

00:10:28.100  -->  00:10:31.880
....
108

108

00:10:31.880  -->  00:10:36.250
so that has added the button and just the other thing
we can take because you've notice we've got a lot
109

109

00:10:36.250  -->  00:10:43.210
of code their that's being used so we can
actually call this new_game function if I
110

110

00:10:43.210  -->  00:10:48.560
just scroll down I neet to put
some of this back so I'm going to copy
111

111

00:10:48.560  -->  00:10:58.920
this bit of code here so we need to create those
variables initially down here and once
112

112

00:10:58.920  -->  00:11:08.380
you've done that we can actually call
the new game functions so I'm gonna do that so....
113

113

00:11:08.380  -->  00:11:11.330
and what we're trying to do is avoid
duplication of code because we had the
114

114

00:11:11.330  -->  00:11:15.980
code here that we have originally placed
in there and so basically at the start
115

115

00:11:15.980  -->  00:11:19.630
of the game we can go through and
just actually run this and we have got
116

116

00:11:19.630  -->  00:11:23.730
a frame we are actually technically
destroying a frame and created it
117

117

00:11:23.730  -->  00:11:28.000
creating it again but have what we are
doing is we are avoiding this duplication
118

118

00:11:28.000  -->  00:11:33.150
of the code and not running it I should say sort of
in two places so the Idea is to put the
119

119

00:11:33.150  -->  00:11:42.860
code and only executed it only once so lets try running that and see whether it works...
120

120

00:11:42.860  -->  00:11:48.690
....and so
far so good we've now got another button for a
121

121

00:11:48.690  -->  00:11:53.640
new game and players 14 so I'm
going to click on play another
122

122

00:11:53.640  -->  00:11:59.180
card I should say so hit me and I
busted the dealer wins and now I click
123

123

00:11:59.180  -->  00:12:05.010
new game starting again thats work and
strait away I obviously got blackjack which
124

124

00:12:05.010  -->  00:12:10.880
is a good thing so I'm going to click on dealer and
I win because the player the dealer
125

125

00:12:10.880  -->  00:12:11.980
busted
126

126

00:12:11.980  -->  00:12:15.090
click on new game and click on play
127

127

00:12:16.050  -->  00:12:18.260
and I got 21 again I'm having a great run here
128

128

00:12:18.260  -->  00:12:25.020
and the dealer busts so click on new game again I've got 18 so I'm gonna just gonna hold
129

129

00:12:25.020  -->  00:12:31.260
that and I win again and lets just see whether we
get the dealer to win so click on
130

130

00:12:31.260  -->  00:12:32.720
dealer
131

131

00:12:32.720  -->  00:12:36.910
the dealer is having a bad run their new
game
132

132

00:12:36.910  -->  00:12:42.810
dealer again we got a draw this time so I talked
about that in the previous video wanting
133

133

00:12:42.810  -->  00:12:48.030
to get it draw so we got that work new game
I'm going to click on dealer again and
134

134

00:12:48.030  -->  00:12:52.720
lets see if we can get the dealer to win the dealer has a bad run with cards new game I'm
135

135

00:12:52.720  -->  00:12:58.350
going to click on dealer again and finally we get
the dealer to win so that's working well
136

136

00:12:58.350  -->  00:13:01.930
but we are gonna have a problem with this
and if we keep playing you should
137

137

00:13:01.930  -->  00:13:06.340
eventually get an error so I will see if I can do a few more
games and you think what I'm doing this what
138

138

00:13:06.340  -->  00:13:15.480
that error will be It might take a few more games for us to see it their we go we got it to actually crash so why
139

139

00:13:15.480  -->  00:13:20.590
is it crashed well the reason it crashed is that we ran out of cards their is no
140

140

00:13:20.590  -->  00:13:25.520
more cards remember we have we created the
deck of cards initially and we're not
141

141

00:13:25.520  -->  00:13:30.230
refreshing those and we're not you know
once we reach the end the deck we are not
142

142

00:13:30.230  -->  00:13:33.940
reinitializing that again and that is why it crashed now theirs
143

143

00:13:33.940  -->  00:13:38.430
many ways to solve this but the obvious
one would be to create a new deck
144

144

00:13:38.430  -->  00:13:44.640
list every time a new game has started by
just copying the two lines and
145

145

00:13:44.640  -->  00:13:52.290
in other words if I just shut this down so the two
lines and actually that turn out to be in the
146

146

00:13:52.290  -->  00:13:57.200
wrong place so the shuttle should
bee in strait after the deck when we
147

147

00:13:57.200  -->  00:14:00.560
created it for the first time so what that
actually meant was that we didn't
148

148

00:14:00.560  -->  00:14:05.870
execute the very first time the game is
played the shuffling of the decks so that was
149

149

00:14:05.870  -->  00:14:10.190
my mistake putting that in the wrong place
but what we could do the obvious approach
150

150

00:14:10.190  -->  00:14:16.150
would be to every time we create a new
game we basically execute these two
151

151

00:14:16.150  -->  00:14:19.980
lines of code create a new deck of cards and shuffle them so that each game
152

152

00:14:19.980  -->  00:14:25.960
literally like a standard game of blackjack with a new deck so that would be one way we can
153

153

00:14:25.960  -->  00:14:30.400
actually put that code in the new_game function but we're gonna take
154

154

00:14:30.400  -->  00:14:31.370
a slightly different approach here
155

155

00:14:31.370  -->  00:14:35.680
so what we gonna do is every time a new
card is dealt it is going to be put back
156

156

00:14:35.680  -->  00:14:39.590
at the bottom of the deck in other words
you just reusing the same deck
157

157

00:14:39.590  -->  00:14:43.980
continually so in Python terms the object is going to be appended back to the list so
158

158

00:14:43.980  -->  00:14:53.160
we want to do that in the deal_card frame and come back and have a look and you can see on line
159

159

00:14:53.160  -->  00:15:01.440
35 were actually popping that so what we now need to do
is before we display it....
160

160

00:15:01.440  -->  00:15:09.620
...so we added it back
again so.....
161

161

00:15:09.620  -->  00:15:14.390
.....so that should be all
162

162

00:15:14.390  -->  00:15:18.970
we need to do so this is actually
more realistic because it's like a real
163

163

00:15:18.970  -->  00:15:22.530
game and that's because when normally play a game of blackjack you don't
164

164

00:15:22.530  -->  00:15:26.420
start with the a brand new deck for every
single game do you just sort of just
165

165

00:15:26.420  -->  00:15:30.820
keep using the same deck and that is what we
are doing here essentially now there's many
166

166

00:15:30.820  -->  00:15:36.390
other improvements you could make to the
game if a new deck is not created for each new game
167

167

00:15:36.390  -->  00:15:40.850
and the game could have an option to
shuffle and let's add that as well so you can
168

168

00:15:40.850  -->  00:15:45.900
randomly click on a button and have it do a
shuttle for us to do that we can come down
169

169

00:15:45.900  -->  00:15:49.440
to the end where we actually added the new game button
170

170

00:15:49.440  -->  00:15:58.180
we're going to add a shuffle button so....
171

171

00:15:58.180  -->  00:16:04.980
....
172

172

00:16:08.610  -->  00:16:15.280
....
173

173

00:16:15.280  -->  00:16:26.290
...and we now need
174

174

00:16:26.290  -->  00:16:30.090
to write this function and the functions
is just going to shuffle so what I'm going to do there is
175

175

00:16:30.090  -->  00:16:34.730
take that line out as well and call this
function so....
176

176

00:16:36.380  -->  00:16:39.460
even thought we haven't written it yet we're gonna go ahead
ad write that now so gonna come up to
177

177

00:16:39.460  -->  00:16:50.740
the last method up here and......
178

178

00:16:50.740  -->  00:16:56.630
...and that should stopped those errors from showing up
now we are calling the shuttle function
179

179

00:16:56.630  -->  00:17:01.690
and the command shuffle is now working alright
so let's run that and just make sure
180

180

00:17:01.690  -->  00:17:04.690
that it is working
181

181

00:17:06.270  -->  00:17:09.290
ok we now got a shuffle button so just click on shuffle
182

182

00:17:11.130  -->  00:17:15.060
we are not getting any indication that's working but it's
also not crashing which is good so let's
183

183

00:17:15.060  -->  00:17:20.660
have the dealer win but the dealer lost and that's probably
184

184

00:17:20.660  -->  00:17:23.450
something you can also look at changing
you notice what happened there is the
185

185

00:17:23.450  -->  00:17:28.660
dealer actually had 15 but I continue to
draw another card and that's because our
186

186

00:17:28.660  -->  00:17:34.200
code had the logic that while the score
was 17 or less well less than 17 its going
187

187

00:17:34.200  -->  00:17:37.700
to try and draw another card so  what it should
probably be doing is each time its drawing a
188

188

00:17:37.700  -->  00:17:41.090
card its also checking to see whether it's
one or not that will be another enhancement you
189

189

00:17:41.090  -->  00:17:51.720
can look at making to the game click on new game and click on dealer again 19 so the dealer won and click on shuffle on obviously I click on new game
190

190

00:17:51.720  -->  00:17:56.910
that's good that's all working nicely and perhaps one other final thing you could do is you
191

191

00:17:56.910  -->  00:18:02.210
could add a score how many games each
player's won and display the tally at the
192

192

00:18:02.210  -->  00:18:06.700
top of the screen so have a go at modifying the game or to add that functionality that
193

193

00:18:06.700  -->  00:18:11.600
will be a nice enhancement you can make and perhaps let us
know how you went about doing it and
194

194

00:18:11.600  -->  00:18:13.380
maybe even show us the code
195

195

00:18:13.380  -->  00:18:17.640
and also perhaps look at some other features
that feature that I just mentioned
196

196

00:18:17.640  -->  00:18:20.740
there with the dealer when its going
to draw a new cards it's already
197

197

00:18:20.740  -->  00:18:24.520
won it shouldn't be drawing another card as you saw do that because ultimately lost
198

198

00:18:24.520  -->  00:18:30.180
because it didn't check the status to see whether it won
and I'm gonna finish the video here
199

199

00:18:30.180  -->  00:18:33.780
now because its getting very long but their is one last
final mini challenge and that's what
200

200

00:18:33.780  -->  00:18:38.430
would be how would you change the
program to play the game with several
201

201

00:18:38.430  -->  00:18:41.910
packs of cards in other words just assuming your adding 2 or 3
202

202

00:18:41.910  -->  00:18:45.930
packs of cards and you got one deck that
contains two or three packs how would
203

203

00:18:45.930  -->  00:18:50.920
you actually do that so if you can figure
that out right now and pause the video and
204

204

00:18:50.920  -->  00:18:53.930
I'll come back to me when you come back
I'll show you quickly how to do that
205

205

00:18:53.930  -->  00:18:56.930
so pause the video now
206

206

00:18:57.650  -->  00:18:58.640
...ok so the
207

207

00:18:58.640  -->  00:19:04.520
solution to that the moment you can see
here on line 166 deck = list cards
208

208

00:19:04.520  -->  00:19:13.680
that's one deck of cards so we could simply
just put.....
209

209

00:19:13.680  -->  00:19:18.780
and effectively you've got three packs of
cards now that are being put into our
210

210

00:19:18.780  -->  00:19:20.050
overall deck
211

211

00:19:20.050  -->  00:19:23.180
and we're still calling the shuffle which
will go through quite happily shuffle
212

212

00:19:23.180  -->  00:19:30.440
that entire deck which now contains the
three packs as I mentioned and looking at that the game
213

213

00:19:30.440  -->  00:19:33.990
functions like it would before so
that's it I'm gonna finish the video
214

214

00:19:33.990  -->  00:19:40.000
here and we'll move on now to more in
the way of modules I'm gonna be talking about
215

215

00:19:40.000  -->  00:19:43.830
using your program itself as a module so
see you in the next video
