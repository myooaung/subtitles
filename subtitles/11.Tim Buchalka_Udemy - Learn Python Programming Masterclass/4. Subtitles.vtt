So are you having trouble understanding
me? There's two possible reasons why that

2

00:00:09.040  -->  00:00:12.100
might happen.
Firstly I'm a geek, and geeks talk

3

00:00:12.120  -->  00:00:15.960
fast about technology because we're
excited, in this case with, programming.

4

00:00:15.960  -->  00:00:20.660
But secondly, the other reason is because
I'm an Aussie, compared to a US or

5

00:00:20.660  -->  00:00:25.820
UK English, you might find the Aussie accent, well it does, the reality is it sounds a little bit different.

6

00:00:25.820  -->  00:00:28.800
Now the good news is that most students quickly get used to

7

00:00:28.800  -->  00:00:33.000
my voice and to my accent, and understand
it easily after a video or two,

8

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:37.400
but there are subtitles available if you
need them, and they can really help.

9

00:00:37.400  -->  00:00:41.960
Now the subtitles are hand edited, not machine
generated, in this course, and that means

10

00:00:41.969  -->  00:00:45.719
that they make a lot more sense than most
subtitles that perhaps you've seen in

11

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:49.400
other courses on udemy.  So here's
how to turn on the subtitles.

12

00:00:49.400  -->  00:00:55.220
You come down here, click, basically click and select
English and you're done. It's that easy, and from

13

00:00:55.220  -->  00:00:58.740
that point on, English subtitles will
actually be shown on the screen.

14

00:00:58.740  -->  00:01:03.220
Now keep in mind that only English subtitles are
hand edit unfortunately, and that's because

15

00:01:03.220  -->  00:01:08.040
it's incredibly expensive to get
subtitles hand edited in other languages.

16

00:01:08.060  -->  00:01:13.120
So non-English subtitles are machine
generated, and the English ones,

17

00:01:13.120  -->  00:01:15.920
well they're the ones that have been
hand edited and not machine generated

18

00:01:15.920  -->  00:01:18.480
and available for you.
Alright so that's it for this video.

19

00:01:18.480  -->  00:01:21.880
Let's move on now to the next one.
