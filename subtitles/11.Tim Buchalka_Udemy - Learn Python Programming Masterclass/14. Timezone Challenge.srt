00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:08,550
so in this video we are going to do a
challenge I'm gonna challenge you to
2

2

00:00:08,550  -->  00:00:13,660
complete a particular challenge for this
section of the course which is of course
3

3

00:00:13,660  -->  00:00:18,560
dealing with time zone and what I'm gonna
do is paste it in and talk about it
4

4

00:00:18,560  -->  00:00:22,430
and then get you to actually do the
challenge so first things first is create a
5

5

00:00:22,430  -->  00:00:27,530
new file here I got the same project
open as last time right click on that
6

6

00:00:27,530  -->  00:00:36,870
new Python file I'm gonna call it timechallenge
that is the timezone challenge going to paste the code in
7

7

00:00:36,870  -->  00:00:42,460
so let's go
through and discuss what the challenge
8

8

00:00:42,460  -->  00:00:48,990
is and essentially I'm asking you to create a
program that allows a user of your
9

9

00:00:48,990  -->  00:00:53,140
program to choose one of up to nine
different time zones from a menu you
10

10

00:00:53,140  -->  00:00:57,400
can choose any zone you want from the
all_timezones list that's going to be
11

11

00:00:57,400  -->  00:01:01,960
where you save the time zones for
this program and the program will then
12

12

00:01:01,960  -->  00:01:07,870
display the time in that time zone as
well as local time and UTC time entering
13

13

00:01:07,870  -->  00:01:12,090
0 choice from the menu will quit
the program so you want to display the dates and
14

14

00:01:12,090  -->  00:01:17,140
times in a format suitable for the user
of your program to understand and you should also
15

15

00:01:17,140  -->  00:01:21,850
include the timezone name when
displaying the chosen name so that's it
16

16

00:01:21,850  -->  00:01:27,280
that's the challenge so I suggest you do
now is go away and see if you can solve that and
17

17

00:01:27,280  -->  00:01:31,670
when you're ready to come back you can come
back and check our solution and take
18

18

00:01:31,670  -->  00:01:39,750
it from their so pause the video now and
I'll see you when you get back
19

19

00:01:39,750  -->  00:01:45,140
hopefully you managed to get this working or
have a good stab at it any way so lets go through now
20

20

00:01:45,140  -->  00:01:49,910
our implementation and see if its something
similar to what you came up with so
21

21

00:01:49,910  -->  00:01:56,950
first we need to do our 2 imports from modules which we have been doing....
22

22

00:01:56,950  -->  00:02:00,380
.....
23

23

00:02:00,380  -->  00:02:08,470
.....so next we need all the time
zones lists where we can choose where we can
24

24

00:02:08,470  -->  00:02:11,870
choose from up to nine times and so what
we're going to do is create that so....
25

25

00:02:11,870  -->  00:02:16,990
.....
26

26

00:02:16,990  -->  00:02:23,220
.....and I'm gonna start with one
that's gonna be the choice for the menu you don't
27

27

00:02:23,220  -->  00:02:27,380
have to strictly use these
that I come up with as long as you got
28

28

00:02:27,380  -->  00:02:43,550
separate ones......also get the spelling on these correct because
29

29

00:02:43,550  -->  00:02:55,750
if their wrong and they don't match the time zone
you get a problem....
30

30

00:02:55,750  -->  00:03:32,360
.....
31

31

00:03:32,360  -->  00:03:39,350
...so that's
32

32

00:03:39,350  -->  00:03:46,170
our available list of nine options so what
we want to do now is accept input from
33

33

00:03:46,170  -->  00:03:51,140
that and then start displaying it so
first things first lets print a message that
34

34

00:03:51,140  -->  00:03:59,920
people see on the screen so... which we mentioned was
35

35

00:03:59,920  -->  00:04:11,540
part of the instructions there.....
36

36

00:04:11,540  -->  00:04:14,630
.....
37

37

00:04:14,630  -->  00:04:21,330
......
38

38

00:04:21,330  -->  00:04:26,540
....the format began to include
the place which was obviously from the
39

39

00:04:26,540  -->  00:04:29,690
list and also available_zones....
40

40

00:04:29,690  -->  00:04:36,660
...so we are getting the number as well as the actual location so
41

41

00:04:36,660  -->  00:04:41,040
that's our loop to display them on the
screen and what we're doing now is
42

42

00:04:41,040  -->  00:04:46,480
work on the loop that accepts input from
the user and continues to loop until I press 0
43

43

00:04:46,480  -->  00:04:54,700
so put...so its going to continue
looping until I enter 0 to exit...
44

44

00:04:54,700  -->  00:05:01,940
.....
45

45

00:05:01,940  -->  00:05:07,660
....
46

46

00:05:07,660  -->  00:05:11,650
...so that's going to break out of the while loop and end the program but if
47

47

00:05:11,650  -->  00:05:15,910
we're not exited then what we need to do is we need
to look up and see whether the choice
48

48

00:05:15,910  -->  00:05:20,730
entered is in the keys so the way to do that is...
49

49

00:05:20,730  -->  00:05:26,640
.....so
in other words if the number 1 to 9 has that
50

50

00:05:26,640  -->  00:05:32,480
been entered if it isn't there we are gonna put....
51

51

00:05:32,480  -->  00:05:40,750
.....
52

52

00:05:40,750  -->  00:05:46,970
......
53

53

00:05:46,970  -->  00:05:58,950
.......
54

54

00:05:58,950  -->  00:06:21,320
.....
55

55

00:06:21,320  -->  00:06:29,980
....and we're going to format that to a proper
56

56

00:06:29,980  -->  00:06:34,840
time we talked about that on line 10 display dates and times in a format
57

57

00:06:34,840  -->  00:06:37,890
suitable for the uses of your program to
understand so we've done this before we are gonna do
58

58

00:06:37,890  -->  00:06:38,500
something similar
59

59

00:06:38,500  -->  00:06:41,590
we are....
60

60

00:06:41,590  -->  00:06:54,350
.....
61

61

00:06:54,350  -->  00:07:00,220
....
62

62

00:07:00,220  -->  00:07:10,220
.....so that's the first one
63

63

00:07:10,220  -->  00:07:16,280
we also want to print out local time so that's part of the
challenge as well to do that so lets go
64

64

00:07:16,280  -->  00:07:23,920
ahead and do that and it's going to be.....the local time is of course the local
65

65

00:07:23,920  -->  00:07:27,310
time in which ever time zone your
currently running this in for me its gonna
66

66

00:07:27,310  -->  00:07:32,300
Australian central
Daylight Time format and it's going to
67

67

00:07:32,300  -->  00:07:40,800
be..... we are going to use basically the same format very similar format
68

68

00:07:40,800  -->  00:07:46,980
and we are going to use...to get the current time but then
format the actual time so...
69

69

00:07:46,980  -->  00:07:49,390
.....
70

70

00:07:49,390  -->  00:07:56,990
....
71

71

00:07:56,990  -->  00:08:04,960
.....
72

72

00:08:04,960  -->  00:08:09,800
.....and the difference there is
we're going to use instead of now we're
73

73

00:08:09,800  -->  00:08:14,400
going to use UTC now to get the current
UTC time and everything should be the
74

74

00:08:14,400  -->  00:08:19,280
same and add one last final print to space it out a bit in the end and that should
75

75

00:08:19,280  -->  00:08:23,820
be it that should be all we need to do and I'll just delete the spaces and leave one space as per the standard
76

76

00:08:23,820  -->  00:08:29,600
Python way of doing things and now we've
done that we should find that we're good
77

77

00:08:29,600  -->  00:08:30,090
to go
78

78

00:08:30,090  -->  00:08:33,660
what would do first is try
running it right click and run time
79

79

00:08:33,660  -->  00:08:38,900
challenge you can see we've currently got
the menu showing please choose a time zones or 0
80

80

00:08:38,900  -->  00:08:44,590
to quit so type 0 to quit to make sure that works ok that work well
81

81

00:08:44,590  -->  00:08:50,350
as we expected to do all right so let's to
time zone that we know works lets do 3 for Australian
82

82

00:08:50,350  -->  00:08:54,680
Adelaide and we got an error on line 38 now
we just have a look at that error
83

83

00:08:54,680  -->  00:09:01,960
unknown time zone and the reason
that's unknown is up typed Australian
84

84

00:09:01,960  -->  00:09:06,510
instead of Adeliade how embarrassing my own timezone
so that should be
85

85

00:09:06,510  -->  00:09:10,120
Australia Adelaide remember earlier in
the challenge in this video I mentioned
86

86

00:09:10,120  -->  00:09:15,550
the need to not make any typos and of course
is another one on line 4 in my haste to
87

87

00:09:15,550  -->  00:09:20,080
try and dp this video and type of the
same time I seem to be failing at task
88

88

00:09:20,080  -->  00:09:23,830
need to make sure that you fixed the typos to have any chance of this working
89

89

00:09:23,830  -->  00:09:26,180
lets try it again number 3
90

90

00:09:26,180  -->  00:09:31,270
Australia / Adelaide this time and we actually
got something which is good and we have
91

91

00:09:31,270  -->  00:09:35,730
a look at our time wednesday at 1:40
which is converted to 1:49 their because you can see
92

92

00:09:35,730  -->  00:09:37,440
it was on 55 seconds
93

93

00:09:37,440  -->  00:09:42,990
UTC time is second of the third sixty
you can see the format we used and noticed
94

94

00:09:42,990  -->  00:09:50,980
before when I look at the code we did the %z for the first line and
95

95

00:09:50,980  -->  00:09:54,440
then we can see that by doing that we
added the time zone information the
96

96

00:09:54,440  -->  00:09:57,710
extra information that's appearing on
this first line the others lines have also
97

97

00:09:57,710  -->  00:10:03,300
got the current day and then the date month and year and time but we also added
98

98

00:10:03,300  -->  00:10:07,740
timezone and that's what the other entry was so that's working ok so lets try a couple
99

99

00:10:07,740  -->  00:10:14,800
of others to make sure we don't got any problems here 1 the time in
Africa Tunis is Wednesday 4:19 a.m.
100

100

00:10:14,800  -->  00:10:26,900
CET so if we actually do a search for current
time we put current time 4:19 am and its
101

101

00:10:26,900  -->  00:10:33,210
GMT +1 time in Tunisia which should be
correct obviously and you can see where
102

102

00:10:33,210  -->  00:10:36,630
+1 there is as well so its definitely
working and just try another
103

103

00:10:36,630  -->  00:10:43,810
one lets just try 6 Japan current time
in japan is 12:20 and +9 which is JST current time Japan
104

104

00:10:43,810  -->  00:10:55,240
...you can see currently the time is 12:20 JST time and if you go back and have a
105

105

00:10:55,240  -->  00:11:04,520
look again 12:20 so that is all working and what the heck of it lets try another Hawaii current time -10 HST
106

106

00:11:04,520  -->  00:11:07,040
so you can see obviously the time zones are
working nicely
107

107

00:11:07,040  -->  00:11:12,630
lets check that current time Hawaii
108

108

00:11:12,630  -->  00:11:21,520

109
5:20 p.m. 2nd of February HST 17:20 which is 5:20 p.m. so that's it that's
109

110

00:11:21,520  -->  00:11:25,670
actually the solution that's the
challenge done and dusted so I hope you
110

111

00:11:25,670  -->  00:11:30,800
got a lot out of that so we are now done
with time time zones dates etc
111

112

00:11:30,800  -->  00:11:34,240
in the next lecture what we're going to
do is we're going to take a little bit of a side ways
112

113

00:11:34,240  -->  00:11:39,400
trip what we gonna do is start
looking or have a brief look at tk enter
113

114

00:11:39,400  -->  00:11:43,540
this is the tk  widget tool from Python which
allows GUI programs to be created
114

115

00:11:43,540  -->  00:11:47,120
so it's not going to be like a huge sort
of section on this but it's going to give you
115

116

00:11:47,120  -->  00:11:51,400
an idea on how to start looking at
GUI interfaces so will start looking
116

117

00:11:51,400  -->  00:11:52,930
at doing that in the next video
