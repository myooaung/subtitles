00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Narrator] Before starting this course,

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.001
let's explore what skills and knowledge you will need.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.000
This course is targeted at intermediate

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.009
and advanced developers.

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.003
In order to truly be successful in this course,

6
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.009
you should have experienced with Java

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.006
and a solid understanding of Spring framework

8
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:20.009
and Spring Boot.

9
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.007
It'll also be helpful to have some exposure

10
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.002
to functional programming, and streams and lambdas

11
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.006
that were introduced with Java 8.

12
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:34.002
Previous experience with JUnit testing is nice to have,

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:38.004
but since we will be doing hands on exercises from scratch,

14
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.001
you will quickly pick up the essentials.

15
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.009
Our focus will be on the latest versions

16
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.000
of Java 15 and Spring Boot,

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
current 2.4 with supporting APIs.

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.002
Throughout this course, we will be using IntelliJ IDE,

19
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:59.000
but any Java IDE is sufficient with this course.
