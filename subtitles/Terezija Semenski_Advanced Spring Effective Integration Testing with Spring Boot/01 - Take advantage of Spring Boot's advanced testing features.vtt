- [Terezija] Writing and running tests

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.008
are essential parts of delivering reliable software,

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:09.003
but we don't always test as efficiently as we can.

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.006
Guess what?

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.004
We can do better.

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.002
This course will get you up to speed

7
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:19.004
on how to take advantage of Spring Boot's testing features

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.006
by mocking external systems,

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:26.001
using test slices, and supporting fluent APIs

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:31.006
to write fluent, precise, and performant integration tests.

11
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.008
We will deep dive into some tricky

12
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.000
real world testing scenarios

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.002
that have baffled us in the past,

14
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:42.009
such as data-based queries, caching, web layers,

15
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.003
and testing in microservice environments.

16
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.002
Hi, I'm Terezija Semenski.

17
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.000
I've been a software developer in Java and Spring

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.005
for over a decade.

19
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.009
The best way to learn integration testing

20
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.000
is to jump right in, so let's get started.
