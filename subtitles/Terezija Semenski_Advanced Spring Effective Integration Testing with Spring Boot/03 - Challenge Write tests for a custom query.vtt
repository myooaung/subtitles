00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.008
(soft music)

2
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.000
- [Instructor] So far, we haven't

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.006
really introduced any customizations.

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.000
And there is a very little risk involved

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.003
that we have introduced bugs in our application.

6
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:17.001
In this challenge,

7
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.006
we want you to create a custom query

8
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:24.001
that is able to fetch average grades for active students.

9
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.001
First, you should extend the student class

10
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.005
with new attributes boolean active and int grade.

11
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.002
Grade can be anything between zero and 100.

12
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.000
Next you'll write a failing test

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.002
by pre-existing a couple of students

14
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.000
and verifying average grade.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.005
And finally write an implementation for a custom query.

16
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:51.000
This challenge should take about 5 to 10 minutes.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.009
When you're done, or if you get stuck,

18
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.004
you can check out my solution widow

19
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.000
to see how I solved the challenge.
