00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.280
After looking at the AWS offerings,

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.290
AWS Systems Manager looked like the best fit to replace those

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.540
management suites that Globomantics has on premises.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.000
So why don't we just look at what Systems Manager actually is.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.070
AWS Systems Manager consists of many different

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.040
components that, in one way or another,

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.900
we will be touching on throughout the course.

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.470
Systems Manager automation, really at a very high level,

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.320
enables you to execute very common maintenance and

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.240
deployment tasks to AWS resources.

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.250
For example,

12
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.940
you can configure and manage specific AWS resources like EC2 virtual machines,

13
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.440
or you create custom workflows to create new AWS virtual machine images,

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.640
your golden image if you will.

15
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.230
Another example could be to respond to AWS events and,

16
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.540
for example, patch virtual machines, shut virtual machines down,

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.940
or execute other tasks, like sending messages to a chat system.

18
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.440
Another major component of Systems Manager is called run command. It

19
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.730
enables you to securely execute commands against AWS EC2 virtual

20
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.990
machines and even on‑premises virtual machines.

21
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.880
These commands could be commands to install an application, to update

22
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.730
Windows, to change a user's password, or to even create a user.

23
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.240
Really, imagination is your limit here.

24
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.690
Patch Manager, as the name suggests,

25
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.440
is there to potentially replace your on‑premises patch management system.

26
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.070
It applies security hotfixes or other application updates to VMs following

27
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.320
custom classification and categorization of updates while also, obviously,

28
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.610
following your defined maintenance windows. We all know that maintaining

29
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.830
secrets and other values that we need to use during deployments or

30
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.340
automation is really difficult.

31
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.840
Hard‑coded passwords are still a very common occurrence.

32
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.640
Systems Manager Parameter Store makes this a lot easier.

33
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.670
Parameter Store is a secured AWS managed service that is

34
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.140
integrated into pretty much all other services.

35
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.720
You can put secrets into the service and programmatically

36
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.240
retrieve the secrets whenever you need them again.

37
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.340
These secrets can be database connection strings,

38
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.240
user passwords, certificate keys, or any other strings.

39
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.040
Maybe you're an operations engineer, IT professional, or systems engineer.

40
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.400
You will need something like OpsCenter,

41
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.350
a central location where you can view and investigate work items that

42
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.140
relate to something happening in your AWS environment.

43
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.720
It aggregates and standardizes operational items like alerts and

44
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.460
other events across your environment to provide you a single

45
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.540
location during the investigation of any issue.

46
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.850
It's designed to reduce the mean time to resolution for

47
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.340
any issues impacting AWS services.

48
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.940
And last, but not least, we will then also look at Session Manager.

49
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.310
It allows you to securely connect to a terminal on your

50
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.610
virtual machines without, I repeat without, exposing these

51
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:10.000
virtual machines out to the internet. Jump boxes and bastion hosts are a thing of the past.
