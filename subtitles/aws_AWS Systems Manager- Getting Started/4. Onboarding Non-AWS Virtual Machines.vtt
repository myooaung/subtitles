00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.040
Now that we have seen how to onboard in AWS EC2,

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.940
next we need to look at onboarding non‑AWS virtual machines.

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.260
This could be a virtual machine in your datacenter,

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.750
a desktop PC or virtual machines on other cloud providers like Azure or GCP.

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.080
No matter where they are, we need to do these things here.

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.040
First of all,

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.510
we need to create a Systems Manager activation key and code to be used

8
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.700
for onboarding during installation of the SSM Agent.

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.740
We also need to create a custom IAM role.

10
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.020
This IAM role is then used to communicate with Systems

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.210
Manager on behalf of that virtual machine,

12
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.850
similar to the role we created in the previous demo.

13
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.940
It's also very likely that the non‑AWS VM will not have the SSM Agent installed,

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.140
so we will need to take care of that as well.

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.170
So let's jump into our next demo where we're going to have a look at

16
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.840
onboarding a non‑AWS virtual machine to Systems Manager.

17
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.990
We're back in the Systems Manager console,

18
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.230
and the first thing we need to do, as I mentioned,

19
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.240
is to create an activation.

20
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.840
Activations are created in the Hybrid Activations tab.

21
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.040
In here, we can create an activation,

22
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.340
and we're also able to see already existing activations.

23
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.660
Let's create a new one.

24
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.640
Click on Create an Activation, and here we can provide a description for it.

25
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.970
We also need to specify how many virtual machines we want to allow

26
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.230
this one activation to onboard to Systems Manager.

27
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.260
The default is one, and for now we only need one VM,

28
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.360
so we'll just leave it at that.

29
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.320
Next thing, I did mention we will also require a new IAM role for these hybrid,

30
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.140
non‑AWS virtual machines.

31
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.740
Systems Manager gives us two options.

32
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.140
We can either have it create in new role with the correct policies for us,

33
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.240
or if there's already a role deployed that has the correct permissions,

34
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.740
we can select that existing custom role.

35
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.930
We can also apply an expiration date to this activation, and we can

36
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.040
apply a default name to the instances. As an example,

37
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.530
we can call it globomanticslinux because in our case now we're

38
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.890
going to activate a Linux virtual machine next. We create the

39
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.300
activation, and once it's created,

40
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.490
it's important to not click too quickly because up here in that

41
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.580
green banner we can now see the activation code and the

42
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.120
activation ID. These two values are only,

43
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.140
I repeat, only available to you at this point in time.

44
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.180
If you close this tab,

45
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.440
you have to go and create a new activation to get a new activation code.

46
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.240
So we'll just leave it as it is and head over to our terminal

47
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.590
where we have already SSH'd into an existing Linux virtual

48
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.080
machine that's not on AWS. So here we've already got a script

49
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.610
present to install the SSM Agent.

50
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.660
This script will also be available in the exercise files,

51
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.140
but we can take a quick look at it.

52
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.440
It's fairly straightforward.

53
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.720
Download the agent, unzip it, and go through the installation. Part

54
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.070
of the installation is also the registration for which we have to

55
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.500
provide the installer with the activation code, ID, and the region

56
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.240
that we want this to happen in.

57
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.640
Let's close out of here and execute the script.

58
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.350
We copy and paste the required parameters in. First, the activation code. Next,

59
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.600
the activation ID.

60
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.240
And lastly, the region we're deploying into.

61
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.100
We're using Sydney, as mentioned before, and the AWS region

62
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.380
name for it is ap‑southeast‑2. Executing this,

63
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.260
we see the script output as expected,

64
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.640
that it only takes a couple of seconds, and we can see it's already installing

65
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:50.510
and registering the agent. And yep, it's already registered as it says, and we

66
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.640
can now head back to the Systems Manager console.

67
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.580
Click on the activation, and we can see that the registered instances

68
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.850
count is now increased to 1. Browsing down back to the Managed Instances

69
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.090
we've already seen in the previous demo, we can actually now see the

70
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.030
managed instance, the name we've provided and the activation, and clicking

71
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:23.050
on it, it's showing the same information as our AWS EC2. Congratulations!

72
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.000
We have just successfully registered a non‑AWS virtual machine to Systems Manager.
