00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,230
In this demo,

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,640
we will learn about the process to enable Systems

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,240
Manager OpsCenter on our AWS account.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,570
Back in the Systems Manager console,

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,600
we first navigate to OpsCenter and see that there really isn't too much

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,380
to see right now as we haven't enabled OpsCenter yet.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,360
For this to happen, we click on Get Started and,

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:35,470
interestingly enough, we now find ourselves in the Explorer and OpsCenter setup.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:41,740
AWS created an integrated setup experience for these two

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,200
services that makes it easier to get started.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,250
In this integrated setup, two things will happen.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,040
OpsCenter requires IAM roles or permissions to do its job,

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,120
which is essentially to interact with other

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,240
services and aggregate data from them.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,340
That's what the first role here is for.

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,640
And then we need another role, which is used by CloudWatch to create OpsItems.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,110
We can see what the IAM role permission and trust policy will look like.

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,790
There's no way to not have these roles created.

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,790
But later on we will see that we can always use other

20
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,040
roles that might fit our use case better.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,620
The other thing that will happen is that the setup process

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,360
allows us to have default rules created that,

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,470
if triggered, automatically create OpsItems.

24
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,850
These rules are going to be CloudWatch event on AWS Config rules and are

25
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,830
really a collection of commonly used rules. This collection of default rules

26
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,250
changes over time and can be viewed in the Systems Manager User Guide. We

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,280
want to have those default rules created,

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,240
so we keep the box ticked.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,200
One click on Enable OpsCenter here and we are

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,680
forwarded to the OpsCenter summary page.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,740
This means the integrated setup experience is done now.

32
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,300
So let's have a look at the IAM roles by first browsing to

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,440
IAM and then clicking here on Roles.

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,370
We can see the two roles that were created by the setup

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,070
experience. If we wanted to, this would be opportunity to

36
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:38,000
make changes to any of those roles. But for now, the builtâ€‘in permissions will be sufficient.
