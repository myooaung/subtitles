00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.340
In this module, we were introduced to Systems Manager OpsCenter,

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.410
which, as the name suggests,

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.360
is a great place for operations teams as it provides a

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.080
single pane of glass into our environments.

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.480
Anything happens, and a CloudWatch event rule gets triggered that creates an

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.600
OpsItem that an administrator can respond to. By providing deep insights into

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.840
the state of the environment when an event happened,

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.860
the Mean Time To Resolution is reduced. Administrators are able to

9
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.480
see everything that was going on in one place.

10
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.340
You can even go back to automatically finding similar

11
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.530
events and learn how they were resolved,

12
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.620
including leveraging Systems Manager Automation

13
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.040
runbooks to resolve issues automatically.

14
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.030
Congratulations! This is also the final module of this

15
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.940
course, AWS Systems Manager: Getting Started.

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.460
So let's take a quick look at what we at Globomantics covered. As a

17
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.410
reminder, Globomantics set out to learn about the Systems Manager suite

18
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.420
and how a fully managed service like this can help us operate our cloud

19
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.080
environment but also our on‑premises suite. We demonstrated that Systems

20
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.640
Manager's total cost of ownership is fairly low compared to other

21
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.710
third‑party solutions.

22
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.140
It doesn't require us to deploy any infrastructure to achieve any

23
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
of these outcomes we covered in this course,

24
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.860
which where run command and automation to centrally

25
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.040
manage tasks like software installation,

26
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.290
service restarts, or creation of new EC2 Amazon machine images, patch management

27
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.700
to keep our service up to date, Parameter Store to secure secrets and manage

28
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.210
parameters for runbook executions, like run command or automation, Session

29
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.970
Manager to securely remote into our Systems Manager managed instances in the

30
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.990
cloud or on‑premises, and, lastly, in this module, OpsCenter as the single pane

31
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.710
of glass for our operations team. I thank you for tuning in and learning about

32
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.000
AWS Systems Manager with me and wish you a lot of fun exploring this service further.
