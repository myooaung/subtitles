00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,860
All right,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,270
that was quite a lot, so let's do a quick recap of this

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,840
module and see what we have achieved.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,540
We got an overview of the Patch Manager service and the

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,340
patching process itself and saw that the SSM Agent is yet

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,440
again an integral part of it.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,540
We then saw the steps involved in applying patches to VMs and EC2

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,280
instances by creating custom patch baselines,

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,040
patch groups, and maintenance windows.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,240
Stay tuned for the next module,

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:45,000
where we will cover eight of these Run Commands and how they can be used to install software across your fleet.
