00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.680
In this module, we introduced Systems Manager Session Manager,

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.540
how it works, and what it can be used for.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.940
We also covered the issues with remote access scenarios in

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.780
general and why a managed service like Session Manager is a

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.240
great tool to have access to.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.110
Lastly,

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.510
we then put the service to the test and learned how simple it

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.140
is to connect to our managed instances.

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.000
I will see you in the next module where we will cover a topic that many struggle with, secrets management.
