1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,650
We now know how to create and inspect parameters from the command

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:11,190
line on the console and why it is certainly already very powerful

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,440
to be able to get them from PowerShell.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,000
It's also good to understand how Parameter Store integrates with other AWS

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,550
services. Out of the box, there's native integration to the EC2 service, ECS,

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,990
the Container Service, Lambda, CloudFormation,

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,140
the Code Suite, and, of course, the other Systems Manager services.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,740
How? Simple, by referencing the parameter by its key name

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,040
and optionally the parameters version.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,670
No need for hard coding values into scripts or using complicated helper

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,230
scripts to get secrets out of secret managers and worrying about keeping them

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,450
safe at the same time. For unencrypted parameters,

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,530
that's all we need to do. For encrypted parameters,

14
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,000
there's usually a bit of coding involved, but not much, as we will see in the next demo.
