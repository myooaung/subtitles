00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.440
Introduction to Systems Manager Session Manager.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.240
That's quite a mouthful indeed. Besides a tongue twister,

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.510
what can we use it for? Its main use case is to allow us to remotely and

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.940
securely connect to our Systems Manager managed instances.

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.450
How? By providing us with a browser‑based shell and

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.100
CLI on both Windows and Linux. Yes, command line only.

7
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.080
No matter which operating system you connect to, it's the same experience.

8
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.540
And really, what more do you need than a fully functioning command line?

9
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.240
What's so great about it? Well, we don't need a public IP on our instances.

10
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.540
All communication happens on the AWS Fabric,

11
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.160
which means that we can connect to instances and private

12
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.390
subnets completely shut off from the outside world, or even

13
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.900
on‑premises or on other clouds.

14
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.600
Every command we execute while logged into an instance can be centrally

15
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.980
logged to an S3 storage packet or to a CloudWatch log. Session Manager also

16
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.820
supports port forwarding for more advanced scenarios.

17
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.640
As an example, remember when Session Manager only gives us a command line?

18
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.430
Well,

19
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.420
what if in a rare instance we do need to do something via a UI on a

20
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.540
Windows server? We can use port forwarding to tunnel our RDP connection

21
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.420
via the Session Manager service and then get a full RDP session to our

22
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.800
private instance. Definitely worth checking out after we have covered the

23
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.740
basics here in this course. Session Manager comes at no cost for AWS

24
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.000
instances. However, for non‑AWS instances,

25
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.630
the advanced instances pricing tier is required and needs to

26
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.490
be enabled per account and per region.

27
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.760
The cost is fairly minimal, but definitely important to call out. Per

28
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.270
advanced instance, so that's every non‑AWS managed instance in your account

29
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:41.410
and region, AWS will charge us $.00695 US per hour. As an example, if we

30
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.240
had 100 on‑premises instances in a month,

31
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.940
we would have to pay roughly $507 US.

32
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.440
Why is remote access even a problem to solve? Aren't there are already

33
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.470
hundreds of established patterns around? Yes, and all of them are trying

34
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.820
to solve the problem of securely exposing RDP and SSH to the outside world

35
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.590
through bastion hosts or jump boxes and RDS gateways, and everybody

36
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.040
understands that this is a fairly difficult and definitely not a low

37
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.940
effort task to get right.

38
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.100
This is literally why cloud providers like AWS go and

39
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.740
offer a managed service for it.

40
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.920
It's super important to audit who connects to our instances from where,

41
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.180
when, and what do they do.

42
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.030
This can be very difficult depending on the operating system and

43
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.540
the manner in which users access the machines.

44
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.940
Lastly, as mentioned,

45
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.840
there are so many different patterns, often different depending on the

46
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.720
use case even, like which operating system needs to be accessed, if a

47
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.010
user is coming from the internet or VPN,

48
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.640
etc.

49
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.780
It's difficult to select the right pattern,

50
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.690
deploy that pattern, and then maintain that pattern.

51
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.350
It's almost a no‑brainer to select a managed service that

52
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:24.000
offers the same or similar experience, especially if it comes at the Session Manager's price tag.
