Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.850
My name is David O'Brien, and welcome to my course, AWS

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.920
Systems Manager: Getting Started.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.420
I am a cloud architect,

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.700
certified trainer, and director and founder of a cloud

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.340
consulting company called XIRUS.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.330
I've been working in and around the major cloud providers almost since

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.320
their inception and have been enjoying teaching and enabling many

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.560
companies and individuals for the last 10 years.

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.340
AWS Systems Manager is still a bit of an underdog in the toolbox that is AWS,

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.410
but consists of a variety of very powerful services that cover many

12
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.620
areas of concern for a lot of companies. In this course,

13
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.770
we're going to introduce the AWS Systems Manager suite and how it can support

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.300
operations and development teams to be more productive on AWS.

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.850
Some of the major topics that we will cover include overview of

16
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.160
the most commonly used Systems Manager services, onboarding

17
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.110
workloads to each of these services,

18
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.910
solving day‑to‑day problems with AWS Systems Manager, and integrating

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.190
different Systems Manager services with each other.

20
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.650
By the end of this course,

21
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.110
you will know how to get started with the AWS Systems Manager suite and

22
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.270
be ready to onboard your first workload to it and reduce your own

23
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.780
workload by automating some of it through Systems Manager. Before

24
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.250
beginning the course, you should already be familiar with some of the

25
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.760
fundamental cloud concepts and, more specifically,

26
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.880
the AWS concepts like the EC2 and IAM services.

27
00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:06.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn AWS Systems Manager with the AWS Systems Manager: Getting Started course at Pluralsight.
