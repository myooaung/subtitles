1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,830
So why not apply some of the basic practices of Lean and Agile

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,080
to the requirements development process?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,340
So, adopt Lean. Adopt techniques that streamline your work,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,080
that is, eliminate waste.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,920
So ask yourself, are your processes streamlined?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,510
Can you make some improvements?

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,880
Well, if so, make them.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,180
Apply some features of Agile.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,630
They will work great, not just in software development, certainly.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,940
And here are a few that might give you the most bang for the buck.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,230
First, standups are essential.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,240
Maybe have daily standups with your team of analysts and another standup

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,540
weekly so you can report progress to your stakeholders.

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,250
Define a backlog and perform iteration planning and iterations.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,900
Set up your backlog, that is,

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,980
what are the basic tasks I must do to accomplish my task or project?

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,340
Even if you are doing this alone, doesn't matter; define your backlog.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,550
Now,

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,050
pull forward into an iteration of a week or two what items you

20
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,840
think you can accomplish and start working on them.

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,790
Working in an iterative fashion is lean and is smart.

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,990
Readjust at the end of each iteration,

23
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,890
and readjust your backlog based on the feedback you get

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,780
daily from your standups with your teammates and weekly

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,440
standups with your stakeholders.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,700
Employ the appropriate LOE,

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,820
or level of effort, for documentation and artifacts per

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,040
activity or project you are working on.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,370
You will leverage your artifact repository for your templates,

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,350
examples of past projects, tools, knowledge base,

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,180
etc.

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,530
You will draw upon your repository to employ and use just

33
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,080
the right amount of material and tools to minimize any

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,710
waste and maximize your output.

35
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,570
Now let me walk you through an example of setting up a simple

36
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,240
backlog and laying out your iterations.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,560
Here is an example of creating your backlog for your analysis task.

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,070
Let's say your task is to determine if the purchase of

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,460
accessories in the vehicle order system is worthwhile.

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,980
That is the assignment you've been given by your manager.

41
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,970
Here is my backlog of all the tasks I need to get done.

42
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,640
I need to interview the sponsors, determine business drivers,

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,340
determine return on investment or any benefits,

44
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,590
determine existing systems effected,

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,470
maybe view a demo of the existing system or systems,

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,150
analyze the ordering workflow, understand just what accessories really means,

47
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,920
set up and conduct daily and weekly standups,

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,300
develop and deliver my findings in a presentation.

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,140
Now that we have itemized that, let's move on to the next step.

50
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,170
Let's define our iterations in the Agile analysis process.

51
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,140
Okay, here is our backlog from the previous slide,

52
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,050
and I have numbered each one for reference.

53
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,470
I decided that I would lay out three one‑week iterations as follows.

54
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,270
Here are the tasks that I or my team plan to do in iteration 1,

55
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,350
here are the tasks for iteration 2,

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,340
and here are the tasks I plan to work on for iteration 3.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,090
Now, here is my analysis Agile process I will use to run my assignment.

58
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,800
So first, I'll conduct daily standups with the analysis team,

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,040
review backlog and iteration assignments,

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,610
make any changes as necessary, conduct weekly standups with sponsors,

61
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,420
provide incremental progress and findings to sponsors

62
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,200
and solicit feedback and guidance,

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,540
remember we always like really short feedback cycles,

64
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,930
adjust backlog and iterations based on the feedback.

65
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,540
I mean, how simple is this?

66
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,810
Let's leverage the basics of Agile and apply it to how

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,080
we conduct our analysis activities.

68
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,140
Now feel free to modify and improve this in any way that works for you.

69
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,570
The approach builds trust with your sponsors and team and

70
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,540
will provide artifacts that you can show and prove to others

71
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,340
that you have your act together.

72
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,900
I would recommend running your analysis activities as described.

73
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,940
It is even more important to follow an approach like this if you have a team.

74
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,960
Use a repository of backlog templates.

75
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,550
Here's what I mean by that.

76
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,990
In our example, I showed you a backlog.

77
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,600
Keep that backlog with its list of tasks around as a template

78
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,110
for future assignments of a similar nature.

79
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,450
Determine the type of analysis you've been assigned,

80
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,410
say a high‑level strategic, or multi‑system,

81
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,640
or single system.

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,140
Now, over time you will figure out your general types of analysis work.

83
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,470
Maybe you can categorize the backlog templates into three to six categories.

84
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,730
You don't want too many.

85
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,530
I think three templates, one for each business context, would be just fine.

86
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,540
Next, select your backlog template.

87
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,230
This has the list of tasks that are required for this analysis type,

88
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,420
premade and ready to go.

89
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,430
Before you start,

90
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,940
remove any items you know you won't need and add any that you think are missing.

91
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,140
When your analysis activity is complete,

92
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,780
update the backlog template as needed,

93
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,590
or maybe even create a new backlog template for a new analysis type.

94
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,460
Also when complete, update your analysis Agile process template, if required.

95
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,670
I have five process items on the previous slide. Maybe you need to add some.

96
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,270
Or you could take this to the next level and have an analysis Agile

97
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,450
process that is paired with each backlog template.

98
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,870
I like that even better.

99
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,000
Always remember, at the end of every activity you do,

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,090
you want to reflect upon and capture your lessons learned back

101
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,640
into your framework process of artifacts.

102
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,440
Pure analysis iterations, you know, like the ones we just discussed,

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,340
well, your outcome or deliverables could be recommendations,

104
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,840
options, reports, business cases, and the like.

105
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,600
You are following your own independent iteration schedule.

106
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,300
Another form of engagement could be where you are doing the

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,150
analysis iterations, and your outcome are backlog items to be

108
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,130
given to the Agile development team.

109
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,290
You have partnered with your product owner,

110
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,710
helping them articulate the business requirements,

111
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,220
and at the end of your two‑week sprints there are new backlog items.

112
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,200
They in turn are given to, and consumed by,

113
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,740
the Agile development team and worked in their next iteration.

114
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,030
You then start on your next iteration doing more

115
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,040
analysis and developing new backlog items.

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,990
I have used this approach a few times. Basically, it

117
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,370
is just‑in time backlog items.

118
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,070
This approach worked well when the project had to start immediately,

119
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,580
yet there really wasn't a backlog ready yet.

120
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,060
Hence, we broke the work up into two Agile teams,

121
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,000
one focused on analysis and delivering backlog items and one

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,240
team focused on developing the software.

123
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,150
In this case,

124
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,500
your iteration schedule was in sync with the development iteration schedule.

125
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,340
Next, you, the analyst, are part of the Agile development team itself.

126
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,160
Maybe you are taking fuzzier backlog items and refining them into user stories.

127
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,740
Here, there is only one iteration schedule,

128
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,740
and it's the schedule of the Agile development team.

129
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,730
In all of these, you want to be using analysis templates,

130
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:52,000
best practices tools, frameworks, etc. to optimize your work and reduce waste.
