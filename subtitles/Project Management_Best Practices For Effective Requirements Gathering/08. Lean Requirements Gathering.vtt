00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.240
Now let's talk about Lean requirements gathering.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.430
Lean is a set of techniques to identify and eliminate

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.710
waste from the work that you do.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.900
Lean systems focus on the process improvement that

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.340
eliminates waste and improves workflow.

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.920
You are not Lean, that is,

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.470
a system is not considered Lean unless the process that has followed is

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.250
dedicated and focused on eliminating waste and improving workflow,

9
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.110
that's Kanban.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:39.820
Kanban is a framework to allow you to create context‑specific process solutions.

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.260
Kanban does not follow a rigid software development lifecycle process,

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.230
such as the models we have discussed.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.650
and that's including Scrum.

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.910
I think Scrum is great, but it is rather rigid.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.130
Kanban is flexible and context‑specific,

16
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.580
and is even more adaptable than Scrum,

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.740
and that is why I want to share it with you the next few slides.

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.050
So just what is Kanban?

19
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.510
Well Kanban is a method to manage workflow.

20
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.300
Now that is the most basic, simple definition.

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.900
If your teams' practices are a series of steps,

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.910
your workflow, then Kanban may be for you.

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.070
If you want to learn a little more on Kanban,

24
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.380
please check out my two Kanban courses on Pluralsight.

25
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.740
Now, in the next couple slides, I'll take you through a very simple card wall,

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.110
so I really won't be doing Kanban much justice at all,

27
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.740
I just want to give you a quick, quick overview.

28
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.640
Let me show you a quick and simple Kanban card wall or board example,

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.920
and I stress simple.

30
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.220
There is so much more to a true Kanban board system,

31
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.940
but just to be sure we're on the same page,

32
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.940
here's an example.

33
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.840
Also, what I really like about Kanban is that is very visual,

34
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.080
easy to understand, and extremely flexible.

35
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.990
So, here's our grid with three columns.

36
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.590
This is the to do column, or demand, things we pull from to work on.

37
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910
This is the doing column, or work in progress column,

38
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.270
and our done column, or completed item column,

39
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.800
items ready for delivery to our customers.

40
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.010
Now, here are a whole bunch of to do or demand items.

41
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.930
Each card represents a single work item.

42
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.040
For example, it could be a user story.

43
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.380
Here are our work in progress cards.

44
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.720
So we pulled three work items,

45
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.360
and now we are working on them in the doing column,

46
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.380
and now say, on the next day, during our standup,

47
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.840
we move two items to the done column,

48
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.440
and move one more from the doing into the work in progress column.

49
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.240
Any of these items can be any kind of work, such as an analyst test as well.

50
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.260
This, of course, is a very simplistic example, but you get the idea.

51
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.440
Please note, a card wall does not equate to doing full‑fledged Kanban,

52
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.510
there is so much more to it.

53
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.760
Now, believe it or not, on my pantry cupboard door,

54
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.910
I have a personal Kanban board of all my tasks and

55
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.440
to dos I have around my house.

56
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.510
Yes, I'm a bit crazy about Kanban,

57
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.840
so check out my two Kanban courses if you really want to be crazy like me.

58
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.540
Here are the core Kanban properties that all good Kanban systems must embody.

59
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.340
Visualize your workflow.

60
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.020
They kind of call the workflow the value stream as well,

61
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.160
so visualize your workflow with a Kanban board like in my examples,

62
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.640
and they can be very annotated to convey a ton of information easily.

63
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.380
My examples were quite simple.

64
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.100
They can be quite annotated and complex,

65
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.560
but still tell you a lot about the process and what's going on.

66
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.280
A Kanban limits the work in progress by each resource is working on one,

67
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.910
and only one, work item at a time.

68
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.750
Think about that.

69
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.340
When was the last time you worked on only one thing at a time?

70
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.770
The point being is that it has been proven that people are more

71
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.140
productive working on only one thing at a time.

72
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.850
You can easily measure and manage the workflow,

73
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.990
which will help you predict your work outcomes.

74
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.540
Kanban boards are fully automated today,

75
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.910
so it's very easy to find bottlenecks and blockers and correct them.

76
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.940
A Kanban system is a process,

77
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.710
and you can make process policies explicit on the board itself.

78
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.710
This will relate to the completion criteria for each step in your value stream.

79
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.640
They're also known as done rules.

80
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.960
My step isn't done until I satisfy the done rules,

81
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.730
and then the next resource downstream can pull the work forward.

82
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.810
Also using planning models and charts,

83
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.470
these will help you recognize improvement opportunities

84
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.020
that further enhance your value stream, and by further enhance,

85
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.940
I mean to get rid of any waste and streamline it.

86
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.530
Of the five properties on the previous slide,

87
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.290
I have chosen what I think is the most important to talk about further,

88
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.990
so let's explore how Kanban limits work.

89
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.320
This is one of the main foundational elements of

90
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.220
Kanban, limiting work in progress.

91
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.840
A resource or person works on only one work item at a time, no exceptions.

92
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.290
Wouldn't you just love to do that?

93
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.630
I know most probably work on several things at once,

94
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.670
usually at the expense of quality.

95
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.510
A resource pulls or takes new work from the done buffer.

96
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.970
That's the work that was completed on the step just ahead of you, and

97
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.660
only when they have completed their current work item,

98
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.050
and only when the resource upstream has satisfied the

99
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.010
completion criteria or the done items, that builds

100
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.020
quality right into the process flow.

101
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.550
And lastly, the maximum number of work items is set for each workflow step,

102
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.740
and it is set by the number of available resources. If

103
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.430
there are two resources in a step,

104
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.450
then the maximum number of concurrent work items is two. This

105
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.840
is also known as capacity for that step.

106
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.000
So this is the definition of limiting work in progress. It's very simple and easy to understand.
