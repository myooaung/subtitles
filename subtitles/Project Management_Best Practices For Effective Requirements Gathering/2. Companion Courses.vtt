00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.150

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.360
augment your requirements development skills and capabilities.

All of these will help you be a better business analyst.

Everything we talked about in this entire course has an

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.440
underpinning and requirement for strong and dynamic

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.550
leadership and communication skills.

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.930
So check out the course,

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.160
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

You won't regret it.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.010
The course Developing Effective Agile Sprint Plans will give you

11
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.260
insight into agile and sprint planning that you need to help you

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.420
better partner with your agile teams.

13
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.310
In addition,

14
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.560
it will help you apply agile techniques to your

15
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
process of requirements development.

16
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.140
The course Kanban for Agile Scrum Practitioners will give you the

17
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.210
insight into the beauty of Kanban that you need to help you

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.470
better partner with your Kanban teams.

19
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.250
In addition,

20
00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.940
the Kanban techniques will help your process of requirements development.

21
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.520
Also,

22
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.410
I strongly recommend that the business analysts should at least be

23
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.940
knowledgeable in traditional project management.

24
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.870
There are some best practices that have worked well for many years,

25
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.940
and many companies are still following the traditional approach.

26
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.650
Also,

27
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.390
I've seen that many companies are doing a sort of blend of the two approaches,

28
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.840
Agile and traditional.

29
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.550
So if you have to learn more about traditional project management,

30
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.150
you might want to check out this course,

31
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.740
Project Management for Software Engineers.

32
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:36.000
All business analysts need to know how to make better estimates. You might want to consider this course, Best Practices for Project Estimation.
