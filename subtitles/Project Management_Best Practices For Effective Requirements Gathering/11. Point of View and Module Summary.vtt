00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.650
Here's my point of view and module summary. Here's my

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.400
point of view and some opinions.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.070
Design, build, and use an analyst framework.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.260
The analyst framework is all the artifacts on what, and

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.320
all the processes on how we do our work.

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.220
Adopt lean and agile practices for all your analysis work.

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.140
Don't wait.

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.870
Not only will this help in doing pure analysis work,

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.980
but it will also help you better integrate into Agile Scrum and

10
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.150
Kanban software development teams. Is BABOK overkill? BABOK stands

11
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.340
for Business Analysis Book of Knowledge, BA for Business Analysis,

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.080
BOK for Book of Knowledge.

13
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.560
It does have a lot of great information in it.

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.830
I would give it a browse,

15
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.410
and there are some great tools that I mentioned at the beginning of

16
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.900
this module that will be further explained in it.

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.310
But what is BABOK really?

18
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.100
Well, it's a framework, but it's a bit rigid,

19
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.720
a bit inflexible, and seems like a heavier methodology to me,

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.360
but give it a look and you could decide. To me, it outlines

21
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.540
many good tools analysts can use.

22
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.360
What I have presented here, of course,

23
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.020
is a roll‑your‑own framework that is lean and agile and adapts to

24
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.740
your organization, business, and processes.

25
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.940
Here are the key points of this module.

26
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.280
The essential role of the business analyst is to have,

27
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.910
a clear,

28
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.950
lean, and agile process to determine requirements that are

29
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.170
truly essential and add value to the business.

30
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.250
What's a requirement?

31
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.470
Well,

32
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.060
the simplest definition is a description of what a system

33
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.160
is supposed to do, but how you gather,

34
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.170
specify, analyze, and recommend requirements can make or break a company.

35
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.630
So get good at it.

36
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.230
The uncertainty of business requirements. If we accept that all

37
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.470
requirements are either uncertain when we hear about them, or

38
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.560
become uncertain at a later time,

39
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.170
we can then focus on how best to deal with this reality, until

40
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.380
something else better comes along, following lean and agile

41
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.310
processes for requirements development is the best course of

42
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.440
action in an uncertain world.

43
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.810
Determining the true value of a requirement is best solved by having a good,

44
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.180
solid requirements development framework. How do we

45
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.590
efficiently gather requirements? Well, in this section,

46
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.350
I showed you how to map your analysis task to iterations

47
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.460
and leveraging pre‑built templates.

48
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.870
Apply the right level of effort means to apply your framework

49
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.150
artifacts and process for each business context, and then

50
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.450
continuously improve and update your framework over time. In search

51
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.900
of the perfect requirement, here, I laid out a threshold to help

52
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.120
guide you as to how much analysis to do.

53
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:39.000
You don't want to do too much, and you don't want to do to little. Don't over‑analyze. Less is more in the agile and lean world.
