00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.740
Now let's take a look at the triangle dilemma.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.160
The triangle dilemma is also known as the iron triangle. But I like the

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.840
term dilemma, because a dilemma is a situation in which a difficult choice

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.670
must be made between two or more alternatives,

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.970
especially when they are equally undesirable ones.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.780
The triangle is composed of three competing elements,

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.930
requirements, schedule, and resources. If I have all the requirements up front,

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.200
then you can now estimate the scheduling resources for the project.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.310
Sounds pretty easy.

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.770
The schedule can be predicted based along with the

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.460
necessary resources. And lastly, using the resource requirements,

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.370
you could probably predict the cost. For all this to work, it

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.840
assumes that the requirements are fixed,

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.140
and we know that requirements are never fixed. They ebb and flow.

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.240
We also know that management will edict schedule changes at

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.170
any time. That in turn will affect the requirements and

17
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.040
costs, or the budget is reduced,

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.150
which in turn will also affect the requirements and schedule.

19
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.140
Requirements, schedule, and resources are at odds with each other.

20
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.280
If one changes,

21
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.800
then one or both of the others must change. Regardless, we then use

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.650
our project management process we discussed earlier and march forward,

23
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.340
hanging onto our waterfall for dear life.

24
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.590
Let's talk quality, the fourth and sometimes forgotten side of the triangle.

25
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.250
Since the requirements are fixed,

26
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.520
the schedule is fixed, and the resources are fixed, there's only

27
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.870
one thing that will suffer and suffer indeed,

28
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.240
and that's quality.

29
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.740
So we cut corners to meet our resource allocation and schedule

30
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.210
that was dictated, or new requirements were presented but we were

31
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.920
not allowed to lengthen the schedule.

32
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.800
It is a miracle the industry did as well as it did.

33
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.250
But as all things in life, we learned from our failures.

34
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.180
A company's investment business model goes something like this: develop

35
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.090
business cases, determine the return on investment,

36
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.020
get executive approvals, secure funding, and launch the project.

37
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.410
And off you go, hoping to salvage your career.

38
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.080
I think some form of waterfall may be with us for many years to come,

39
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.190
believe it or not. And you've probably heard of the term scrumfall,

40
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.650
which is a blend of both kind of mushed together. A company's business

41
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.700
model will influence the software requirements development methods.

42
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.030
Though you will hopefully be using agile,

43
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.750
lean, or other,

44
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.280
more modern methods, your company's business processes that

45
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.270
envelope you will likely impede your flexibility,

46
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.240
so be prepared to adapt.

47
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.580
Do not be hardcore and say you will do 100% scrum or no matter

48
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.000
what. It may not work in your company without enterprise‑level understanding and buy‑in of agile and lean.
