1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,770
Now let's look at how you can work and collaborate with your product

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,940
owner to develop and create high‑quality user stories.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,270
One of the most key activities of partnering with your product owner is

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,820
not just helping them create quality user stories,

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,280
but also guiding them on how best to prioritize the backlog.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,140
The responsibility to prioritize the backlog is owned by the product owner.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,890
Your role is to help them prioritize by providing key information,

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,340
guidance, and support that will help them determine the priorities.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,700
Estimates greatly help the product owner make decisions and set priorities.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,540
Let's face it,

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,800
will you buy a brand‑new car without getting a quote from a dealer?

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,150
Would the estimate of the purchase price help in your decision process?

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,400
Well, it certainly does.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,640
So, get good at developing quick, high‑level estimates for your product owner.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,790
Here's a quick priority guideline checklist.

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,950
So you'll want to consider value of the item in the backlog,

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,850
cost of not doing the item, cost of doing the item,

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,560
and return on investments.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,570
Those are some very key ones, but add your guidelines as you see fit,

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,210
and use it as a checklist to go one by one through

21
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,340
the backlog to help you prioritize.

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,720
I also recommend representing your product owner or jointly

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,640
attending the daily stand‑ups as an option as well.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,870
Product owners are busy, very busy,

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,760
so they may welcome you helping them by filling in for them at the stand‑ups.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,600
It should not be the norm, but this can provide better project continuity.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,060
Trust me,

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,640
developers will appreciate your attendance to keep things moving forward.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,990
Provide any backlog changes, items, and priorities to the agile or lean team.

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,270
The product owner may make last‑minute changes,

31
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,500
and you can quickly convey them to the team.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,990
Provide further requirement clarifications to the agile and lean

33
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,240
team so that the product owner is not bothered.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,190
Document the stand‑up outcomes and provide a short and succinct status to

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,780
your product owner as a quick email and CC the full team.

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,490
Always keep the product owner in the loop if he or she is not available.

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,480
Stay true to the product owner's vision, backlog, and priorities.

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,740
And remember, you are not the product owner, but partnering and helping them.

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,070
Just a note here,

40
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,340
agile and lean team members can fluctuate shape and size over time.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,400
That is normal.

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,110
Of course, when team members remain consistent,

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,440
productivity is usually much better.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,740
People get used to working together, they understand the cadence,

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,420
and the teams really start functioning well.

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,820
Product owners may change.

47
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,850
That can happen and can be quite disruptive,

48
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,960
especially if they have a different vision.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,780
So be prepared for a bit of a setback, and get to know your new product owner.

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,520
Provide any education,

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,070
and build your new partnership using the relationship

52
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,750
templates we discussed in the relationship module.

53
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,940
The number of team members can change based on workloads,

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,510
budgets, and company macro requirements,

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,240
things really beyond your control.

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
The types of skills required in a team can change.

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,940
For example,

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,690
early on you will need more user interface and user experience engineers,

59
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,520
and later, more test engineers.

60
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,840
You will likely have more analysis activities

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,290
earlier in a project than at the end, as we previously discussed.

62
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,240
Now roles and skills can be spread over multiple teams,

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,210
especially for the examples I just gave you,

64
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,580
user interface, experience, testing, and analysis roles.

65
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,240
Availability of members over time can change too,

66
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,150
such as out sick, vacation, reassigned to hot projects,

67
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,100
and the like.

68
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,000
Being aware of these allows you to plan and adapt to provide better service to your product owner.
