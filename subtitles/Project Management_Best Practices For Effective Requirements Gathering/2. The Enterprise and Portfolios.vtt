00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.540
Let's explore the enterprise and portfolios.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.060
Let's first contrast the business unit and enterprise.

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.520
The focus for the program business unit is in

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.630
creating business unit release roadmaps,

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.360
driving iterations with features and stories.

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.440
The focus for the enterprise is defining and managing enterpriseâ€‘wide

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.280
themes or strategies to ensure effective management of the entire

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.740
company's resources and progress towards its vision.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.420
The enterprise focus is also known as the portfolio

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.540
level of looking at requirements.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.850
We have discussed how the BA may be organizationally positioned in the last

12
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.470
two modules with the product or with information technology or even in

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.660
finance, if a program management office was set up,

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.320
and maybe in the finance organization as well,

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.760
though it could be anywhere that makes sense for a company in how they want

16
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.640
to place their programs. With enterprise requirements development, the BA

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.410
may be reporting in at the corporate level.

18
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.380
Let's say a company has five business units. Well, now maybe you've graduated

19
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.300
to the corporate level. In the next three sections, we will discuss what

20
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.610
portfolio themes are and how they relate to epics.

21
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.980
We will then discuss the portfolio backlog,

22
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.100
which, by the way, does not contain a list of themes, but epics, and,

23
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.000
lastly, portfolio management, which is the glue to make all this happen effectively.
