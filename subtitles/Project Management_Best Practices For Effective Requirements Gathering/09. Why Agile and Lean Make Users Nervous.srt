00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,800
Why Agile & Lean Make Users Nervous. Whenever new ideas, processes

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,370
or approaches are introduced into a business,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,760
it creates many challenges. Adapting easily to change

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,980
is not that natural for many of us,

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,140
especially when there are established business norms.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,680
So what about the users?

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,740
Do you need your customers or users to buy into

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,810
Agile or Lean development approach?

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,570
It would be best if they all did,

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,850
but they may still want to know how much will it cost and when will you be done?

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,770
Do they really need to know about Agile? To optimize Agile benefits, all

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,640
stakeholders should be involved and follow Agile principles and adopt an

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,020
Agile methodology like Scrum or Kanban. But you may be fighting an uphill

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,860
battle since all requirements first and software second is still so

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,870
ingrained in many companies today.

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,350
So maybe begin with a few iterations 100% dedicated to requirements

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,870
gathering and iterate with more detail until you get a reasonable

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,900
rough estimate and schedule for the client.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,420
That was the approach we took in my consulting company.

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,260
Let's face it,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,650
would you hire a contractor to build you a house if he didn't tell you

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,330
how much it would cost and when would it be done?

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,430
I think not.

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,070
Customers,

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,940
users, and stakeholders absolutely need to be informed and educated about

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,180
Agile and Lean. Business people want to save time and money,

27
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,640
and Agile and Lean will save them time and money.

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,740
Remember those relationship and communication skills we talked about?

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,930
Well,

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,890
now you can put them to good use because you will need them to

31
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,540
convince your stakeholders a better way to go.

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,350
Here's some ideas on why users are uneasy and nervous when introducing

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,090
and using Agile and Lean into their organization.

34
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,660
Users want budget predictability.

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,940
Agile requires a huge leap of faith for customers who are used to

36
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,030
hard budgets and fixed bids, as many people are,

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,840
especially in the CFO or more financial roles.

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,880
Users want technology predictability. Users want everything, don't they?

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,270
How do you balance maintenance versus new features?

40
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,870
A traditional detailed requirements document might reveal issues that

41
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,910
would appear in an Agile project at a much later stage.

42
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,740
Traditional versus the appearance of disorganization and neverâ€‘ending.

43
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,860
Users worry that development teams will avoid providing estimates,

44
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,450
documentation, and plans,

45
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,760
and Agile and Lean give the appearance of neverâ€‘ending work.

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,750
It's just iteration by iteration by iteration.

47
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,550
That's why I always recommend having one or more iterations for

48
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,980
analysis artifacts to rough out estimates and plans.

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,740
This will help alleviate the fears of management.

50
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,410
Oh boy, yet another way to make software.

51
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,630
Some users are overwhelmed by a new methodology and how

52
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,700
collaborative and interactive Agile projects are.

53
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,650
Users will see this as an increase in workload for project involvement.

54
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,410
Remember, you need that product owner involved daily,

55
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,170
and if they're not involved in an Agile or Lean project,

56
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,920
it's less likely that it will succeed, only proving their fears.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,090
Change is scary.

58
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,470
Adopt Agile/Lean over time and gradually incorporate it into

59
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,720
your analysis and development processes.

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,690
Be patient.

61
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,490
Also, it never hurts to have executive sponsorship. That's a must.

62
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,890
Agile and Lean approaches will have a good chance of taking hold if you

63
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,880
have executive sponsorship. Without executive sponsorship,

64
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,500
a grassroots effort may be a course of action. And if so,

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,040
have patience and look for small wins.

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,200
Don't leave your users or customers defend for themselves.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,840
Educate and support your Agile/Lean users. Find ways to give

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,230
users some sense of predictability by demonstrating functional

69
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,940
deliveries at the end of every sprint or with Kanban daily. Earn

70
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,390
their trust incrementally.

71
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,670
This will take some time.

72
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,500
Give users enough information to make good decisions such as backlog burn down,

73
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,410
priorities of features, value to the business,

74
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,080
quality estimates, and the like.

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,290
Make sure you talk to all your stakeholders.

76
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,040
We spent some amount of time on stakeholder management in the previous modules.

77
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,770
Don't use developer buzzwords.

78
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,280
They'll never like those. Adopt Agile techniques gradually.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,420
So think back to the relationships module.

80
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,200
You will need to use those skills and capabilities to

81
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,000
educate and support your users, stakeholders, and customers. This is important.
