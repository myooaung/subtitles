1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,530
Now that we have the foundation of a program and program management, and how

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,790
these both help enable a business unit to achieve its business goals, let's go

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,140
through an example of designing program requirements.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,990
Let's say the executives of the sales and marketing business unit meet

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,080
and arrive at the following business unit requirements.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,200
They want to increase revenue, they want to open markets in the UK,

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,240
and they want to develop a new product.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,740
These are the three main business unit requirements.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,440
The executive team decides to set up a program focused on increasing revenue.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,310
They set up a program management office and select a program manager.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,690
The executives and the program manager set up a stakeholder

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,580
team that will be led by the program manager.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,220
The program manager and the stakeholder team decompose the business

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,690
unit goal of increased revenue as follows: increase order revenue;

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,620
improve customer order stickiness, that is,

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,210
after a customer orders something, can we keep that

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,830
customer coming back for more; and lastly,

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,380
at least equal the competition for ease of ordering, since

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,760
our ordering interfaces are a bit clunky.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,110
So we have moved from business unit requirements to program

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,840
requirements, and typically this process needs a seasoned

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,740
experienced business analyst to help out.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,430
Now we want to determine the program application domain, that

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,700
is, what applications will be affected.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,080
Here are our program requirements from the previous slide.

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,310
Now the program manager,

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,030
stakeholders, and business analysts need to determine which applications,

28
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,220
systems, and operations would be affected by the program

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,530
requirement to increase order revenue,

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,150
improve customer order stickiness, and equal the competition for

31
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,840
ease of ordering. The program manager and stakeholders determine

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
that the vehicle order system, the order management system,

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,580
the vehicle allocation system, and the dealer customer

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,720
support operations center will all be affected by the

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,740
business unit requirement goals.

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,070
But we still don't know the impact to each of those systems,

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,540
so let's go to the next step.

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,580
Now we need to determine the application requirements

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,750
for each of the identified systems.

40
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,270
On the left are the four systems that the program stakeholders identified.

41
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,490
For each system, the business analyst needs to do the following: identify

42
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,680
the application stakeholders, contact information, and stakeholder type for

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,960
each application domain. Determine involvement, there are application

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,430
stakeholders we'll want to inform, consult,

45
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,220
partner, and then there are the decision makers. Determine the

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,890
interactions, identify forms of communication and interactions

47
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,980
with each application stakeholder.

48
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,060
Please recall, these are all the steps we set up in the relationship

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,040
model in preparing to work with any stakeholder.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,640
We're doing our homework and we're doing our groundwork,

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,640
and we're progressing step by step.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,650
Let's do a quick recap.

53
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,810
Sales and marketing define their business unit requirements, those are the

54
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,040
highâ€‘level requirements for a particular business unit.

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,410
A program was designed and defined to tackle one of those

56
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,180
requirements, the increase revenue business unit requirement.

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,680
We also set up a PMO, program management office, and selected a program

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,990
manager and stakeholder team to help steer the program.

59
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,380
Next, the application domain was identified,

60
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,880
and there are four applications in that domain,

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,040
and we performed our stakeholder preparation as to whom to

62
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,440
work with and what the interaction will be.

63
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,930
But before we drill down further and perform more

64
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,000
decomposition into epics and features, let's transition for a moment to discuss the broader business analyst role.
