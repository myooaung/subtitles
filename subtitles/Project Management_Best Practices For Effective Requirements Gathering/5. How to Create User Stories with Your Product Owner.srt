1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,280
Now let's look at how you can work with your product owner

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,140
to develop and create your user stories.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,420
This is important to emphasize.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,220
User stories are at the heart of agile requirements‑‑ from the product

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,700
owner's backlog through development and implementation.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,740
The entire process rides upon high quality user stories.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,060
As we discussed in the relationship module previously,

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,920
you've spent the time with your product owner to define your relationship.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,290
Now you can get down to business and ask, let's have a look at your backlog.

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,170
You never know what's in it or what the format is.

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,760
Let's see what she has.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,430
It is rarely in user story format, and that makes sense, really.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,980
Product owners know their business and have not likely

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,480
learned how to write a user story.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,100
And that is just fine.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,970
And that is why you are there.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,310
We will talk more about the user story format in a few slides.

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,830
Quite common, it's in a spreadsheet format.

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,990
This seems a pretty popular medium, which is just fine with me.

20
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,540
It may have some screenshots, text, workflows, and a collection of well, stuff.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,880
Maybe it's a Word document, and again, with the same kind of content I

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,980
just mentioned, and maybe even a wiki, like confluence.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,580
Or it may be a very detailed, structured,

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,830
traditional style requirements document.

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,890
I had one given to me in psuedocode style.

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,520
Yeah, really! Since it was almost impure code,

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,310
I couldn't figure a thing out, since I was much too close

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,140
to the trees to see the forest, so it took a while to

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,400
unwind that into user stories.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
Sometimes content quality is simply just inadequate.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,650
I look at this as a challenge and a great opportunity to

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,880
learn about the business and build a fun and rewarding

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,590
relationship with the product owner.

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,940
So be prepared for a myriad of formats and content quality to contend with.

35
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,230
Let's discuss the BA's challenges with normalizing

36
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,540
the backlog into user stories.

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,390
As you know,

38
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,030
a product owner is a person from the business who typically represents

39
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,740
their business community and represents their needs.

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,860
As you can imagine,

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,390
product owners come in all makes and models with various backgrounds,

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,080
from purely business to highly technical.

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,620
Therefore, the nature and quality of the backlog may widely vary,

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,310
and it may be very unclear.

45
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,300
The English language can have a lot of ambiguity.

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,900
Plus, the team is learning about the domain and its terminology,

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,360
so discussions may ensue, all good. And a backlog may have multiple styles.

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,400
Many times,

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,000
the product owner is gathering requirements from all the

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
other departments or organizations,

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,250
and hence, different people wrote different items

52
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,530
resulted in different writing styles.

53
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,410
It is the goal,

54
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,640
then, of yourself to refine those writing styles and try

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,650
to standardize and normalize them.

56
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,240
Backlog items can be very high level.

57
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,410
Sometimes the backlog item is at such a high level,

58
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,100
it will require additional refinement. Sometimes, like the example I

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,870
gave in a previous slide, it's at a very low level,

60
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,060
so this is the flipside.

61
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,020
Some items can be way too detailed to be in the backlog.

62
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,660
Maybe it's more like a task than a real requirement.

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,020
Also,

64
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,960
the product owner is still learning. The product owner may be learning not

65
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,410
only about their business domain, but also about backlogs,

66
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:11,950
agile,

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,600
lean, and other things, so please give them time and respect they

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,180
need to come up to speed. Priorities based on need.

69
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,860
Now, need is interesting and can be tricky.

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,480
Initially,

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,160
you might be presented with an item of high need, and you

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,080
believe it is just not that important.

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,460
For now, just sit tight.

74
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,330
Don't presume you know everything. Now, you might be right, but give it time.

75
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,910
Listen, seek to understand, and show empathy for the need.

76
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,050
Remember, they don't need the new system for fun.

77
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,530
They have a business to run, so it's up to you and your team to normalize,

78
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,550
if you will, the originally presented backlog into more actionable material.

79
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,940
That is what we will be doing in the next section.

80
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,310
Educate, collaborate, and define your relationship with the product owner.

81
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,650
So let's say you meet them for the first time. Before you get into the

82
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,380
backlog on user stories and all that stuff, first,

83
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,420
do the following.

84
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,060
Educate the product owner on the actual process.

85
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,770
Talk about its value, how the backlog works,

86
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,820
how iterations of user stories work, and that they are in control.

87
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,990
That is key.

88
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,760
They control the backlog and their priorities.

89
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,290
Of course,

90
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,130
there is collaboration and give and take in the agile process as well. Work

91
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,710
to collaborate and partner with your product owner. So describe how you will

92
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,670
help write user stories, how you will analyze their fuzzy ideas and needs,

93
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,080
and normalize them into user stories.

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,910
Maybe give some examples. In your initial discussions with the product owner,

95
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,080
you will define how you will work together.

96
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,730
That is, what will be the product owner's

97
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,870
responsibilities and what will be yours.

98
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,200
It is not clear cut, since every product owner is different

99
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,080
based on their background and knowledge.

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,870
Every relationship I have had with a product owner has been unique.

101
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,760
Come prepared with a simple PowerPoint presentation so that

102
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,820
you have a template on what to talk about.

103
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,980
It makes these discussions go smoother.

104
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,570
These topics include how you will educate them on agile or lean, and

105
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,110
how you will collaborate and define user stories.

106
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,150
Remember we talked about the secret to successfully gather

107
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,640
business requirements? That is building a solid

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,260
relationship with your product owner.

109
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,500
Always work to improve your relationship.

110
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,890
I can't tell you enough how important this is.

111
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,050
Your projects will go much smoother and be more successful.

112
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,070
As discussions proceed with normalizing user stories,

113
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,180
be sure to observe the level of understanding, the level of confidence,

114
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,960
and the quality of discussions with your product owner.

115
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,220
Watch the body language and be intent on assessing the degree of

116
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,580
understanding. If you see soft spots, jump in and clarify. The process to

117
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,640
normalize the user stories is a mechanism for you to learn even more

118
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,000
about the business domain and to further illuminate the product owner's understanding of the requirements.
