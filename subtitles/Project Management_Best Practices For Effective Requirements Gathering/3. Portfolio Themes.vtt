00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.940
Now let's discuss portfolio themes.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.490
What are portfolio themes? Well, here are the characteristics of themes.

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.490
Themes are strategic business initiatives.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.900
These are very high level and visionary. Themes propel a company forward.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.320
That is, without themes, a company or organization will die.

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.340
So for wherever you work or worked, what do you think your company's themes were?

7
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.810
And if you do not know,

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.690
then your company may not have been doing a very good job in

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.500
communicating themes and business strategies to its employees.

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.470
So themes represent new or improved products or services.

11
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.880
They can create opportunities in the marketplace.

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.140
They can enhance competitive advantage.

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.080
They can increase revenue; the term top line is used for

14
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.190
that. And they can help avoid business costs; the term

15
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.750
bottom line is used for that.

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.240
Also,

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.590
themes have a longer duration of life. A theme may be

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.230
around for many quarters or a year or two.

19
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.660
In fact, in my aerospace experience,

20
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.580
a theme was launching a new commercial aircraft,

21
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.340
and that theme was for 20+ years.

22
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.790
Here are some examples of themes. Cross sell services; that is,

23
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.220
try and find other products or services to sell to other existing customers.

24
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.780
This theme could affect most systems in the company.

25
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.200
An example may be the system selling motorbikes could now sell accessories,

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.540
so you are cross selling accessories.

27
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.740
Another theme would be leveraging existing services,

28
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.120
so use existing technology platforms to address new and growing markets.

29
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.410
An example may be expand our ride sharing service to delivering food.

30
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.250
Lastly, improve our technological advantage.

31
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.550
Remove system usage friction points. That is, make our systems easier to use,

32
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.200
adopt, and promote.

33
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.710
Add cell phone access.

34
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.910
If you don't have a mobile app,

35
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.160
you will likely be left behind. Partner with company X.

36
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.120
There may be some great companies that you could

37
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.470
partner with to grow your market share.

38
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.190
I have only listed a few here, but you get the idea.

39
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.380
All of these have significant enterpriseâ€‘wide implications.

40
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.040
They would touch maybe every corner of a business.

41
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.520
The business analysis activities and skills needed at this

42
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.040
level are very important and critical.

43
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.270
Well, where do themes come from in the first place?

44
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.660
Well, there are many potential sources.

45
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.910
The board of directors of a corporation, certainly. Executives, we call them

46
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.310
CxOs, and what CxOs stand for most likely are CEO, CTO, CFO, CIO, et cetera, you

47
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.690
get the idea. Lines of business leaders, or LOBs, such as the VP of sales or the

48
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.390
VP of engineering. External consultants,

49
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.400
maybe marketing companies and other industry leaders.

50
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.800
Key personnel within the company that are also leaders and

51
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.950
visionaries. And BA's providing research and analysis that

52
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.340
is required in identifying, designing, and articulating themes.

53
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.260
It is important to note, themes drive epics. Themes need to be

54
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.430
decomposed into epics, and epics are development initiatives

55
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.910
that fulfill your investment themes.

56
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:17.000
Please keep this all in mind as you work through this module. By implementing epics, you fulfill your theme.
