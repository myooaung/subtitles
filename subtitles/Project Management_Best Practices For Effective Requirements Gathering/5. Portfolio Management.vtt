00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.830
The executives and CXOs are not just letting everyone run

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.260
wild to get the themes implemented.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.840
Since themes are not only the lifeblood of a company,

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.070
they are, in essence, the company, so the proper oversight is required.

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.840
Portfolio management.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.860
Portfolios are important for the same reason business

7
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.410
unit or programs are important,

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.530
but on steroids since they apply to the entire enterprise.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.030
Portfolios exists in order to focus enterprise resources that will

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.820
enable broader business benefits and objectives.

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.680
Portfolios have a broader reach, business impact,

12
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.840
and benefits than a program does.

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.970
The portfolio requirements activities have a total impact,

14
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.060
positive or negative, on all projects and operations within the enterprise.

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.950
The construct of portfolio management was created to manage the effective

16
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.140
use of resources in order to achieve the company's vision.

17
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.280
The term portfolio, or portfolio management,

18
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.280
may be called something else in other companies,

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.340
but all well‑run large enterprises have a process to do this,

20
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.340
all of them.

21
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.700
Portfolio management.

22
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.380
So who is making all these decisions about what are the best

23
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.630
themes and how and when to invest in them?

24
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.120
That would be the portfolio management team,

25
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.360
which would be comprised of maybe the board of directors,

26
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.780
executives, you know, the CXOs, line of business leaders,

27
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.940
LOBs, and other key individuals.

28
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.940
The focus of portfolio management is typically investment oriented.

29
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.060
That is, where should we, as a company, invest our money?

30
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.680
Such as, develop new products or services,

31
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.520
improve existing products or services, future research and development,

32
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550
add, reduce, or remove investments even.

33
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.650
These phrases may, in fact, be themes in and of themselves,

34
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.840
but these are a little bit lofty,

35
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.140
and they are usually a little more to the point.

36
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.240
Here are the mechanics behind portfolio management.

37
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.040
Portfolio management decides on what is to be worked on and the rationale why.

38
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.480
Usually senior product managers and analysts heavily contribute to the why.

39
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.030
They establish themes, technical and business,

40
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.140
and I will talk more about technical themes in the next section.

41
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.990
They prioritize themes and epics,

42
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.520
and here is where analysts help gather the necessary information to guide the

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.840
prioritization of the translation of themes into epics.

44
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.570
And lastly,

45
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.160
portfolio management authorizes budgets and other fiduciary oversight as to

46
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.340
the progress of implementing the themes through epics.

47
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.620
Here is an example of a simple workflow of portfolio management.

48
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.560
You could use this as a starting point and then modify it to meet your needs.

49
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.050
First,

50
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.400
you identify and gather the executives you need to

51
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280
form your executive steering group.

52
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.940
They should be members of the C‑suite, so like CEO, CFO, COO, etc.

53
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.790
Plus, you'll want to have the CIO and the CTO as members as well.

54
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.500
And, of course, anyone else that makes sense to join.

55
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.290
From that team,

56
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.600
you identify and itemize key strategic themes with corresponding data,

57
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.780
such as business cases, outcomes, goals,

58
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.550
targets, ROI, etc.

59
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.820
Then your PMO executive team, maybe the same players or a subset,

60
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.360
will follow the portfolio management governance

61
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.020
defined and review the themes and epics,

62
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.630
the results of which is the epics backlog.

63
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.050
Portfolio management reviews the backlog,

64
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.910
adds new items,

65
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.100
and discusses feedback from ongoing epics and their associated projects.

66
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.660
If a new epic is approved,

67
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.750
the team will make a resource allocation and launch a new epic.

68
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.250
Or maybe we adjust the resource allocation for an

69
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.440
existing epic or project either up or down.

70
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.360
Next is an example of a portfolio of epics for theme X,

71
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.460
which is a container of epics.

72
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.540
There would be a container for each theme as a way to display progress to the

73
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.940
executives or governance body for easy status reporting.

74
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.410
As you can see in this example, we have four epics in theme X.

75
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.980
Two are ongoing and doing pretty well as green,

76
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.770
one is red, so that might be an issue that we may need to drill in on,

77
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.440
and Epic 4 is yellow.

78
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.620
We still want to drill in, but maybe there is hope for that project.

79
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.980
Their portfolio, project, or program managers will be feeding information in,

80
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.350
that is a decision metric such as value,

81
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.250
cost, risks, and things like that,

82
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.550
all back into the portfolio management reviews to enable

83
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.140
quality decision making as you move forward.

84
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.840
So this is rather simplistic,

85
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.000
but I want you to get the general idea about portfolio governance, which is the responsibility of portfolio management.
