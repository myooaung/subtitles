00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.540
Let's discuss and define the business unit and programs.

2
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.030
Let's contrast the last module regarding product requirements

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.780
with this module regarding a business unit.

4
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.780
As a product business analyst,

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.290
you would likely focus on a single or small number of systems or

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.040
single business function like sales or distribution.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.720
Agile team members are organizational closer,

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.020
easier to constitute,

9
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.780
and there isn't really any organizational silos, typically. The business domain

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.150
or organization is relatively easy to get your arms around.

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.890
As a business unit or program analyst, you would focus on largeâ€‘scale systems,

12
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.820
applications,

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.450
products, or suites of products so you would have a much broader responsibility.

14
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.240
Organizing agile teams across the business unit at scale is much more complex.

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.850
As a product or business analyst,

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.150
you might focus on one system or maybe a couple.

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.340
Some companies will look at these boxes or systems as

18
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.220
standalone entities or silos, therefore,

19
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.680
you need to have a new way of looking at your suite of applications.

20
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.600
But as a business unit analyst,

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.820
you will focus on a broad set or suite of applications or systems,

22
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.370
so you may be working with multiple Agile teams driving towards a

23
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.490
broad set or suite of products and services.

24
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.160
The role of the analyst looking at broadly scoped

25
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.940
requirements is very challenging.

26
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.540
Let's look at an organizational construct that may help.

27
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.140
That construct is the program.

28
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.020
Another term for business unit is program.

29
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.630
I rather like program since it will give us more

30
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.240
organizational flexibility if you need it.

31
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.010
A program is a group of related projects and operations

32
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.500
managing a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not

33
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.940
available from managing them individually.

34
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.910
Program management is the application of knowledge,

35
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.330
skills, tools, and techniques to meet program requirements.

36
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.450
Organizations with mature program management are more

37
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.540
successful than those without it.

38
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.390
More benefits can be derived from managing them collectively rather than

39
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.550
individually with the general business goals of increasing revenue, avoiding

40
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.340
costs, and improving customer service. Programs are a relatively simple, but

41
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.790
very important organizational construct.

42
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.110
Programs exist in order to focus resources that will enable

43
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.500
broader business benefits and objectives.

44
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.340
Programs have a broader reach,

45
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.080
business impact, and benefits than a project does or single

46
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.630
product. Because business unit level requirements activities have a

47
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.180
significant impact positive or negative on other projects and

48
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.160
operations within the business unit,

49
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.930
the construct of a program is used to manage the effective use of those

50
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.000
resources. Let's say these three critical business functions in the red box

51
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600
are placed into a container that is a program.

52
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.770
This will help the business unit better manage.

53
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.700
Those resources to achieve the common goal within that

54
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.540
red box, it's a simple and great idea.

55
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.720
So in this module you will see how you fit into the broader business

56
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.240
unit and program requirements gathering activities. Here are the key

57
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.690
characteristics or attributes of a program.

58
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.000
Unlike projects,

59
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.570
programs may never end or may end only when the

60
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.250
business requirements or strategy changes.

61
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.210
Programs have a higher level of complexity projects,

62
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.320
obviously since they will involve many projects and operational

63
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.080
elements and their dependencies. Programs involve a broader range

64
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.440
of senior management or stakeholders.

65
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.880
If you're going to have many projects and operations,

66
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.580
you will quite likely have more management and stakeholders involved.

67
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.700
Programs use more resources than any project might.

68
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.410
Well, sure,

69
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.360
multiple projects and operations will certainly add up to more

70
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.490
resources in people and money, and they will have more

71
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.770
potential conflict in business issues.

72
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.250
Well, yes,

73
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.270
certainly you have higher level of management and much more

74
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.360
resources to compete with, which may result in more potential

75
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.410
conflict and problem resolution, and programs require much more coordination,

76
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.410
to say the least.

77
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.850
It takes an immense amount of coordination,

78
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.980
management acumen,

79
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.940
communication skills, and experience to work on or run a program.

80
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.000
So you already might see how skilled senior business analysts will play a role in programs.
