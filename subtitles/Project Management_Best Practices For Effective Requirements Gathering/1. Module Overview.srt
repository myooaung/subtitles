00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,150
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,460
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,730
I will be presenting the module, Gathering Requirements for the

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,750
Enterprise, in the course, Best Practices for Effective Requirements

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:18,070
Gathering. Our backdrop for requirements gathering in these last three

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,030
modules has been by business context.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,480
In the previous two modules,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,610
we covered how the business analyst would perform

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,670
requirements development for a product,

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,140
working within an Agile or Lean team, and working with the product owner.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,380
And we discussed requirements gathering in a broader context

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,220
within the business unit, also known as a program where you

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,660
may have dozens of systems,

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,620
applications, and complexities that must be managed. And in this module,

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,670
we will cover the requirements gathering in the enterprise or portfolio

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,650
context. As a reminder, these contexts are not cut and dry and maybe

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,240
not even existent in most organizations.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:00,040
But as I mentioned, we need a form of categorization to frame our discussions.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,400
Here are our forms of expressing user requirements within an

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,480
organization that we discussed in the last two modules,

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,600
user stories, features, and epics. And lastly,

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,740
in this module, we will cover themes or business strategies, which cover

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,620
an entire enterprise's business drivers. The forms in which these are

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,270
expressed are described and documented as follows from right to left.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,960
Themes are very high‑level descriptions,

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,450
epics may be list points with slightly briefer

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,640
descriptions, then comes features,

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,360
which are detailed and programmable, and lastly, user stories,

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,830
which is the most detailed,

30
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,940
succinct, and follow a well‑defined template used for constructing them.

31
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,160
Here are the topics of this module, the enterprise

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,640
and portfolios, portfolio themes, portfolio backlogs,

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,230
portfolio management, architectural and technology themes,

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,560
epic identification and creating backlogs, the BA's role at an enterprise

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,740
scale, and wrap up with my point of view and module summary.

36
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,340
Okay, let's get after it.

37
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,530
This module will focus on the requirements gathering at

38
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,540
still a higher level of abstraction, the enterprise itself,

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,370
and we will address the enterprise‑wide requirements process.

40
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,600
The module outcome is to enable you to improve your

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,840
enterprise requirements development skills,

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
including tools,

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
techniques, and approaches for requirements development from an enterprise perspective.
