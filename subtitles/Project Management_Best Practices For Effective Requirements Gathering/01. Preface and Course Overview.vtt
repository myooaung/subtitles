00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.260
Hello, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.130
Best Practices for Effective Requirements Gathering. I'm

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.960
Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight,

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.440
and I will be presenting the module, The Value of Requirements.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.530
I will start with a brief introduction and describe the key

6
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.960
learning objectives to set the stage for the course.

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.410
Then I'll jump into the first module, the value of requirements.

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.380
Also, since this is an intermediate course,

9
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.160
I will assume you have some requirements analysis understanding,

10
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.540
and this course will add and build upon your existing knowledge.

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.900
The toughest part of requirements development isn't the act of documenting what

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.580
the users need, but is the process which results in helping users discover that

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.350
what they need provides business value. I believe that everything we do as

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.440
analysts is aimed at adding business value.

15
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.220
We can break down the process we use into these high‑level chunks.

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.330
You first gather candidate requirements by doing a variety of tasks,

17
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.540
like interviewing users, reviewing existing systems,

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.580
meeting with executives to understand the vision, and so forth.

19
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.080
Next, you specify, that is, document those requirements into some form and shape,

20
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.030
such as documents by using Word or Excel, wikis is like Confluence,

21
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.970
workflow tools, and maybe even developing basic mockups of screens

22
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.210
or pages, to name just a few mediums.

23
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.630
Next,

24
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.080
you analyze those requirements within the context of your vision or mission

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.420
statement as a backdrop. Every analysis task or project is conducted somewhat

26
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.350
differently, based on that context. Lastly, recommend.

27
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.630
That's an important element of our jobs,

28
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.280
since users may want the world, but by providing recommendations

29
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.580
and options with pros and cons, estimates, and your experience and

30
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.090
judgment, will all help in focusing the users to the best value

31
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.940
proposition for the business.

32
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.080
The requirements analysis context, that is,

33
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.670
you're going to gather, specify,

34
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.420
analyze, and recommend within the context of the following:

35
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
requirements development for a new system or product,

36
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.780
such as developing a new vehicle ordering system for a major motorcycle company

37
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.360
or requirements development for business unit. For example,

38
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.080
this business unit is responsible for product engineering,

39
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.320
such as developing and integrating the company's engineering systems with

40
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.670
other up and downstream suppliers and partners, quite broad,

41
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.910
complex, and certainly encompassing multiple systems.

42
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.520
Lastly, requirements development for an entire enterprise.

43
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.400
These would be very large and strategic requirements,

44
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.770
such as Facebook acquiring Instagram.

45
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.600
Can you imagine the requirements developed to accomplish that activity? We will

46
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.200
discuss these and provide examples within these contexts.

47
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.570
It is very important to understand the requirements analysis from

48
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.420
each of these perspectives. Requirements development is challenging

49
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.350
and hard work but extremely rewarding.

50
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.200
I truly enjoy helping customers discover value,

51
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.310
and that is very rewarding to me.

52
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.030
Requirements are not just laying around,

53
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.170
waiting to be scooped up like candy on an Easter egg hunt.

54
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.340
Requirements reside in a multitude of places, legacy systems,

55
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.740
artifacts, executives, users, suppliers and customers, to name but a few.

56
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.070
And most importantly, they reside in the minds,

57
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.600
hearts, and souls of everyone you encounter.

58
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.290
That is why I have an entire module on relationships.

59
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.330
Now, that is where the fun happens.

60
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.340
I have a blast doing this, and here's why.

61
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.010
Why is this so fun, you ask?

62
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.020
Well, you get to meet and interact with a broad variety of people,

63
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.340
from company leaders, to people doing the real work, and everyone in between.

64
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.380
Since I like working closely with people,

65
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.640
I love it. Understanding new and innovative business endeavors.

66
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.840
I started my career in highly technical positions, and over

67
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.790
time preferred more people‑oriented positions,

68
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.290
which led me to appreciate business in addition to technology.

69
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.360
The reward of adding value to the business, that is, making a

70
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.060
real difference to an organization, is great.

71
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.920
A successful business provides career opportunities for the

72
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.020
employees and in turn adds value to their customers and better

73
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.000
enables a company to be socially responsible.

74
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.440
So think about yourself for a moment.

75
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.700
Where are you on the scale of fun?

76
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.240
Work is hard enough to not be having some fun at it.

77
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.440
First, why are you here right now watching my course?

78
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.190
Maybe you are a new analyst and you want to discover more about your role,

79
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.430
or you are currently an analyst but ready to learn more. Not sure where

80
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.120
to grow next your skills as an analyst? Maybe you are wondering what

81
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.760
other tools or methods you could explore? Looking for guidance and career

82
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.740
planning? Maybe diving deeper into the world of the business analyst will

83
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.080
help you better decide the direction of your career, and we are going to

84
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.820
look at requirements development in the broader enterprise perspective as

85
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.300
well.

86
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.440
Are you wondering if there's a role for a business

87
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.320
analyst in a more agile world?

88
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.420
Well, absolutely.

89
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.460
Or are you just plain curious? If you can relate to one or

90
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.530
more of these questions or are looking to improve your

91
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.940
skills, then this course is for you.

92
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.970
Here are the course topics.

93
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.390
The value of requirements, relationships: the secret to successful requirements,

94
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.430
the evolution of requirements gathering, gathering

95
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.030
requirements for a new product, gathering requirements for a business unit, and,

96
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.640
lastly, gathering requirements for the enterprise.

97
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.440
And lastly,

98
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.870
we will summarize the entire course by discussing key learning objectives.

99
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.790
Though this course applies to business analysis in any business context,

100
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.840
this course is more geared to the development of computer systems, applications,

101
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.840
etc.

102
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.990
From time to time, you will see a POV, or point of view slide.

103
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.080
These slides will provide you with my personal comments,

104
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.350
my guidance on the topic, my on‑the‑ground insights,

105
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.910
my recommendations based on my experiences,

106
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.840
real‑world context, my opinions and beliefs, my perspectives.

107
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.270
I hope they are insightful and helpful to you, as they will provide some

108
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.240
color and depth in supporting the topics discussed.

109
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.470
