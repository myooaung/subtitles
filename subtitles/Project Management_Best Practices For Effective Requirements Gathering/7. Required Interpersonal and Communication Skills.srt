1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,460
Required interpersonal and communication skills.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,830
We have identified all the stakeholders and got all their pertinent

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,130
information and documented how we want to interact with them, and we

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,860
have some good pointers on collaboration techniques, but we are not

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,040
yet done in our preparations.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,830
Let's think through about the required interpersonal and

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,320
communication skills that will help us. A quick recap.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,520
Sometimes when we start our analysis activities,

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,070
we don't spend enough time or effort really trying to

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,890
understand the makeup of the entire user that is

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,110
stakeholder community. We've identified,

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,320
classified, and determine the interaction with our stakeholders.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,450
So for each of your activities or projects,

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,540
these are the people you will most likely be working with.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,760
Then we discussed a prescriptive approach to

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,540
collaboration and key collaboration tips.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,730
Now we get to the hard part. Next up, interpersonal and

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,510
communication skills, an essential element of success.

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,120
Now the first two boxes on the left are relatively easy to understand

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,240
and adopt into practice, they are very prescriptive,

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,710
but interpersonal communication skills can be more of an art than a

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,220
science, but I will try and break it down for you and give you some

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,940
important best practices you can begin using tomorrow.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,680
Here is an important note.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,300
Typically,

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,950
the business analyst is the integration point between IT and the business.

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,720
You may have also heard of the term that BAs bridge

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,640
the gap between the business and IT.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,130
Therefore,

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,240
you need a rock solid interpersonal and communication set

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,640
of skills to best accomplish your role.

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,250
Here are the key interpersonal skills that I think you need.

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:39,970
Teamwork.

34
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,360
You must be able to work well in teams and different kinds of teams,

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
some more business‑oriented,

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,960
some technical‑oriented with members having a wide variety of skills,

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,000
perspectives, and motivations.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,250
Responsibility.

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,450
You need to be responsible, not just for what you think your main job

40
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,820
is, but responsible for others need to take on even more

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,910
responsibility when you see your stakeholders struggling and needing

42
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,620
your help and guidance. Dependability.

43
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,770
I can't believe I am saying this, but you must be dependable.

44
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,020
Sadly, some people are not, not just show up on time,

45
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,860
certainly, but they mean what they say and they do what they say.

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,140
You need to show that you can be counted on. Motivation.

47
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,500
Do you think your stakeholder wants to see an unmotivated person?

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,010
Certainly not. Not only do you need to be motivated, but provide

49
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,450
motivation to others to keep the team moving forward.

50
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,490
Flexibility,

51
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,020
Every activity or effort I begin in my professional career has

52
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,540
never ended exactly as I thought it would.

53
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,780
If I wasn't flexible,

54
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,780
I won't have been as successful as I have been. Facilitate a give

55
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,410
and take atmosphere with your teams. Patience.

56
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,520
Well, I wish I had more of this one, that's for sure, but if you push too hard,

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,260
you may just be pushed back.

58
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,600
And also, pushing too hard can be very disrespectful to

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,690
your coworkers or your stakeholders.

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,720
Now I know it's a tough balance.

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,980
You want to be patient,

62
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,420
but as respectfully as you can, keep things moving forward,

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,640
it's a tough balance.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,050
Communication, a component of interpersonal skills is certainly communication,

65
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,080
and I will dive into that one a little more on the next couple slides.

66
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,040
Leadership.

67
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,310
Not sure if you've noticed, but all these attributes illustrate a true leader,

68
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,660
and I will go into more attributes of a leader in a

69
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,240
couple of slides from now as well.

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,990
Lastly,

71
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,800
you will find you get more out of what you want professionally by

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,660
living by these characteristics, not just at work,

73
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,870
but at home as well.

74
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,760
Oh, one more thing.

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,880
Quickly look at the list in front of you.

76
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,560
I want you to think about each item and rate yourself on each.

77
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,880
Say one for maybe not that much, two for medium, and three for pretty good.

78
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,480
For those you've rated yourself a one or two,

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,370
you might consider improving on those.

80
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,110
If you gave yourself 16 points or more, well, you're doing really well.

81
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,940
Keep it up.

82
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,770
Communication and interpersonal skills do overlap,

83
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,460
certainly, but they have a bit of a different emphasis and focus.

84
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,640
Here is a list of key communication skills that you need. Active listening.

85
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,900
This means good eye contact, and if you have good eye contact,

86
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,360
you do not have your head buried into your laptop.

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,240
Pay attention and listen for accuracy and meaning in what the speaker is saying.

88
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,190
If you are not sure what was said or need clarification,

89
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,410
just repeat back to them for validation and confirmation,

90
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,160
show empathy, and look for common ground. Writing.

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,580
Okay, don't get me started.

92
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,500
I have had the pleasure of working with many highly

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,490
technical and gifted engineers, but they can barely write a grocery list.

94
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,190
Writing is so important for specs, emails,

95
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,640
presentations, for just about everything.

96
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,210
Think about your writing skills.

97
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,410
Can they be improved?

98
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,630
Creating presentations. I have seen many more poor

99
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,840
presentations than good presentations.

100
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,380
I have a few more tips on this in the next few slides,

101
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,340
so we'll get to that then. Presenting. Even a harder lift for most

102
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,280
people. Presenting material in front of a group can be challenging, it

103
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,220
was certainly a challenge for me, and again,

104
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,200
a little more on that in the next couple slides. Speaking, that's meetings,

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,330
presentations, video calls, you name it.

106
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,490
Speak clearly, politely, succinctly,

107
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,590
that is avoid extra words that don't add any value.

108
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,850
Speak in a lean fashion, less is more.

109
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,020
And don't let speaking ruin your listening.

110
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,520
Leading meetings, again, a very essential skill, and again,

111
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,090
most of what I've seen is, well,

112
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,870
poorly led meetings. Creating quality documents,

113
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,090
certainly related to writing skills above,

114
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,040
but a little different.

115
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,170
Remember, people really don't want to read anything,

116
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,000
so make it as clear and concise is it can be. Okay, same thing.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,870
Quickly look at this list in front of you.

118
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,750
I want you to think about each item and rate yourself. For those

119
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,130
items you rate a one or a two, you might consider,

120
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,440
of course, improving those.

121
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,950
If you gave yourself 14 points or more, you're doing great.

122
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,640
Keep it up.

123
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,090
Here are a few presentation tips. I'm calling them Michael's

124
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,700
four P's plan, prepare, practice, and present.

125
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,300
I want to have a complete slide dedicated to presentations since to be

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,670
successful you will need to communicate and influence others and

127
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,510
presentations are one of the best mediums to do that.

128
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,600
Okay, here they are.

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,200
Plan.

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,460
Have the outcome in mind, know what you want before you

131
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,330
start planning your presentation,

132
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,530
know your audience, research your topic, organize the main points,

133
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,070
align your presentation with your outcome. Prepare.

134
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,790
Write a script ahead of time, and also open with something intriguing.

135
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,930
Understand why they are there and try to address the reasons why they are there.

136
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,920
Try to minimize the number of your slides.

137
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,170
No one wants a 50‑page slide they have to go through in a half an hour.

138
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,910
Display one topic, one thing at a time, and please,

139
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,990
no long paragraphs. And practice, practice,

140
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,820
practice.

141
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,530
And yes, practice does make perfect.

142
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,620
Sometimes I even stand in front of a mirror.

143
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,360
Try to hear yourself speak, project your voice, and please don't

144
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,410
memorize, and don't just read your slides,

145
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:51,940
either.

146
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,280
And then you're going to present, and you're not just talking,

147
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,090
you are delivering a message.

148
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,090
Maintain good eye contact, engage your audience, speak clearly

149
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,910
and with confidence, manage your stress, there may be some, and

150
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,700
maybe vary your tone and pitch.

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,070
You don't want to be monotone.

152
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,530
Also look presentable.

153
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,750
Think about your audience when you make your choices.

154
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,080
I believe, at least for myself,

155
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,870
that delivering presentations was my most effective way of

156
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,240
influencing others in my entire career.

157
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,730
A quick callout if you want more on this topic. Check out my

158
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,230
course Leadership and Communication Skills.

159
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,470
I can't emphasize enough how important these another

160
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,580
interpersonal and communication skills are in performing

161
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,490
