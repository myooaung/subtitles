1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,000
Now that we have identified all the stakeholders that you'll need to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,810
interact with and how you will interact with them, now it's time to

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,740
interact and collaborate with them.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,900
Here's a quick definition to make sure we're on the same page.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,920
Collaboration is the action of working with someone to produce or

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,620
create something. So not just working with someone, but working

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,040
with someone for a specific outcome.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,420
There are two key parts to the elements of collaboration: working with others,

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,590
of course, and producing or creating something.

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,860
Every collaboration should yield a result. Prior to every

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,890
encounter with a stakeholder, have your outcome in mind as to

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,420
what you need accomplished in that encounter.

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,480
Don't leave an encounter empty‑handed. Collaboration requires a mix of

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,000
interpersonal, problem solving, and communication skills that you need

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,610
to build and sustain your working relationships in order to produce

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,700
your expected project outcomes.

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm going to already assume you have some pretty good problem solving skills.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,370
In the rest of this module, we will touch on interpersonal skills and

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:13,140
communication skills to make you more effective with those outcomes.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,660
Collaboration and analysis activities. Your analysis activity is to develop

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,070
the requirements to add the ability of dealers to order accessories when

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,060
ordering new recreation vehicles.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,680
Your task is driving your collaborations with key

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,540
stakeholders to better understand this new feature.

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,940
Let me mention a few undertakings that will help build

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,190
collaboration and solidify your relationships. Requirements

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,430
workshops and other discovery activities,

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,560
discussing alternative solutions and approaches, maybe there are a few

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,950
ways to accomplish this feature, and discussing potential impacts to

30
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,680
development team and the deployment team. Also, discuss whether it could

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,670
be a build or buy, evaluation of the resourcing, costs, and skills,

32
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,190
impacts to other projects.

33
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,890
These activities in blue are conducted with your system‑oriented stakeholders,

34
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,470
for example,

35
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,680
product coder, development team, etc. And these in green, you would

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,320
likely do with your project or business stakeholders,

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,890
for example, project manager,

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,090
finance manager, senior IT, etc. The blue are focused on the task

39
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,680
itself, and the green are more like the metadata,

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,370
if you will,

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,330
of all the extraneous things around the project that are more

42
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,390
financial and schedule, and cost and resource‑oriented. Find

43
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,660
and resolve relationship gaps.

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,350
Look for relationship gaps between team members.

45
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,790
Is the health of your team good? If not, determine why not and

46
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,020
try to resolve, even if you're not the team leader, behave as

47
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,350
an individual contributor leader.

48
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,180
Periodically check in with your project manager or leader of

49
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,240
the activity or project you are working on.

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,640
Ensure your relationship with the manager or leader is solid.

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,490
If not, have a one‑on‑one and get it fixed.

52
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,120
In fact,

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,680
I recommend a one‑on‑one regular meeting of at least 30

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
minutes once a week with your team leader.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,060
If you see a rift in your relationship on a project, and even if

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,600
you don't think it'll affect your specific work,

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,110
it may well affect the results of the team's work,

58
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,880
which ultimately might reflect on you and your team.

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,010
Be proactive, and build and nurture relationships.

60
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,950
Now that takes guts, and you may need to be bold.

61
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,890
We tend to focus on the nuts and bolts of our work, that

62
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:21,000
doesn't really matter if the team and the stakeholders are dysfunctional. Keep that in mind.
