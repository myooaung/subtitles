1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,660
Consider the viewpoints of others.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,540
Sometimes when we start our analysis activities,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,320
we don't spend enough time or effort really trying to

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,360
understand the makeup of their user community.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,540
Let's take a closer look.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,060
So, who are the users?

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,320
And we use the term users quite broadly, don't we?

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,050
Users are people who will use the results of your analysis,

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,820
say, a new feature, or even an entirely new system.

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,860
Now customers.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,030
This is a broader term, which includes users plus others,

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,960
like the management of the users who may benefit from the results

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,580
of the system, but not literally use the system.

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,450
Who are they?

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,530
Do we design the system for them too? Sponsors. Typically executive or

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,610
senior leaders that want to see the results of your analysis and how that

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,130
will benefit them and the business ‑ costs,

18
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,900
deployment, customer impacts, and things like that?

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,140
IT professionals.

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,460
These folks are responsible for the development and

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,840
support of the systems and applications.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,650
You may need them to provide you with information to support your

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,410
analysis activities, as well as they may be the people who must implement

24
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,430
the results of your work. Subject matter experts,

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,180
sometimes known as SMEs,

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,790
are key resources that may be scattered throughout the

27
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,690
organization that you need to complete your work.

28
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,950
There may be other categories, certainly, but I likely got most of them.

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,810
Notice my icons on the left side of the slide are all representations of people.

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,480
I hope you like working with people.

31
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,900
I believe that the most successful analysts are

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,370
people‑oriented and relationship‑oriented.

33
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,420
I like people, hence, I enjoy the analyst role.

34
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,640
All of these "users" have different viewpoints, that is different wants and

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,440
desires that they need completed to fulfill their requirements.

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,460
In one sense,

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,380
I like to use the term stakeholder in a broad way for all of these

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,810
interested invested parties I've listed above.

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,940
Now let's drill into the stakeholder concept.

40
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,540
Multiple stakeholders ‑ single focus. In your job,

41
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,610
performing business analysis for a new project,

42
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,050
for example, you will encounter the following stakeholder types.

43
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,250
System stakeholders are users of the system or works with the

44
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,670
results of those who use the system, or possibly will be impacted by

45
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,840
the deployment and operation of the system.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,800
Then there are the project stakeholders, whose interest in your project is

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,040
about the project's financials typically, such as cost, budget, and schedule.

48
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,770
These stakeholders may be the business leader and those who care about how the

49
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,240
results of your analysis may be implemented,

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,560
such as developers and other IT professionals, and still others who may

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,840
be involved in installing and maintaining the system.

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,120
You need to consider these communities for a complete

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,140
analysis of your task or project.

54
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,640
Their requirements and ultimate expected outcome may be different and competing.

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,260
Therefore, your role is to provide a single focus,

56
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,560
which may also be known as the product owner,

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,180
project manager, senior analyst, or simply, business analyst.

58
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,000
Your job will be to ensure that the requirements are

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,860
aligned across both of these communities,

60
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,340
as well as manage the myriad of expectations towards a singular outcome.

61
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,820
This could be challenging indeed. As a business analyst,

62
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,890
you will need to integrate diverse viewpoints by

63
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,540
performing the following additional roles.

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,330
To begin building your relationships,

65
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,870
you need to collaborate with all stakeholders and champion

66
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,220
their needs and desires, let them know you care, and will do

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,280
everything you can to gather, specify,

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
analyze, and recommend their needs to provide the highest value to the business.

69
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,500
This begins your journey to establish trust. As you work with them, you may

70
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,540
play the role of facilitator, working with each stakeholder to find common

71
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,890
ground so that the entire community can accept a combined outcome of your

72
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,380
work. And other times, stakeholders will look to you to lead, to make

73
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,050
decisions that are tough, and to pull all the viewpoints and requirements

74
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,970
together into a unified specification.

75
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:58,000
Please note, the larger the number of stakeholders, the greater your collaboration, facilitation, and leadership challenges will be.
