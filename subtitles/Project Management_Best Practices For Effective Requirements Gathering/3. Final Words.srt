00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,190
Next are my final words and closing remarks for this course. Wherever

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,230
your career path may take you, always remember, the bottom line is

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,780
your ability to deliver business value.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,570
Do not forget that. It is one of your biggest assets as a

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,680
professional. Thank you very much for taking my course.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,140
It's been my pleasure.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,120
I, like you,

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,200
have been challenged over the years on how best to

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,810
provide value to the business.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,280
My mind is constantly focused on it. I hope and trust that this course

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,890
has been able to provide you with the essential tools,

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,620
methods,

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,320
approaches, and renewed confidence to help you be more

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,700
successful in requirements development.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,670
Lastly,

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,780
I hope I see you again in one of my other courses, and I wish

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,000
you the best in your professional journey. Never stop learning!
