1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,040
Now, for my point of view and module summary.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,640
Where do you fit in or feel the most comfortable doing your job?

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,800
You likely have spent most of your business analysis career

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,290
in the areas of user stories and features,

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,980
and maybe even with epics.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,440
In the next module, we'll go into the enterprise realm, that is themes.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,340
As you move from left to right, I believe you need greater experience,

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,300
maturity,

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,810
interpersonal and communication skills to be more effective and successful.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,840
So, let me ask again, where do you fit in and where do you want to go?

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,610
Here is my point of view, my thoughts and opinions.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,750
Programs are not projects.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,950
Many projects can be contained in a program.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,810
Many companies do not use the notion of programs and

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,730
instead just call everything a project.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,920
It's not what I would do,

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,360
but everything in this module still applies whether

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,610
we call it a program or a project.

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,940
For business units and program type work,

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,670
a higher level of business analysis skills are required.

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,810
Sometimes the role title may come by many names:

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,210
program manager or project manager, or just manager,

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,070
or senior business analyst.

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,580
Or, they may not even be defined in your organization at all, but should be.

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,550
You may have to be assertive and creative,

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,440
and simply take on the role and get the job done.

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,390
Here are the key points and summary of the business unit

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,430
or program level requirements module.

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,320
What makes programs different from single systems is we

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,330
are now covering large scale systems, applications,

31
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,720
products or suites of products, and then organizing Agile teams at scale.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,060
Our goal throughout this module is to manage the

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,840
effective use of business unit resources,

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,410
whereas in the previous module,

35
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,720
your analysis is mostly focused on the product or system features,

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,490
now you are also focused on how best to implement

37
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,400
those features across a business unit.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,250
That takes strong analysis and interpersonal skills.

39
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,340
We discussed the organizational construct of a program management

40
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,620
office that would lead or guide a large program.

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,610
We also noted that the same activity can be performed by a

42
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,180
senior business analyst or a project manager,

43
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,420
or some other title.

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,430
Not every company embraces the program concept.

45
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,390
We emphasized your important role to translate epics into more detailed and

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,320
refined notation in the form of features and user stories.

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,640
Next we then proposed a method to optimize the

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,470
workload of features and user stories,

49
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,280
and assign them to the backlogs of your Agile teams.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,900
We looked at the backlog as having feature items or service items and how we

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,580
might want to factor those out across different teams,

52
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,380
where subteams will focus on the user stories and other on services,

53
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,320
and yet others will be hybrid teams.

54
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,800
So in some cases, you'll want a team to not only implement features,

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,100
but also include them in your backlog service items,

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,710
and, in fact, that might be more productive than otherwise.

57
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,550
All managers and executives want to know when they will be getting something.

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,900
Yes, I know,

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,120
the Agile approach just says you'll get it when you

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,720
get it after every iteration, but trust me,

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,200
executives don't care about Agile, they care about revenue or business,

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,240
so you will need a release roadmap,

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,480
and I provided you with approach for that as well.

64
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:16,000
That will provide a level of comfort and trust to the stakeholders. Up next, gathering requirements for the enterprise.
