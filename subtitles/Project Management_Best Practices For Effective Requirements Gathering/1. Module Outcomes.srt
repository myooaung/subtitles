1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,170
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,440
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,910
I will be presenting the module,

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,390
Applying Key Learning Objectives, in the course, Best Practices

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,980
for Effective Requirements Gathering. Well,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,360
you made it through the course.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,290
Congratulations! The outcome of this module will be to cover the key

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,290
points of this course and encourage you to begin applying what you

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,420
have learned quickly and successfully.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,770
I won't just reiterate things,

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,640
but instead illuminate topics that are important and provide key takeaways.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,690
In my opinion, the business analyst role is undervalued and underappreciated,

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,950
but only you can change or improve that perception.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,550
Hopefully, by applying the ideas, techniques, and methods you've learned,

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,540
you can truly change your organization for the better.

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,520
Here are the highlights of the module, The Value of Requirements. The

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,940
toughest part of requirements development isn't the act of documenting

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,530
what the users need, but is the process which results in helping users

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,950
discover that what they need provides business value. I truly believe

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,370
that how you gather, specify,

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,800
analyze, and recommend requirements can make or

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,840
break an organization or a company,

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,090
and that is why you need to have a solid analysis framework with processes and

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,900
effective soft skills. By adopting Agile and Lean approaches,

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,610
tools, and techniques such as Scrum and Kanban into your

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,710
requirements development process, you can minimize, but not

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,780
eliminate the uncertainty of requirements,

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,340
but greatly improve the quality of your requirements' outcomes.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,210
We talked about setting up your own requirements' backlog with

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,070
iterations to manage and drive your analysis work activities.

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,070
Create your own requirements development framework.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,280
This is comprised of your artifacts, templates,

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,260
checklists, processing tools, training,

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,000
etc. so that you can quickly pull out and use.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,820
You want them to be Agile and Lean oriented and

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,140
suited for each business context.

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,740
Keep this with you no matter where you work.

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,660
Here are the highlights of the module relationships, The

39
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,870
Secret to Successful Requirements.

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,700
The secret to developing quality requirements is through influencing,

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,340
nurturing, and cultivating relationships with all your colleagues.

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,440
Those relationships will yield the requirements you need.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,500
One area I emphasize was identifying,

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,160
classifying, and collaborating with your stakeholders in

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,440
creating a stakeholder preparation template.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,650
Work closely with them and design your collaboration from what they

47
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,550
want from you and not what you want from them.

48
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,330
The business analysts is a key integration point or bridge

49
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,160
between IT and the business. Therefore,

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,670
you need rock‑solid interpersonal and communication

51
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,640
skills to best accomplish your role.

52
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,540
Interpersonal and communication skills are a must,

53
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,620
and there are many, as noted in the module.

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,450
But here are my top five, team builder, able to motivate,

55
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,340
dependable, flexible, and you are an amazing presenter.

56
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,390
Here are the highlights of the module of the

57
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,380
evolution of requirements gathering,

58
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,710
sequential and stepped requirements and the triangle dilemma.

59
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,330
We discuss how the sequential and step process for

60
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,720
developing requirements and systems, also known as waterfall,

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,890
could not accommodate changing requirements and business dynamics,

62
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,420
thus resulting in more defects and lower quality.

63
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,790
Hence,

64
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,270
it forced us into the triangle dilemma where schedule and cost

65
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,570
dominated requirements. Next up, incremental and iterative

66
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,320
requirements development was a great learning laboratory,

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,090
and many of the great ideas from this phase were carried

68
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,050
forward. Adaptive or Agile requirements, well,

69
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,180
we learned much from those previous models,

70
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,170
and we incorporated incremental results provided over multiple iterations and

71
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,240
also inserted prototyping and lighter‑weight specifications.

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,060
We explored Lean as a requirements gathering approach, and in particular,

73
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,690
Kanban is the most adopted method of requirements and systems development using

74
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,050
Lean. Initially, Agile and Lean will make users nervous for a few reasons,

75
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,050
something new, it changed the way we do things, it appears less predictable.

76
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,440
Yet, it is actually more predictable,

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,370
and we emphasize that you would need to educate and support your

78
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,630
customers and users and stakeholders on how Agile and Lean can

79
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,140
provide more consistent value to the business.

80
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,990
The next three module summaries is where I will summarize

81
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,470
the requirements development by context.

82
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,230
The first was working on smaller teams focused on a single system or a

83
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,730
few systems that are called the product context.

84
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,690
Second is the business unit or program context where

85
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,160
you may have dozens of systems,

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,940
applications, and complexities that must be managed.

87
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,590
Lastly, the enterprise or portfolio context.

88
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,040
This is the entire enterprise,

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
which includes all application systems or any CAPEX spending.

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,060
The approaches to each of these is different,

91
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,270
and it is important to understand that difference. Also, these

92
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,430
contexts are not cut and dry, and in reality, very fuzzy.

93
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,240
It may even be non‑existent in most organizations,

94
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,040
but as I mentioned,

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,010
I need some categorization to help frame the discussions. In this module, we

96
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,310
covered how the business analysts can contribute to requirements development

97
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,340
for a new product, and here are the key takeaways.

98
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,860
We discussed the composition of the Agile product team and how the BA is a

99
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,960
member of that team, though the BA's membership on the Agile/Lean dev teams

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,330
is underrepresented, in my opinion. Normalizing the product backlog. We

101
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,980
learned that the product backlog can have all sorts of odds and ends in it

102
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,530
and that the business analysts can normalize those odds and ends into

103
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,390
succinct user stories that can be understood by the product owner and the

104
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,740
technical developers.

105
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,030
There are benefits to normalizing the backlog.

106
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,810
Besides creating quality user stories,

107
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,120
the process itself to normalize the user stories is a mechanism for you to

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,640
learn even more about the business domain and to further illuminate the

109
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,940
product owner's understanding of the requirements.

110
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,480
Use the user story template and the invest checklist to

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,350
create consistent, quality user stories.

112
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,070
No matter where you are organizationally in your company,

113
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,450
you will have the best success with your projects by

114
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,540
partnering closely with your product owner.

115
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,550
Here are the highlights of the module gathering

116
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,600
requirements for the business unit.

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,770
Our goal throughout this module is to manage the effective

118
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,210
use of business unit resources. That takes strong analysis

119
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,740
and interpersonal skills.

120
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,490
Program management strengthens the alignment of resources and goals to

121
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,280
the business unit strategy and ensures better control and focus on

122
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,340
realizing those intended and expected benefits.

123
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,200
I outlined four forms of expressing user requirements, user stories,

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,920
features, epics, and themes.

125
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,850
This approach greatly helps us articulate requirements from a

126
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,340
program or system level to features to even broader business unit

127
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,400
or program‑wide requirements, and lastly,

128
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,740
enterprise‑wide requirements known as themes.

129
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,030
Driving epics to user story backlogs,

130
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,840
defining team assignments, and releases, we emphasize your important

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,120
role to translate epics into more detailed and refined notation in

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,050
the form of features and user stories.

133
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,700
Next, we then propose a method to optimize the workload of features and user

134
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,120
stories and assign them to backlogs of your Agile teams.

135
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,740
All managers and executives want to know when they will get something,

136
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,450
and they don't always care about Agile.

137
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,280
They care about revenue or business, so you will need a release roadmap,

138
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,740
and I provided you with an approach for that as well.

139
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,690
Here are the highlights of the module, Gathering Requirements for the

140
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,700
Enterprise. Portfolio themes are strategic business initiatives.

141
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,950
These are very high‑level and propel a company forward.

142
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,480
It is the long‑term vision of the company that themes represent.

143
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,860
Portfolio themes drive the creation of epics and implement the

144
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,990
theme and portfolio backlogs are the collection of epics and not

145
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,310
the themes themselves.

146
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,050
Themes aren't just business oriented,

147
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,840
but also architectural and technology themes that are

148
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,020
critical to the success of any company.

149
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,350
Both business and architectural themes drive epics. Portfolio management is

150
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,430
essential to ensure the themes are managed and successful.

151
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,240
Portfolio management decides what is to be worked on and the rationale why.

152
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,180
Something we should all keep in mind, changes in technology will drive how we

153
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,700
perform requirements development in the future.

154
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,290
As you see new technologies,

155
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,350
consider adding them to your analyst framework or toolkit.

156
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,930
The professional discipline of requirements development is a continuum,

157
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,000
and you will need to grow and adapt to requirements development skills throughout your professional career.
