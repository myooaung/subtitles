00:02.240 --> 00:09.680
Fetching the post generally works what doesn't really work is to display all of the thumbnail and the

00:09.680 --> 00:11.510
preview text.

00:11.510 --> 00:18.350
Now the issue is obvious if we have a look at firebase something is stored in thumbnail link here and

00:18.400 --> 00:21.670
the preview text doesn't even exist.

00:22.670 --> 00:27.330
So we have to fix both in our code when we create a new post here.

00:27.680 --> 00:32.090
We should probably change the data we fetch and we store it.

00:32.300 --> 00:40.550
So in the Edmon Post forum here we should rename thumpingly a link to just Nehal so that we are in line

00:40.670 --> 00:47.090
to Diablo components where we try to access the Fontenelle property and we also need to provide a field

00:48.140 --> 00:56.420
at best text area so it will copy the content field which allows us to fetch some pretty you text.

00:56.420 --> 01:02.080
So preview text also named the field as such preview text.

01:02.910 --> 01:06.980
To store that we need to add that field to our edit that post.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.840
Preview text.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.820
Initially it's an empty string.

01:12.070 --> 01:18.490
And now all future posts which we save will have the updated thumbnail and the preview text.

01:18.520 --> 01:25.030
So let's go back and let's delete dead wrong post and let's create a new one instead.

01:25.150 --> 01:29.110
So the Edmund sectional tree then you post it's by Max.

01:29.140 --> 01:31.680
It's a working post here.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.910
All at the same image as before again like this.

01:36.910 --> 01:41.800
This post should work and the review is should work.

01:42.100 --> 01:46.570
Let's now save and we get back to state data response.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.160
You may ignore the advertisers.

01:48.220 --> 01:50.490
They will be fixed later.

01:50.490 --> 01:58.480
And if we now go back to our starting page now we get no error and a working post though the thumbnail

01:58.480 --> 02:01.300
image isn't really this late.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.480
Why is that.

02:02.800 --> 02:11.950
If we inspect firebase thumbnail is empty because the admin post for him I'm still synchronizing this

02:12.100 --> 02:14.660
field to thumbnail link.

02:15.010 --> 02:20.230
Let's switch just to edit it post something here on the input and lets for now manually fix this on

02:20.230 --> 02:22.020
firebase future posts.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.240
Should work fine.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.860
So for now I'll just manually enter this link here into the thumbnail field in the future.

02:31.870 --> 02:32.940
Again this will work.

02:33.070 --> 02:36.460
I can't get rid of the erroneous field here.

02:36.460 --> 02:41.820
Now if we go back and reload that page we do see our from Neil.

02:41.950 --> 02:46.360
So this is now working at the same is true for our block list here.

02:46.660 --> 02:51.830
Let's next work on fetching a single block posts because there we still use dummy data.
