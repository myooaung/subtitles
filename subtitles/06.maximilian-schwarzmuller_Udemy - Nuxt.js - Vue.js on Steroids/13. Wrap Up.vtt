00:02.250 --> 00:10.800
So in this module we learned a lot about layouts ponens pages and how routing works in backstabs we

00:10.800 --> 00:17.970
didn't dive explicitly into service rendering but we're actually using it all the time already whenever

00:17.970 --> 00:21.330
we reload a page it's rendered on the server.

00:21.390 --> 00:27.570
So we're already using that feature next gives us dead and the nodes are out of the box.

00:27.600 --> 00:32.090
Now later in the course they will also look a little bit more behind the scenes of that no worries and

00:32.100 --> 00:35.400
you will also see different approaches of rendering your app.

00:35.730 --> 00:40.470
But before we do that let's actually build something more beautiful than we have right now.

00:40.650 --> 00:46.710
And let's practice the things we learned thus far by diving into our main course project where we built

00:46.950 --> 00:52.080
a real block application a web lock application with Nax.

00:52.080 --> 00:59.100
J.S. We'll dive into this in the next module and this offers a great opportunity to practice and understand

00:59.280 --> 01:00.430
what we had a look at.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.190
So far.
