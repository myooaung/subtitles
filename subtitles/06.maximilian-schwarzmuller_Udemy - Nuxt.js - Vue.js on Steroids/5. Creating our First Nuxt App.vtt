00:02.210 --> 00:07.310
Now enough with the theory let's make sure we all understand it's a bit better by simply getting our

00:07.310 --> 00:09.200
first next ep.

00:09.260 --> 00:16.730
And keep in mind this will in its core be a as EP just with a different build workflow and a lot of

00:16.730 --> 00:17.870
help.

00:17.870 --> 00:23.690
The easiest way to create a next app is to use a special tool which is like a seal IDE that gives you

00:23.690 --> 00:25.790
new next applications.

00:25.790 --> 00:32.240
You can simply google for create next app and you should find to get a repository to create next app.

00:32.240 --> 00:37.190
If you're coming from a reactionless background you might know create re-act app as a tool to give you

00:37.190 --> 00:38.510
react apps.

00:38.510 --> 00:43.170
Now it is a tool to give you next apps and on this her page which you found.

00:43.180 --> 00:48.640
Of find insulations attractions though there is an either way then the one showing here.

00:48.890 --> 00:53.700
You can simply use NPM notes package manager to get started with that.

00:53.750 --> 00:58.960
Now for that you will need no change as though no change is required for two reasons.

00:58.970 --> 01:05.450
The node package manager which will use to install create next app and then also all dependencies in

01:05.450 --> 01:06.710
that project.

01:07.010 --> 01:15.080
But also because of notorious itself we also need that because next is a tool that starts a simple note

01:15.140 --> 01:18.190
JS server so that it can do that prae rendering.

01:18.190 --> 01:22.710
We were talking about and therefore we need no G-S obviously we need it.

01:22.730 --> 01:26.650
We won't write our own Noach Yes code but daks requires it.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.170
So on node j is not Orrick.

01:29.390 --> 01:34.600
Download the latest version or if you were facing any issues with that the long term stability version

01:34.640 --> 01:40.760
on the left and simply walk through the installer once you got that finished you can run NPM install

01:41.290 --> 01:47.830
Dasch G create Dasch next Dasch app in the terminal or command prompt.

01:47.930 --> 01:53.120
If you run Windows on your machine the folder in which you navigated there doesn't matter.

01:53.120 --> 01:58.780
On Mac and Linux you might need to add a pseudo in front of that to get the right permissions and thereafter

01:58.940 --> 02:04.810
you can simply hit enter and this will install this create next app tool on your machine.

02:04.810 --> 02:08.450
Now be back once this is finished once the installation finished.

02:08.450 --> 02:15.110
You should navigate in the terminal or command prompt by using DCD command into the folder where you

02:15.110 --> 02:17.180
want to create your next project.

02:17.180 --> 02:23.690
So I did this and then you simply execute create dash Nax dash app and then the name of the folder you

02:23.690 --> 02:24.590
want to create.

02:24.620 --> 02:31.590
In this case I'll simply name it my first next app but the name is of course totally up to you.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.950
Once you hit enter you'll be asked a couple of questions.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.870
The project name is the first you have to choose and you can simply hit enter to confirm the default

02:39.900 --> 02:42.010
which is written in parentheses here.

02:42.030 --> 02:46.940
The same is true for the project description and then you can choose a service side framework.

02:46.950 --> 02:48.860
Now you don't have to choose one here.

02:48.930 --> 02:56.160
It's just that you can easily integrate next into a I'd set up using Express Khoa at Dawna's.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.210
So these are all notes.

02:58.230 --> 03:00.180
J.S. frameworks.

03:00.370 --> 03:05.340
Now as I mentioned earlier at the end of the course I will dive into that and show you how you integrated

03:05.340 --> 03:06.840
with such a framework.

03:06.960 --> 03:13.210
For now I just want to get a simple note server where the next runs and word only does one thing.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.970
Give us pre rendered view applications and therefore I will choose non here.

03:19.050 --> 03:25.050
Now you can also add a UI framework so that as a package which gives you UI components and then you

03:25.050 --> 03:29.130
can of course look into any of these but I will simply use non here.

03:29.460 --> 03:34.920
Now you can choose surrendering mode because you could even say I don't want that Cirus I pre rendering

03:34.920 --> 03:35.510
stuff.

03:35.580 --> 03:41.430
Just give me a normal single page up and then you would have the benefit of the year improved and easier

03:41.430 --> 03:42.850
configurations still.

03:43.020 --> 03:50.250
But I will go with a universal map here and you can choose to pre-install ex-U.S. which is H2B client.

03:50.310 --> 03:51.330
But for now I will choose.

03:51.330 --> 03:58.710
No here you can enable lending to get messages regarding your code quality but Elbel also disable this

03:58.710 --> 04:01.990
year and then enter your name.

04:02.100 --> 04:07.890
Once this is all done this will set up a new folder with a lot of files and configuration in there for

04:07.890 --> 04:14.370
you and it will inform you once it's done it will also re-install all the dependencies it requires.

04:14.370 --> 04:17.890
So let's wait for days to finish and then have a look at what we got.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.560
So it finished here and now we see the commands we should execute.

04:21.570 --> 04:25.080
We can simply navigate into the newly created folder with CD.

04:25.080 --> 04:30.560
My first next app and then run NPM run def to start the development server.

04:30.630 --> 04:33.680
Does this the notes server with next on it.

04:33.750 --> 04:38.360
But in a special development mode with better debugging messages and so on.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.740
Now you can then visit this page here.

04:40.740 --> 04:45.250
This you are l in your browser once it's started and keep that process running.

04:45.270 --> 04:51.930
You should not exit it because if you exit it you shut down your development server and if you didn't

04:51.930 --> 04:57.100
was a local host 3000 This is what you should see or something related to that.

04:57.180 --> 05:04.230
So basically some starting screening starts with now let's open the project in an ID to log which files

05:04.260 --> 05:04.680
we got.
