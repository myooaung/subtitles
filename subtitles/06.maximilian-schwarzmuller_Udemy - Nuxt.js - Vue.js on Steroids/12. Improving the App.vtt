We add up quite a lot of logic to our admin area and we're almost at the end of this course modules

00:07.630 --> 00:10.310
so that we can dive deeper into more next features.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.850
But there are two things I want to do.

00:12.870 --> 00:14.230
Three actually.

00:14.230 --> 00:19.030
The first is in the next of you fall in the admin area we have this normal button.

00:19.060 --> 00:24.090
Now I simply want to use my app button here just to get nice for styling.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.450
So I will use app button and to use it I need to import it.

00:28.480 --> 00:35.320
So we should add import to app button from ACT component's slash UI slash app button.

00:35.320 --> 00:39.310
And if you're wondering if there's an easier way then adding that to every component where you want

00:39.310 --> 00:39.890
to use it.

00:40.000 --> 00:40.470
Yes.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.610
And we'll dive into that soon.

00:43.030 --> 00:50.820
So now the patent is available here the other thing that's missing is the index not you fall in the

00:50.820 --> 00:52.230
off section.

00:52.230 --> 00:57.230
Now there I will copy in some code which you can also find attached to this video.

00:57.300 --> 01:04.200
This code here where I essentially create a form with control inputs and buttons where we can switch

01:04.200 --> 01:10.680
between log in and sign up here with this button at the bottom and where we can enter an e-mail address

01:10.710 --> 01:15.300
and a password where we can submit everything though right now we don't do anything.

01:15.300 --> 01:20.430
So we were not handling this but at least we have the styling and then we've got some starting here

01:20.430 --> 01:22.000
at the bottom two.

01:22.260 --> 01:24.200
So with that if we save this.

01:24.420 --> 01:34.650
Now if I reload the page I can see my updated button and on the admin area we can manually for now go

01:34.650 --> 01:38.920
to slash off to see this error again.

01:39.060 --> 01:46.050
Classic I guess we need to add our imports to control input and to add a button to the off in the view

01:46.050 --> 01:46.840
file.

01:47.040 --> 01:57.590
So add import app control input from add components you all my app control input.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.950
This is really annoying isn't it.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.420
So we'll soon fix this.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.260
No worries.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.370
So for now let's duplicate it.

02:03.470 --> 02:05.540
Also import app button.

02:05.640 --> 02:14.400
And let's add the components key here to this object down there and register app control input at App

02:14.490 --> 02:15.480
button here.

02:15.690 --> 02:21.420
And now with that we can reload this page and get a nice looking for and where we can switch between

02:21.420 --> 02:22.940
log in and sign up.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.870
And with that the admin area is looking pretty good.

02:26.070 --> 02:29.870
However what about conditional layouts.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.850
Why don't we use a different layout for the admin area.

02:32.970 --> 02:35.560
We might not need that normal head or indeed.
