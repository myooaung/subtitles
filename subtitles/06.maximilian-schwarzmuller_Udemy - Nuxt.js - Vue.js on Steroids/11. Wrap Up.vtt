00:02.340 --> 00:08.240
So in this morning we did one super important thing we connected a real back and to our app.

00:08.340 --> 00:15.970
And let me highlight this once again even though next can pre-rendered your pages on the server.

00:15.990 --> 00:19.120
It's not a suicide framework like Express's.

00:19.230 --> 00:26.190
Therefore in our next view code here we don't directly at code to connect to a database for something

00:26.190 --> 00:34.440
like debt we can access some server side resources like the request we got and we'll show you how to

00:34.440 --> 00:40.630
use that in a separate module where you can achieve a closer integration of next and your back end.

00:40.740 --> 00:46.650
But a typical set up old is this one which looks like in a normal single page application where you

00:46.650 --> 00:51.590
have a restful API as a back end where you send requests to the differences.

00:51.720 --> 00:58.680
We can already connect that back and on the server through access and next so that we can still get

00:58.680 --> 01:02.580
that initial data for our preview render page.

01:02.610 --> 01:04.560
And this is exactly what we're achieving here.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.260
We're doing Prete rendering.

01:06.390 --> 01:10.300
We don't have a super close connection between the back end and the front end.

01:10.350 --> 01:17.550
We're just doing pre rendering which is more than just us small just it's actually a big thing and it

01:17.550 --> 01:24.930
drapey enhances our view applications which now all of a sudden R-S.C. of friendly and that is a huge

01:24.930 --> 01:26.120
benefit.

01:26.220 --> 01:32.340
You learned how to add and manipulate data and how to update it locally in the store to always reflect

01:32.340 --> 01:36.840
the latest state even without fetching a new version from the server.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.970
These are all great things.

01:38.980 --> 01:45.870
Now it's time to have a closer look at the next configuration and improve our code base a little bit

01:46.260 --> 01:49.900
before we dentals and have a look at all indication middleware.

01:49.950 --> 01:55.800
And finally at the end of the course of course all that deployment and how to achieve that closer connection

01:55.800 --> 01:56.790
I was referring to.
