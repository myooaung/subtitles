Welcome to another module this far we get a detailed look at how routeing works how you work with pages

00:08.550 --> 00:11.960
with layouts of components and how you build your view.

00:11.970 --> 00:19.140
Nextstep location with all these building blocks now thus far we only used dummys static data which

00:19.200 --> 00:21.980
are hard coded into our templates.

00:21.990 --> 00:27.690
Now it's time to use dynamic data still not fetch from a database.

00:27.690 --> 00:29.560
We'll add this later though.

00:29.670 --> 00:36.750
But already at least loaded into our javascript code as if we were fetching it from my server or something

00:36.750 --> 00:37.640
like that.

00:37.650 --> 00:43.140
Now while we're at this we'll also have a look at how view X plays into this and how this all connects

00:43.140 --> 00:44.740
to server side rendering.

00:44.820 --> 00:47.970
Because there are some special things about that.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.740
Now let's dive right in and let's continue working on the project we started in the last module so that

00:53.760 --> 00:58.820
we can see how we can add some dynamic javascript controlled data to it.
