Before we dive into more pages and components for the different posts some pages and the admin area

00:09.600 --> 00:11.230
let's add some header.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.930
Wouldn't that make sense.

00:13.400 --> 00:21.050
So let's add a special header component to our application and I'll do this by creating a new folder

00:21.050 --> 00:26.590
in the components folder that navigation folder the name is totally up to you.

00:26.820 --> 00:33.290
Now here I am again prepared something I've prepared for components which you can find attached to this

00:33.290 --> 00:36.210
video which I'll just paste into the navigation folder.

00:36.470 --> 00:41.660
The headers of you for the site and after you fall and the side Neph toggled up you fall side there

00:41.690 --> 00:47.720
toggles a simple hamburger menu created with CSSA which we can click which emits a toggle event which

00:47.720 --> 00:50.540
you can listen to from Parad components.

00:50.570 --> 00:56.600
The header component includes that toggle and listens to that custom talking event were emitting it

00:56.600 --> 01:01.120
then emits a number event side nav toggle which will have to handle.

01:01.400 --> 01:05.240
Include some logo which is just some text with a next link though.

01:05.420 --> 01:12.220
And they have an arrogation items as normal list items with next links to blog about and Edman.

01:12.470 --> 01:18.480
And then I got some Stahl's at the bottom here two stalls all beautifully and the side nafas just forward

01:18.480 --> 01:19.870
to responsive layouts.

01:19.910 --> 01:28.790
This is just a backdrop and the side Neph itself with a little slight animation also with property it

01:28.790 --> 01:31.560
receives to decide whether it should be shown or not.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.830
And then some stylings.

01:33.830 --> 01:42.380
Now to use these components we will have to go to our default layout because I want to include that

01:42.380 --> 01:49.730
header in all my pages and to do that of first of all add a script section here because this will allow

01:49.730 --> 01:51.930
me to import these components.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.160
So let's import that header.

01:55.280 --> 02:00.050
And by the way if you're wondering about the naming this is following the official view style guide

02:00.330 --> 02:06.230
where are components that you really use only once should have a that at the beginning so that Hetter

02:06.470 --> 02:12.340
from at slash component's slash navigations slash the header.

02:12.410 --> 02:18.800
The the view is added automatically and then we don't just have the header but from the same folder

02:19.040 --> 02:27.000
we have the side nav we don't need to import to toggle because I'm using that in the header.

02:27.470 --> 02:30.840
Now this is my component import.

02:31.100 --> 02:38.250
Now I can add the components property duty view on an object here and added the header and the side.

02:38.260 --> 02:42.360
Now with that we can use these two components in our template.

02:42.530 --> 02:50.300
So above that next hook here where the actual page will be rendered I'll add that header as a self-closing

02:50.300 --> 02:50.850
tag.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.500
And the side nav has a self-closing tag.

02:55.080 --> 03:00.860
Now both is added but we need to listen to an event and do something to decide after determine whether

03:00.860 --> 03:02.490
it should be shown or not.

03:02.780 --> 03:09.500
So the header I'll add the event listener where I listen to side nav toggle simply because that is a

03:09.500 --> 03:17.930
custom event that gets emitted in the header here side nav toggle whenever this event occurs.

03:17.950 --> 03:22.430
I want to switch some property which I can then pass down to the side near.

03:22.660 --> 03:28.720
So to manage this property I'll add the normal data Meffert where I return an object as we should do

03:28.720 --> 03:35.890
it in view components where I have displayed site nav which is set to false initially.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.930
Now one has switched this property whenever this event occurs.

03:39.980 --> 03:43.230
So I will set the display side and to what it's currently not.

03:43.250 --> 03:50.030
This will essentially toggle it from true to false and the other way around to that side nav I need

03:50.030 --> 03:56.690
to pass my show property and I binded to the dynamic display side that value.

03:56.690 --> 04:03.090
Now the side nav component actually also emits an event whenever I click the backdrop.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.180
The close event is emitted.

04:05.240 --> 04:10.740
That's of course important because this ensures that we actually well close the site.

04:10.970 --> 04:19.400
If it's currently opened so let's implement this by going to the layout and by listening to at close

04:19.400 --> 04:28.320
here and then switching displays side nav to Foldes if it occurs with that if we go back we see that

04:28.320 --> 04:30.450
beautiful head are at the top already.

04:30.570 --> 04:38.580
And if a shrink does it switches to the mobile layout so that it looks much better I'd say this is now

04:38.580 --> 04:40.510
the header and so on implemented.

04:40.620 --> 04:46.500
Now I would say that the links inside neth are still wrong.

04:46.830 --> 04:49.380
I did this on purpose so that we can adjust it.

04:49.560 --> 04:56.460
So let's navigate to slash posts from a click on lawk to slash about if we click on about and to slash

04:56.520 --> 04:58.000
app and they click there.

04:58.170 --> 05:02.850
And with that if we go back now we can switch pages.

05:02.850 --> 05:07.050
However you will notice that the site stays open if you do so.

05:07.890 --> 05:12.430
Now to fix this we can do is we can simply emit to close event.

05:12.600 --> 05:19.680
Also whenever we click somewhere on there's an order list so somewhere on our navigation items let me

05:19.680 --> 05:23.610
quickly add does your.

05:23.640 --> 05:30.020
And now if I save that and go back and reload the page I can click onto these links and then all the

05:30.020 --> 05:31.740
clothes decide that then.

05:32.030 --> 05:37.250
So that we get a response of hador and navigation implement that.

05:37.250 --> 05:43.520
There is of course more we can do for example work on the entire posts section before we dentals later

05:43.520 --> 05:49.790
we'll have a look at how we populate this with real dynamic data instead of hard coding everything.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.990
But let's focus on our components first.
