00:02.060 --> 00:05.530
We already had a look at some of the settings we can set.

00:05.540 --> 00:07.610
Now let's continue.

00:07.610 --> 00:16.100
We also have debt loading property in the next conflict fall dis controls the progress bar you see at

00:16.100 --> 00:19.540
the top when you switch pages like here.

00:19.550 --> 00:26.870
If I go to about juiciness green flash at the top that is the progress bar controlled by next and you

00:26.870 --> 00:32.040
can easily change the color to a different hex code here by simply changing it.

00:32.360 --> 00:38.600
And once you did does and you navigate around and reload the page once and then we get around you see

00:38.750 --> 00:42.190
we have a different color for this navigation bar now.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.020
So this is how you can change that.

00:44.060 --> 00:49.700
And if you don't want the loading indicator at all you can also disable it.

00:49.700 --> 00:53.760
This is simply done by setting this two falls instead of a color.

00:53.780 --> 00:59.780
So now with that if I reload the page and I now navigate around we don't have to add loading indicator

01:00.260 --> 01:05.750
I'll turn it back on but you can of course set this to whichever setting you want.

01:05.930 --> 01:12.230
Important besides setting the color here and this object you can also set a special failed color by

01:12.230 --> 01:13.390
default that's red.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.110
But you could set it to yellow or whatever you want.

01:16.640 --> 01:23.930
You can also set the height so that you've got a broader bar like tool for pixels and you can also set

01:23.930 --> 01:26.240
the duration because that's important.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.530
This loading indicator doesn't really take as long as the process takes.

01:30.530 --> 01:33.470
It doesn't know how long the page changes will take.

01:33.470 --> 01:38.760
So we should set a sufficiently long duration so that it feels good to the user.

01:38.900 --> 01:44.120
And if it is done faster then this durational which it normally should be that it will just instantly

01:44.120 --> 01:46.330
complete not the worst user experience.

01:46.460 --> 01:52.520
If you set a too short duration this is way worse because now you give to user to fling off who I'm

01:52.520 --> 01:56.000
almost done and then the user isn't.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.580
So now I left a default which is five seconds but it greased to high to 4 pixels.

02:01.670 --> 02:07.670
And if I now reload the page and then navigate again we got a bit of a broader loading indicator as

02:07.670 --> 02:09.550
you can see a higher one.

02:09.890 --> 02:15.830
So this is the loading bar a very useful feature to control this to your needs.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.920
Important if you're trading a single page application.

02:19.940 --> 02:28.400
So if the mode is set to SBA and not to universal then you can add a loading indicator property too.

02:28.430 --> 02:34.070
Now that's not the same as loading bar which is controlled for loading the loading indicator instead

02:34.340 --> 02:36.400
is a spinner that's built in.

02:36.470 --> 02:41.570
And that will be shown during the initial rendering which then happens in the client since it's a single

02:41.570 --> 02:42.850
page application.

02:42.860 --> 02:48.830
So whilst we're waiting for that data you can show a loading indicator you can pick a name circle would

02:48.890 --> 02:50.820
display a circle.

02:50.850 --> 02:54.370
You can also pick a color FAA 9 to free.

02:54.690 --> 03:00.710
And if you now simply for a second switched switch mode to SPCA here and reload.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.500
Now you saw it for a fraction of a second because it's loading really fast.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.670
Here you saw the loading indicator.

03:07.950 --> 03:12.800
So this is something you can then also do now I'll switch back to you.

03:13.010 --> 03:16.940
Universal here so that our app works ask before again.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.400
But that's the loading indicator which you can use.

03:19.410 --> 03:24.750
Of course if your remote is a single page application then you have to load your data differently and

03:24.750 --> 03:26.790
not through async data.
