00:02.220 --> 00:06.680
Back in the project let's start with this next conflict file.

00:06.730 --> 00:14.200
This file is used whenever you run NPM run death or all later when you run the Obert build command.

00:14.200 --> 00:20.680
You have to prepare your application for deployment and the settings there are taken into account during

00:20.680 --> 00:22.460
the belt process.

00:22.460 --> 00:30.820
Do these settings here play a crucial role in what gets rendered out by next day can change the content

00:30.820 --> 00:37.000
of the pages which are created and that can also change some of the bill's settings like optimisation

00:37.000 --> 00:38.430
settings you might enable.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.410
So let's have a look at this fall.

00:40.570 --> 00:44.940
The site's going for does fall here where you always see some of the settings.

00:45.190 --> 00:49.920
You also might want to check out the official Nax documentation you can find it on next.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.990
J.S. dot org.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.200
There you'll find this configuration point.

00:55.280 --> 01:00.910
And chances are that the page looks a bit differently when you're viewing this because the next team

01:00.910 --> 01:02.380
is still working on it.

01:02.500 --> 01:07.420
But the general structure should be the same and there should be some configuration guide.

01:07.590 --> 01:12.750
Now if you click on it you'll see all the possible settings you can find.

01:12.850 --> 01:18.910
And you always get links which you can click on to find very detailed instructions on how to adjust

01:18.970 --> 01:22.080
every tiny piece except that to your needs.

01:22.210 --> 01:28.090
Obviously we can't go through all of that but I want to go through some of the settings at least in

01:28.090 --> 01:29.460
the next conflict file.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.430
Let's start with the moat.

01:31.450 --> 01:37.440
The moat is set to universal because I've picked this as a mode when I created the project with Create

01:37.450 --> 01:38.530
next app.

01:38.680 --> 01:43.830
The alternative would be as a for single page application.

01:43.870 --> 01:50.350
Now universal simply means that we take advantage of next prae rendering capabilities where it renders

01:50.350 --> 01:57.760
the view views on the server already whereas SBA means we just take advantage of this configuration

01:57.760 --> 02:02.760
by folder approach Naks gives us we take advantage of all the optimizations that does.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.300
But we don't use the service side pretty rendering.

02:05.410 --> 02:11.420
We just get a static normal single page application just as if we had not used next.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.620
But of course with the benefits of the next conference on as I just mentioned.

02:15.850 --> 02:20.650
So these are the two modes and you can pick whichever you will need or whichever you want do you want

02:20.650 --> 02:25.430
to pre-rendered capabilities then you should set this to universal Do you not.

02:25.460 --> 02:31.990
Didi's do you just want to create SBA with the additional next features and the ease of use X gives

02:31.990 --> 02:39.820
you then you should set this to SBA the head section is an interesting one in the head section you can

02:39.940 --> 02:45.850
find some general data that should be written to the head of any rendered page.

02:45.850 --> 02:50.080
So we've had I mean DHV email head element and head area.

02:50.380 --> 02:57.820
Every document has whatever goes into the next conflict is added to every single page to the head.

02:57.820 --> 03:03.600
For example the title here is always set to the package name and package simply as the package deal

03:03.620 --> 03:04.590
Jason.

03:04.630 --> 03:09.490
But you can of course change this here so we could set this to W D block here.

03:10.480 --> 03:16.290
For web development block and now with that if we save this and we don't even need to restart the server

03:16.920 --> 03:23.680
we always see that if we restart the page or reload the page title here at the top and the tab did change

03:23.680 --> 03:31.030
to W.D. block then we all have that Medha rate where we can simply define Mehta text that should be

03:31.030 --> 03:38.380
added to the head section and the approach always is to put it into a javascript object where you basically

03:38.380 --> 03:41.190
reflect the attributes of the meta tags.

03:41.230 --> 03:46.990
So like the name attribute and then the content to set the default viewport and the description which

03:46.990 --> 03:53.140
is all the pulled out of the package took chase in this case we could of course also adjust the description

03:53.140 --> 04:02.380
here and say my cool web development lark with that if we save this we will see that change once we

04:02.380 --> 04:08.410
reload the page and inspect the page source code there in the head section at the top.

04:08.410 --> 04:14.060
It's a bit hard to read because it's all inline but there you see that description tag with daemonic

04:14.080 --> 04:16.220
will web development block content.

04:16.510 --> 04:23.200
So this is how you can adjust DS Maira attacks which are of course important for search engine optimizations

04:23.350 --> 04:26.310
for share ability why of Facebook and Twitter.

04:26.350 --> 04:32.470
So that is how you can configure this and you can also easily include links here for example so you

04:32.470 --> 04:38.450
can include links to our CDN hosted resources if you wanted to be there like.

04:38.530 --> 04:45.400
Well basically what you can already see here behind the scenes does head configuration here is using

04:45.400 --> 04:50.650
the view Maeder package to which you find a link at the end of this module in case you want to learn

04:50.650 --> 04:55.990
more about it and more about the settings you can set here because it's more than just title merda and

04:55.990 --> 04:56.530
link.

04:56.530 --> 05:00.070
So definitely check the last lecture in this module to learn more.

05:00.100 --> 05:07.010
Speaking of that head area you're not limited to some general settings next conflict here.

05:07.060 --> 05:10.750
DS settings are applied to every page and first some settings.

05:10.750 --> 05:16.750
We want this but sometimes you also want to overwrite this for specific pages or you just want to set

05:16.750 --> 05:24.400
certain tags or some elements on certain pages and you can always do that on any page component and

05:24.460 --> 05:30.100
only on page components not on average components not on the default components.

05:30.100 --> 05:37.810
So on any page component you can go in like let's say for a single post under the ID folder and you

05:37.810 --> 05:49.700
can add a head property to your data here to your component object not head her head and in there you

05:49.700 --> 05:58.150
can now again set things like the title here for example we could set up a blog post as a title.

05:58.190 --> 06:04.340
Now if that if we save this and we go back and click click on a single post and reload this page we

06:04.340 --> 06:07.430
see ablock post as the title in the tab up here.

06:07.610 --> 06:12.410
So this is how we can override these settings on a per page level.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.430
And of course not just a title but of course any of the settings that can be set with you.

06:18.650 --> 06:20.850
So that is the head section.

06:20.990 --> 06:26.160
Now in the next lecture I want to cover the average configurations we can adjust in the next config

06:26.160 --> 06:26.790
file.
