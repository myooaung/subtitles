00:02.170 --> 00:05.150
Now let's add a back end to our next ep.

00:05.180 --> 00:09.890
And as I said for now I will use a third party back in or not necessarily for a party.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.250
Put your own back and.

00:11.360 --> 00:18.770
But living on a different server than the server we used to render our next app all use firebase which

00:18.770 --> 00:25.580
is a service a service service where I don't have to manage to serve a set up which is free for the

00:25.880 --> 00:30.320
amount of use which will happen this course we could check out the pricing to find out more and see

00:30.320 --> 00:33.650
if your plan usage such also is within the free plan.

00:33.650 --> 00:38.450
And then you can simply create a console with your Google accounts and make sure to create one and log

00:38.450 --> 00:44.050
in there you can add a new project I'll name mine.

00:44.060 --> 00:47.180
Next block pick your location.

00:47.180 --> 00:50.420
This does not affect the pricing and clicked create.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.810
This will give you a new firebase project.

00:52.910 --> 00:55.570
I won't dive deeply into firebase in this course.

00:55.580 --> 01:01.310
It's not a firebase course I just use it because it's a simple to get started back and which will also

01:01.310 --> 01:04.360
allow us to later implement authentication.

01:04.520 --> 01:08.280
Now for now I just want to use one main feature and that's that database.

01:08.300 --> 01:14.800
So click on database on the console that opened and in there you have the choice between two databases.

01:14.830 --> 01:20.360
I'll use the real time database which is the older and longer existing database.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.760
Firebase has no end there.

01:22.790 --> 01:29.570
You simply sent HTP requests to dead end point or two sub end points which reflect this structure of

01:29.570 --> 01:33.680
data you have in the database eventually to store and get data.

01:34.130 --> 01:41.150
For now I'll go to the rules tab first and there you should set both read and write access to true will

01:41.210 --> 01:42.590
later change just one.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.230
We added authentication.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.680
But for now we want to enable everyone to read and write data.

01:47.810 --> 01:52.940
These are of course not settings you want to have in production but for now to get started quickly that's

01:52.940 --> 01:53.500
great.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.840
And now I want to be able to store data and fetch data.

01:58.930 --> 02:03.990
We'll start with storing data in the next lecture because it's often easier to fetch data.
