Welcome to this course is really great to have you on board in this course.

00:06.770 --> 00:14.540
We'll dive into next to J.S. which is a framework that builds up on beauty as it makes the development

00:14.600 --> 00:22.100
of future as applications even more fun and even easier by adding a lot of cool features that save us

00:22.100 --> 00:24.580
time and make things while easier.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.730
And it especially makes one thing easier.

00:27.740 --> 00:31.410
The service side rendering of view takes applications.

00:31.550 --> 00:34.560
You'll learn how next year's works for this course.

00:34.580 --> 00:37.430
We'll dive into it and will not just dive into it.

00:37.430 --> 00:45.260
In theory we will build an entire course project a blog with both a front end and an administration

00:45.290 --> 00:45.930
back.

00:46.040 --> 00:52.730
So we'll also talk about things like off indication of this course at the end of this course you will

00:52.730 --> 00:58.290
not just know how Knox works and how you can use it to build amazing the web applications.

00:58.310 --> 01:04.460
You will also learn which different types of view applications you can build because you're not limited

01:04.490 --> 01:10.580
to serve a side rendered ones as you will see this coerse hopefully adds an important building block

01:10.610 --> 01:17.010
to your future development career and I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did creating it now.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.720
Enough talking about the course.

01:18.740 --> 01:19.940
Who am I.

01:19.940 --> 01:21.730
My name is Maximillian Schwartz moolah.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.580
I'm a freelance web developer and they work a lot with you.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.660
J.S. I'm not lying when telling you that.

01:28.670 --> 01:33.070
When I discovered next day as I couldn't believe how much more fun.

01:33.080 --> 01:39.500
View as application development can be because it already was a lot of fun but we have next years it

01:39.500 --> 01:46.430
really is on a new level and my team's Web page a catamite dot com is even built with Naks so I'm sure

01:46.430 --> 01:48.550
I can pass some useful knowledge to you.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.980
And with that let's dive right in I'd say.
