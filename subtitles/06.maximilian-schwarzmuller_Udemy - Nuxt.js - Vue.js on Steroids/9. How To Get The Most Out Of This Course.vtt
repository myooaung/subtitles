00:02.150 --> 00:03.990
So time to dive into the course.

00:04.040 --> 00:06.900
And of course I want to ensure that you get the most out of it.

00:07.130 --> 00:12.590
Now the best way or the first thing you should do is watch videos that's super important.

00:12.590 --> 00:13.960
Watch the videos.

00:13.970 --> 00:18.090
Post them if I am moving too fast or if you need to think about something.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.240
Feel free to reduce the playback speed or increase it.

00:22.250 --> 00:27.710
If I'm going too fast or slow make sure that you adjust everything to your needs and watch the videos.

00:27.710 --> 00:30.610
But don't forget to zip code along.

00:30.620 --> 00:35.680
We built an entire project in this course and you'll learn the most if you write de-code for your own.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.980
There'll be mistakes from time to time and data is where you learn the most.

00:39.980 --> 00:46.280
If there are mistakes debark them on your own first you can find my source code attached to many lectures

00:46.310 --> 00:52.280
for the course as well as the last lecture of each module and I did attach to code there so did you

00:52.280 --> 00:57.800
have a convenient way of comparing your code to mine and find out what's causing death specific error

00:57.860 --> 00:59.280
you're getting.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.830
If you absolutely can't find a solution.

01:01.910 --> 01:06.440
Feel free to ask him to Q&amp;A section and I'll be more than happy to help you there.

01:06.710 --> 01:13.820
But also try helping average students dare answer questions because and that is something I emphasize

01:13.820 --> 01:15.350
in every course I create.

01:15.350 --> 01:17.020
This is how you learn the most.

01:17.090 --> 01:23.780
I get so many students telling me Hey I started answering and that really helped me learn whatever the

01:23.780 --> 01:24.880
course taught.

01:25.130 --> 01:29.630
And it's true you'll learn far more if you answer it because we're Denne challenged to think about a

01:29.630 --> 01:35.720
problem and come up with a solution which is always harder than asking but it's always where you learn

01:35.720 --> 01:37.540
the most and nothing can go wrong.

01:37.550 --> 01:39.630
The answer is wrong or incomplete.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.770
Well then someone's going to correct you and then you'll learn again.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.660
So definitely give this a try.

01:44.830 --> 01:48.870
And with that you've got all the tools you need to get a lot out of this course and to learn.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.270
Next genius.

01:50.300 --> 01:55.330
So let's dive in and let's dive into the next module where we start working with next.
