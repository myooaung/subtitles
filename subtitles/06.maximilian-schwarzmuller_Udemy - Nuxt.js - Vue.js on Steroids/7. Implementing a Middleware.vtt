00:02.060 --> 00:08.270
So let's implement a model where now off middleware that actually redirects the user if he tries to

00:08.270 --> 00:12.700
access a page which requires a vindication if he's not offended hated.

00:12.890 --> 00:17.870
So in the middleware folder I'll add a new file which the name of J.S. no.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.460
Copy the code from the lockjaw as malware.

00:20.660 --> 00:24.320
But of course the logic will differ here in here.

00:24.320 --> 00:31.020
I simply want to check whether to use or is often indicated and if he's not I want to redirect him now

00:31.040 --> 00:32.110
to check that.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.060
Let's go to our store first.

00:34.190 --> 00:35.500
And then at the bottom.

00:35.510 --> 00:40.720
I'll add a Gadar Aleta is authenticated Geter.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.690
This is a really simple Geter that will simply recheck if we have a token or not.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.470
If we have one the user is offene hated.

00:48.560 --> 00:54.270
So here I will return state token an equal to know if it's not.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.560
Now if we do have a token then the user is a FINUCAN it.

00:57.620 --> 00:58.680
That's the logic here.

00:58.820 --> 01:03.110
And yes the token can expire but that something will happen later.

01:03.110 --> 01:04.730
For now does our logic.

01:04.730 --> 01:09.340
So let's go back to the middleware to the chase file and in there.

01:09.590 --> 01:16.740
Let's now simply check whether we do have that token for Dabi can access the store on the context object.

01:16.880 --> 01:23.030
And there are getters and their D is authenticated Gadar which will return true or false because remember

01:23.180 --> 01:27.030
we are returning the result of that check.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.040
So we get true or false here.

01:29.310 --> 01:35.400
And if this is true then everything is all right but if it's false and therefore at exclamation mark

01:36.000 --> 01:42.930
I want to call context redirect a helper function which allows us to help redirect the request to a

01:42.930 --> 01:44.340
different page.

01:44.340 --> 01:50.910
In this case here I want to go to slash admin slash off.

01:50.930 --> 01:57.710
So to our side Inforum now we just need to use that middleware and we could add it to all pages in the

01:57.710 --> 01:59.310
admin section.

01:59.420 --> 02:03.790
We could also added to the entire admin lay out this one.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.330
This would almost be right.

02:05.330 --> 02:12.500
The problem chest is the off page is also part of that layout and to this page we should actually be

02:12.500 --> 02:13.420
able to go.

02:13.670 --> 02:18.090
So therefore I will added manually to all these Admin Pages here.

02:18.200 --> 02:23.640
The alternative would be to not use this admin layout on this page.

02:23.660 --> 02:27.370
Then you could use the middleware on the overall admin layout.

02:27.740 --> 02:30.590
So here on that we start adding the middleware.

02:30.850 --> 02:37.740
I'll add it to my main index file here off Mitla where the index that you fall in the Edmon area.

02:38.020 --> 02:43.640
I'll add it to new post of course because this should be protected and by the way if you want to add

02:43.640 --> 02:47.420
multiple Middlers you can't just pass an array of strings.

02:47.420 --> 02:50.310
This also works so this is also valid.

02:50.510 --> 02:53.440
So this is now middleware added to the new post.

02:53.510 --> 02:56.770
I don't want to add to my log in sign up page here.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.670
I do want to add it to this single post page though so here.

03:00.710 --> 03:08.270
I'll also add that middleware with that make sure to save all files and once you did this let's actually

03:08.270 --> 03:14.190
go to slash admin you'll see that I'm redirected to the log in Forum.

03:14.480 --> 03:25.110
Let's go to slash admin new post and I'm redirected to the app and for him to log in for him.

03:25.190 --> 03:29.950
If I do log it though I can go to all these Obert pages.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.180
So does this now working as it should.

03:32.180 --> 03:35.930
We're now using middleware in an environment where it makes sense.

03:35.930 --> 03:41.090
Still there are some things which aren't that great if we ever reload the page.

03:41.090 --> 03:45.680
We end up back on the log in forum because our state isn't persistent.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.950
Additionally the token return from firebase only is valid for one hour.

03:51.050 --> 03:56.530
It's times out there after you can refresh it and you can read more about this new firebase docs.

03:56.540 --> 04:01.970
I won't do it here but what I do want to do is I want to store it across page refreshes.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.060
But on the aberant get rid of it once it does expire.

04:05.180 --> 04:08.640
These are all things we'll implement over the next lectures.
