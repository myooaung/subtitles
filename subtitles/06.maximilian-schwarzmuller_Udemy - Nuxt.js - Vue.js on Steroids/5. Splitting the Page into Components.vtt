00:02.320 --> 00:11.440
Now we started adding content to our starting page and styles we can already see that this page is getting

00:11.530 --> 00:12.830
quite big.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.410
We're putting all our logic all our code in here.

00:17.410 --> 00:24.700
Now obviously the posts here will be rendered dynamically in the future but still we do the entire styling

00:24.700 --> 00:28.540
of all the different pieces of this page manually.

00:28.540 --> 00:34.060
Actually however we could split it up into some components and we should do so.

00:34.060 --> 00:41.740
View is all about creating such small building blocks and it makes your application easier to manage

00:41.860 --> 00:44.630
and easier to exchange these building blocks.

00:44.650 --> 00:46.710
Update them or reuse them.

00:46.840 --> 00:54.490
If you outsource the logic the stylist template into components and the perfect component of what be

00:54.490 --> 00:55.230
disposed.

00:55.230 --> 01:00.670
Preview thing here where we have the next link with our preview HDMI code.

01:00.970 --> 01:06.640
We should put that into its own components so let's go to the components folder and then they're all

01:06.640 --> 01:08.390
remove the logo W-4.

01:08.410 --> 01:15.400
We don't use that rebuilt component anymore but in there all now create a new folder posts because I

01:15.400 --> 01:22.400
want to store all my posts related components in that folder so that I have some organization now in

01:22.430 --> 01:27.840
their altered and you follow the post previewed that if you fall into a convention to name ID like this

01:27.850 --> 01:36.370
in Pascal case the post previewed or you fall will have a template and my template is just this next

01:36.490 --> 01:41.910
link thing which I highlighted in the index that you followed directly in the pages folder.

01:42.110 --> 01:46.710
OK did from there and remove the second one too so that this is now.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.730
But the MTA and I'll go back to the Post review and entered here as a template.

01:51.730 --> 01:54.110
I want to use just like that.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.180
Now the template alone isn't worth that much.

01:57.190 --> 02:04.750
We all need our styles so all scope them again by adding scope and then I'll go back to the index that

02:04.810 --> 02:07.630
you follow again which I can work on.

02:07.990 --> 02:12.480
And now here I'll again grab all the post preview relate that Stahl's.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.250
So from post preview and below.

02:15.580 --> 02:18.580
Wrap them all cut them from the page file.

02:18.610 --> 02:24.370
I don't need them here and instead move them to the Post review because they only are relevant to this

02:24.370 --> 02:26.210
post preview.

02:26.380 --> 02:30.890
Now with that we got our page cleaned up a bit.

02:30.940 --> 02:34.270
Now of course we need to import our posts pre-boot component.

02:34.450 --> 02:40.870
So in the index that you fall in the pages folder I'll add a script section and I'll add the imports

02:40.930 --> 02:45.550
import statement where they import post preview from and then it's at.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.260
Slash component's slash.

02:48.340 --> 02:53.250
And then we used that posts folder and there to post preview file.

02:53.260 --> 03:00.910
You have to admit Didon view it will be added automatically and then in the component object of this

03:00.910 --> 03:07.480
page you add the components propertied you understands and you refer to post preview which behind the

03:07.480 --> 03:12.250
scenes is extended to post preview with a value of post preview.

03:12.820 --> 03:18.560
This allows us to use that as a component in our featured posts section.

03:18.700 --> 03:23.320
So I use it as a normal HTL element as self-closing one though.

03:23.350 --> 03:28.660
Because I don't need to pass anything between opening and closing text and now I can replicate this

03:28.660 --> 03:34.000
free times to save and go back and have three equal posts.

03:34.000 --> 03:34.740
Great.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.900
That may make it a bit bigger like this.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.820
So that's the first step.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.360
Now of course we want to pass some data to that component though because right now we hard code everything

03:46.360 --> 03:47.070
in there.

03:47.080 --> 03:54.160
In reality we'd like to render different posts and pass different information pieces to the post therefore

03:55.090 --> 03:56.930
we can do this with props.

03:57.010 --> 04:01.350
A normal view concept not related to next.

04:01.540 --> 04:06.910
So therefore I'll add a script object and area to the post preview component.

04:06.910 --> 04:10.720
We can give the component a name which only helps us with debugging.

04:10.720 --> 04:14.200
Basically we can see that if we get any error messages.

04:14.230 --> 04:18.790
More importantly I'll add a props object when I want to find the props.

04:18.810 --> 04:27.490
This component works with for example is the ideal Propp we can define it by passing an object as an

04:27.490 --> 04:30.640
argument for it and set to type to string.

04:30.790 --> 04:33.030
And this is all default view chase.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.010
Not next specific.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.750
So we set to type 2 string and we set it to be required because we need to know the id of the post we're

04:40.750 --> 04:42.430
rendering.

04:42.430 --> 04:49.140
Then we can add a title that also is a string and that also will be required.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.340
We need to know what title to output.

04:51.880 --> 04:59.270
We all need a preview text so that also should be a string in the end and it should be required.

04:59.710 --> 05:02.210
And of course I want to have a thumbnail.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.380
So let's add a thumbnail prompt that will be a path to the thumbnail.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.060
So also a string and it also is required.

05:10.450 --> 05:17.230
Now this becomes really reusable because now you can just use these props like ID here for example just

05:17.230 --> 05:18.310
referring to ID.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.970
This will refer to this Propp we receive.

05:21.400 --> 05:28.990
I can use title of course here instead of hard coding post title I can outpoured output to the title

05:28.990 --> 05:35.150
property in whichever value it holds the preview text can be output down there.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.660
So let's output preview text here.

05:38.290 --> 05:43.990
And of course the thumbnail can be used in R U or L here for dad.

05:44.140 --> 05:52.480
I turned a style binding into a dynamic one by adding a colon and then its background image in camel

05:52.480 --> 05:56.130
case so that it's a valid property in javascript.

05:56.170 --> 06:05.800
It also has to be inside a javascript object which we actually pass to the style binding as an argument.

06:05.940 --> 06:12.650
And now I just need to ensure that here this u r l thing actually is a string.

06:12.690 --> 06:15.650
So let's wrap it with quotation marks.

06:15.660 --> 06:18.650
Now this is broken because we already have quotation marks.

06:18.710 --> 06:26.630
So inside of there however I will just skip out of that string temporarily like this because here I

06:26.640 --> 06:30.600
dynamically want to output from there so I will still construct that you are l.

06:30.650 --> 06:33.940
But to a fan mail I receive from outside.

06:34.020 --> 06:41.120
Now does this relate reuseable but forces us to use our post preview component a bit differently.

06:41.130 --> 06:45.590
In our indexed w file in our pages folder there.

06:45.600 --> 06:54.870
Post preview now only works if we pass an ID one for example if we pass a link to a thumbnail and here

06:54.930 --> 06:57.270
I will use the same link as before.

06:57.270 --> 06:59.860
You can of course pick any you or else you want.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.080
And we can also set the title here like.

07:04.270 --> 07:11.910
Hello there or the preview text this is my first post.

07:13.720 --> 07:19.620
And now we can remove the post previous and replicate this first one here.

07:20.870 --> 07:29.670
Leydet simply put multiple posts where we now pass different props so different ideas different titles.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.280
Hello there.

07:31.280 --> 07:37.020
The second time because this is my second post and then maybe.

07:37.040 --> 07:45.930
Hi this is my first post and if we save this and we go back now you see the different data in the posts.

07:45.950 --> 07:48.000
The image is the same because I pass the same.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.070
You are l but the text differs and if I click on them you all the c you are l the d id which will load

07:55.510 --> 07:56.930
is a different one.

07:56.960 --> 08:03.460
Here is slash post slash one and here it slash posts slash too.

08:03.950 --> 08:11.870
So this is how we can have a nice co-existence and actually not just that but a nice approach where

08:11.870 --> 08:20.690
we use Page components for the general structure of a page but then small focused components stored

08:20.690 --> 08:26.210
in the components folder for the bowling blocks that make up our pages.
