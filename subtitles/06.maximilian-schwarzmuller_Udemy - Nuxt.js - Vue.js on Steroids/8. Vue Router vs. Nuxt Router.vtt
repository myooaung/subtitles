00:02.150 --> 00:04.810
Now what are we added navigation in the last lecture.

00:04.810 --> 00:10.060
There's one thing you can see I never get around between the different sections even though not all

00:10.060 --> 00:11.470
of them load.

00:11.470 --> 00:17.150
We do see Deady active link is highlighted in the navigation bar.

00:17.470 --> 00:26.180
Now that is happening because in my head or component here I actually have a special Seer's styling

00:26.180 --> 00:27.000
set up.

00:27.370 --> 00:32.730
I'm styling any anchor tech that has the next link active class.

00:32.800 --> 00:40.480
This is a class automatically added to the well active links of your page and an active link is simply

00:40.480 --> 00:43.130
determined by the you or else you're on.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.480
And the POF the link is pointing to.

00:45.480 --> 00:51.370
So if you or you or else starts with Slash posts this link will be treated as active and actually the

00:51.370 --> 00:58.930
behavior here is exactly the behavior you find in the official view router because the next router in

00:58.930 --> 01:03.090
quotation marks just uses the view router behind the scenes.

01:03.430 --> 01:08.930
So therefore all you can read in the official view router documentation applies to the next router.

01:09.010 --> 01:15.740
The only differences that you use knucks to link to well link to your routes instead of a router link

01:16.000 --> 01:22.300
but the properties you see here can all be accessed and used just as you read it in the official view

01:22.300 --> 01:26.840
router page and that is something important which I definitely wanted to highlight.
