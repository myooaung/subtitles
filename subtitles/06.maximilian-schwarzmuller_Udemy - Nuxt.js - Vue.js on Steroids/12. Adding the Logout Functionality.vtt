00:02.160 --> 00:04.160
Now we're almost done with this module.

00:04.170 --> 00:07.950
One thing is missing though a way to log out.

00:07.950 --> 00:09.420
We don't have debt.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.620
Now where do we at this lock out functionality.

00:13.620 --> 00:20.040
I would go to my Edmon main page here where I have the button to create a new post next to it.

00:20.130 --> 00:23.520
I'll simply add a new button where I say log out.

00:23.580 --> 00:29.070
Now it is of course just one way you can use a different way but this is a quick and easy way of adding

00:29.070 --> 00:31.630
such a functionality upon a click.

00:31.640 --> 00:38.010
I want to trigger on a log out this function and this function therefore should now be handled in this

00:38.040 --> 00:39.620
indexed view file.

00:39.630 --> 00:47.900
Now to do that I'll add a methods property and handle on log out here and then on log out I want to

00:47.910 --> 00:50.520
dispatch a to be created action Det.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.460
Guess what locks to use are out.

00:52.650 --> 00:57.190
So something like this stored dispatch log out.

00:57.220 --> 01:03.210
That's the idea for that I'll go to the store now in next chance in the store folder.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.790
And let's add this log out functionality.

01:07.810 --> 01:12.450
So here all ADD does log out action.

01:12.670 --> 01:16.090
And I as always get X context here.

01:16.920 --> 01:25.970
And then actually I simply want to commit the clear token method the clear token notation.

01:25.970 --> 01:32.400
I should say because I want to remove the token from the store if we log out now with sites dead.

01:32.550 --> 01:37.080
I also want to unset a token at the expiration date and the cookie.

01:37.110 --> 01:38.490
So here is the cookie.

01:38.490 --> 01:56.270
I also want to call remove token and cookie remove token expiration or I name that expiration date I

01:56.270 --> 01:58.160
guess yeah.

01:58.390 --> 01:59.380
So I removed that

02:02.450 --> 02:07.430
and the token was called JWT and all cleared for local storage.

02:07.430 --> 02:11.080
So local storage remove item.

02:11.480 --> 02:21.490
And here we stored the token a token key or with the token key and the expiration with token expiration.

02:21.530 --> 02:28.820
So I want to clear the token key from local storage and I also want to remove the item with the token

02:28.820 --> 02:30.560
expiration from local storage.

02:30.560 --> 02:35.790
So I'm cleaning up my local storage and cooking too besides my local state.

02:36.140 --> 02:41.720
This new log Lagat function is actually a great function to call in other places where we use clear

02:41.720 --> 02:42.420
tokens.

02:42.620 --> 02:48.710
So essentially here if we check whether we do have a valid token or an expired one.

02:48.980 --> 02:54.560
So here I can call you x context dispatch log out simply.

02:54.590 --> 02:58.790
This will then bundle all these functionalities and clean everything up.

02:59.060 --> 03:04.840
With that in place let's save this and let's go back to the application let's quickly log in to should

03:04.850 --> 03:06.610
still work hopefully.

03:07.070 --> 03:11.190
And we can't let you get around as we did before so this should still work.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.940
But now we get that log out button here sitting next to create post.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.450
We can work on the styling here.

03:16.460 --> 03:21.300
But let's now click log out and now if I try to go somewhere else and redirected.

03:21.420 --> 03:23.950
Obviously I want to get redirected instantly.

03:24.150 --> 03:26.280
So we go back to index the view.

03:26.460 --> 03:33.270
And besides dispatching log out all reach out to my router and so simply push me back to admin of your

03:33.270 --> 03:38.070
immediately so that I'm redirected to the log in page if I'm logging out.

03:38.430 --> 03:45.150
And we wanted to fix the styling here because the button is sitting right next to Deandra button.

03:45.480 --> 03:53.670
Now what we can do is we can simply add a quick and dirty margin left 10 pixels here.

03:53.680 --> 03:59.110
As a style styles are passed down to the button so we can add it to our custom component.

03:59.110 --> 04:04.400
And with that if we try this again and we quickly log in.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.270
Now this looks better.

04:06.590 --> 04:14.300
And now we can again still navigate around at some exclamation marks your safeties see it here all working

04:14.690 --> 04:15.940
go there again.

04:15.950 --> 04:17.870
So that's looking great.

04:17.870 --> 04:25.130
We can also of course temporarily go back to our main area and click around here and then go back to

04:25.130 --> 04:27.400
the admin area and we should still be locked in.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.670
But if I click log out now this does not work.

04:30.860 --> 04:34.140
I can still go back to my main area though.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.740
But if I go back to the Edmon area again I end up here.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.270
So this is all working.

04:39.290 --> 04:45.200
And if we expect our view store here we see clear token was dispatched and our current status doesn't

04:45.200 --> 04:46.520
have one.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.650
So that's all working.

04:47.660 --> 04:53.390
That's the authentic part finished for now and I hope you'll learn useful things about how authentication

04:53.390 --> 05:00.650
can work and on which things or ideas you can build up on and refine does for your requirements and

05:00.650 --> 05:01.250
your EP.
