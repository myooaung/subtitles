00:02.140 --> 00:06.010
Let's Next add a functionality to invalidate the token.

00:06.010 --> 00:12.430
After one hour because tokens were turned by firebase are only valid for this one hour for security

00:12.430 --> 00:13.580
reasons.

00:13.630 --> 00:17.110
We actually get the expiry time as part of the response.

00:17.140 --> 00:22.840
It's stored in expires in field and you can always console log the response of the log in or sign up

00:22.840 --> 00:28.990
requests to see which fields are included or of course check the official docs there.

00:28.990 --> 00:34.840
You can also see that there is a expires in a field which holds to number of seconds until the token

00:34.840 --> 00:35.950
expires.

00:36.310 --> 00:40.890
So it expires after one hour right now or we get devalued anyways.

00:40.930 --> 00:45.690
I now want to set a timer whenever we got the token and whenever we set it.

00:45.700 --> 00:52.030
So essentially here when they commit set token this is where I also want to start a timer to invalidate

00:52.030 --> 00:53.800
the token for this.

00:53.830 --> 01:03.400
First of all add a new mutation which I would call clear token here I get my state and the only thing

01:03.460 --> 01:09.740
I'd do in here is I'd set token equal to null again to get rid of it.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.830
This should be executed offered the expiry time.

01:12.910 --> 01:23.230
So I'll now add a new action after authenticated user which I'll call set log out timer here I expect

01:23.260 --> 01:28.010
to get my duration when this should expire.

01:28.360 --> 01:35.890
And that will then set a timer with set timeout where I will execute some code and this anonymous function

01:36.220 --> 01:38.460
ofter duration.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.140
That's the idea.

01:40.150 --> 01:45.250
Now the thing I want to do here is of course something I get from my Buick's context which is my first

01:45.250 --> 01:57.480
argument and each action and there I simply commit clear token so I clear my token offer duration.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.950
I want to dispatch this action whenever I set the token.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.760
So here I will call view x context.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.880
Dispatch does function is available on the context.

02:09.690 --> 02:21.910
Set log out timer and pass result is the response of all requests result expires in remember death the

02:21.910 --> 02:25.010
field which holds the amount of time in seconds.

02:25.210 --> 02:29.200
Now the timer sets time or takes a duration and milli seconds though.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.020
So it will multiply does with 1000.

02:32.080 --> 02:37.320
This will now set a timer that invalidates the token after Does expiry time.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.320
Now that's a good first step.

02:39.520 --> 02:45.670
But it still doesn't help us with the problem that we're actually not persisting to token across page

02:45.670 --> 02:46.680
refreshes.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.680
So this is something else I will tackle and it will do so in the next lecture.
