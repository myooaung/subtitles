00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
know that we have added few contact details to our file as a repository in this lecture,

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.180
let's right the controller on service functionality for handling the get request to give

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.790
all the context to the client.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.150
So to begin with,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.050
let's write a function in our service called Get All Contacts,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.040
and all I have to do is to return a copy of the content maintained by Distort Contacts.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.450
On I'll have to do is to use a spread operator over here and then say this dot contacts

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.400
Notice.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.170
This particular function may not have any validations over here because there is no

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.280
parameters coming in,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250
and hence this function is very,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.010
very simple.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.720
So let's go to the controller on in the controller.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.050
I'm gonna write a function here called that they get all contacts and the name of the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.340
function can be anything you want on return.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.970
This starts.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.170
Surveys don't get all contacts that I'll have to do.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.810
But in order for the user requests to reach here,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.580
I need to decorate this with other it get without any perimeters on our get request.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.130
Handler,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.740
along with its service function,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.220
is really let's go to the postman and very for the same thing.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.570
So if I go on,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.800
copy this urine,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.830
open a new tab,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.600
make a get request this time basted Ural on Bentley Concern I should get the context that I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.760
have in my database,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.170
which are nothing but three.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.070
The course that I argued in the previous example Let's click the send button and now you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.430
can see we got all the context as another.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.560
So that's all for this lecture.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.660
In the next lecture,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.170
let's try toe Access an unusual contact object based on the I.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.560
D.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.730
And in case the idea is invalid,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.300
it should also give for not for error.
