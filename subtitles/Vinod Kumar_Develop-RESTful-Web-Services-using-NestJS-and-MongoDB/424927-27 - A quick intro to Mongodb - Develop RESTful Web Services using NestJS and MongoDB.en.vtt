00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
in this lecture,

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.140
let me introduce you to Mongo DB,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.150
which is the most popular no sequel database management system.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.030
It is a cross platform,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.150
document oriented database management system classified as a no sequel database program.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.410
Mongo DB uses Jason late documents with optional scheme.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.220
US Mongo DB was developed by engines after company in 2007 as a component off a platform as

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.250
a service product.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.740
In total nine,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.830
the company shifted to an open source developing Modern.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.720
And in 2013 tension changed its name to Mongo,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.910
DB Inc.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.850
The name manga TV is derived from humongous TV Onda,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.950
as indicated,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.850
he is used for storing huge amount of data.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.130
Unlike arguments where you perceive the later in a tabular format with rows and columns in

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.420
Mongo,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.150
DB restored the later in a so called document format,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.950
which is nothing but a bunch off key value pairs.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.300
A document in Mongo DB is equal in tow record off the table in an Audi bemis,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.150
but all records often are DBM,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.350
a stable are identical in structure,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.950
whereas documents in a collection may have different structures.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.950
A collection in Mongolia V is equal in tow,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.550
a table in our IBMs.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.190
A document is like a Jason object,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.610
but internally it is stored in a format called Visa,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.650
which stand for Binali Jason.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.920
We can perform all kinds of quality operations and a collection just like how you would do

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.070
that in an alley.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.550
BMS.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.130
But unlike arguments mongo DB,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.660
it doesn't support transactions on joints.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.580
The idea here is toe.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.220
Retrieve the data quickly and efficiently,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.450
since joint operations are the biggest pain points when it comes to performance in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.270
arguments,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.490
since we tend to store huge amount of daytime mongo db toe,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.970
increase the performance and mitigate fail owers,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.210
mongo DB offers charting and replications for storing,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.210
manipulating on accessing data in a mongo DB collection by our nest application.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.050
We don't necessarily need to know mongo db in detail.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.990
However,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.430
in the next couple of lectures,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.150
I will walk you through the basics off mongo DB shall commence
