00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
In reality,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.180
it's very unlikely that you do actually delete operation,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.870
which is called harder delete.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.530
So you're gonna lose the actual record in the database if you are maintaining those thing

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.290
in the database.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.270
But instead,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.830
probably you may want to do something called Soft Village,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.780
for example,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.670
if an employee quits the job instead of actually deleting the record from the database.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.930
What we can probably do is tow either flag,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.530
such as he's active and then turned the two false similarly,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.000
in a shopping cart application.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.040
If a product is not going to be sold anymore,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.420
probably because it's not being manufactured anymore,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.990
we might want toe add a field called Discontinued.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.300
And whenever the product is not being sold,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.400
we can simply say discontinued equals to two instead of actually diluting the product.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.290
However,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.910
for the sake of demonstration,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.390
we will implement a delete operation where we take an idea and then search that idea in our

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.940
record,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.170
and then we will delete that on that particular index.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.380
Since we're using an array,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.750
we just heard of the motor element from the index.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.880
So let's go ahead and do the same thing in our BIA scored here.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.250
So we're gonna come down here at a function called delete Contact.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.800
It takes an idea as a perimeter,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.170
and we have to search if that I exist.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.530
If the idea doesn't exist,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230
we're gonna throw a not phoned exception.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.750
But if the idea is found,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.270
we're going to remove that element from the sorry that we are maintaining.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.940
So to do that,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.610
I'm gonna simply copy this part which will take it off.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.350
Whether the idea is a valid one are not as well as it finds The index of the contact which

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.020
contains the idea given on.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.600
All I have to do now is toe use a function called splice,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.860
which is part of an area.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.830
So I can say this.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.580
Start contact starts place,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.610
supply the index and then the number of elements to be deleted.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.380
Since I want to dilute a single element in that given index,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.460
we simply say one displays function also returns an array of all the deleted elements.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.850
So I can say here,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.910
let deleted equals toe and then assigned this entire operation.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.600
Dilated isn't sorry.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.720
I know that I've deleted a single element.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.970
I can simply say here,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.030
return dilated off zero because that's the one that I've deleted on now.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.040
My delete function is really all I have to do now is toe the decorator at the rate delete,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.080
as usual,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.360
supply the ideally in the form of a segment here and then received the same thing in the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.710
form off a parent.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.470
Second copied.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.050
It's on pace over here.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.120
It's Our function is now ready.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.040
We can go and verify the same thing.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.440
Let's go back to postman.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.550
First of all,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.590
let's see the details that we have.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.000
So we have four records.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.990
Let's I want a billet John Circle,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.840
which is three.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.680
So I'm gonna use the same Ural at a new time.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.410
Over here,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.150
solider.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.970
It's TDP Delete Method based,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.610
the you are in.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.120
And then we want to supply the idea of the person that we want to delete.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.470
Lets it 33 is John's idee bill.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.230
It is like get where we can't supply request body.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.870
We can't supply quietest in parliament that if we want,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.860
but in this case we just want to supply the idea in the form off segment here,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.750
let's click on send and see what happens.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.300
As expected,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.390
it is returning the details of the person whose data is deleted from the context.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.560
If I go back to the get request,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.490
send it again.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.920
You can see that we don't have the details off 83 on once again.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.840
If I send the same request again,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.130
it's gonna come back with former for because the idea is not found in the contacts anymore

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.130
.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.020
Off course.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.680
If I restart subtler,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.450
everything will be reset again and then I'll be able to deal it once more with this.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.960
Now we have discussed elaborately about controllers.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.710
There are a few more things that we can discuss about controllers.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.320
Such a Squire listing perimeters are headers.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.540
How do we access them?

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.730
How do we respond?

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.590
The user with custom at airports are other messages.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.660
How do we respond?

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.700
The user with custom status scores are status messages,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.210
which we will be doing subsequently,

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.850
along with other concepts.
