00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
in this lecture.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.320
Let's try to get request handler for getting the list off all the contacts.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.590
But since we have only two contacts first,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.930
let's add some data toe or existing mongo DB collection,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.660
for which I will make yourself a website called marco dot com.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.570
Here you can generate up to 1000 documents in different format.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.100
For example,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.430
you can see that there is a CS,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.000
reformer,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.620
Jason,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.250
former SQL and other formats.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.460
We want Jason format,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.150
and also we want to customize the fields.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.850
I don't need the idea,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.810
so I'm gonna get enough that I need the name instead of first names.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.150
So I'm gonna changes toe name on the type toe full him.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.650
So if I can type your full,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.280
you can see that you get the full name.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.500
I don't need the last name.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.040
I need email at only gender,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.850
but I'm gonna have phone number instead of gender.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.020
But the type off the value that I want is also a phone numbers.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.960
I'm gonna go and select your phone number.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.520
The former of the phone,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.000
remember,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.930
we have to include the country cool so I can go here and choose one off these three until

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.810
it the 1st 1 I don't need the I p address,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.710
but instead I can say I want city changes to city.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.980
That's at another field called ST Click Here Toe change this toe state and one lost.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.470
I want country and select country.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.380
And now I can click on this download data Britain Toe Don't look the same by default.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.500
It comes with a name called Mark Underscore Data.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.260
Jason,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.870
I'm gonna keep it on my desktop.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.170
Click on Save the Filings.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.910
Don't load it.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.150
Let's go to the Mongo db Shell exit from there.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.430
And then from here we can executor recommend car mongo import to load all the data from or

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.280
moderator Jason into our collection called contacts.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.050
To do that,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.450
let's type in the command mongo import,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.090
and we have to give few options.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.750
For example,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.650
we have to specify what is the name of the DB by typing national TV.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.740
DB Name is called Training Dash Dash Collection.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.870
This is going to specify what is a collection that we want toe import into.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.810
But if I don't mention this,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.820
the name of the file will be considered as the name of the collection,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.350
which is mark on the score data.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.550
But since we already have a contacts collection,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.050
so I want to import the data into context.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.190
And finally we have to specify that the content of the file is a Jason Terry because it can

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.750
also be a CS three data.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.090
So I can say here,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.800
Dash just Jason Day and finally,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.380
the filing that I had to give,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.810
which is on my desktop.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.470
I am giving a religion part from my home military,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.550
the stock slash mark data Georgeson.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.130
When I pressed Enter,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.610
you can see that it is connected toe mongo db colon,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.890
double slash local host and 1000 documents imported successfully.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.460
So if I get inside the mongo shell on my DB is called training Now you can see that if I

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.790
say show collections,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.870
I already have the collection called Contents Heavy work.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.550
If I say db dot contacts dot com,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.500
I'm gonna get 1002 as the count.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.330
The command db dot context don't find will only display the 1st 20 off them because find

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.450
returns and it'll later which can display the 1st 20 I press enter and you can see we got

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.790
20 documents.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.280
You can count it if you want,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.670
but in order to get the next batch of 20 I can take your I D and interest enter.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.480
Now that we have over 1000 documents,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.110
let's read get request handler,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.900
which makes us off our service function to get the data from the mongo db.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.020
So let's go to the visuals to the accord.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.240
First,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.120
let's write a handler for get request.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.800
So I like to start by typing at that it get press enter to automatically import the same

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.660
and then the function name.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.560
I want to call it us.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.000
Get all right now,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.250
we don't want to receive any pattern readers,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.210
but later we will are few parameters that will help us do the pagination on inside this,

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.610
I can say return this start service start.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.950
Probably get all contacts.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.230
Notice that we don't have this function.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.390
That's why we're getting another.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.740
I'm following a top down approach over here,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.770
so let's go and create a function called get all contacts in the service class.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.020
I'm gonna copy this name,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.470
go to the contact service tortillas,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.550
onda paste that open and close curly bracket to get all the documents from the database.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.500
It's very simple.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.690
I have toe make yourself this start contact modern don't find which doesn't take any

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.470
perimeter.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.470
However,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.040
if you want to do some filters,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.010
you can supply the filter condition as perimeter.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.390
Let's for a cynical and and also at the return key word here so that when we call this

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.830
function,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.650
we get all the documents.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.000
So two very for the same let's go toe postman on.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.830
Then send in a request to the same mural using the http,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.710
Get requests.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.830
So I'm gonna copy this yarn on,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.770
then create a new tab base this Ural,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.970
it's already get Request your click on send,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.350
and hopefully I should get the list off all the documents.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.370
As you can see,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.350
I got all 1002 documents.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.120
It's very difficult to come,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.710
but since you can see that there are a lot of documents,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.650
we can take it for granted that it's 1000 documents.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.410
Now.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.710
This is OK for 1000 plus documents.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.210
However,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.740
what if we have millions off?

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.790
Documents are probably billions of documents.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.790
You don't want to really send all the billions of documents toe the client because that's

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.930
going to take a lot of bandwidth as well as a lot of processing power.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.560
Plus,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.110
the users may not be interested.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:08.140
Toe see all the document as a less the users Browsers also may not support to display those

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.140
many documents so that a lot of factors for which we know have to probably say,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.580
I don't want all these documents.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.820
Gimme here.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.910
Probably a bunch off 10 documents at a time.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.660
And to control that,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.350
we probably can send in a perimeter here.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.710
Question mark underscored.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.400
Page equals to probably one on,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.480
then probably underscore.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.230
Limit equals toe.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.930
Say,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.560
for example,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.040
10.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.180
I also want these two well used to be the default.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.030
So if I don't supply these,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.090
it should be assumed as page number one and then the limit off 10.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.790
So let's go to the controller and add these two parameters.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.650
I'm gonna create page off number type and then limit also off number type,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.250
and then the same thing.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.670
I have to supply toe dysfunction,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.660
which currently is not receiving any such perimeters.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.460
However,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.450
we will send it anyway and make the necessary changes in the service class.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.920
So that's giving another because we don't have the parameters defined in that particular

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.520
function.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.360
Let's go to that function on,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.960
then receive those two variables wanting animal colleges page off number type and then

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.150
limit also off number type.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.110
Now to make it off this in our fine function,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.230
we simply have to say here dot limit,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.800
which is not a model limited self.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.600
So this is going to restrict the output toe only the specified number off documents.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.040
But we also want to specify an offset that starts from this particular page.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.340
So if you are on the page,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.520
number one the officer to zero.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.280
But if you're in the page number two then offset is nothing but the limit.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.480
So because of this,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.420
I can say dot escape,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.340
which is to mention the offset I have to say page minus one.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.610
So if you are in the first grade,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.750
it's gonna be one minus one,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.550
which is zero.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.430
But if you're under page number two,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.590
it's like two minus one,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.230
which is one multiplied by limit.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:12.350
So if your limit is 10 and you're saying page number 33 minus one is 22 into 10 is 20.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.290
That means you're gonna skip the 1st 2 20 documents.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.040
That means that in the beginning of the third page,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.650
so which is what we want anyways?

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.920
Now the service function can give me the paginated data.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.950
But we still have toe map,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.150
these two variables to our controller function arguments.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.650
So let's go to the controller.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.260
We have these variables to map this.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.750
I just have to say obdurate quality and then specify that the quality perimeter name is

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.000
underscored page.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.400
So that's going to map it.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.230
Likewise,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.850
I'm going to stay here at the red quality underscored limit.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.340
But we also probably want to say that in case if the user doesn't supplied underscored paid

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.340
are in school limit,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.210
we wonder to be assumed as one ended 10 respectively.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.300
For that,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.290
I can make it the default value pipe over here.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.790
I can say new default value.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.810
Pipe off one for the page on the same thing.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.700
I can copy this and paste for the other one,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.240
but the value here would be 10.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.210
We also want to ensure that the U there is entering only a numerical value for those two,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.570
for which I can add one more here,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.290
which is called parse into pipe the same thing.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.580
I'm gonna go and give it toe the other perimeter also.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.460
And now our controller as well.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.130
A service functions already.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.630
So let's very for the same thing.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.170
By going back to the postman,

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.080
the tree,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.410
move on these perimeter values and then send in the request,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.380
See what happens.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.720
It's like consent on as expected.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.710
You can see that we're only having a handful of them,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.030
which is not about 10.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.450
Document the 1st 2 off them I inserted earlier using my post.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.380
The remaining ones are the documents I imported from the mark data.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.040
Jason,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.080
let's go on.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.140
Add a page number.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.420
Now I'm gonna go here and then type Question mark underscored.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.850
Page equals to two.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.860
I'm supposed to get a different documents than these two.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.150
Let's click on send another concern.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.040
We we got a different set off 10 documents.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:21.130
But what if I want a page number two where the content part page is gonna be 20 documents?

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.750
No problem.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.990
We can go here and then say 1% underscored.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.950
Limit equals to 20.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.150
Click on send.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.820
Now.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.380
We got some different data.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:30.860
Also,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.930
we got more number off documents So this is how you can implement the pagination using the

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.360
mang goes ap I.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.230
So that's all for this lecture.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.780
In the next lecture,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:47.240
let's write a get request handler wearing the user may be able to supply an I D.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.350
And if there is a corresponding document,

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.050
let's respond with the same thing.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.850
Models.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.150
We will respond with four,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.250
not four state of school.
