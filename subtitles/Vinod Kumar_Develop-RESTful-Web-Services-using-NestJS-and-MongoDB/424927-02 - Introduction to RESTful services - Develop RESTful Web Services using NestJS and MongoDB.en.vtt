00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
arrested and I couldn't for representational state transfer.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.250
At first,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.990
it might sound a bit complicated,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.750
but if you read it from rewards,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.950
it reads more or less like transferring state in different representations that don't

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.650
stayed here refers to the state off a collection off objects known as a resource.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.840
In general,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.180
a resource has some information,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.630
which is nothing but stayed.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.350
Often object,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.410
and the client I'm server may exchange are transferred the same in different formats are up

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.150
with conditions.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.550
For example,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.460
a mobile application may request this Alberto provide state off resource in XML format,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.000
while another Web obligation may request the silver for the same state.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.280
In Jason Former,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.480
both sour unclaimed can bargain for representations off state from each other,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.360
which is stormed.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.780
US.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.450
Content negotiation This type of communication between the Clintons are work is carried out

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.450
,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.550
using the Web as transport platform on leverage that it's TDB protocol features.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.090
When working with the rest will services,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.050
these points must be kept in mind.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.820
Resource is access to a are A.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.550
You are our uniform resource identifier.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.080
For example,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.070
the you're right slash ap slash contacts represent a collection off contacts in an address

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.490
book The Ex TDP request matters such as Get post foot,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.840
delete our patch actors.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.150
Words are actions to be performed on a resource.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.570
For example,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.730
sending a get request for slash AP slash contact should get all the contacts in some format

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.730
,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.150
maybe XML or Jason,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.050
but sending a post request to the same your I slash ap slash contact with the request Body

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.750
should create a new state in the resource on the SIRO site,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.110
but its GDP requested are except is used by the client to negotiate with the Sarwar for a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.000
specific type of representation.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.490
For example,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.700
a value off applications slash Jason for this header instructs that Sarwar toe send it

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.320
Jason The presentation of the state while applications slash example tells this Alberto

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.710
send an XML copy of the same similarly textile slash plane may bring a textural

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.350
representation off the same resource as well.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.130
The ex TDP requested Our content type is used by the client toe.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.810
Indicate what representation off data being sent from the plane to the server while making

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.620
a post.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.410
Put our patch requests in these requests.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.600
The data is center.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.610
The request body,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.780
commonly known as payload with this basic idea off rest full servicers in the next Lecter.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.250
Let's have a look at what Ness just is all about.
