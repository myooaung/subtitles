00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
Now that our application is really on also has been tested with the local copy of Mongo DB

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.870
Server.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.080
Let's now try to connect toe a mongo DB Cloud server,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.750
which is provided for free.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.220
Of course,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.680
by mongo db To do so,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.940
visit mongo db dot com On on the home page on the right side,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.810
you have a try free button.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.620
Click on that on.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.040
Then you see three options.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.940
You can see that the green color bought here indicates this is the one that is selected by

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.550
the front earlier.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.240
We don't order this one.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.450
Andi set it up on your local machine.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.560
We used it.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.040
Not this time.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.450
We want to sell it the club.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.490
And here you might have to do a couple of details.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.880
Number one is the company which says optional.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.200
So I'm not going to give the same.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.410
I'm gonna get the email as Kamar at we know Darko.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.280
First name.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.860
We know last name common password.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.380
You have to create a new one.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.110
Minimum eight characters are required.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.720
Agreed to the U.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.990
S.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.960
And privacy policy Get started for free.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.360
Since we are being presented with different options,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.750
I'm gonna go with the free cluster over here.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.100
So the Mongo DB Server is hosted on AWS Google Cloud as well as Microsoft Azure.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.470
And the default selected here is terribly ISS Andi.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.110
It also asked me to select a different region.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.160
I would like to live it to the default and then click on Create Cluster over here.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.820
And as you can see that it says your cluster is being created.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.430
We may have to wait for roughly around 1 to 3 minutes after a couple of minutes.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.320
It has bean created on.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.520
No,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.150
there are a few options for me.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.180
The first option I have to choose is the connect and then it'll ask you what is the white

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.790
list connection I p addresses since we are running it from our local host.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.700
At this point in time,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.830
we may have to add the I P address off our computer other ways,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.560
you might have to give a different I p address.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.210
For example,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.620
when we deploy this on toe heroic Ooh,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.360
are any other clothes or worse,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.250
we may have to add a different I p address,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.530
but for the time being,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.100
I toe add my current I p address.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.230
So when I use postman toe,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.420
make a request over Resting Point running on local host that local host will intern.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.500
Connect to the server.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.190
So I have toe this I p address.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.520
If you only can also give a description saying that,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.460
for example,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.750
we know it's laptop click on Add I P address and that is now recorded.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.470
It also expects a Mongo DB user.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.730
And if you have observed that in our local installation off Mongo DB,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.110
we don't have any user name or password here.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.440
We're going to give a user name.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.630
I'll give the user name as for example,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.370
I mean and then let's give the password.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.650
And,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.420
as you can see,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.710
it also suggest a strong password.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.080
We can use the same thing and click on the generated one,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.340
and then it says,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.700
create mongo DB user.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.770
Let's click on the button,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.550
and in the next step,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.050
it says,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.560
choose a connection mattered.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.790
So let's click on the same.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.790
It says you can connect with the Mongo shell like what we have right now among Ghoshal

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.210
running on our local computer.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.290
We can use that took on it are you can take connect your application.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.440
This is what we want to do because we have return a software application.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.000
That application has to connect to this mongo db.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.850
So let's click on this one.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.800
And it says here,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.580
this is the U R L that we have to use when we're tryingto connect toe this Mongo DB Plus,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.350
Let's click on the copy button toe,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.550
copy the store clipboard and then take on clothes.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.830
No,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.860
the door cluster is really let's goto RVs scored open at modernity is and this is where we

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.890
had given earlier.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.220
The local host you order will replace this with the actually oral to our mongo db a close.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.810
I'm gonna pace that we have to replace this password with the actual pass were So let's do

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.500
the same.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.000
And also it says,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.250
What is the name off the DB,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.420
which I'm going to give it as a phone book Now our next year's application is going toe

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.290
connect toe the remote mongo db server.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.160
Now that we have made the necessary changes toe the mongo db,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.300
you are Onda nest J sir,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.900
what has already been restarted?

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.500
Let's go toe postman and send in a request to get the list off all the contacts.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.250
Because the mongo db Star work cluster is a brand new one.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.800
There are no contact,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.390
so we should get an empty list.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.660
So I'm gonna send in a request toe Http equal and local host Colon 3000 slash contacts

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.150
Click on send.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.720
You can see that we got a m d Addy.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.930
However,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.060
if I'm going to send in a new contact where the post matter,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.570
this will be sending a request to the remote mongo db server on a new document should be

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.530
added over there.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.980
So let's change this toe post sending a body raw.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.250
And then Jason,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.940
let me send my details.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.120
So I'm going to stay here.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.470
Name is we know.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.920
Come on,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.460
he made we know I did.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.600
You know dot co phone number is plus nine one.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.150
The country cord is important.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.970
I'll add 9 71 424784 These are the mandate refuse on.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.900
Also,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.840
we have satisfied the valuations,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.080
so let's click on a send and see what happens.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.660
As you can see,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.120
we got a response 201 created as well as a new I.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.300
D.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.400
has been generated.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.370
If I'm gonna make a good request once again for local host retailers and slash contacts,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.350
click on Send and you can see we get an array off one document.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.050
We can perform all other operations.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.300
Like,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.970
for example,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.210
I want to send in a patch request now.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.610
So I'll say patch and then send in,

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.040
Let's say,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.910
for example,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.890
city off bangle on.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.560
Then let's a country off India.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.370
I also have to send in the I d in the park perimeter here.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.440
The idea is right here.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.470
I'm gonna copy this.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.850
This is the response from the Post.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.550
I put a slash here based it now effective consent.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.150
It will come back with 204 which says that no content,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.440
but if I'm going toe,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.380
make a request for the same.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.470
You should see the rest of the details along with city and country as well.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.740
Now that we have added one document and then send in a patch request let's go to our actual

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.400
mongo DB cluster on DSI that there is a button called collections over here,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.600
clicking on which it will take me toe the list of collections and you can see that there is

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.050
a deep vehicle phone book.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.450
If I expand that there is a collection called Contacts Clicking on which you can see that

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.210
it shows me the list off all the documents,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.380
which is not about one single document at this point in time.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.360
So by just changing one single line off court over here,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.410
you can see that our application now works with really mongo db server on the cloud in the

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:24.720
subsequent lectures that's building deploy our application itself on toe 1/3 party rial

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.330
Sarwar like hello.
