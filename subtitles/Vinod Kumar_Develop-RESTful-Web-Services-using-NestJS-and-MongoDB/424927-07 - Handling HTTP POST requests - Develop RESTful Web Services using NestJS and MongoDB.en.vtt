00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370
in this lecture,

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.150
let's create a new function that can be mapped to the it's TTP post method.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.050
The idea is the user should be ableto send in a single contact object or in a day of

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.950
contact objects,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.600
and we should be able tow.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.430
Add those contacts toe the existing context.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.830
Sorry,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.080
but before that,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.370
let's install something called Postman.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.980
Because using a browser,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.450
you will be able to make only get requests,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.450
not post put Ordeal it.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.230
So let's open a new tab and look for postman until it the first feeling that you get here

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.550
download postman at.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.420
Based on the operating system,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.310
it has already given the appropriate download button.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.650
Let's click on the same thing.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.550
Don't let it on desktop.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400
Once the download is done,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.950
let's unzip the same.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.690
And if I goto new finder window,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.650
you can see on my desktop.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.300
There is this postman,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.020
so I'm gonna drag this and drop it on to my applications and in the applications.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.750
Now I have the postman icon so I can run this from anyway.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.050
So let's close this.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:15.200
Find a window open postman and you will be prompted post monies and abd under it from the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.630
Internet.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.920
Are you sure you wanna open it?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.070
You can click on open.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.550
And this is the interface off postman.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.170
So I can click on the cross button over here at a new tab here,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.550
you can select the it's TDP request method that you want to use.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.520
For example,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.480
I want to send a get request toe http colon double slash local host 3000 slash contacts and

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.470
click on sent to get the four context that we already have.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.790
However,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.340
I should be able to send http post mattered to the very same you are by supplying an

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.330
appropriate body.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.610
So,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.130
for example,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.710
if I'm going to copy this on,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.220
then open a new tab click on post based the urine and in the body section you can send the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.190
details of the contract that you want to add.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.010
For example,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.260
you can send the data in the form of form data our rod text.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.870
In our case,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.550
we want to send Jason so rod text is fine.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.480
When you selected Are you also have tow ard http request header called content type with a

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.750
value off applications like Jason.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.650
Now you can do the same thing by selecting from this drop down Jason and then send up

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.060
payload.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.870
For example,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.270
If I want to send a new contract person with name off,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.740
let's say James on,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.600
then email off James at example dot com and then click on Send.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.150
There will be a new post request,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.480
but as you know,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.150
we haven't written the court yet,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.250
so we're gonna get a fortnight for better,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.090
which is okay for no,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.250
But we want to fix this.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.650
I really got into http standards.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.850
You should be getting a 405 error indicating post matter is not supported.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.090
But that's okay.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.550
We can always control the same thing.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.010
Similarly,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.090
I should be able tow.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.880
Send an array off data,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.750
for example,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.720
if I want to send another contact with name is little.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.460
For example,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.450
Rummage email is Ramesh at example dot com.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.690
You have to surround this with a squared record.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.970
That's why we're getting this error.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.280
So I have toe select all of them,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.870
cut it,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.720
put it in a squared record,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.550
and now we have a value GIs on r E.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.610
So I should be able tow handle these kind of scenarios.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.440
So let's go back toe arias scored at a new function.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.110
Let's call it as create contacts because this could be one or more contacts and I want to

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.540
receive the entire request body toe a variable called body on In order to tell the messages

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.650
that we want the entire request body to be injected into this variable,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.210
we have to use a decorator called Body.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.150
So I'm gonna say that they're it body.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.810
I know that body is going to be imported from nest jizz common.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.570
Of course,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.410
body has to be given with parent.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.860
This is like this and now we have an object that could be a single contact object.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.650
Are would be an array of objects.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.880
Also,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.890
we need to decorate,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.560
dissenter function using at the right post once again import the same thing from next year

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.450
slash common.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.560
Since the incoming body which may contain one contact or multiple contacts,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.350
they do not contain ideas.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.550
So the first thing we want to do is to find what is going to be the new I d off the contact

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.450
that we're gonna add.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.760
And to do that,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.920
we have to first convert the contacts into an area into just consisting off only ideas and

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.860
that's very easy to do.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.510
We can just do the map function.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.260
For example.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.490
I can say Let ideas equals two.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.750
They start contacts dot map,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.010
which needs a comeback which receives a single object at a time,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.790
and then we have to return an equal in value.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.740
From that object,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.280
I would say cedar idee,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.050
which means that we will be getting an aria off ideas at the end of this operation.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.920
So there's gonna be an array of numbers consisting off 1234 Now we need to get the maximum

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.390
value from that which can be done using the mat dot max function.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.730
So I'm gonna take your mat dot max,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.090
which takes a bunch of values as perimeter.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.670
So we do have ideas,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.650
but I can spread the ideas into this function.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.460
So by this typing to pull dot ideas and now this gives me the maximum value in the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.020
collection.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.930
I can call this as let new I d equals two one plus mad dot max off all these values.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.800
So basically,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.980
we are now having fire as the valley because four is the maximum idea in this collection.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.450
We now have five as the new I D.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.580
The next thing we have to do is toe check.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.930
If the request body contains an area of contacts,

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.910
are a single contact and that can be done by chicken if body instance off.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.390
Harry,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.710
that means we have an array here.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.550
Let's call it us.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.150
Let contacts equals to body.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.110
Yes,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.850
I can say let a single contact equals toe the entire body.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.010
Of course,

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.420
Here I can take contact.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.650
Our i d equals toe new I d.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.960
But as here,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.050
I have toe loop over each of these elements and then associate a 90 for that.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.780
And that's very easily doable by typing contacts start for each.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.930
This is a function,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.750
but behind the thing,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.010
it uses a loop where I get an element on its index.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.550
I is the index here.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.200
And then I have to do some operations so I can simply type your cedar.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.600
I d equals toe new I d.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600
Plus I.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.010
So I'm actually adding +0123 etcetera.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.000
For example,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.240
if we have sent an area of two elements here for James,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.410
we will now get new ideas.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.680
55 plus zero is five.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.200
James Idea is nothing but five.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.790
But when the situation goes forward,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:17.570
I is one because the index off Ramesh is one and that Phi +16 will be Ascender,

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.250
the I d.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.400
And this is the job done at the end of this.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.050
So there's no return value from contacts or forage,

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.950
but it has updated the ideas for each one of them.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:32.340
Now all I have to do is tow Add each of these elements toe the area that we have here are

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.950
this particular object to the Ari.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.150
So here I can say now they start contacts dot push.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.970
And then I can spread the contacts,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.450
Ari.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.860
So individual elements of the context will be pushed one after the other.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.610
Here,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.810
I can simply say this.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.470
Start contact start pushed and then supply this contact object,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.450
which is a local variable over here.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.130
Now,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.780
after doing these operations,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.930
you have to give some response back to the user by default.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.130
There is no response,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.590
but the status called off 200 will be sent.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.310
However,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.830
if you want toe respond to the user with the contact having newly generated ideas what I

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.510
can do that can create a variable.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.550
Your core let out equals toe none.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.920
And then here I'll say out equals toe contacts.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.600
And here I'll say out equals toe singular contact.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.650
That's this variable.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:31.870
And then we're gonna written the same by typing written out nest automatically Arts The

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.530
response header called Content type with applications last Jason,

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:42.050
because this is not a primitive value on our post handler is pretty much really we can now

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.000
test the same thing.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.770
Let's first test the get request over here.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.060
So we do have four.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.250
Let's send this again.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.920
We got our four records back and then I'm gonna send to off them here.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.800
It's an Ari.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.900
So James and Ramesh when I click on Send previously we got the for Not for.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.330
But this time we should get status 200 plus.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.650
Both James and Ramesh should have some ideas.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.450
Added to that.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.030
Let's check it out and you can see James has an I D off five.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.850
Ramesh had the 90 off six.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.890
Also,

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.650
if I go back over here and then click on send,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.350
you should now see that there are six contacts in our attic.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.750
So this is how easy it is to create a post handler.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.750
All we have to do is tow.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.480
Declare a variable here toe,
