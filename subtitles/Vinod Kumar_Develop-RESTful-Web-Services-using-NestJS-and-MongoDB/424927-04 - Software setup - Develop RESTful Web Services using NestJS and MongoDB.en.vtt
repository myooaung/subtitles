00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
to get started with this training,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.680
you need a couple of softness.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.180
Number one is nor Jace to install Norges on your computer.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.930
Argh!

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.070
I little real Eric.

You tow this page where you see two big buttons.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.410
It automatically detects your operating system on,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.550
then gives me two options here.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.450
One to download what's called LDS,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.990
which is long term support that's currently 12 about $17 0 all.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.470
If you want the latest pictures,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.480
which might be tweaked and probably even removed,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.930
which is 14 doctrine or zero called us current washing,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.910
it is highly recommended that you installed the LTs wash in answer of the current version.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.850
Let's go and download this.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.150
I'm gonna keep the file on my desktop.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.160
Go on sale once it is downloaded.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.010
Let's open the same thing on the finder on double click the package in solar that brings up

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.720
this installation wizard.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.440
Let's click.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.110
Continue.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.320
Continue again to continue installing this after you must agree to the terms off software

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.180
license agreement.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.170
Let's click on Agree click on install If it asked for administrator password.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.150
Let's give the same thing ender on the installation is complete.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.610
Let's click close to verify whether the installation was successful or not.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.550
We can open a terminal on Windows.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.150
It's called Command Prompt,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.620
and he sure command Nord Dash.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.650
We are dusters worsen.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.750
That'll show me that the current question is 12 about $17 0 No.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.620
Just also comes with another utility command called NPM,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.250
which is a known package manager.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.210
It helps installing the dependencies required for applications.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.970
Let's check the portion of the same.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.650
I'm gonna type NPM Dash V and it says six start 14.4.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.250
The second software requirement for our training is a good court editor,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.920
and the most popular one is Visual Studio Court from Microsoft.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.120
This is based on another very popular platform called Atom.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.310
But now this is maintained by Microsoft to get the latest question off visual studio called

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.750
Goto court dot visual studio dot com,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.580
and you will see a big blue button here download for Mac Once again,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.110
this website also has identified our platform on We simply have to click on this download

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.570
button,

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.040
but if you want to download for a different operating system,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.880
you can see that there are other options.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.330
Also,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.450
let's click on this download for Mac.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.470
Once again,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.450
I'm going to keep the downloaded in the desktop,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.510
Nick.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.050
See.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.670
Once the download is complete,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.790
let's open the same thing in Finder and then double click the Zip file,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.950
which just unzips the continent,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.990
which is nothing but the executable.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.730
We just to your coat I can execute from desktop itself,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.030
are on Mac OS.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.950
It's good idea toe drag this and drop it onto the application's folder.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.840
And since I already had visuals to the accord,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.560
it's asking me that.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.320
Do I have to keep both of them?

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.070
Are Shall I cancel the operation?

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.350
Actually replace I click on replays to keep the latest Russian.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.520
One thing I would visual studio code is that it's one of those software,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.310
which is called Evergreen Soft Dress,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.780
which means once you download and install every time there is an Internet connection and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.260
there is new updates available,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.550
it will automatically update itself so we don't have to download electric switching anymore

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.550
,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.580
so to see how this is gonna come up.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.750
So I'm gonna double click this visual studio core.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.600
And since I'm running some softer downloaded from the Internet,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.620
macaroons is prompting me there.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.650
Shall I open this?

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.050
Are shall I show you the webpage for details?

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.310
Let's click open.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.550
And this is how visual studio code looks like.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.180
That's good screen by different visual.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.420
Studio poor comes with this dark team.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.640
If you want to change to something different,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.850
you can goto cord references and choose a different color team that is available.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.750
I would like to live it to the default,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.690
which is dark.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.480
One more thing that you also want to do Probably east toe run visuals to the airport from

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.230
command around our terminal.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.280
For this visual studio court must be available in the part off the oils to ensure that this

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.250
is gonna happen.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.150
Command shift B.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.250
Our control should be on windows and look for shell and you can see that David An option

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.180
Shell Command,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.530
install court command in path.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.890
Let's select that on the bottom.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.660
You can see Shell Command called successfully installed in part.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.860
So with this now,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.670
if I close visual studio cord open a terminal and then they called dot you can see that we

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.880
should.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.930
Studio Court opens on shows all the files from the current folder Let's close visual studio

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.370
code.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.420
The terms offered that we require toe get started with this training is next Chase Command

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.920
line interface this Valassis toe.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.120
Create new messages projects on add additional components to our existing projects as well

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.120
.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.100
Father,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.440
let's go to the terminal our command prompt in windows and then type in the command NPM

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.960
install all you can simplify an entire dash G that g required because this is gonna be a

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.080
command line interface.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.450
We must be able to execute the command from any locations.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.530
And that's where the Dash G is important.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.620
That is a flag for global and then the package to be installed is admitted.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.020
Nest jails slash ceelo on Microsoft windows This is good enough.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.970
But on leaners on my quiz we also have to run this with pseudo privilege West ender.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.090
If it ask for the password,

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:00.720
type in the password breasts tender and after a couple of minutes we got the installation

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.530
done on.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.590
In case if you see some Arabs during the installation procedure,

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.200
all you to look at is whether it installed at next JSTOR cli at the rate seven door to door

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.810
zero R,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.710
which are the latest fashion when you are installing is displayed here or not to check

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.690
whether our installation is done correctly or not,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.270
you can also clear the screen and then type nest dash,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.720
dash Washington are you can simply say,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.850
Dash Week.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.360
It should give the Washington that be just now in stone,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.850
which is seven dot co 7.0.0.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.990
So these are the three softer set up required for getting started with this training.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.380
Now that those after set up is done in the next lecture,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.640
let's use this command nest to create a new nest Jace project and see what are the source

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.850
code generated for us.
