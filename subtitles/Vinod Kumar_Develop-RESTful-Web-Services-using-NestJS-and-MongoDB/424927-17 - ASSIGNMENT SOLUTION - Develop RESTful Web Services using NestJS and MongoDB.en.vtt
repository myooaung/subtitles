00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
in this lecture.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.950
I'm gonna provide the solution for the assignment that we discussed previously.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.230
I'm gonna implement three tasks in three different functions.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.960
So I'm right now in the service class for handling the put request.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.420
I'm gonna have one business logic function over here.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.740
I'm gonna call this US update full because it's supposed to update full contact details,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.430
which is going to receive idee as a perimeter along with contact objects.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.580
So the contract object Typical is the payload on ideas.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.190
What is coming as the request part perimeter on,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.640
The first thing that I'm going to do is to check whether this idea exists or not.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.480
And if it exists,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.680
what is its index?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.500
So I'm gonna type your let index equals toe distort contacts dot find index,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.960
which takes a call back,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.850
and the callback receives the unusual elements off the start contacts one by one.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.480
So I'm gonna say,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.150
see,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.900
Andi,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.180
I'm gonna check if see,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.050
that idea is it equals to the idea that I deceived.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.600
If the answer is yes,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.720
then I get the index.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.240
But if the answer is no,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.860
it will go through all the elements in this start Contacts and then gives a minus one as

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.180
the values I'm gonna check your if index is not equals two minus one,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.330
which means it is found on.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.170
All I have to do is to say this start contacts off index is equal to a new object

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.580
consisting off all the members off contact,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.590
along with the idea that we received over here.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.700
So in case did,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.070
the paler already contains an idea that will be overturned by this one.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.610
So this way,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.950
we are now having a new object in the given index which represented our search result.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.200
Now that the contacts is being mutated,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.940
we now have toe right the content of the file,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.830
and we have a function called this dot right toe file on.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.860
Once that is done,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.760
we can now simply written the value off this particular objects I'm going to simply say,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.640
your return on.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.000
We don't want to return the reference to the actual object,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.770
so I'm gonna return a shallow copy off the same thing.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.660
So tripled out this start Contacts off Index on our function update.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.660
Fel is ready.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.930
The next function is for the patch some right here,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.490
a function called abd it partially.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.940
Once again,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.820
it's going toe received the same perimeters.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.950
So I'm gonna copy this part.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.550
Close the bracket.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.650
We also have to actually get the index off the element that we want toe update.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.770
So this line,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.780
all soul's good.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.270
We have to check if the search was successful then only we have to do the patch.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.550
So I'm gonna baste it and then close the bracket for the same.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.590
However,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.770
we want to read in the current values off the search to object.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.160
But overrating the values in this particular contact.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.490
So all have to do now is to say,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.340
distort contacts off index that the search result is equals to a new object that should

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.030
contain all the values from the current object which is nothing more.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.150
Distort contacts off index.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.500
But it should over right?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.850
Whatever is coming in the payload which is nothing but tripled out contact.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.620
And now,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.870
since the distort contacts is manu plated or mutated,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.320
we have to write to the file.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.200
I'm gonna say this start right toe fight and then return the modified variant off that

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.080
which is currently kept in this one.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.940
So the line here is identical to this.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.250
I'm gonna copy and paste the same thing over here.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.240
So we there's no our update.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.290
Partial is done.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.890
One last function in the service class is toe delete.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.350
So I'm gonna write a function called Delete by idee,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.850
which takes an idea the perimeter to deal it an element in the member variable the area.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.660
We have the first search and get the index,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.730
which is same as this.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.750
So I'm gonna copy these two lines based over here on Glenn.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.490
Close the bracket for this and to delete the element.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.350
We're going to use the slice function.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.790
So we're going to say this start contacts,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.770
which is in a day.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.150
But I had a function called spice,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.760
where we need to supply an index on in their index.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.080
How many elements you want to delete,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.850
which is not the one we want to just do it One element.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.390
And after the leading,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.610
this is going to return on our day off.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.350
All the deleted element on since you were believing only one element.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.430
I can collect that one element that is dilated,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.660
which is at the index zero to a variable called C and then I can return that see,

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.070
so that it can be given a the response back to the plane so I can say you're return.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.590
See?

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.280
But no doubt this has happened only the memory.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.600
But in order for us to update this into the file,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.770
we have to call this function this dot right to fight.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.390
That's a space that over here on our belief by idea is also ready Now that our salaries

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.280
functions already.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.220
Let's motor the controller first.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.590
Let's right the handler for put someone at the rate put remember,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.100
it's gonna take the i d.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.790
As part perimeter,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.150
so that's important.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:13.560
And then I'm gonna write a function called Update where whatever comes at a part perimeter

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.560
,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.240
I wanna assign that to a variable seltzer at the rate for um off.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.370
I really on.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.550
Then I'll declare variable called idee,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.160
Andi.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.680
Then I'll also say at the red body,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.680
which is gonna be assigned toe a variable called body and now we have to check if this idea

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.950
the valued one and squander that can make us off this functions,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.240
I'm copied it and then paste over here because we want to check if this idea exist,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.850
then only we want to do an update on the way you do.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.350
An update is distorts surveys dot update full,

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.360
which takes idee and body as the perimeters of body contains actual contact distance.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.250
This comes back with the updated data on I can simply say return,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.340
but if the idea is not for me,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.730
I'm gonna simply say through a new not for an exception Over here on our update.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.110
Functionality is ready.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.060
Let's also the patch.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.730
Andi,

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.060
I'm gonna right here at the rate patch again.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.300
The parameter is going to be a same thing,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.830
Colon,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.100
I really know that this idea itself can be something else.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.000
If you want to give,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.690
I'll say patch instead off update.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.550
I also received these two parameters,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.100
except that the body may consist off.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.450
Partial data need not be full data.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.830
The function is pretty much the same thing as the previous one.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.140
I'm gonna copy and paste the same thing over here.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.250
However,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.090
instead of calling the update full,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.770
I'm gonna call the function called Update Partial.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.730
On the rest,

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.890
all is going to be seen.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.500
One lost is the delete handler.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.550
I'm gonna take here at the raid in it.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.490
The perimeter is still required.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.640
So colon idee the function name I'm gonna call it does delete contact or just to delete

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.410
also is fine.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.550
And then I'm gonna type here at the right bottom off idee.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.990
Pass it on to variable called idee.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:07.660
There is no requirement of reading a body because delete on get do not have a request body

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.660
.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.600
We just had to check if this exists,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.580
we want to do it.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.940
If it doesn't exist,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.860
we won't actually throw a not for an exception.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.390
So I'm gonna copy this in that section based over here.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.300
But instead of calling this,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.900
I have no call Dill it by idly and then supply the i.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.180
D.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.620
So with this now,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.840
all the three tasks off the assignment is completed.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.480
Let's go on Very for the same thing.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.480
First,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.710
let's go and get the data Seawater.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.360
The data on the data is same One is we know to Ishaan Trees,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.830
John.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.220
Know that name?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.220
Isham on the email issue,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:52.890
amit example dot com I go and send this detail where I'm tryingto change the name toe full

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.940
name on email,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.750
toe a gym,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.950
a lady if everything is OK.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.460
I should get actually updated version.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.430
We can go on,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.560
verify the same thing over here on.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.450
Send this request once more and you can see it's been updated over here.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.230
Notice that the I.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.430
D.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.940
Has bean either their string here.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.370
But if you are very particular about the data type,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.060
then you can go back to your service function where we're actually adding that idea over

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.350
here.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.690
This is the idea which came from the request part perimeter.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:28.820
I can convert this into an integer before I can pass it on over here so I'll type your ID

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.560
equals toe parts into off idee.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.060
And if I go back to the postman,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.490
send this put request once again,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.700
you can t know that the idea came back with an integer off course.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.400
I can verify the same thing over here.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.800
Also not.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.230
I want to send the patch requests where only the name off this person I'm changing from

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.350
John to John Doe.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.440
The email should remain the same thing.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.850
So if I click on send,

00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:00.000
you can see that we have updated the name successfully while keeping the email as east.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.270
We can also go back here and then very funny.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.060
So it was the previous I'll put John.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.830
But if I send a request now,

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.850
you can see this John Doe when the email is intact.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.160
One last thing is to check the delete operation.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.650
So I go back over here.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.450
Three corresponds to John's record.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.940
Deleting it first earn should be successful,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.080
and you can see it is successful so you can go back here and then verify the same thing.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.800
Notice that the Johnson card is gone.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.380
However,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.270
if I go back and deleted again,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.760
this is going to be a four,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.560
not four,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.860
because there is no contact for I d tree.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.710
We can also very further working off this for not for for puttin patch also.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.530
So if I type here,

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:46.390
for example 22 I don't try to send it supposed to come back with for not for because I did

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.780
22 is invalid.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.330
Likewise,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.640
if I go to the patch,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.060
let's give it us 33 click on Send since I lead 33 is invalid.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.820
Patch also comes back with four,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.350
not four.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.150
So this is my solution for the assignment.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.810
I hope you also would have completed the past in a similar fashion
