00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
the extra DB Political also has a request Minted called Patch.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.890
The idea is toe do a partial update.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.220
So in this lecture,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.710
let's have a look at the same on First of all,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.050
let's create a new request over here.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.200
Select the patch method and send the same urine request,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.680
which is toe It's too typical and local host 3000 slash contacts slash some i D.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.250
But I want to send a body that contains probably partial data in case of the put,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.910
it would have completely replaced the contact details with one that they sent from here.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.960
But in this case,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.790
I'm gonna send only the email.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.040
But the name should not be touched.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.170
Let's give an example off Casey Sham at example dot com and let click on send.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.910
As usual,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.870
I should expect for not for because we don't have a corresponding handler function for the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.290
same.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.750
So that's going to create the one which can handle this particular request.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.360
So that's scrawled on.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.750
Over Here are a function called partial update.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.590
This function also has to receive these two parameters,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.060
so I'm gonna copy and paste the same thing over here.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.890
Also,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.580
the logic four dysfunction remains more or less the same thing as the update.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.090
So this part is gonna be the same thing.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.350
I'm gonna copy and paste that over here.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.810
But unlike the previous example where we completely replace the contact objectively given

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.850
index with the new one this time we're going to simply overrate the existing fields,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.190
and that's gonna be very simple.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.940
So we're going to say you're distort contacts.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.850
Off Index is equals to a new object,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.500
but the object is gonna get values from the same object.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.390
So there is this start contacts off index as well as some of the values coming from the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.870
body.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.550
So we're gonna say spread contact.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.190
So remember this already has name and email discontents only email.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.910
So the email in this one would be overturned by this one,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.230
and that's gonna be a completely new object.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.250
And that new object is going to replace the one in the current index.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.750
Once this is done,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.950
we're going to actually return distort contacts off index.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.740
Of course,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.850
if you don't want toe,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.250
send the actual object and you want to send a shallow copy.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.260
It's always a good idea toe.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.290
Do the same thing.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.690
Just put the spread operator over here.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.960
One last thing that we have to do is tow map.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.350
This particular function to the http request mattered patch,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.920
and that's done by taping at the Rate Patch Press enter to automatically import.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.430
And then,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.810
just like the port are the slash colon idee because this is the one that we're tryingto

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.570
receive toe this particular variable.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.640
Since my file is automatically saved,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.020
next year's would have automatically reloaded that there were also Let's go back to the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.400
Postman and see what actually is the current Valley for the I D to let's click on the send

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.950
ones.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.690
Then you can see that the name is Sham Emily Sham at example dot com But we're actually

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.340
changing the email tow Kingfish,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.640
Um,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.980
at example dot com.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.750
By sending this patch request,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.750
let's give it a try to consent,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.480
and you can see that the response comes back with the updated data.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.450
Name is not going to be disturbed,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.600
so it's also going to check that out over here.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.090
Click on Send and you can see that name Dimension.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.180
But email has changed Toe cassation.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.300
Example that come So this is how you handle a partial update using the patch http.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.260
Request matters.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.670
As for the http requests are concerned,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.540
the only thing that we have not done is the village on.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.260
That's what we're going to do in the next lecture.
