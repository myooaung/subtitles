00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
In many cases,

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.050
you will not need to write custom exception classes and can use the building nest http

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.680
exception.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.450
As described in the previous section.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.280
If you need to create customized exceptions,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.830
it's a good practice to create your own exception hierarchy,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.260
where your custom exception classes inherit from the base.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.360
Http exception.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.280
Class With this approach,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.450
Nest will recognize your exceptions on automatically taken off the error responses.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.390
To understand this custom exception classes.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's assume the user is going to make a request supplying a filing as a perimeter.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.190
And in case the file exists,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.060
we're going to send the data back to the user.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.410
But if the file doesn't exist,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.850
I want to throw an exception.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.150
But a custom exception called Fine Art formed exception.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.840
So let's go and write their handler for the same.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.760
I'm gonna write a function called Send File,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.150
which takes finding as a perimeter off type string.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.180
And here is where I want to get the content from the file and then return the same.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.100
So obviously,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.970
toe read the content from the file.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.910
I need the file system model,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.050
so I'm gonna go and type your import star as Fs from FS,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.540
and now I come down here and then say Let content equals toe efforts dot reid File Sync And

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.940
then the fine name is nothing with the fine name sent by the user past that.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.690
As an argument included,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.540
the file exists.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.890
It's going toe written the content over here.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.750
But if the fight doesn't exist,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.950
it's going toe throw an exception.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.290
And since we didn't handle the exception here,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.850
it's going to be handled by the default exception layer on that's going to give the adult

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.560
status as 500 description as internal server error.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.880
Let's give it a try,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.490
so I'm gonna go on type return content.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.850
We no need to map this function toe a u r l Some new type here.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.570
At the rate get the euro is going to contain the fine name.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.360
I'm gonna take your colon file name and that is supposed to be mapped to this variable.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.440
So we're gonna type your underrate bottom and then supply that file name,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.700
which is nothing with the You are a segment that is now being ascent over here.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.220
So whatever the find that the user is asking for,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.420
if it is not dead.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.700
We're going to get an error.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.950
Let's go and check it out.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.220
I'll stay here.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.330
Locals 3000 slash and then say we know dot Txt Because the five you know Doc txt doesn't

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.990
exist.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.890
It's going toe.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.090
Come back with an editor and you can see edl is internals.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.810
Are were better.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.570
I never go to the terminal over here.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.370
You can see there is an error that says no such file.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.910
All directory open,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.260
we know dot txt and that's caused by efforts dot reid File Sync.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.510
And since this is not one of the standard exception,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.250
nest automatically genders.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.220
The response.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.700
Jason,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.050
which contains scored 500 status message as internal server error.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.980
But this is where I want toe actually create my own exception.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.200
Plus and throw an object off that so to do so let's go to the SRC folder,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.370
create a new file.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.180
Let's call it us file not found dark exception dot t s and then you're gonna say export

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.510
class file not phoned.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.760
Exception extends its GDP exception exceeded.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.500
The exception comes from nest common,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.600
so we'll import the same thing and all I have to do here is toe call the super class

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.350
constructor by supplying the message under state of school.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.680
Since finite phone is something to do with their not found,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.200
so we're gonna send us to the score.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.180
That's for not for.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.660
But I should be able to get some information which I can for the positive that it's GDP

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.240
exception as message.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.890
So I'm going to read a constructor over here which probably gets an error.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.270
This could be a string are it could be an object.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.550
I will simply say any indicated the user has not passed.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.680
I can also assign some default,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.750
probably can't say file not found.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.050
And then inside the constructor,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.780
I simply have to say super and then I supply err on then for not for the incident,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.800
for not for you can also say Http status and then say dot You can see that there is not

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.010
phone which represents former for.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.670
Anyways,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.160
Now that I have my own exception plants,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.770
I can go to my APP controller where I have this court,

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.330
which might probably throw an exception If there is no exception,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.750
I would like to return the content,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.120
but if there is an exception,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.480
I want to handle that.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.170
So to do that,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.700
I'm gonna go and cut this.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.100
Now,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.080
put a try catch block over here and inside the try block.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.110
I'm gonna pace this,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.570
but in the catch block,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.440
I get the error object,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.190
and then I want toe construct my own error object and then supply that toe.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.560
Finer foreign exception,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.420
for example,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.250
I can say let at r equals toe an empty object.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.570
And then probably I can say time stamp.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.050
It calls toe new date dot to I s o string,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.120
like we did in the earlier case.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.790
Probably.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.380
I can also say message equals toe eat out message.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.650
And that's gonna be the text message I may get.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.270
Of course,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.730
this is not equal stupid.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.660
That's colon.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:18.320
And now I can say here through new file not found exception which takes an editor object.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.970
I have this,

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.840
er that I'm gonna supply to check both the scenarios.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.020
We will cleared one file under our project military.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.890
When I access that file,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.340
I should get the content.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.950
But if that file doesn't exist,

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.690
I should get the details at her message in the form off Jason.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.590
So I'm gonna create a new file over here,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.540
I'll say,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.140
we know dot Txt Let's have some basic information like my name,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.460
my email.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.850
Let's say I know want to access this u r l on the sea.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.180
But the scenarios I come down here how this we know dot txt Now,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.480
if I click on send,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.570
we should get the actual content.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.740
But I got this in what's called a buffer format.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.520
I want to get the textual value.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.780
So all I have to do is to supply the including here in the perimeter,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.850
off refiled.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.770
Think I'd say that this is a postulated as utf eight onda.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.870
Now I am supposed to get the content in text format.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.190
So let miss any day game and you can see we got the output.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.690
But if I type your say for example,

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.120
we know dot j pick I don't have a file called you know dot jp on this should give me an

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.700
exception.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.480
But this time it's supposed to be the Fine art fund exception the State Escort is gonna be

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.670
still for not for,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.090
but I get the details here likes times time on the actual error message also.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.800
So this is how you can create your own custom exception classes.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.720
All your to do is tow extinct.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.890
The building standard http.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.940
Exception plants and then pass on the information to its constructor.
