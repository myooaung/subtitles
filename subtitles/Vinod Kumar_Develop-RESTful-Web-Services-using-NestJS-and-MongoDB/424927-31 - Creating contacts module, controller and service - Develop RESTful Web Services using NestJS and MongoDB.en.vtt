00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Now that our project is up and running,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.850
let's create a model for our contacts application.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.090
I've written Toller on a service to the same model and to add a new model called Contacts.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.640
Let's type the command nest G G four generate Oregon State,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.460
the Complete World generate.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.380
And then I take your model,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.030
followed by the name of the model I want to create,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.750
which is nothing but contacts.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.210
When a press enter,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.300
it's going to create a folder called Contacts On Inside that it's going to create a file

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.270
called Context dot model Dirty Years as well as it makes an entry in the abductor model 40

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.550
years,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.560
which is our route model.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.150
Let us now create a controller.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.270
Once again the command is nest G and then see for controller Oregon type the world

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.070
controller itself and then the name of the controller we want to create.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.860
Once again,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.710
I want to give it us contacts because it is goingto be dumped into a folder called Contacts

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.530
and updates the model file,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.060
which is present in that folder,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.450
which is nothing but context model ts.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.500
So we have added a model and a controller on the only thing that is left is to create a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.000
service that's created by typing nest G service.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.110
And then the name of the surveys once again is going to be contacts I pressed.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.710
Enter.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.130
It's going to create a class along with its a speck and then update the contact start model

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.830
that tears.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.860
Let's go back to our area scored and verify whether on the court is gendered it properly.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.370
So if I go back toe beer scored at SERC Main Dirty years,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.930
no change over here.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.770
I were in the at modernity,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.230
as you can see that it has imported the context model.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.220
And then in the context model,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.650
which is under contacts,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.350
you can see that there is a controller on a provider,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.710
which is nothing but your contacts always over here before we proceed for the let us make

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.660
our app configured toe work with Mongo DB,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.790
which is running in local host to 7017 To do that,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.960
let's go to the ATM Adu LTs.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.150
And then in the import section.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.810
Let's import the Mongols model and configure the same.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.920
To do that,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.430
I'm gonna come here and then press enter,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.870
make some room here and then type here.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.240
Mongrels model 0.4 route and they type in the string,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.700
which is nothing but your connection.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.140
String to mongo db.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.530
So I'm gonna take your mongo db colon double slash local host Poland to 7017 Now,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.900
this happens to be the default port for mongo db so you don't have to explicitly mention

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.170
But then you need to give their DB that you want to connect,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.790
which is nothing but training.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.700
Let's give a comma here because it's an area and it says that mangoes model is not

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.290
available.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.850
So let's go here and then import the same.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.870
I put an empty curly bracket and then say from at the rate,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.450
Nestor Js slash mongrels.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.730
And if I now come down here,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.740
you may see that there is a intel isn't available.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.950
I can even press command dot and then it says add mongrels model to the existing import

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.570
declaration.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.350
So I'm gonna select that on automatically that comes up over here.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.440
Once our application is relieved,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.360
we will be connecting this toe the mongo db a plus,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.030
which is nothing but among would be cloud and all.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.470
I have to do is tow.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.820
Come back here and then change this year or early that connects.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.820
Stood among would be a class with the user name and password.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
So that's all for this lecture.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.150
In the next lecture,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.620
let's create a contact model,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.940
plus that represents our contact the resource and then consider the same toe work with

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.950
mongo db using mangoes.
