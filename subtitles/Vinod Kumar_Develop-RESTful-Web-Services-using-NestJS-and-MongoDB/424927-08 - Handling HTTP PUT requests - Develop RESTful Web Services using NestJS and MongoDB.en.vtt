X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
let's know,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.130
right,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.630
A new function over here on the map.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.770
The same thing to the its GDP put request matter.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.930
In theory,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.510
the it's TDP request mattered.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.650
Put he supposed toe update a resource,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.450
which means you're gonna send a contact with data on.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.570
We need to search for that particular record in our database and then we have toe replace

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.020
that are up,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.850
did the same thing.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.160
Unlike the Post,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.450
we're not actually modifying multiple records.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.500
But in case if that is what you want,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.360
you know how exactly that can be done.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.350
So the function we're gonna write is going toe have to perimeters.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.750
One is supposed to be the i d off the contact that we want to update.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.050
And the second is the request body which contains the new details off the contact.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.070
For example,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.150
I may want to send a put request toe This particular you are also let me copy this year

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.460
oral at a new tab over here selector.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.110
It's TTP put matter base that you're over here and if you want toe update the details off,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.430
let's say,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.320
for example,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.980
Sham.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.180
The idea is to we have to send it as part of the Ural segment here like this,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.460
it is as if you are supposed to search for the particular person with idea off to and

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.890
replace his or her details with the one that we're sending as part of the body.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.670
Once again,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.450
the body will be raw,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.950
and then we're going to send Jason content.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.920
In theory,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.190
the put request is supposed to replace the details off the person that we're searching for

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.770
with the details that I'm sending.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.630
Whereas if you want to send only partial data,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.950
then you may have toe handle the same thing using Patch.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.850
But for now,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.930
let's look at the put.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.590
So I want to update the name and email off contact with the I D to.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.670
So let's a name is going to be Sham cinder.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.580
Andi email is going to be,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.380
let's say Sham Casey at gmail dot com.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.780
And if I click on send once again,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.110
since we don't have the handler,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.720
we're gonna get for not four,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.650
we can give it a try and you see that we got the for not for,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.940
but we want to implement the feature Nam.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.050
So let's go back to Rhea scored on add a function called update contact,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.650
which this is an I.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.000
D.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.350
As the last body.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.860
And it's supposed to return the modified or updated contact details,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.510
which is nothing with the body itself.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.780
Notice that the body that we're sending doesn't contain the idea.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.190
The idea is going to be deterred from here.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.820
Even if I have added an I d over here,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.910
that should be ignored.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.610
So let's go and search for the contact with this idea first,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.230
and then replace that with this particular body fasting.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.620
First,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.170
let's add the decorators.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.350
So this is going to be at the rate put press enter to do an auto import at the parentis is

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.620
idea is supposed to come from the perimeter that we're gonna receive over here.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.870
So I'm gonna take your slash colon idee and then here a monotype at the rate bottom off.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.260
I d whatever that were given over here is the value for at the rate for,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.420
um,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.460
decorator on this is gonna be at the dead body.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.140
Now,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.660
Since we know that this is going to represent the contact,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.750
I can simply type your contact.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.570
I missed their single courts over here that's where we're seeing the other.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.850
And now we have to take this contact set this value as its I d on then replace the contact

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.510
in our member variable.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.260
First of all,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.180
let's check if this is a valid I.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.520
D.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.740
So to do that instead of using the find Amber News,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.790
the find index.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.940
So I said this start contact start find index and I will receive unusual contact from the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.270
Ari.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.800
And then I'm gonna check if Cedar idee is it equals toe the idea that we're supplied once

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.150
again,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.250
keep in mind that we're going to use a double equals instead of triple equals,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.720
because when the perimeter was received,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.230
it will be in the form of a string,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.970
although we can convert that into an integer.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.330
But for the time being,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.370
we're going to use that as is So this is a new medical I d over here and then we're

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.650
comparing that with their string I d.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.950
But as long as their values are saying this is going to return true and if that is true,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.740
this is the contact that we're searching for.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.130
We get the index of the same thing over here so I'm gonna type here.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.820
Let index equals toe this for their cynical.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.560
And over here,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.730
however,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.840
if the Islay given is wrong and not to be found in the entire area Bigot minus one as the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.960
index value.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.070
So we're gonna check your if index equals toe minus one.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.170
We're gonna say throw new,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.750
not found exception.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.800
We have seen this in the previous lectures where the response scored off for not for will

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.350
be sent.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.500
However,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.680
if this doesn't take place.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.230
So we are here in light number 58.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.670
Now we're going to say contact our idea called Stow the idea given over here,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.180
which is what we distinct.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.590
Of course,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.690
you can always do a part into just to make sure that it is a numerical value.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.340
And now we have toe replace the contact details in this index with the new contract object

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.810
over here.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.280
I'm going to say,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.240
here they start contacts off index,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.610
so the value in that particular index is going to be replaced with the local variable

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.340
contact.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.460
And finally,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.230
we're gonna say written contact.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.560
This will now go as a response in the form off.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.190
Jason,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.520
let's go and check the same thing since two is a valued I d.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.270
We will first check What is the current value off that?

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.870
And remember,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.820
were working in in memory data.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.060
Even though I see six off them over here.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.490
It was the previous request.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.240
Since the sorrow restarted,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.800
everything in the memories reset.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.610
And now I have only four contact.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.640
So if I click on send,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.450
I should get four of them.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.050
And this is the current value for Sean.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.470
Whose ideas too.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.190
I'm gonna go and send this request now and now we can see the response came back with the

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.500
modified content.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.060
If I go back over here and then click on send,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.470
you can see that the value off Sham has changed due to chance Inder and Charm Casey at

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.350
gmail dot com.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.150
However,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.790
if I go and try toe update a value,

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.230
which is that there for example,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.200
25 25 is an invalid lady.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.110
No matter what I'm sending over here,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.700
I'm gonna get for not for over here because 25 is an invalid.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.910
I d If you want,

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.270
you can also customize these other messages.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.150
We will have a separate section for handling these kind of errors and exceptions.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.780
So to summarize,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.580
we have toe write a function and decorate the same using at the rate put the put always

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.230
receives a part segment over here,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.750
which is representing the I d off the person that we're tryingto edit,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.260
and that idea will be positive into a variable.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.110
The entire request body is also going to be received,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.350
which is going to be eventually updated.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.240
Toe our source data and in case if the idea given is wrong and you want to respond,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.050
the user with for not for all you have to do is tow throw a not phoned exception.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.930
So that's all for this lecture.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.010
In the next lecture,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.450
let's see how we can handle the patch.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.190
Http method where partial data can be updated without any problem.
