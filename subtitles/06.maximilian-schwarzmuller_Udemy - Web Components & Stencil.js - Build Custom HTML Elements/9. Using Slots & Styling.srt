1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:11,400
Now using props is one great way of interacting with the DOM or with the outside world and of getting data

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,410
into your component.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,490
Now of course there are other ways as well,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,080
one way is a slot and slots work exactly in the same way as they do in vanilla Javascript. You can also

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,140
have name slots as we did there and you set up named slots in exactly the same way because stencil

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,130
uses exactly the same API in the end.

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,090
Now here I got a slot and this of course enables us to add something between the opening and closing

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,770
tag of our side drawer

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,120
and there we could have an unordered list with some list items, maybe all wrapped in a nav item because it

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,060
is a navigation we might be adding here but this gives us the flexibility to use the side drawer for

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,460
anything, doesn't have to be a side navigation, could also be an info screen that is added to some page

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:09,190
but here, we could have content like this, a link, another link, a third link.

13
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,250
This is all passed in from outside

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,440
and if we come back, we see this gets displayed there and we still change the title after three seconds,

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,310
I guess.

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,660
So this is another way of passing in data and just as before, we can of course also style this slotted

17
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,550
content, however we can't style the nested slot content,

18
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:36,140
so if we want to kind of style all the links in our side drawer here, we can't really do that

19
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,240
through the slotted special selector because as you learned, you can only change the top level element

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,800
there,

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,280
so the general styling of your content has to be done outside of your component in the light DOM.

22
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,050
Now lets still do some styling here.

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,950
One styling I want to do in general here in my light

24
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,500
DOM and I'll use style tags,

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,140
we could also import a CSS file but I'll simply do it here,

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,120
I want to set a base font-family of sans-serif because I prefer that.

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,890
But now for the content in the side drawer to style that, I could only target the nav item here, the other

28
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,250
content is hidden away from me.

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,660
So if I want to style that, then I have to do it here in the light DOM.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,240
So there I could give this a class of side nav for example and then we could assign some style here,

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:38,880
side nav and for example ensure that the unordered list in there has a list style of none to remove

32
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,850
these bullets

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:49,660
and that my links in there have no text decoration to remove the underlining and maybe a color of orange,

34
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,460
something like that,

35
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:58,790
now we would have this side menu. Let me turn this from orange to dark orange

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,570
maybe, yes like that.

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,050
Now you can style this way more,

38
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,680
this is not really about web component, so I don't want to do that,

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,310
I just want to highlight and that is not a restriction of stencil but of slots in general,

40
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,760
you can style the contents you pass in through slots from inside component,

41
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,340
you only have access to the top level element, so you could style the nav element in your component

42
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,090
through this special slotted selector.

43
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,190
You can't style the nested content though, so you have to do that from the light DOM. And with that, let me also comment out

44
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,050
this code that changed the title because I don't want to do that anymore.

45
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,600
Now one thing we can of course change is the position of the title in the drawer because that is of course

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,970
part of the side drawer,

47
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:51,110
this header. So we can go into our drawer and in there, add the header style and maybe add a padding of 1rem

48
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:59,330
to all directions and also ensure that the header h1 tag maybe has a font size of 1.5rem

49
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,880
and now this certainly looks different and maybe we also want to give it the header a certain background

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,350
color of black and give our text here a color of white

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,810
then, looks nice

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,800
and now let's also remove the margin on the h1 tag because I added a padding to the header already

53
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,070
and now this looks quite decent

54
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,140
in my opinion.

55
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,980
Now let me just style the links a little bit more so that they look a little bit better,

56
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,290
I will actually change the color to black and I will add a style here,

57
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:41,060
side nav list item style where I set a margin top and bottom to 1rem and left and right to zero so

58
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,800
that there is some spacing between the links.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
Now I don't have any hover effect or anything

60
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,960
but now this doesn't look too bad, doesn't look too shabby

61
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,000
and we now had a look at the slots again and improve the styling a little bit as well.
