00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.970
I think our side drawer is making really good progress here.

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.600
Now one functionality we have learned about in vanilla web components which we haven't implemented here

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:22.390
though is that we can also work with methods in our component that we can call from outside of this

4
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.570
component. Use case would be that in index.html, we might want to open the side drawer, not by setting

5
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.840
this property which is absolutely fine but maybe also by calling some method, sideDrawerOpen, like

6
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.420
this. Now

7
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.460
currently, we have no such method but of course we can add one in the side drawer, right.

8
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.410
So here we can add an open method like that

9
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.550
and then here, we can set this open to true,

10
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.240
right.

11
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.010
Remember this

12
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.130
open, this is our property here with the prop decorator right there which is mutable, so we can change it from

13
00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.610
inside

14
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.730
and this makes sense if you have properties like this one which can be changed from in and outside

15
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.470
and now, I have my open method.

16
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.350
The problem is open is also the name of this property, hence I get an error here

17
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.380
and therefore, I will actually rename this property to opened,

18
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.540
so in all the places where I have this.open, I'll set it to this.opened and of course also in the CSS code,

19
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.620
I now have to watch for the opened attribute being present

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.500
and now open is a valid name.

21
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.010
Now if I save this with this method added, if I open the side menu, I get an error, side drawer open is

22
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.820
not a function. By the way, it doesn't have this, a function named like this.

23
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.310
The thing is behind the scenes, stencil translates your code you have

24
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.230
here into vanilla web component code but it does not necessarily keep the names of your methods and

25
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.130
so on,

26
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.400
it also moves your code around and therefore, this is actually not a publicly exposed method of your

27
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.830
web component.

28
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.260
If you want to create such a method though, you can easily do so. You can add another decorator above

29
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.980
or in front of this method name

30
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.890
and that is the method decorator, this also needs to be imported from @stencil/core.

31
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.340
Now we add it in front of the method which should become a public method and in front of course could

32
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.630
also be done like this,

33
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:40.420
it's just a convention that for methods, you add it above it just as you add component above of your class.

34
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.980
And now with add method added here,

35
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.380
this suddenly is a publicly available method.

36
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.860
So with this little change, with the method decorator added, if we reload,

37
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.080
now we don't get this error anymore. But it's also not working,

38
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.450
the reason for that can be found in the index.html file though, here I'm checking whether side

39
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.920
drawer open is true,

40
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.870
well I rename this to opened,

41
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.200
right,

42
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.850
so we should rename it there too.

43
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.230
With that change if I reload,

44
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.220
now this works, just as before.

45
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.790
So now we also learned how we can add methods and now we can really create rich web components with

46
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.760
a broad API where people can interact with them through attributes, by setting properties or calling

47
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.780
methods.

48
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.300
And it's not that uncommon that you expose multiple ways of interacting with your component to give

49
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.300
your users, your consumers, the developers using your web components different consumption methods.
