00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,860
Congratulations, you've finished this course and I hope you learned a lot about web components and you

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,760
now feel confident creating your own web components. Simply dive in and practice, practice, practice.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,430
This is the best way of becoming better,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,900
play around with the different features you learned about in this course,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,960
also consider building native web components without stencil

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,070
again, play around with that but I would strongly recommend using a tool like stencil.js because it

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,350
is just so awesome

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,850
and then build web components for your own projects or also to share them with the public.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,090
So feel free to share your web components on npm or at least across your own projects.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,850
Dive into web component libraries like Ionic as a next step,

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,480
stencil.js was actually developed by the team behind Ionic and Ionic is a set of web components

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:59,010
that quickly turn your web app into a modern automatic adapting web application that looks great on

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,490
mobile devices.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,050
Also, try out web components together with frameworks,

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,000
I showed you how to use web components with Angular, with React and so on,

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,280
so give this a try and start implementing web components into your next projects

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,760
there, you might be able to save a lot of time by reusing your web components across projects

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,040
after all, you don't have to rewrite that modal all the time and you will refine your web components

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,340
as you do so because in one project, you might need one extra functionality, you add it to the web component

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,010
and suddenly, you have that available in all your projects too.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,100
Awesome.

22
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,930
Now last but not least, stay up to date. With technologies like web components,

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:46,830
you should simply dig into additional resources like MDN, the Mozilla Developer Network that is or other

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,730
blocks, Google Developer pages where you can learn more about these features that make up web components,

25
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,900
how they evolve and how browser support evolves,

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,970
that is also something you can check on stencil.js's home page for example. Attached to this lecture,

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,540
you will find some links that will allow you to dive deeper and learn more about web components and

28
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,020
stay up to date.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,460
Now one thing I want to mention right away is that for stencil.js,

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,580
so a tool that helps you with creating web components,

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,510
there are alternatives.

32
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,700
For example when you search for lit element, this is another solution that also allows you to create

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,090
web components, native web components with some extra help,

34
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,000
so with an extra tool or package and you can learn more about that on its official page, attached to

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,770
this video you also find a link to it of course.

36
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,480
Now I absolutely love stencil.js and going with it is certainly not wrong but it's always important

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,600
to also know that there are alternatives and if you search for web component compiler and so on, you will

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,140
find more alternatives,

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,010
so also feel free to have a look at those.
