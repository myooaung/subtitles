00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,220
So that's it for this module. You learned a lot about the basics of web components, that there are two

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,880
ways of creating them, by extending HTML element or a specific HTML element like the anchor element.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,320
That you can have a constructor in which you always have to call super

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,690
first where you can do some basic initializations and where you can also set up your shadow DOM if you

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,660
want to use it which you often want because it gives you a lot of advantages, where you can then if you

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,960
use the shadow DOM also initialize the template, the HTML code of the shadow DOM or if

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,230
you're using a HTML template which we're not doing anymore here

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,530
but if you were to use that, you could get access to it here,

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,470
it would not be rendered by default in the HTML element

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,440
and instead you could read it here and then assign it to your shadow DOM. That you can use something like

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,830
slots in your template no matter if you use the in Javascript template here or to one in the 

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,000
HTML file. That you also have some lifecycle hooks of which we only used one, we'll see the other hooks later.

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,850
We used the connectedCallback and that there is one important thing about the connectedCallback, at

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,230
this point of time our custom element will have been added to the real DOM,

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,120
so if we want to do DOM manipulations on our element, not on its shadow DOM, that is possible earlier

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,450
but on the element itself or if you want to get access to its attributes for example, we have to do that

17
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,690
in the connectedCallback. That you can add properties and methods to your class which you can then call

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,660
from other places as we do it here, That you have to register your own elements with the custom elements

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:50,130
define method where you then choose your own tag name which has to have at least one dash in it to ensure

20
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:57,090
it's not clashing with the built-in elements and that you should choose a unique name here. And that you

21
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,990
then just have to import your style, your scripts excuse me and then you can start using your elements

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,830
like this

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,630
or in case you are extending a specific element, like this. This is basically what you learned here.

24
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,950
Now there is more to custom components, to custom elements and we will learn more about that over the

25
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:25,470
next lectures and modules but this is a crucial set of basics that should now be clear and that already

26
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,940
allows you to build some nice web components.
