1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,300
So we want to be able to show that modal and for that, we need a way to control the visibility of the

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,930
backdrop and the modal.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:18,350
Now there are various ways of doing so in CSS, we can set the opacity, we can set the display property, 

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,860
anything like that.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,150
What we will need in the end is some way to pass in the information whether this should be visible or not

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,400
from outside,

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,820
so from our main document because one possible way would be to set let's say an open attribute, either

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,870
set this to true or as you also see it on some built-in elements, just open, for example the built-in

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:50,030
button element has a disabled attribute which you also add just like this. So when open or opened maybe

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,270
is added let's say, then we want to show to modal, if it's not added, we don't want to show it.

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,550
And now I'll add a script tag here and you could outsource this into a different file too of course where

12
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,170
I want to do something when this button is clicked and I want to add this opened attribute when we

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,360
click it.

14
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:15,830
So I will now get access to my confirm button here maybe, by using document query selector and I can

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:22,790
select a button here because another advantage of the shadow DOM, we will just fetch this button because the

16
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:29,930
buttons in our modal are part of the shadow DOM and therefore, we are in no danger of accidentally selecting

17
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,670
these from outside.

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,970
So that's another advantage of the shadow DOM here,

19
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,860
when we select something in our main document, we only select buttons in that main document and in this

20
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,980
case, we only have one button so I can use this query selector and then, I'll add my event listener here

21
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,490
for the click event

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:02:00,600
and here, I want to add the opened attribute to my uc-modal element. For this, I'll get access to my modal

23
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,500
with document query selector

24
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,060
and now we can simply use uc-modal as a selector because this is a valid tag by which we can select

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,530
it

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:18,180
and then we could say modal set attribute opened and now we need to assign a value here and I'll set

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,340
this to an empty string.

28
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:27,040
Now in order to be able to see that effect, we have to make sure that we're not showing the modal by

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,550
default which we currently are and especially its backdrop is blocking us from clicking anything.

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:43,240
So to hide it by default, we got a couple of possible ways of solving this. One way of making sure we

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,880
can show and hide this is to set the opacity to 0 by default which will hide this but then we'll

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,700
face a problem actually because now if I reload this, it is hidden but we still can't click this because

33
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,470
even though it's invisible, it's fully opaque, it's still in front of us,

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,670
now we could change the set index but we can also set the pointer events here

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,990
to none and this will not accept any clicks on the backdrop but let them through instead.

36
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,360
We do the same on the modal, we just have to change this later when we show it so that we then really

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,920
block clicks through it

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,620
but here, we want to allow them.

39
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,690
So now if I reload, I can click this.

40
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,920
And if you watched, you saw opened was added here on the right,

41
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,160
let me show this again.

42
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,290
If I reload this modal here, it doesn't have the opened attribute

43
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,700
but if I click this button, watch it here on the right, here it is, there it opened.

44
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,930
So this is working

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,580
and now in the next lecture, we can work on doing something in our component

46
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,850
when this opened attribute is added.
