00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:10,850
Let's start with our lost text, it's easy to bring back because the template solution here has a tool

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:19,280
for us to enable us to pass some content between our opening and closing tags of the web component and

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,970
this feature is called slots.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,090
We can define a slot in the template which basically means, hey you can insert the content which is between

5
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,370
the opening and closing tags of our element in that place.

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,650
You do it by simply adding a slot element, opening and closing,

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,610
nothing in between, like this inside our template.

8
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,610
If you do that with just that addition, if you now reload the page, you'll see our text is back

9
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,600
and now the question mark is correctly added after it

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,020
because essentially, it's now taking this as a template and this template says here is the place for

11
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,840
whatever you passed between the opening and closing tag

12
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,030
and thereafter we have our own DOM, our own template or whatever we want to have.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,670
So this works now as before but now we're taking advantage of that slotting mechanism. Now

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:26,910
slots also can have a default value, some default and this will kick in if you don't pass anything between

15
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,530
the opening and closing tags,

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,260
so if I delete my text down there for the second usage of this custom component and I then go back to

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:41,970
the page and reload, we see some default here because the text I passed between my slots tags then is

18
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,920
used as a default unless we overwrite it with our own text as we do up there.
