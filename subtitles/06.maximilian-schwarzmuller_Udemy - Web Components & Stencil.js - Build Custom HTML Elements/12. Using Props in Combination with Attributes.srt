1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,610
So we ensured that the side drawer can be opened,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,870
right now only through the dev tools, we'll  add a button soon and we're doing this only with the help

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,680
of attributes and CSS. This works and in many cases, this might be all you need.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,140
There are also reasons why you might want to use it as or what might want to add it as a prop with the

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,120
prop decorator too though.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,670
Now stencil will automatically check if an open attribute is valid and it'll synchronize this open property

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,480
to any value you might set to the open attribute.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,620
This can be helpful if you want to be able to check the current status,

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,940
is it open or not?

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,240
You can now do this through this property, both from inside this component as well as from outside

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,950
and this can be useful when we add a button for opening the side drawer.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,070
I will add this button here,

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:07,930
a normal button where I say open side menu and I will add some logic in my application script here so

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,820
to say, to the script in the index.html file to watch for clicks on this button. So I'll name this side

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:23,500
drawer button and I will use a query selector here and I will query for an ID which I assigned

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,660
to this button, sideDrawerButton,

17
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,440
you can of course use any ID you want,

18
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,760
I'll just query for that down there

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:39,790
and with that queried, I will add a click listener here, side drawer button,

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,960
add event listener

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,930
click and when I click this, I want to open my side drawer but I only want to do so when it's not

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,250
currently open. And for that, I will access the side drawer,

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:57,330
remember this gives me access to my web component because I select it by its tags here and there,

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,200
I can now check the open property, so I can check if side drawer open and do something if that is the

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,110
case or in my case, I check for the opposite by adding an exclamation mark and I check whether this is

26
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,690
not open and only if it is not open,

27
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,630
I'll try to open it and now I can open it in a couple of different ways.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,080
For example I can now of course set open to true,

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,810
I could have also used set attribute or we add a method which we can call from outside

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,240
but more on that later, we haven't learned that yet,

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,840
so let's instead do it like this

32
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,620
and in my side drawer, I actually want to reflect changes to this prop back to my attributes, so I

33
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,470
will add the reflect to attribute configuration to this prop as well.

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,070
Now if I go back, we have this button and I get an error when I click it, that is an error I have in

35
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,320
my index.html file,

36
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,400
of course it's not this side drawer, side drawer is a normal constant here, so no need for this,

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,830
I'm not in a class here. So let's quit this and now this works. Now let me also show to you that is only

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,570
opens it once by for one

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:20,090
adding a console log here right before I call or before I set open to true, opening side drawer and I

40
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:27,820
also want to be able to click that button all the time. So I will make sure it is elevated above my side drawer

41
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:37,130
by setting its style, giving it a set index of 1000 and a background of black and a color of

42
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,810
white so that we can always see it and for the set index to have an effect,

43
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:50,600
I'll also give it a position of absolute and now if we reload, here it is.

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,070
Now it's always on top,

45
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,110
we'll change this soon

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,310
but now if I click this again, you'll see opening side drawer is not getting printed more than once

47
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,250
so it does indeed not open it again.

48
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,510
Now I'll remove all that styling here,

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,430
that was just for demo purposes.

50
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,040
So now we can indeed see that having this as a prop can be useful too,

51
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,420
also because now we can open the side drawer programatically here if we want to.
