00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.500
Now here is the stencil project which we created in the last module

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.740
and first of all, I want to start a development server which is part of that project we created. For this,

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.250
I'll again open my integrated terminal here under view, integrated terminal or this terminal here

4
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.100
or use your normal system terminal or command prompt and navigate into this folder and then run npm

5
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.060
start.

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.690
Now this executes a script here in the package.json file, this start script that is triggered by that command

7
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.280
and this in the end runs a little development server.

8
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.000
Now what is a development server?

9
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.010
This is in the end a simple web server where we don't have to write any configuration or do any configuration,

10
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.110
which serves this index.html

11
00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.980
file as well as all our build components and this build process happens in memory only in the

12
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.890
development server

13
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.890
which is why we don't see any output there. The dist output which we generated in the last module is

14
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.120
not used here,

15
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.450
this build process happens in memory and this allows us to simply preview our components, that's the

16
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.140
sole purpose of this development server.

17
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.090
When we later want to share our components, we don't have to share this server or use that server at all,

18
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.210
we will just share the output of the dist folder and I will show you how to use it in a later module

19
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.570
but here for development, we can simply serve that index.html

20
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.170
file through that development server and there as we are currently doing it by default with this

21
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.480
built-in component or with this default component the new project ships with,

22
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.570
we can simply add our components,

23
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.060
play around with them and test them.

24
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.250
The development server once started should have opened a new window in your browser,

25
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.700
otherwise you should manually visit http://www.localhost:3333

26
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.680
and there, you see the output of this first demo component with which we start

27
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.660
which is this my component thing.

28
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.720
Now we will replace that in the next lectures and write our own component from scratch to learn it

29
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.040
but this is now the development environment

30
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.260
we have. Definitely keep that npm start process running, it does not quit automatically,

31
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.900
you can always quit it with control c

32
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.270
but we want to keep it running because as long as it is running, it will watch all your components you

33
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.570
add in the source components folder for changes as well as it'll watch for the creation of new components

34
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.020
and it will also watch for changes in the index.html

35
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.880
file and it will automatically rebuild your components and reload this page

36
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.610
whenever you do change something.

37
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.480
So just to quickly demonstrate this, in this component there,

38
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.310
we output Hello World! with one exclamation mark.

39
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.850
If I add multiple exclamation marks and I save that file, it automatically picks that up and it reloads

40
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.290
here and that of course speeds up our development experience.

41
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.650
So this is the environment with which we'll work

42
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.290
and now, let's actually get rid of that component here,

43
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.260
simply delete it and also delete it here in index.html

44
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.610
and let's add a new component with which we can work to build it from scratch.
