00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,140
Now let's work a bit on the styling and the thing which I explained in the last lecture,

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:15,150
the fact that our slotted content is not actually part of the shadow DOM has one important implication.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,090
If we go back to our code,

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm talking about this web components text here of course,

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,510
it's not part of the shadow DOM as I now mentioned multiple times.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,040
This means that I can style this through the light DOM,

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,440
so through the styles set up in the light

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,410
DOM and I want to do exactly that right now.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,070
Just format this a little bit

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,110
and now here to make it really clear that I can style it from outside,

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,150
I'll wrap this in a span, simply so that I have a tag, a selector which I can use in my light DOM CSS

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,360
and I will give this a class of let's say highlight.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,880
Let's say this is a class we have in our default page styles,

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,240
in this case here, I have my highlight class selector

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,050
and again really important to recognize that this is now all happening in the light

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,700
DOM, this is not the scoped styling in the web component,

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,160
it's our normal styling in our normal page

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,400
and that could of course also be done in an external CSS file.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:26,200
And let's say for the highlight style here, I typically assign a background color of yellow,

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,630
maybe not this yellow but maybe like a light lime yellow here, like this

21
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,340
or actually so that you can see it a bit better,

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,350
let me go with a light orange,

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,690
I guess that's a bit easier to see.

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,820
Now when I save that and I reload this page, you'll see that this is getting this light orange background

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,130
and again this is not some styling set up in the web component,

26
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,060
it is general styling set up in my HTML page

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,510
and again, this could also be in an external style file.

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,430
So my styles here still apply because this span here which holds my text is part of a light DOM,

29
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,730
not of a shadow DOM and I can make this even clearer if I dive into my tooltip and there into the

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,630
styling for the shadow DOM and there,

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,460
let me also add a highlight class selector,

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,500
now in the styles

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,340
of the shadow DOM and let me give this a background of red.

34
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,600
So here I have a background color, so let's make this equal even though it wouldn't make a difference but

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,040
now a background color of this light orange in the light DOM and a background color of red in the shadow DOM.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,080
And please be aware or see that this is the exact same CSS selector,

37
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,540
so we have a class selector here too in the shadow DOM.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,070
And now if I reload my page here, we still have the orange style

39
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,850
and if inspect this span here and we have a look at how the styling gets applied,

40
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,600
we see there also is no other styling getting applied except for this orange background color.

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,920
So it's not like this would be overwriting the shadow DOM styles,

42
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,320
the shadow DOM styles simply don't matter here because it is not part of the shadow DOM

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,250
and I'm just emphasizing this because this is so important, that has an important implication for styling.

44
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,870
Now of course though, you could have the use case that you do want to style your slotted content from

45
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,170
inside the shadow DOM because you might be creating a web component that should very well set up

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,530
some default styling for the projected content,

47
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,380
so for the content that's passed into slots. And how could you solve that then?
