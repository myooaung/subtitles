00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:09,760
Well if you want to style slotted content, there is a special selector you can use inside your web component,

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:19,850
so inside your shadow DOM styling and that is a special pseudo-selector, ::slotted. This will select

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:28,280
all slotted content and the way it works is that you call this like a function here in CSS and to it,

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,830
you pass the selector of the slotted content,

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,630
so now you could say I want to select all slotted content that has the highlight class or all slotted

6
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,520
content that is a span or an anchor tag,

7
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:48,200
so anything like that. Important though, you can only select the slotted content itself.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,410
So if for example in my slotted content here in this span, I also had an anchor tag in there,

9
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,530
then what you could not do,

10
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:05,060
you could not select slotted and then the span, this would still work because the slotted content is

11
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,210
the span but you can select the child element in the top level slotted content.

12
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,040
So this would not style the anchor tag in your slotted span because you can only select the topmost

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,280
element for styling,

14
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,280
this is an important restriction you have here.

15
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,020
So if you have nested content, you can't select this but you can select the span or since this is also directly on

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,150
the slotted content in our case here,

17
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:38,570
the highlight class. And then here, what we could do is we could give this a border bottom of 1px

18
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:48,260
dotted and red for example, save that and go back and reload this page and you will see this slight

19
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,160
red border here

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,400
and if I inspect this again, you see here is our style getting applied, the border bottom is having

21
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,480
effect here.

22
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,470
Still important to highlight the order of the styles here,

23
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:09,650
the styling you set up in the light DOM will overwrite your slotted styling you set up in the shadow DOM

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,830
and the idea here simply is that you always want to give the user the final say on how things should look

25
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,350
like

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,720
but you can set up some default styling you want to have as we do it here.

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,400
But if we were to set a border bottom in the light DOM too, so in our case for the highlight class, if I

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,220
had a border bottom of let's say 2px solid and blue here, then you would see that if we reload

29
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,300
this page, we see that border instead of our red dotted border

30
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,900
because whilst this rule still gets applied,

31
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,330
it gets overwritten here.

32
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,350
So the specificity in CSS is such that light

33
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:54,290
DOM styling overrides shadow DOM styling for projected or slotted content.

34
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,000
This is just one thing to be aware of,

35
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,970
I will comment this out here in the light DOM because I don't want to overwrite it,

36
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,900
I want to have my red dotted border but it is something you definitely have to be aware of.

37
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,030
This can be overwritten from inside the light DOM.
