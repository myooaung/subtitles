1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,380
Let's add some content in the modal,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,190
so inside of my modal div there, I actually want to have three sections.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,040
I want to have a header in there which holds a title

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,430
and for now, I'll simply have dummy title there, h1 tag, please confirm.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,260
Below the header here,

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,380
I want to have a section,

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,760
maybe with the ID main, whatever you want and in there, I'll have a slot because I want to be able to

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,790
pass the content that is displayed as a message into this modal from outside and actually you are of

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,370
course not limited to passing in some text here,

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:53,150
you can pass in anything here, you can pass in an image, button, form, inputs whatever you want.

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:59,990
So I reserve a slot here and then below that slot, I'll have another section and this should be the

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,890
section where I have my button or my two buttons, I want to have two buttons in here.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,090
I'll give this section an ID of actions and the first button will be cancel, the second button will

14
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,350
be confirm or ok or whatever you want

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,080
and of course you could also create this in a more generic way,

16
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,890
we have to draw a border at some point here, so I will go for the hardcoded buttons here,

17
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,790
you could definitely find a solution where this can be passed in through slots too and I will show you how

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,600
to have different slot parts in your template

19
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,490
here in a second, we'll see that later in this module.

20
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,900
So now I have these buttons in here,

21
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,630
now we can style that a little bit.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:51,700
I'll select actions with the ID selector, give this a border to the top of 1px solid and a light

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,460
gray

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,320
look let's say and if I now reload this, this is how it looks like.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,290
I definitely wanted a different layout here,

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,280
I want to distribute all these pieces across the available space. So for the entire modal here, I'll actually

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,380
set the display to flex using flex box and if that is something you don't know, attached to this video,

28
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,650
you'll find some helpful resources for learning flex box,

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,720
it's a way of managing the layout in CSS or managing boxes

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,080
elements in CSS and distributing them.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,970
I'll set the flex direction to column here

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:37,310
and I set justify content to space between here and this should ensure that if I now reload this all,

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,570
the buttons are at the end here. And now I just want to go to my actions,

34
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:51,120
give this a padding of let's say 1rem and also select my actions button elements here and give them

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,520
a margin left and right of 1rem and with that, we have our buttons in here.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:06,450
Actually I want to have that differently, I want to give them 0.25rem to left and right margin and

37
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:18,560
in my actions here, I'll set display to flex too and I'll set justify content here to flex-end. So

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,630
now I have my buttons here at the bottom

39
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,610
and now of course you could style these buttons differently, for example make the cancel button red or

40
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,260
yellow-ish and make the OK button green,

41
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,520
I will keep them as they are because I don't want to lose too much time on all that styling. Let me quickly

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,430
style that title up there though,

43
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:44,590
so the header, I'll add the header selector here and there, I'll set up padding of 1rem, just as I

44
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,270
have it here for the actions and I'll then also add a header 

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,880
h1 selector to select a h1 tag we have in the header and set the font size to 1.25rem

46
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,770
maybe.

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,560
Let's see, yes,

48
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,880
and now we can present any content we want.

49
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,380
Now I will also get rid of that height

50
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,060
I set up there, that was only set temporarily to have some height when we had no content

51
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,040
but now, it should be as high as the content we pass in requires that to be

52
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,980
and we can pass in any content we want.

53
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,170
Since I have a slot, we can go between the opening and closing tags of our modal

54
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:31,410
and for example add a paragraph and then add any message we would want to show here, with your confirmation

55
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:39,120
you agree to pay the full amount, whatever your app might be showing here. And now with this paragraph

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,330
added between the opening and closing tag of our modal,

57
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,090
if I reload the page, we see it here and now again, time for some styling.

58
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,070
Let's go back to the modal,

59
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:56,100
keep in mind that the slot is inside of the main section, so I'll style this main section here, selected

60
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,810
by the ID selector main and give it a padding of 1rem too

61
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:06,330
and if you would want to style the paragraph itself, you can use the techniques you learned in the last

62
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,480
lectures with the slotted pseudo-selector for example. Here 

63
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,580
I got no need to do that,

64
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,690
so I will leave it as it is here.

65
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,450
With that, we've got a nice looking modal in my opinion,

66
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,720
let's now ensure that we can also open and close it

67
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,360
and we want to open it when this show details in confirm button here is pressed.

68
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,990
So that will be our next task

69
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,780
and if you have an idea for that,

70
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,520
definitely try it on your own first.
