1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:08,320
Now this was again a lot of new information. In the next module we'll practice this a bit more when we

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,140
build a more complex web component that will take a lot of the things you learned into account, giving

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,380
you a great chance of practicing it but we'll also introduce new things.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,210
I want to wrap this up now, I want to wrap up this module

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,980
now and there's one thing I just want to do quickly.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:31,480
I promised that we would change the way we set our position for our entire web component

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:38,110
instead of setting it to the style, to the inline style of our web component, of our custom element here,

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,220
I will remove it here in the connectedCallback,

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,360
this is a relict from times when we didn't know how to style our element correctly.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,760
Now we know we can use the host selector,

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:56,500
so let's use host without any condition to set our position to relative. Just a little change that makes

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,380
a lot of sense with all the knowledge we have now, works as before

13
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,000
but now we have this little improvement here, a better way of styling our web component.

14
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,180
We still have the relative style here

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,410
or the relative position but now applied through the host instead of by setting the inline style as

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,880
it did before.

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:22,600
But with that, we learned a lot about styling in general, about the host, the host with condition, the

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,140
host context and the slotted special selectors that allow you to style your slot content, your element

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,180
and your element with certain condition attached to it.

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,870
You learned about CSS variables,

21
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,780
very helpful for setting up some themes

22
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,910
your component uses, so the developers using your component can choose from.

23
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:51,150
You learned about how you can listen to changes in your attributes with the attributeChangedCallback

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,030
and observedAttributes.

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:59,230
You learned how to use the disconnectedCallback for cleanup and I hopefully got you thinking about at least

26
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:06,670
using or considering this render method for all your DOM updates, so that the rest of your component

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,990
can focus on changing the data

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:15,430
whilst this is the only place interested in changing your shadow DOM. And now with all that knowledge,

29
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,280
let's move on and let's build a more complex web component in the next module where we will see many

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,620
of these things again

31
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,950
but where we will also dive into some other new interesting features or functionalities you can implement with

32
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,050
web components.
