1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,510
The styling works but of course we want to be able to listen to clicks on these buttons and we want

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,120
to change our content

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,580
we show here based on the button click and for that, we need a couple of building blocks.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,560
First of all, we need different content to show. So in the render function, I'll have my main content variable

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:21,930
and

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,390
by default, that is my slot element.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,130
Now here I can simply output main content between curly braces and we will have the same output as before

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,510
but I want to have an alternate content which I might show when we switch to the contact information.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:52,370
Then main content maybe is between parentheses, so that we can write multiline JSX code, maybe is a h2

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:01:00,870
tag where I say contact information and let's wrap that all into a div

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,740
because we must have one top level element there, we could add an array but let's go for this solution now 

12
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,010
and below that, we have you can reach us via phone or email

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:26,070
and then I have an unordered list with a couple of list items where I have phone, some random number, an email and then

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:36,490
we have mail to something@something.com, something@something.com.

15
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:43,360
Now this main content is now what we display there because we always override our main content to that

16
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,700
but of course we want to do that conditionally only when we change the second tab.

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,110
By the way, I'll just quickly give this a contact information ID

18
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,200
to add some padding to it to make it look a little bit nicer,

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,420
so contact information will receive up padding of zero top and bottom

20
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,280
but 1rem left and right but that is just the styling,

21
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,150
we want to work on the logic. Now for that,

22
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,550
we need a click listener on our buttons here,

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,870
so on these two buttons, we need to be able to listen to clicks and we need a method that we can execute

24
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,070
to then do something upon such a click.

25
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:29,130
So here I'll have the onContentChange handler maybe, you can name this however you want

26
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,940
and there, we want to execute some logic that we can then use down there in the render method to, well

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,280
output or something or to display different content conditionally. Well first of all, let's hook up these

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,430
buttons with onClick listener

29
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:51,420
and for the first one, I want to target onContentChange and I want to pass an extra argument to

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,570
onContentChange. I want to have information about which content should be shown, which button was clicked,

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,460
do I want to show the contact information or the slot content?

32
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,660
So I expect to get some content there

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,050
and let's say this is a string. We're using Typescript right,

34
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,520
so it is a good convention to define the types of things when we don't define a default value

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,070
and here we got no default value,

36
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,710
so here I will be very clear about the fact that I expect a string here.

37
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,020
So when I call onContentChange there, since we don't call it with parentheses, we can pass an argument

38
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,490
like this but we have to bind this anyways

39
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,440
and the bind method takes more than one argument, where the other arguments are passed in as arguments to the

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,680
function we're calling.

41
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,560
So here I can pass in nav maybe and then I'll just copy that and add it to my second button as well

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,860
and there, I will pass in contact, like this.

43
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,850
Just restructured it,

44
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,850
these are two buttons,

45
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,420
first one onClick passes nav as an argument,

46
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,170
second one passes contact.

47
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,380
So now this function should execute and I can for now console log this to see if it works.

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:11,990
If I save that and I go back and I open my Javascript console and I reload to clear it, if I click navigation, 

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,090
you see nav here, if I click contact, you see contact.

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,630
But of course we don't change the output and

51
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,660
that is something we'll do in the next lecture.
