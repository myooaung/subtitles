00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.390
So let's start building that modal component

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.320
and for that, I have a brand new project, just an HTML file with that basic HTML5 skeleton,

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.490
no script files, nothing. There

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.070
I will now add my modal.js file where I want to create that code for that modal web component.

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.610
Now throughout this module,

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.460
always feel free to pause the video and try something on your own,

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.250
if we're working on a certain feature where you feel like, hey I can do that on my own,

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.100
definitely pause and try it on your own,

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.180
otherwise just code along and you will see many of the things we covered in the last lectures and modules

10
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.620
and this module should therefore also help with really understanding all these pieces and see how

11
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.150
they come together.

12
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.140
So in modal.js, I will start by creating a new component class with the class keyword and I will name

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.670
it modal and I will extend the HTML element, so I'll not extend an existing HTML element like

14
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.350
a div or anything like that,

15
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.700
I'll start from scratch here.

16
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.230
Now before I add any content here, any logic, I will also register this with custom elements define, I'll

17
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640
name it uc-modal,

18
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.150
that will be my tag and I point at this Modal class.

19
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.920
Now with that added, I'll go to the index.html file and there as before, add the script import

20
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.240
to the modal.js file and thereafter, we can added it here, uc-modal as our own

21
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.270
HTML tag in the body of this template.

22
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.360
And later we'll also add some logic

23
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.370
so that we have to click a button to show it and hide it.

24
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.920
But that will all come later,

25
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.680
for now let's start adding some content to this modal and I'll start with the constructor where we always

26
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.290
have to call super first and now in here,

27
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.150
I will set up this general template for this modal and for that as you learned,

28
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.260
we want to create a shadow DOM.

29
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.480
Now as you also learned, this is of course not a hard requirement,

30
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.660
we can create custom elements without the shadow DOM but the shadow DOM gives us many advantages and

31
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.970
therefore, I definitely want to use it here.

32
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:29.360
So I will call this attach shadow and set the mode to open as always and now we can use the shadow root

33
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.820
to start setting our innerHTML, so the template so to say, the HTML code of this custom component

34
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.390
that is hidden away from the light DOM.

35
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.660
Now I want to create a modal and this will actually consist of two major parts,

36
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.630
for one I will have a div with a CSS class of backdrop, could also be an ID of backdrop if you prefer

37
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.130
that

38
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.100
and this will be the part behind the modal which will gray out the rest of the page whilst the modal is

39
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.620
in the foreground. And the other part therefore is of course the modal itself and again here, I'm using a class

40
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.750
of modal,

41
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.050
actually let's use the ID because we can be that specific here

42
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.480
and selecting an ID is actually a bit faster than selecting a class,

43
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.180
so for my CSS perspective, this is a bit better.

44
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.570
And now let me also add style tags here so that we can style all the components or all the elements

45
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.670
we'll have in the modal. And I will start with some rough styling and with the rough layout and later,

46
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.400
we'll add more and more feature to that modal, like different slot areas and so on.

47
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.580
Something we haven't covered yet, we'll learn it in this module.

48
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.350
So let's start building that modal

49
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.780
and first of all here I'll select the backdrop and I'll set a style for that backdrop.

50
00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.640
Now the style for this backdrop will be that it has a position of fixed from the top of the page and

51
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.960
the way this is positioned in the index.html file directly in the body,

52
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.410
this will refer to the overall document, to the overall page as the container.

53
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.000
So from the top, I want to have a distance of 0, from the left as well and then this backdrop should

54
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.620
cover the entire page.

55
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.220
So I'll give it a width of 100% and for the height,

56
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.760
this would not work unless we also set the height of our body and the HTML tag to 100%

57
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.890
but here we can use 100vh which stands for viewport height and also is about the entire height of

58
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.620
our window basically.

59
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.300
Now I'll give it a background of RGBA and then a transparent black color,

60
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.490
maybe 75% opacity, so 25% transparency here and with that, we should have a backdrop in

61
00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.100
place. Now since we already import this and we use our tag here,

62
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.480
we should be able to reload this page and indeed, we now have a gray background and that is the modal

63
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.590
background.

64
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.080
It's not obvious here but we can confirm this if we simply inspect this in the developer tools,

65
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.070
it's this background, this div

66
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.910
here, that is responsible for that.

67
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.020
If I uncheck the background, it's gone.

68
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.130
So we see the modal background here, that's great

69
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.130
and if we had other content on this page and I will add something here,

70
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:40.030
please confirm your choice and then we have a button which maybe says show details and confirm whatever

71
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:48.590
you want, if I now reload, this is hidden behind the modal or behind the backdrop.

72
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.560
So that is working,

73
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.650
now just one tiny thing so that it's a little bit less ugly.

74
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.070
Let me again set some general styles, here

75
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.870
I'll set a box sizing of border box for all the elements and that includes my custom elements by the

76
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.500
way

77
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:12.170
and for the body, I'll set a margin of zero and I'll set a font family of sans-serif here because I simply prefer that,

78
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.060
now this looks a bit nicer.

79
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.720
I'll get rid of the margin actually,

80
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.500
let's give this a margin of 2rem instead so that we have a little bit of margin on the body,

81
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.960
yes.

82
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.410
Ok, so

83
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.710
this is the general styling,

84
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.790
the backdrop is in place now.

85
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.230
Now let's also add the modal style itself in the next lecture.
