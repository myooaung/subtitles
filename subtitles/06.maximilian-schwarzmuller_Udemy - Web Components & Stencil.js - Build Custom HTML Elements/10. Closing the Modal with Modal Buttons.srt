1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,140
So now that we covered a lot about slots,

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,050
let's finish up this modal by tweaking some of its styling again 

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,250
but most importantly and first of all, by making these buttons work. Right now, I can click cancel and okay

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,860
and nothing will happen.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:25,220
Now I want to close the modal in both cases but I want to dispatch my own events to which I can listen

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,030
from outside my component,

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,920
so from inside my main application, my main Javascript logic which runs in my main document, so that I

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,220
know whether the user has confirmed this modal or cancel it because right now, what I want to be

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:48,320
able to do in the end is that I add an event listener here to my modal object and keep in mind, my modal

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,080
object is really just my own custom component

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,740
and there it would be nice if we had like a confirm listener and confirm is not a built-in event,

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,540
so right now this will never trigger where I can do something.

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:11,030
So most of the time in my application, I would probably want to do something like create a payment request

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,940
which I sent to some backend once the user confirmed or where I also can do something if the

15
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,370
user declines this,

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,990
so if the user cancels this, then maybe I want to reset some state in my application.

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,920
Of course here, I'll not focus on the application logic,

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,910
I want to focus on the component and how we add our own events there

19
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,410
but I just want to give you some ideas of what you could do there in a real application.

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,970
So outside of your web component, we'll focus on making these custom events work here now,

21
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,600
so confirm and cancel is the go.

22
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,310
For that, let's dive into our modal again and then we have these buttons, since these buttons are part of the shadow

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,770
DOM,

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,550
we have to create listeners to these buttons inside of our shadow DOM.

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,730
So for that, I'll add another constant here in the constructor below my slots listeners

26
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,410
I added in the last lectures and there, I'll have the cancel button

27
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:19,410
and for this, I'll give this button an ID of cancel button, maybe like this confirm button

28
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,600
and now I can select by that ID, so I'll access my shadow root, use the query selector,

29
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:32,510
you could also use get element by ID of course and then select a cancel button ID here and then I'll duplicate this

30
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,450
to also select my confirm button here with the confirm button ID.

31
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,120
So now that I have access to these two buttons, I can register listeners here in my component.

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:52,690
So let's maybe start with the cancel button here and on the cancel button, I want to hide the modal

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,650
and I want to dispatch this custom cancel event to which I'm listening from outside. Therefore, I'll

34
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,380
first of all add a new method here and I'll name it hide,

35
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,670
I could turn this into a private method by adding a leading underscore and always keep in mind, it's

36
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,600
not really private,

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,500
you can still call it from outside because Javascript knows no private and public properties and methods,

38
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,640
I just add this to show, hey this should only be used from inside, if you then don't follow that rule,

39
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,030
well you can do that

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,340
but here I want to keep it as a public method because even though we're not doing it in our app, you

41
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,810
could of course definitely imagine an application where you want to hide a modal from outside,

42
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,620
so from your main application instead from inside of the component.

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,370
Now how do we hide it?

44
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,620
Well in the end, it's all about setting our open attributes to none or to remove it

45
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,170
and we do that not with set attribute but with remove attribute and there,

46
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:06,590
I want to remove my opened attribute. We can add an extra check here to see if this has the attribute

47
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,560
opened before we then try to remove it of course.

48
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:20,770
Besides that, I want to set this is open to false of course to update this property as well

49
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,120
and with that, the modal will already be closed because of that opened attribute which we use in our

50
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,020
CSS styles here.

51
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,210
So therefore we have that functionality, the custom event is missing but I'll come back to that later,

52
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,270
so for now let's continue with the event listener on the cancel button in the constructor,

53
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,660
there we want to listen to an ordinary click

54
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,740
which of course is a built-in event built into core Javascript and the browser and upon a click, I want

55
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:58,200
to trigger this hide, so this hide method. And of course I'll bind this keyword here to ensure that

56
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:06,970
this inside of hide refers to the class and not to the button which is the event trigger. Now I'll duplicate this

57
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,260
to also hook up my confirm button and there,

58
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,860
I also want to hide this modal.

59
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,480
Now we already see a problem here,

60
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,810
I definitely don't want to run the same logic two times.

61
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:26,310
So what I will do instead is I'll add a private method here which I'll name cancel and I'll add one

62
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,260
which I'll name confirm. Now

63
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:39,000
in both, I will call this open and here, we don't need to bind this because if we're calling it like this

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,310
from inside the class, the class itself is calling a method and therefore this in the called method

65
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,050
will refer to the class too.

66
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,410
So I'll also call hide here,

67
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,110
sorry

68
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,150
here it should be hide of course, not open.

69
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,970
So it should be hide in both

70
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,700
but now we can dispatch different custom events here.

71
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,330
So let's tweak that and go up and for the cancel button,

72
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:11,030
I will now actually call my private cancel method and for confirm, my private confirm method

73
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,580
and right now, they will both just call hide but that will change soon.

74
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,230
So now with that, we should already have a working modal such that when I click cancel,

75
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,720
it gets hidden and if I open it again, I can also hide it and close it with ok.

76
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,640
And you can see I can reopen it even though I have extra check here in my main app, in my index.html

77
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,920
file where I check for whether it is not open yet with the isOpen property and I can still reopen

78
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,620
it after closing it because I do update

79
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,330
this isOpen property in my modal as well.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
So this is the first important step

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,120
but the more important and more interesting step of course now is to emit our own custom event.

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,090
Let's do that next.
