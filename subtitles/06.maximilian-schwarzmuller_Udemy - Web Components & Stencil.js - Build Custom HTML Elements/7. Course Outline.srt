1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,960
So what's in this course in detail?

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,170
Well we're pretty much done getting started, in the next module,

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,790
you will get a Javascript refresher. Now important,

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,950
this is totally optional,

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:21,020
you can skip that next module if you already are up-to-date with next gen Javascript features like arrow

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,170
functions, let and const,

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,010
if you're not aware of this, you should take this refresher,

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,240
also important,

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,860
this does not start with the basics of Javascript,

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,930
it's about modern Javascript.

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,710
If you don't know what the DOM is, how you can select elements in the DOM and how Javascript works, you

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,570
definitely have to learn that first before proceeding with that course because I require that basic Javascript

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:51,010
knowledge in the course. Now after this optional refresher, we'll dive into the basics of web components

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,540
with vanilla Javascript.

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:59,470
You will learn step-by-step how you can create your own custom HTML elements, your own custom web components

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,080
therefore. After the basics,

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,120
we dive into the more advanced features. We'll build up on these basics and we will learn how to build

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,940
more exciting web components with more interesting features and then, we'll go one level further and

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:19,120
we'll build even more complex web components with even more interesting features giving us everything

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,900
we need to build a really awesome web components already.

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,220
Now after that, we'll dive into a tool that helps us with building these web components

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,650
because thus far, we'll have used vanilla Javascript only

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,410
and whilst this is all you need,

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,470
you will already see kind of limitations or like

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,360
what's hard about that and you will learn about a tool that makes creating web components easier and

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,210
that tool is called stencil.js.

27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,270
I will introduce you to it and show you the advantages of it in this introduction module and thereafter,

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,320
we'll dive into the basics and then also in advanced stencil.js.

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,530
Now after this advanced stencil.js module,

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,800
you will have everything to build amazing modern web components that run in any browser including Internet

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,010
Explorer 11.

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,170
You will be super fast about building these web components

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,670
thanks to stencil and the sky will be the limit regarding what you can build there because we'll dive

34
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,940
into all the awesome features you can combine and mix and match as needed throughout this course.

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,730
So we'll learn how to publish and share our web components thereafter, how you can publish them to npm

36
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,290
or drag and drop them into other projects

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,850
so that not just you can benefit from that but that potentially, you and all your projects, your teammates,

38
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,510
your entire organization or the whole world could use your components.
