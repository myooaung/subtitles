00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.140
So now that we learned about these different specifications and we will learn what they do and how we use

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.300
them in detail step by step, no worries,

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.860
now that we learned that though, it's also important to recognize that not all browsers support all these

4
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.990
specifications and especially older browsers like Internet Explorer 11, well support even less.

5
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.000
Now let's have a look at browser support

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.940
therefore. Now the easiest way of finding the browser support is by simply googling for web components

7
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.540
and then, you can visit webcomponents.org,

8
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.510
this page there and on this page if you scroll down, you will find this browser support table here

9
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.690
and there, you see all major browsers and how they're supporting the different web components specifications.

10
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.770
As a side note, here you also see ES modules specification,

11
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.450
that is something which I didn't mention on the slide,

12
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.920
it's not directly a part of the web components specifications set, 

13
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.130
this in the end is related to how we can import Javascript files into Javascript files and we

14
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.340
will find a solution for that later in the course too.

15
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.470
The first three rows mention the parts you saw in my slides though, the custom elements, the HTML

16
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.110
templates and the shadow DOM

17
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.440
and as you can see right now, browser support is already very decent,

18
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.710
it's getting added to Edge 2, at the point of time you're viewing the course, this might already have

19
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.310
changed

20
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490
and until then we can use a polyfill,

21
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.450
so a third party package that basically gets the browser to support this and therefore we can use what

22
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.040
you learn in this course in all major browsers. If you want to get a more detailed list of which

23
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.410
browser supports which feature, you can google for can I use and then for example custom elements and

24
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.100
you could also use shadow DOM or HTML templates there and you will then find the can I use page here.

25
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.500
There you take that custom elements we want to link

26
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.560
and on this page, you then see browser support for this feature

27
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.870
and this looks a bit worse than the prior page because there is more red on it

28
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.740
but this is the more helpful page because you will see that for example Edge hasn't implemented this yet,

29
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.840
again you can make it work with polyfills though

30
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.840
and indeed you can actually make web components work in all browsers and this is what we'll do by the

31
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.770
end of the course.

32
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.370
But you can see that for development, you should really use a modern version of Firefox or Chrome

33
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.500
and then later, you will learn how to make your web components work in more browsers.

34
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.590
So the key takeaway here is for development, I'll be using Chrome,

35
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.910
you should be using Chrome or Firefox in its latest version but towards the end of the course, we will

36
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.790
make sure that our web components run in all browsers that

37
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.740
we want to support.
