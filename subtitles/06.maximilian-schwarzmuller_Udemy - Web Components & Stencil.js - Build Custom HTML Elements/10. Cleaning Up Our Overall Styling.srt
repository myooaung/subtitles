1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:09,290
So now that we talked a lot about styling, let me make the style we have in place here a bit more pretty

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,080
now. Now for that,

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:18,350
I'll first of all, I'm going to my light DOM, add a star selector and set the global box sizing for all my border,

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,680
for all my elements to border box

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,930
and now I'm just really working on the visuals,

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,070
this is nothing else.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,230
I'll set a font family of sans-serif

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,180
so that all my fonts have the sans-serif look,

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,110
looks a bit nicer already in my opinion.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:40,990
I will also in my lights DOM, get rid of this ugly blue border around my tooltip, it was just for demonstration

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,770
purposes,

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,730
also get rid of the highlight class which we are not setting anything.

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:52,020
Let me also get rid of that div with the orange border and get rid of that orange border style up there,

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,250
I really just want to make this a bit more pretty

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,420
before we continue.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,640
Now this looks much better already

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,600
and now let me dive into my web components styles and there for example, for this overlay when I hover

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,710
over this,

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,460
I want to add some padding here and make this look a bit nicer, maybe a little drop shadow.

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,160
So for this hovering content which of course is this div here

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,290
and we could of course also use this CSS class or ID here if we wanted to,

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:30,380
there I'll give this a padding of 0.15rem, border radius maybe of 3px and a box shadow

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:41,830
of 1px 1px 6px and then this styling which is a transparent gray-ish look, if I now reload

24
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,040
and I hover over this, box shadow is missing.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,560
Yes because I forgot my colon here,

26
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,940
so let's fix this.

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,500
Yes

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,340
and this looks much nicer.

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,740
Let me also tweak the positioning, it has position absolute

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,450
but I want to move it down a little bit by setting top to

31
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:07,000
let's say 1rem and left also to 0.75rem maybe,

32
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,720
let's see how that looks like,

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,790
let's move it down by 2rem,

34
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,960
yes, maybe 1.5,

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,620
right.

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,100
I like this way more, looks better in my opinion.

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,540
Now I also don't want this text in there to be bold just because the overall component text is bold because

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,940
of host context,

39
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,470
so I will give my div here a font weight of normal.

40
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,760
So I don't use that bold font weight

41
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:52,030
I set for my other text, so now I don't have that bold styling in there anymore.

42
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,580
And now last but not least, there's one other thing. When I set this background color if I have the important

43
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,330
tag, then I also want to add a little bit of padding around my component let's say,

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,700
so that the color does not sit directly on the edges

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,430
and now this looks OK.

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,360
This is how I want it to be,

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,430
this is a style I can live with.

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:19,840
Now with that, let's move on and let's see which other cool functionalities we can add to our custom web components.
