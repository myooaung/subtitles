00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,620
We're coming to a close of this module and we learned loads of new things in this module already.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:16,040
Now I want to close this module by diving back into styling and CSS properties again. You obviously

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,190
noticed that for the spinner, the styles there, here for example we're using some colors, for the stock

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,360
finder we're using colors and the buttons and so we are for the stock price,

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,710
now these colors are all hardcoded into these components.

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,020
Now obviously, we can make these settable from outside by using CSS properties just as we did with

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,950
our own native web components which we wrote earlier in this course.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,990
For example here the stock finder for the border,

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:55,950
we can accept a CSS property, maybe named color-primary and we have our fallback value of this

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,990
purple color or maybe of just, copy that,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,370
maybe of just black and then we can use that down there too.

12
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:21,810
So here we could have our color-primary, whoops, should be color-primary and our fallback value of black then.

13
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,170
Same for the background

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,540
and of course then for the text, we also want to have let's say 

15
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,550
color-primary inverse because maybe we have a primary color where black would be the better text color, default

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,290
value is white though and so on.

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,920
And then we can go into the index.html

18
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,640
file 

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,880
or anywhere in our main app we're building, in a style.css file and we can add our styles here

20
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:09,860
and we can set the CSS properties, for example color-primary would be this purple here,

21
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:16,640
we do that directly on the HTML selector.

22
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,130
We also need color-primary inverse here which should be white in our case because white looks

23
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,520
good on this dark purple and now we can migrate the other colors, like this

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,550
background here

25
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,280
where we hover over the button, we will use color,

26
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:40,260
let's say primary highlight and normally, this would be like a grey-ish hair color, maybe

27
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,980
color-primary highlight grey but of course we can now set our own color here.

28
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,390
Color-primary highlight,

29
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,980
you can name these custom properties,

30
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:06,290
these CSS variables whatever you want and with that, you can step by step get there. Now I'll just

31
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,850
work on that background of the list item would I hover over it, there

32
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:18,080
I want to have my color-primary again and the default value of black and then down there, I'll have

33
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:30,420
my color-primary inverse and a default value of white. And now if I save that, you will see that I

34
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,900
have all my values, all the same

35
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:41,520
look for this stock finder as I had before but if I get into the head section and I remove my styles

36
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,870
where I set these CSS properties, then you see we go to black and white.

37
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,950
So this is now giving us again the possibility of adjusting the look especially the colors

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,140
but you can set anything with CSS properties, so adjusting the look of our components from outside

39
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,650
of them

40
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,830
even though we're using the shadow DOM because properties, CSS properties, CSS variables

41
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,920
as I also call them are a way of breaking through the shadow DOM because they are allowed into the shadow

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,230
DOM so to say.

43
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,010
Now I will not bore you by adjusting all the styles,

44
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,970
you can definitely do this if you want to,

45
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,670
I'll just do it here to complete this component but this is immensely useful for you to know hopefully

46
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,640
and again, feel free to adjust the other components too if you want to do this as a practice.
