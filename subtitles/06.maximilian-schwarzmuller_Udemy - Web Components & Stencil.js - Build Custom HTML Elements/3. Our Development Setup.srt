00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,190
Enough of the talking, let's dive into learning more about custom elements for now,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,820
so about the core part of web components and let's write some code.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,770
First of all, it's important to differentiate that for custom elements,

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,920
we actually got two different ways of creating them.

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,520
For one, you can create so-called autonomous elements,

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,810
these are basically your own custom elements that don't depend on anything, that are totally independent

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,930
of existing HTML elements that are built into the browser.

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:41,030
Alternatively, you can also create your own custom elements by extending built-in elements though, like

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,300
extending the built-in button or the built-in paragraph and that also can be a way of creating custom elements.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,380
In this course, we'll mostly build autonomous elements but I actually will show you both ways of creating

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:01,130
your own custom elements, your own web components and I will use the name custom element and web component

12
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,550
interchangeably here, so you can build custom HTML tags in both ways and I will show you both ways and

13
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,570
both are fine to use depending on what you're building.

14
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,470
Often you want to have your totally separate custom element though,

15
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,220
so this autonomous way is probably the more common way

16
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:28,570
but how do you build your own web components in that way then? For that, I created a new folder anywhere

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,500
on your computer, you can create it,

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,600
it's totally empty as you can tell and I'll open it or I open it with Visual Studio Code.

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:37,910
Visual Studio Code

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,620
is a free web development IDE which you can get from code.visualstudio.com. On code.visualstudio.com,

21
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,880
you'll find download links for all operating systems and you can simply walk through the installer

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:02:00,130
there and you'll have a great, powerful and free web development IDE or editor which you can, well use

23
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,570
for editing.

24
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:08,360
Theoretically you just need any editor, any text editor but an IDE like this gives you more convenient

25
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:15,360
options, auto-completion and all that fun stuff. You can learn more about it by reading the official docs

26
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,050
and of course you can use any web development editor you want to use or any IDE you want to use.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,010
Now in here, I did one important thing,

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:32,710
if you hit control shift P or on Mac, command shift P, you'll open this command menu here and here if

29
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,460
you type theme, then you'll find these preferences color themes option

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,970
and there, I switched to dark plus which is the theme which gives me this dark look, you can of course

31
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,200
also use other themes here.

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,360
And I did one other thing,

33
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:55,590
if you go into the extensions part by clicking on view extensions here, there if you search for material

34
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,750
icon, you'll find that material icon theme which I also installed, this is totally optional,

35
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,620
it just changes some of my file icons

36
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,010
once we start adding files to the project.

37
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,900
So if you want to get that same file icon look I have,

38
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,710
you have to install and enable that material icon theme. Thereafter you can go back to your explorer view

39
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,290
here.

40
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,070
OK.

41
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,070
So this is now the view in which we'll work

42
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,410
and there, I will add two files.

43
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,970
The first one is an index.html

44
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,910
file,

45
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,630
theoretically you can name it anything you want and this will be the dummy page we use for hosting

46
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,090
and running our own custom elements.

47
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,540
There I'll just type HTML

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,700
and now in Visual Studio Code, I get this auto-completion where I can pick that HTML5 template and

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,180
if I now hit enter, I get a basic HTML5 skeleton here out of the box.

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,610
I'll give it a title of web components

51
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,250
and now here in the body, we can start playing around with our own web components.

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,570
The code for the web components will be written in a different file and here, I will add a tooltip.js

53
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,780
file because I want to start by writing a tooltip component.

54
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,710
So this is now the file where I will write the code, the Javascript code to create my own custom element

55
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,400
and therefore, I will add one more thing here, in the index.html

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,570
file,

57
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:24,330
I'll add a script tag in the head section where I simply import that tooltip.js file and

58
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,030
thereafter, this will automatically run any code we add in that tooltip file and we will add some code

59
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,640
here to define our own custom element and that is exactly what we do in the next lecture.
