1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,840
So with the backdrop added, let's work on modal, so #modal selects the element with the ID modal

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,200
and just to reiterate on that because we're in the shadow DOM, this only affects elements with the ID

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,970
modal that are inside of our template here,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,630
so basically only,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,060
well this element here.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,690
And for the modal, I want to have that in the foreground, so I'll actually give my backdrop a set index of let's

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,780
say 10 and the modal will have a set index of 100 because it should have a higher set index

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,080
so that the backdrop is in the background of the modal.

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,950
I'll also give it a position of fixed to position it in a fixed way, in our viewport, in our document.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,290
From the top let's say we have a distance of 15vh,

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,950
.

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:04,950
and from the left, we have a distance of let's say 25% and then we have a width of 50%

13
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,920
because we have 25 distance from the left, then a width a 50%

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,990
and then also 25% from the right which is the leftover space,

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,630
therefore this should be nicely centered. And you can set different styles, optimize this for mobile,

16
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,220
I'm not caring so much about the styling here,

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,750
I just want to focus on the general functionality and not write a ton of styles.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,430
You could add media queries in here, whatever you need for the right styling.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,500
I'll go with this styling and I'll give it a background of white and to ensure that we can see something

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,810
for now,

21
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:44,160
I'll give it a height of let's say 30rem and we might be able to get rid of this later once we have

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,350
some content in there.

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:54,500
I also want to have a border radius of let's say 3px and I'll give it a box shadow of 02px

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,670
8px and then let's say this style here, some transparent box shadow, drop shadow

25
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,880
and with all of that in place, let's head over and reload this page

26
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,180
and here is our modal

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,670
and obviously, this is missing all the content but we're getting there.

28
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,080
Now we have the modal container, we have the backdrop behind it,

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,210
now we want to populate that modal with some content of course and I want to have some static content

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,740
in there and

31
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,800
I also want to have some slot content in there, so let's add that next.
