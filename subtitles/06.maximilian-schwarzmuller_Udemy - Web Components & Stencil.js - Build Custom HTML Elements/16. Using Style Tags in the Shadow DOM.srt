1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,010
Now with our own template being defined here, we can now also define some styles here

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,930
and by the way this would have been possible with the template in the

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:20,600
HTML file too because in here, we can now of course also add style tags as we can do in any Javascript file,

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,870
as we can do in normal HTML too and the styles here and that is the interesting thing, since we do that

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:35,880
on innerHTML of the shadow root, the styles here will only apply to the HTML code in our template.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:46,050
So to this span here or to the div we add dynamically and this means that we can now add all these

7
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,190
styles down there in our style tag here.

8
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,690
So I add a div selector 

9
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,040
and now I want to set the background color with normal CSS because this is now normal CSS

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,960
within a string.

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,690
So the background color is black

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:07,360
let's say, the color, so the text color is white.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,070
The position is absolute, the set index is 10

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:25,330
and now I can go down there and remove all these manual style assignments and still if we save that

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,230
and we reload, we have the same styling as before but now we can write all styles conveniently as you

16
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:41,140
are used to in HTML or in CSS syntax and it is scoped to this component only.

17
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,490
Please note that I'm using a general div selector

18
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,700
and yet if I go to index.html and I would add a div here,

19
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:57,320
this does not get the web component styles because of the shadow DOM. So if I now reload,

20
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,860
you see the orange border which makes sense because we set this up here

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,170
but you don't see the black background,

22
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,360
this does also not have the absolute position because we really have scoped styles

23
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:20,750
thanks to the shadow DOM and our styles being set up as the innerHTML of that shadow DOM for our

24
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:27,640
custom web component. And this gives you a lot of flexibility regarding how you style your components,

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,900
regarding the template you set up for them, regarding the elements you add to them and all of them is

26
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,480
part of your custom element and does not spill over to your normal DOM.
