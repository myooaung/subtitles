00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.460
Before we dive into anything new, let me come back to the project or the examples we worked on and there

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.420
specifically,

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.470
I want to have a look at our tooltip again.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.530
Now keep in mind, this here is an example for our tooltip,

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.670
here, this web components thing

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.960
and of course here in the developer tools, the Google Chrome developer tools and the elements tab,

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.660
we can see our own custom element here,

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.540
we see the text attribute, we see the style we assign directly to it and that is also something we'll

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.270
change a little bit the way we do that and we see our shadow root here and conveniently, the Chrome

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.790
dev tools also highlights all the shadow DOM with this light gray background.

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.930
Now one interesting thing to see here and I am not sure if you noticed that before is the fact that

12
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.600
web components, so this part which actually gets pulled into this slot,

13
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.910
right

14
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.470
because web components occurs before our question mark,

15
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.100
so technically it gets pulled into that slot, even though it gets pulled in there,

16
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.700
we see it's not part of the shadow DOM, right. Web components here in the DOM tree is part of the light

17
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.210
DOM,

18
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.350
it's a sibling of the shadow root and that is something crucial I want you to understand. With slots,

19
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.750
you can project content into your shadow DOM,

20
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.870
so you got an entry point into your shadow DOM from the light DOM so to say but you don't technically

21
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.530
move the element into the shadow DOM, the browser

22
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.300
just displays it as if it were part of it but actually, it's rendered differently in the DOM and you

23
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.430
can see that here, by the fact or you can tell by the fact that we still have our slot element here,

24
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.750
you see our default which is not actually getting rendered because we passed our own text here and we

25
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.440
see that it points at some other content, in this case it points at some text and if you click on reveal here

26
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.150
by the way, you also jump to the content that gets displayed in that place.

27
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.660
But technically it's not moved in there,

28
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.590
the DOM node is not moved into the shadow DOM and that is one crucial thing I want you to understand

29
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.440
and I want you to be aware of because that really is important to get it right and to be aware of.
