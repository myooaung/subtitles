00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,550
So let's add a little bit of styling here,

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:12,930
I will actually grab the styling of my form related parts from the other component and yes, you could

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,270
certainly reuse that in some shared component, we'll dive into the shared components later,

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,750
for now let's copy that

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,690
and on the finder itself, I will copy that host selector and also use that here

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,520
and use that exact same styling here.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,570
So I actually have two totally equal styles here,  

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,060
if I reload, you can see it here and that is ok for me here

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,420
and as I just mentioned, you could of course also like build a wrapper component with the shared styles and

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,750
only change the logic.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,790
You could certainly merge a lot of functionalities and styles together here, 

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,190
here I have a separation on purpose and I will show you how to embed components into components at

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,700
a later point of time.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,850
So now we have a more beautiful styling, that is the most important thing,

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,140
that was not too much work I guess.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,400
And with that, let's move on and let's actually add logic to output the results below this input and

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,840
the button.
