00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,460
So in this module,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,740
I did a lot of talking, right?

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,070
I did a lot of talking about stencil and how we install it and what it does for us.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,930
Now I really want to sum up the advantages again.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,620
We use stencil because even though this syntax might look very strange to you right now, it actually

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,470
gives us a very nice way of creating components as you will learn over the next modules,

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,190
it might look strange at the beginning but it will make a lot of sense at the end.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,110
This code here for sure

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,380
also would have looked strange if I would have shown it to you all at once

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,910
right at the start of the course.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,350
So this will actually become pretty clear and pretty easy to understand

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,650
and then we get a highly optimized and fast web component, a native web component so we don't ship this

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:46,980
code,

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,320
we ship code that will in the end just look like this code, just in a bit more condensed and optimized

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,430
version and we'll have a tiny bit of extra code being shipped which will look for the browser that

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,470
is getting used by the user and that will automatically load any polyfills we might need to make our

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,740
web component work in older browsers too,

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,940
so we got this out of the box working functionality built in.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,770
So we got an easier way of building web components because this syntax here will turn out to be much easier

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:24,030
to understand than having large components built like this and we'll get components that work in all

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,780
browsers with zero extra content from our side and these are two awesome reasons to use stencil.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,010
Now with that, let's dive into stencil and its syntax and what all these strange @ things here mean in

23
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,880
the next modules.
