00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.160
Now that we have a rough idea of what web components are and you will hear me use the term web components

2
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.340
and custom elements interchangeably in this course by the way,

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.410
now that we know that, the question is why would we use web components?

4
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.380
Well, one great advantage is that a web component like this modal component you saw allows us to encapsulate

5
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.210
logic and a user interface in one custom HTML tag which we then, anther advantage, can also reuse

6
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.760
across our page or even reuse across multiple projects.

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.470
We can just take that Javascript file and drop it into any other project, just as you did it with my

8
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.600
modal.js file.

9
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.940
So encapsulated logic and encapsulated user interface is of course great because its easier to understand,

10
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.570
we have connected code in one element and another element cares about something totally different,

11
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.080
so we have separated code which is always great,

12
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.080
it's therefore also easy to maintain and we have a separation of concerns. Every element takes care about

13
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.650
one task, the modal takes care about displaying itself and showing some content in this pop-up window

14
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.410
style,

15
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.010
it does not care about side drawer or sending HTTP requests or anything like that.

16
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.450
The reusability across the page means that we only have to write a certain logic once and then

17
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.140
we can use it multiple times, that modal might be something we show when user orders an item but also

18
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.140
when the user login fails. So we can write this logic one and then just pass different dynamic content

19
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.470
into it, in the different parts of our page where we use it,

20
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.900
so we don't have to worry about overlapping logic and we also don't have to write logic in the user interface

21
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.680
more than once which is great. And the same advantages are true when we share our component across multiple

22
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.680
projects,

23
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.150
we still use it like a normal HTML element,

24
00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.200
we don't have to worry about setting up a complex development environment there or using a special framework,

25
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.670
we can even have projects written in different frameworks,

26
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.980
let's say in Angular and in React and we can use one and the same web component in both,

27
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.610
so that is a great advantage

28
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.520
we wouldn't be able to share React components with Angular project for example.

29
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.080
We also of course can reuse core UI elements across multiple projects,

30
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.500
so you could create a set of core UI elements that have your corporate identity baked in, like a toolbar,

31
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.000
the modal, the side drawer which you use in all your projects then, so that can be really helpful and

32
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.800
save you a lot of time

33
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.680
and we again also don't have to repeat ourselves when it comes to writing all the logic and the user

34
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.720
interface. And we can not only share our components by dragging and dropping files into other projects,

35
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.040
we can also publish our components or a set of components even to npm and then install it into any project

36
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.560
we want to use it with npm install

37
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.130
and actually, I will show you exactly that towards the end of the course.
