00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.885
Hello folks.

00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:04.875
In this section we are going to see how to prepare Marvin in weldment on Windows.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.340
We have already seen what topics do we cover over here.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.250
But to let see, why do we need each of these topic.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.350
First, we are going to install Java.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.970
Then install Eclipse.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.915
Eclipse is one of the widely used id tool for Java.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.900
That's the reason we are using Eclipse so that we can

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.735
feel how the developers can create the Magen projects.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.250
Then by using Eclipse,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.650
we are going to create our first Maven project.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.080
Don't worry, we don't require any coding skills.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.060
There are some pre-defined templates,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.885
those we are going to use it then mapping coordinates while building our Maven project,

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:40.654
it asks for some coordinates.

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:43.610
We are trying to understand what are those coordinates.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.980
Then default directory structure.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.320
Whenever we create a Maven project,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.670
how does it looks like?

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.790
Then steps involved in the building your Java project.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.290
Like how do we compile,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.470
test to build and deploy to build our project?

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.225
We should know about Marvin goals.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.805
Here we are going to talk about Marvin goals.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:05.540
At last, we are going to build our first Maven project.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.675
These are the concepts we are going to cover in this section.

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:12.480
So let's jump into next lecture to install Java.
