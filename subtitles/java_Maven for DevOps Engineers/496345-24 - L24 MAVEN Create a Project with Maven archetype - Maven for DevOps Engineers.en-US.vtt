00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
In this lecture, we are going to see how can we create

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.820
a project to by using Linux command line.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.555
If you remember, we helped create it over foster project plan Eclipse.

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.030
By going to the marvin archetype.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.195
I will just show you quickly what we have done earlier.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:21.930
It was just File New and we went to others and such for Maven project next,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.570
and we have user default location and click

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.215
Next here we can see all the architects which are available.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.990
Similar way, even we can get this Architects in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.245
our Linux system and we can choose among OTs.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:35.655
And once you have chosen,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:40.210
of course we have selected window next time given the group ID artifact.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.480
And what can I do it?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.850
Same thing, we can do it in our Linux system

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.565
as well to create a new project by using archetype.

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:51.770
So far we have used a HelloWorld simple Java application which degenerates dot-dot-dot.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.335
But here we are going to use the web app.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:58.265
So for that, you can just search for mom and baby up archetype.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:01.340
It would list out the links where we can able to get it.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.760
But I'm going with the first link where we have the instructions,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.515
how we can able to do that one.

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:09.260
You can see here, Marvin archetype is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.950
the archetype which degenerates here sample Marvin web project.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.410
So we are going to generate a sample Marvin will

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.870
project and this is the directory structure.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.075
It is going to create palm dot xml.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:21.545
And in the assert C,

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:23.720
we will have here index.js bit.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.895
This is the actual application and location.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:27.050
How can we get it?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.525
That is Ambien archetype degenerate.

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:31.040
So it is saying that okay,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.470
we are generating from the architect and what is

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.860
the architect we are using whenever we want to use any archetype,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.470
of course, it should contains their group ID,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.020
artifact ID, and version ID, right?

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.655
So this information is needed.

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:47.255
That is the information we are providing in this command to create it.

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:50.075
So archetype we are using that is group IDs,

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.790
RPQ dot apache dot Marvin archetypes.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.575
And the artifact ideas may have an archetype web app and Watson is one doc for.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:01.280
So this is the command we can execute it to create a new project.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.265
But another way to check out all the artifacts is

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:07.445
just executing this maverick architect generate.

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:11.525
It is going to list out all the architects how it is displaying over here.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:12.710
If I go back here,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.510
it is displaying all the archetypes,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.460
read similar where it is going to display it.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.140
So let me execute that one.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.975
I came back to my mountains are worth PWD.

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:21.935
I'm under root.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:24.530
So for we help foster demo project is there.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.890
So now I'm going to exert maverick architect degenerate.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.910
It is going to display the list of the architects which are available

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.025
will wait for a year when Albert,

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:41.870
now you can see total we have 2899 archetypes are available.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.685
We can choose any of these.

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:47.180
And by default it's selected 175 to,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.560
but we needed a web app.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.230
I don't know whether it is a web application, R-naught.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.460
If that is the case,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.485
you can just come out from this.

00:02:54.485 --> 00:02:58.475
I'm just giving Control-C came out from the command.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:03.350
Again, if I execute the same command with the grip web app, okay,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.179
you displace all the architects,

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:07.550
which contains the word web app, again,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.475
with a web app, but there are a lot of archetypes are there.

00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:13.190
So rather than this one, what I can do,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.900
let me do the Control C,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.500
and I'm going to do the full name of our archetype.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.705
So this is the archetype ID, right?

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:22.775
Marvin archetype web app.

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:26.085
So let me copy this one and executed.

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:28.045
Now it is going to display it,

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:30.415
which matches to this pattern.

00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:33.490
Okay? Now you can see we have got limited outputs.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.095
That is 1757 is Marvin archetype,

00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:42.070
which is developed by the ORG dot apache Maven archetypes.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.305
So this is the one which we need to choose,

00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:46.885
okay, number is 17, 57.

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:48.700
Okay, so let's go back.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.765
Control C.

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:54.085
Again, I'm going to execute Marin archetype and that this term,

00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:55.165
once it is displayed,

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:56.890
I'm going to choose this number.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.175
Other way is just to directly executing this command.

00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:02.455
But anyway, instead of executing this command,

00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:04.765
I'm going with the manual width.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:08.415
Let's go and see what information it asks.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:12.620
Okay, So it is 17576.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.300
Good. Now you can see it is asking for the ocean because we have selected the archetype,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.950
okay, whenever we select archetype,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.265
it selects the group ID as well as the archetype ID.

00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:26.180
Now, we need to select the version that is lead us towards finish seven.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.105
Let it be the default URL so you can just type seven.

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:33.440
It takes the archetype now default value for the property.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.005
Now it's time to provide our own group ID.

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:40.100
So we helped given com dot to demo company read and archetype.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.295
I am going to use second demo project.

00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:43.850
Okay?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.460
Now snapshot let it be the default snapshot and package them. Yes, it will.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.275
Comes as a company name colon,

00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:53.570
artifact ID, let it be the PEC, isn't it?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.350
That's it.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.880
And we would like to create,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.995
you can see it is just to displaying,

00:04:57.995 --> 00:04:59.615
to review your information.

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:03.200
We are given the com dot to demo company artifact,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.210
secondary demo project Washtenaw ID its own so package name is calm dot-dot-dot company.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.075
So just to us to create this project.

00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:14.135
Now you can see it has been successfully imported.

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:15.605
And if I check a list,

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:19.610
now you can see one more project called secondary demo project.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.460
Okay, this is how we can able to create

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.650
a sample web application by using the archetype Anya Linux system through command line.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.400
And one more thing is we can able to get it from this command line as well.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.745
Let me try with this one and we'll see what does it do.

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:37.595
There is no option to view the project name,

00:05:37.595 --> 00:05:38.765
but let it be,

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:42.140
we'll try there are we inserted the project and we'll see what is

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.620
the folder it is going to create it or project name it is going to create it.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.210
It is asking for the group ID,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.380
artifact ID and so on.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.120
So if we do according to that,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.260
it is going to create it.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.195
But anyway, I don't want to create it.

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:58.430
So let me do the Control-C clear off the screen unless there's some for this lecture,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.880
the next lecture we are going to see what is the content on this project.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.350
Thanks for watching. See you there.
