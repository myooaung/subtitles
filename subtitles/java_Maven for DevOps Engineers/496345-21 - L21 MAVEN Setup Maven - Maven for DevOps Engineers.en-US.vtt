00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.295
Hello folks, welcome back.

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:06.180
In this lecture we are going to see how to set up never been so far.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.625
We have created an EC2 instance on AWS Cloud and installed the Java.

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.710
Yeah, as I mentioned in the previous lecture,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.685
we are going to download our map and packages from this location.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:21.000
So just right-click and copy the link address.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.590
Go back to our Marvin.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.500
And currently I'm under root directory.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.975
I'm going to under slash OPT,

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:31.980
Optional directory where we can configure these kind of packages.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.140
Now to download these packages,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.445
we need to use a command called a W.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:37.280
Okay?

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.090
If you are not familiar much about the Linux commands,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.690
I have done here dedicated course on Linux for Cloud and Azure.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.210
Devops in is maybe you can have your look.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.235
So w, What is the command?

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:55.100
And we just copying the link which we held corporate under downloaded you to take say,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.560
Well, yes, we have downloaded and you can see this is the package we just downloaded.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.090
Once we download it,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.995
we need to extract it for that tab minus x v.

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:12.365
This is the command we should use and file name which we downloaded.

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:13.925
It has been extracted.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:20.225
And if I go here and go insert to Apache my win 363.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.070
Okay, these are the files.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760
Now how we helped set up the home path for our Jenkins,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.090
similar way we need to set up path for Mavien as well.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.180
So for that, I'm just copying the path of our Marvin.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.840
Even we can rename this directory if you need some easing him.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.285
Now, we need to set up our map in-home path.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:41.750
For that, we need to edit our bash underscored profile again.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.875
So Tilda slash dot bash underscored profile.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:50.750
Okay, So this is the file and where we have updated our Java Home similar way.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.285
I'm going to update Marvin.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:55.985
Marvin, we need to use Yum to underscore home.

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:57.935
Okay, this is the command we should use.

00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:04.610
Yum to underscore home under the path of the apache Maven where we have extracted.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.150
And also we have one more command that is y2 easy cold slash OPT Marvin slash bin.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.725
We need to do till been.

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:13.535
That's it.

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:14.960
Once this is done, again,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.795
we need to add these two to our path.

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:20.525
So dollar young T2,

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:24.425
colon, dollar underscore home.

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:26.180
Okay, So that's it.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.655
Now, I'm going to save this file.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:32.045
And again, if I execute a code dollar path,

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:34.580
okay, it is not reflected yet.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.160
If I do source under the filename where we have updated our path variables.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.070
And if I do again a code path,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.250
this time, we could able to see the map and path as well.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.575
Okay, this is how we are going to update it.

00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:53.360
But to Java path it has been updated twice because we have done the source twice.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.990
Anyway, if you log off under login again, it disappears.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.760
So to validate whether we have set up our Marvin path correctly or not,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.190
we need to use a command called a young Vm,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.100
Vm minus minus version.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.545
This is the commander to checkout version.

00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:11.210
Is there any typo?

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.510
Minus-minus Watson? Yes.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.380
You can see now our MAB in-home parties slash work,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.545
PT Apache Maven, and it is using the Java version.

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.465
This is how we can set up the Marvin.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.345
In next lecture, we are going to see we can build

00:03:26.345 --> 00:03:30.830
our code in the Linux operating system by using the commands.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.810
Thanks for watching and see you there.
