00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.980
Hello folks.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.095
So far we have seen that as a dollar per we help push the code onto the good and the,

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.620
from the map when we pulled this code and we help build it while

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.690
building you to gather their dependencies or

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.120
it pulled up dependencies onto mapping system,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.725
build it, it runs the unit test cases and even deploy it into the Tomcat server.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.635
But usually we don't to do all the steps in the Maven,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:26.715
we are going to use a continuous integration tool called a Jenkins,

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.320
which can initiate the map.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.415
And rather than we'd go into Marvin and doing all the steps manually.

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:35.640
So in this section we are going to see how does it work.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.960
For that one, of course,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.340
we need your Jenkins, our work.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.190
I will show you how to set up the Jenkins or work in the next video.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.940
Thanks for watching and see you there.
