00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
Hello folks.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:05.520
In this lecture we are going to see how to install Jenkins for this one,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.650
I have already created your documentation.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.130
Quickly go through with the data documentation and set up the Jenkins.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.500
This is Jenkins installation documentation.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.655
We need to create an EC2 instance and it should contains the Java,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:18.990
Java one dot it.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.560
Of course we have done the same thing for our Marvin server as well-read.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.300
Once this is done, we need to set up

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.795
the Java home path because Jenkins requests the Java.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.345
Once this is done, we need to install Jenkins.

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.940
Okay, So these are the steps where we are going

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.745
to add additional repo and install Jenkins.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.530
Next thing we need to start the Jenkins,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.350
which means that we can able to access it from the browser,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.130
to access it from the browser,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.110
like Tomcat, public IP colon 800, 80.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.870
Once this is done, we need to do some configuration settings.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.710
We need to do any way we are going to do this one on the console itself.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.470
If you get any dough to during the setup of Jenkins,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.240
maybe you can follow this document.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.015
I tried to update this document frequently.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:03.065
Let's go and create an EC2 instance to install Jenkins.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:05.570
So I'm going to launch instance,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.265
same thing, Amazon, Linux.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:09.560
How we have done our Marvin's at what?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.275
Same thing we are doing T2 micro instance,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.615
nothing to change, nothing to change.

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:16.400
And the here add a tag.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.440
So step, step file name,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.790
I'm going to give it as

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.950
a Jenkins server because I have already one server with the same name,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.240
maybe it get conflict.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.500
So I will do Jenkins instance next.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.895
And the security group,

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:35.075
I'm going to use this security group which is already there,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:36.815
Arles, let me create it.

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:38.465
To our confusion.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.765
Jenkins. Jenkins, Marvin, ESG.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.030
And we need to add port number 800,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.540
80 because Jenkins run some port number 8, 000.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.340
That's the reason choose the custom TCP rule and edge 0, 0.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.160
And here I'm opening for the Internet,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.690
but it is not recommended.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.480
Maybe you can open for you or won't network.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.260
So if you want to know what is your own network is just to go to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.745
browser and search for what is my IP.com.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:09.965
It will give you what public IP address,

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:11.690
which means that you were internet IP,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.555
that IP range you can add if you want to avoid the security violations.

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:19.370
But in this case anyway, it is elaborate.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.770
And again, I'm going to delete it once the lab is done.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.755
That's the reason I'm opening for the Internet.

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:26.420
Next, launch it.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.455
So while launching, I'm going to choose the existing key pair which we have created.

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:34.040
That is Marvin key up knowledge that I have these key pair.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.740
Just Lunch it okay to take say, Well,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.270
let's wait for your well,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.705
and I'm filtering it with the running instances.

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:45.455
Instance state, okay, In Stan,

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:50.045
State is running, so it will show up only running instances.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.595
Once our Jenkins server is up and running.

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:55.880
I think it's up and running and oh, okay.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.010
Whenever we get public API,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.365
which means that we can able to login to a system,

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:02.945
take this public API, and go back.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.270
I have already logged into my Marvin server.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.570
This is Marvin and this is Tomcat. I don't think so.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.330
We need Tomcat X's Let's exit.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.620
I'm closing it and let's connect to our Jenkins server now.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.865
And we have the key pay rate.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:26.155
That is, okay, Here we have here Marvin key and the EC2 minus user is the username.

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:29.274
And okay, to launch the instance,

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:31.915
now we have logged into our Jenkins or work.

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.820
And for better understanding,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.750
let me switch to route and host name Jenkins and

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.655
giving and the sudo SU minus so that it will be converted. It adds a Jenkins.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:46.075
So it's easy for us to identify where we are working.

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:48.580
As a first step, we need to install Java.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.140
So yum, install Java minus one dot, dot star.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.865
Okay, we are installing Java.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:56.900
Yes, to install.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.700
Ok, Java installation is successful.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.785
Next we need to download Jenkins.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.395
If you do a yum install Jenkins,

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.875
okay, those packages are not available by default.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.480
In the default repo.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.075
That's the reason we need to add our additional Grupo.

00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:16.580
That information is already available over here.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.445
If you click on this link and this is the procedure to add it to our system.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:26.090
So just to executing these commands blindly,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.300
and we are adding key.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.870
Now if we try to install Jenkins,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.930
which should work, yes, I've gone to install.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.470
It.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.180
Seems it may take awhile.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.945
Okay. Jenkins installation is completed.

00:04:43.945 --> 00:04:48.340
If I took for service Jenkins status, it's not running.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.700
Service. Jenkins start again.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.815
If I check for status, it is running.

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:56.695
Now I can access this application from the browser.

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.795
So here we have the public IP address,

00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:00.415
copy these public API.

00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:04.090
And once this is done, go to browser.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.355
Control weak colon.

00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:12.025
It makes sure that you have open the port number 800 in the security group level.

00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:13.735
Otherwise, it doesn't follow.

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:18.265
And you can get the password from this path in our Jenkins server.

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:20.065
Let me take the password.

00:05:20.065 --> 00:05:22.540
So you will get the password in this location.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.490
I have taken this.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.060
Now go and install.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.255
Suggested plug-ins are selective plug-ins to install.

00:05:31.255 --> 00:05:31.750
Okay.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.540
Otherwise you can just close this if you don't want to do.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.345
So. I'm just installing the suggested plug-ins.

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:41.140
By default, we need a few plugins if we use this one it installed.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.090
So most of the commonly used plug-ins make sure that it installs git,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.400
then SSH build agent, then Marvin.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.150
So I couldn't able to find a map in any way.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.485
We are going to install it,

00:05:56.485 --> 00:05:59.660
even the ones the installation is completed.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.780
Okay.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.905
Lot of time because I have user first-time to install the default plugins and username,

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:17.945
I'm going to give it as it Jenkins password also Jenkins One 23.

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.925
I have given okay.

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:27.275
Fullname. Jenkins. Jenkins at gmail.com.

00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:27.650
Okay.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.280
Something I'm giving and save and continue.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.735
And this is the URL,

00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:36.995
let it be and finish it and start using Jenkins.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:40.490
Alright, so this is how we can set up our Jenkins server.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.340
In next video, we are going to add our map

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.459
and build server as this Lao-Tzu, this Jenkins.

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:49.380
Thanks for watching and see you there.
