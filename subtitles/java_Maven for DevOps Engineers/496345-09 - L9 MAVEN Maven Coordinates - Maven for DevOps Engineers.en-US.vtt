00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.710
We are still in the process of creating our foster Maven project.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.175
Here it is asking for some information that these group ID,

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.910
artifact ID Watson unpack this information,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.115
we call it as a Maven Coordinates.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:18.480
Let's see what Mab and coordinates and how to use these information are,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.684
how to provide this information.

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:23.459
I just searched for Marvin coordinates.

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:26.159
The first link is talking about palm references.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.115
Still we haven't to discuss the boat palm dot XML file,

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:34.485
but let's go and see what mapping coordinates information is provided over here.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.885
And if you see Maven Coordinates,

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:39.055
and if I click over here,

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:41.735
Just ignore about the pump for now,

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:44.930
but we can see what they're talking about.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.780
Group od helps us to different set E We're project from the other projects.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.940
Okay, that is, this is generally unique among us to an organization Aria project.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.885
It will be default.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:01.400
Usually group ID is provided the company you are L in the reverse format.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.195
So here you can see here ahrq dot apache dot Marvin,

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:08.735
which means that the reverse of the URL up this one, okay,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.375
that is how usually we do the group AD,

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:15.245
but it is not mandatory that we should provide our group ID like this.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:18.920
It can be without the URL up the company still,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.450
that can be possible.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.895
Next one is artifact ID artefact to Eddie is like your name off your package.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:29.435
Once we have generated the artifact out of our code,

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:31.220
then what is the name we should do?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.705
That is artifact.

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.900
Artifact ID should be unique in our project, okay,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.225
you should not use the same artifact ID,

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:40.610
but group ID can be same in

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.970
the all the projects which are dollar per by the same organization.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.435
Next version, whenever we are updating our code,

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:49.340
keep on changing the Watson's read.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.275
Whenever we released the new features,

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:53.930
then we are going to use the latest version.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.545
So that is how the group ID artifact ID and version works.

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:02.480
Packaging is, so packaging nothing but it is usually structured like group id,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.155
colon, artifact ID and Watson it by default it takes like that.

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:08.195
So that is how we can defend.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:11.450
So even if we go back to our Eclipse here,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.165
we need to provide our company name in the reverse format.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:17.195
I mean to say company website in the reverse format,

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:20.390
I'm creating my company website in a nice demo company.com.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.780
That's the reason I help given this in the reverse format, that is,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.915
conduct a demo company next to artifact ID,

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:29.240
I'm going to do the demo project,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.820
okay, we can name it as a anything Arles.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.330
First demo project.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.680
Okay?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.950
So this should be unique in case if

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.745
somebody is already user demo company and if they are using this name,

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:45.320
I cannot able to create it.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.660
So it should be Nick that the reason I'm

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.765
using foster demo project next to the US version,

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:54.845
usually what you can see without snapshot, okay,

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:57.785
but if we are using Snapchat means it is not

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:01.519
tested completely or it is not production ready application.

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.025
So that is the indication it is going to do.

00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:05.660
If we add the Snapchat,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.565
if you don't need it, you can delete it.

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:10.640
So you can able to use without snapshot,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.040
which means that it is like your production ready.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.780
But in our case, I'm not diluting.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.570
Let it be the snapshot Watson.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.020
Now if you see the package name by default, it to take in as it.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.255
Dot to demo company dot cost to demo.

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:26.765
And we can do the version as well at the end of this project,

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:30.305
but let it be the group ID and artifact ID for now.

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:34.460
So this is how we can provide the Maven Coordinates information.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.545
And before moving to the next step,

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:40.925
I'm going to show you some of the companies or organizations how they are using.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:43.910
I just searched for Mab and repo for Spring Boot.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.600
And if you see math and repositories and effect, click on this.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.530
And here. These are the packages are applications which are

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.945
dollar probate Spring Boot organization and that they help given for these applications.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.845
They help given your group ID called Spring framework a boat.

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:04.820
And if I take any application are packaged in this one,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.055
they will have the group ideas in common.

00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:10.910
Now let's go, go with the Spring Boot starter test.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.960
I'm just going inset this particular application or package having

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.340
the multiple versions because they will be Coupon introducing the new features.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.005
So let's go with the latest torsion which released on February 2021.

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:25.670
And if I click on this one,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.160
you can see here there is a code.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.900
You can see Marvin tab.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.440
And there is a code how you can use this particular package,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.374
our application in your application.

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:37.025
So we need to take the group ID,

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:40.280
artifact ID and version by using this information we can

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.090
call these packages are applications in our project.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.675
Okay?

00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:46.340
And if you observe the group ID,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.960
you can see here that is ORG dot Spring Framework dot boot.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.500
Okay?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.710
This could be the URL of the company they have given in

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.790
the reverse format and artifact I did there how named it?

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.375
Isaiah Spring Boot starter test. Okay.

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:04.865
Same artifact ID they have given under Watson.

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:06.650
This is the version, okay,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.810
that is how they are going to provide and that

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.690
this group either could be common for other packages as well.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.275
There is no change, but to the artifact ID keep on changing.

00:05:15.275 --> 00:05:21.800
Now if I go with to the another package and the here spring boot configuration processor,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.650
our Spring Boot auto configure.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.045
And here also there is a version called the 2.5th No.3.

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:33.260
And here also group ID is same and washing ID there,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.510
how to lose the altogether they could be.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.285
And artifact ID has been changed.

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:40.565
So if we wish to use this one,

00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:42.364
we need to use this information.

00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:46.760
We are going to talk about this code whenever we are discussing about palm dot xml.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.260
Now go back over here.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.835
That is how we help provided,

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:53.135
even if I go back and wealth selecting other,

00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:56.060
other application are other artifacts in my application.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.335
You can see here, this is the arc dot apache dot Marvin dot architecture.

00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:03.935
This is the group ID they have given artifact ID and Washington.

00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:05.900
So with this information,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.690
I could able to select it because it is the eclipse,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.890
it automatically propagate if you are using Linux, are you,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.555
if you want to update on your own,

00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:17.675
you should provide this information manually, okay,

00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:21.170
that we are going to talk about in the later sessions for now,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.825
anyway, we have selected this one, go to the next.

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:26.420
We help provided our mapping coordinates,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.030
R, group ID, artifact ID, and Washington.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.565
And let's finish to create the project.

00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:35.435
This is how we can create your map and project on eclipse.

00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:37.865
Are they a dollar per can create your project?

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:39.125
That's all for this lecture.

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:41.750
In next lecture we are going to see that directory structure,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.635
how it get created whenever we create a project by default.

00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:48.330
Thanks for watching and see you there.
