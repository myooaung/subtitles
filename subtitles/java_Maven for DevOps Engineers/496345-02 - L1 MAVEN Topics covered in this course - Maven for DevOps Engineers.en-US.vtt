00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
Hello folks.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.420
In this lecture we are going to see what

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.525
adult topics do we cover as part of this training.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:08.685
First one is introduction section.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.030
Here we are going to see what is Marvin and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.600
how mapping helps to your DevOps in it and the resources.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.015
What do we need to follow these quotes?

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:22.560
In next section, we are going to prepare Marvin in weldment on Windows.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.855
Here we are going to see installation of Java and installation of Eclipse.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.810
And we are not going to install Marvin over here way

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.575
because whenever we install Eclipse where default, my van comes.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:38.050
Next, we are going to seek create your first American project.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.910
And the Maven Coordinates default directory structure of your Maven project,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.180
steps involved in building your Java project.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.040
Next, Marvin goals under Class 2 building first Maven project.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.155
In next section we are going to talk about Marvin goals and the repositories.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.005
Here we talk about palm dot xml,

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:06.965
trans to Dependency Map and repositories and pushing Marvin project onto GitHub.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.730
In next section we are going to deal Marin on Linux.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.770
Here we need your Linux system for that.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.675
I'm going to use AWS Cloud.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.315
So preparing him Marvin server.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:19.850
Next setup Mac and on Linux.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.070
Building Marvin project on Linux commonly used them having goals.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.760
Creating your project with Maren architect next to settings.py XML under class 2,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.145
deploying an application on Tomcat server.

00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:38.945
Whatever application we build over here that we are willing to deploy an Tomcat server.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:42.530
In next section, we're going to see magnum DevOps workflow.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.150
In this section, we are going to see how we can use mapping in continuous integration.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.025
Here we need it Jenkins server.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.865
So I'm going to set up Jenkins server again on AWS Cloud.

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:56.270
Then we will add Marvin server as Asian to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.290
the Jenkins and building a Java project on agent,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.265
nothing but unmanned server.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:07.360
In this section we are going to see DevOps learning path under some additional resources.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.610
What courses you can learn, uh, next,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.395
as part of your DevOps journey and bonus lecture about coupon courts have

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:17.320
our other courses and creating

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.545
an AWS account to which you don't know while doing this course,

00:02:20.545 --> 00:02:23.995
you may come here and check out how to create an AWS account,

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:29.065
install Git Bash, installed mobile x term, and install Tomcat.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:33.040
These installations are needed to practice this course,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.365
but most of the people already setup this.

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:37.420
That's the reason instead of adding in-between.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.225
Now Farber course, I kept it as a separate section.

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.595
So if you are really not aware of this,

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.760
you can come over here and check out,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.325
alright, that's all for this lecture.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:48.510
See you in the next lecture.
