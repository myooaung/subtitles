00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
In previous lecture we have seen different map and

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.630
goals and how does it helps us to build the project?

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.170
In this lecture, we are going to talk about found.ee dot XML.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.125
Let's see what Marvin is saying about Kwame dot xml.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.765
I just substitute for what is bom dot XML.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.300
Let's go to Mavien dot apache.org.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.830
And if you see the definition,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.435
what is palm dot xml,

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.085
your project object model, our palm,

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:27.380
the full form of palm is Project Object Model

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.915
is the fundamental unit of work in math when it is

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:34.535
an XML file that contains information about the project

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:38.615
and configuration details user by mapping to build the project.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.915
It contains the default value of most projects,

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:47.030
which means that it is telling a boda information what this project does

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.190
do and what is the artifact ID and Washington and also configurations,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.585
some of the configurations which you need to do to execute this project.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:01.685
Then it also contains some default values which are required to run that project.

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:06.530
That is how this palm dot xml helps us to build our project.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.215
Let's go to Palm dot xml and tried to understand what is the information it contents are.

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:14.270
This moment, this palm dot xml we haven't written

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.245
whenever we are creating our project by default, it got generated.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.335
And this content also came along with that one.

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:23.930
If you remember, well, creating our project,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.905
we have provided this group ID artifact idea to watch and I rewrite it.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.755
So that is the information got updated over here.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:34.595
Apart from this, there is a one more field we required that is packaging.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:38.254
But if you don't specify any packaging parameter,

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:42.815
then it will treat it as a job under that information also updated over here.

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:46.505
Yes, you can see here default lifecycle jar packaging,

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.250
which means that in case if we don't specify anything,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.485
it is going to treat it as a JAR file.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:54.905
Next name of the project that is fostered demo project,

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:57.485
that is the name we have given and properties.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:00.620
What is the compiler we should use to build this project?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.810
That is one dot seven Maven Compiler.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.295
It is using. And the,

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:06.965
another important field is dependencies.

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:08.420
So in the dependencies,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.575
we need to specify what bundled packages does it require to build this project?

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:16.520
In this case, we are calling JUnit packages with the group idea,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.960
artifact ID and diversion.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.480
Whenever we mentioned, these are the dependencies it

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.985
will come and update in the Maven dependencies.

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:24.260
Apart from J unit,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.785
you can see one more dependency which we will talk in the next lecture.

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:31.985
But for now, the JUnit packages has been downloaded over here.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.135
Let's assume that if I remove this dependency, okay,

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:40.625
I'm just deleting the interdependency and let me save this file.

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:44.975
Okay, I just deleted the dependency and save this file.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:46.760
And you can see that dependency,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.674
I mean to say Mab independency tap got disappeared.

00:02:50.674 --> 00:02:54.740
Why means we haven't mentioned any dependencies in the palm dot xml.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.915
That's the reason it is disappeared.

00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:59.340
Let me add it back.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.525
And if I go and refresh it,

00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:05.190
sorry, I need to save this file.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.370
And we could able to see the Maven dependencies back again because

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.035
which is required to test more efficiently what I'm going to do,

00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:18.665
let's assume that we are calling Spring Boot to dependencies.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:23.525
Let's assume that it requires some Spring Boot packages to run this application.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.705
If that is the case, we can add those as the dependencies.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.295
Let's call those.

00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:31.595
I'm searching as a map in Drupal for Spring Boot.

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:34.025
And if I click on this one,

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:36.245
okay, Spring Boot starter tests,

00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:41.885
let me take this 12 dot four dot three.

00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:45.290
And here you can see the code which they have specified

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.155
over here is to update in the palm dot xml.

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:52.910
Let me copy this snippet and will update as a dependency.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.440
Okay?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.115
So I have updated it as a dependency and save the file.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:02.150
Whenever we save, it creates a pull the packages which

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.215
are there in this dependency and stored in the Maven dependencies.

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:10.175
It may take your well and do let me refresh it.

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:13.310
Now you can see because of adding this one,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.625
it has been downloaded lot of dependencies which is required,

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:20.465
but we just mentioned springboard to startup.js threat,

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:23.945
that is Spring Boot starter dot test 2 dot dot dot 3.

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:27.770
But you can see lot of dependencies also get added without

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.435
specifying under dependency tab that we are going to discuss in the next section.

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:37.055
So let me delete it again from here to here.

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:40.200
And let me save the file.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.090
And whatever extra packages we got,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.365
it should be disappeared.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:47.945
So that is how dependency will help us.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.295
That sulfur this lecture.

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:51.350
In next lecture, we are going to see what is

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.810
transduced dependencies. Thanks for watching.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.350
See you there.
