00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.325
Hello folks, In previous lecture we have installed the Java.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:07.905
Now it's time to install Eclipse.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.635
For the people who doesn't know about Eclipse.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:15.375
Eclipse is one of the widely used an IUD tool for the Java developers.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.670
So they will write their code, compile it,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.115
and even deployed by using the Eclipse,

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.885
there are multiple plug-ins.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:25.260
But in our case, I just want to show how the dollar per is going

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.495
to work with the eclipse and how we can use mapping.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.485
That is the reason we are using Eclipse.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:33.110
So we need to download Eclipse for our system.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.705
So go to the Download button.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:38.675
And at the time of recording this video,

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:42.635
we have 20 2012 version of Eclipse IDEs available.

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.170
Again, click on Download button,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.315
which will take some student next phase.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:52.250
Yep. From here we can download the eclipse executable files.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.420
Let's download it. It takes a while to get you to download,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.370
will wait until it get completes.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.650
All read about eclipse download has been successfully completed.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.130
Now let me open where it has been downloaded.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.335
And to install Eclipse,

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:13.985
just to double-click on this one.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.100
Of course, we have already installed the Java,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.680
so the installation process,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.970
it should be smooth.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.540
So this is the first time wizard.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.120
Well, installing Eclipse, we can choose

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.060
four of each application we are going to install Eclipse.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.300
In our case, we are using it for Java dollar per share.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.690
So let's click on the first option itself in the cluster wizard,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.905
it looks for the Java,

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:39.050
so we have already installed Java.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.210
It is picking up the Java installation path,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.710
nothing to change over here.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.125
And also it is installing the eclipse under Users directory that is waxy.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:49.520
And this is the path.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.590
Now let's proceed with the installation.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.105
Installation has been completed successfully.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:01:59.995
Now let's launch it.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:03.640
Now. It is looking for the workspace where it can store

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.015
the projects which we create an Eclipse ID.

00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:08.350
This is the default location,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.140
but I don't want to create a under a different location.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.435
Let me create the new folder.

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:19.749
So I'm creating a new folder and I will name it as IT projects.

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.705
And choose this folder.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.730
I'll read from now onwards,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.390
all the projects which we create an eclipse will be stored over here.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.625
And let's launch it.

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:35.200
This is the default welcome because either we can close it or minimize it.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.215
So let me minimize it.

00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:40.175
And this is where we can minimize.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:45.320
And we can create a new Java project by choosing this option R else File New,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.240
and we can create the projects.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.710
Anyway, we are going to see how we can create new projects in our next lecture.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.230
Thanks for watching and see you in the next video.
