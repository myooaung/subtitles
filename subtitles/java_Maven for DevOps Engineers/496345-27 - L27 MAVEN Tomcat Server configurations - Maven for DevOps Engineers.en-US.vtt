00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
In this lecture, I'm going to show you how can we deploy

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.110
your application on Tomcat server using mapping to demonstrate this,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.640
we need your Tomcat server.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.710
I have already set up your Tomcat server.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm going to use this one to deploy our application from the mountains are we're already,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.030
we have Marvin server, which is up and running.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.950
So to install Tomcat server,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.020
I have given you a procedure over here.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.740
So this is to setup Tomcat Anya EC2 instance.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.420
You just need to follow the same steps because I had done the same thing to set it up.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.010
Once you have set up the Tomcat,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.025
you need to provide the credentials to Tomcat users too.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:40.475
The SUM deployment, that is where we are using this deployments, okay,

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:44.480
so we need to update this content in that Tomcat use of Start XML,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.725
same thing I have done.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.070
So here we are going to use a user called admin

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.565
and password as the admin to deploy our application from the oven.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.515
So this is the maze of thing,

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:56.255
just I would like to highlight.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:59.180
So I will just login to my Tomcat server and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.480
show you that whether it is matching to this configuration R naught.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.475
For that, I'm going to my Tomcat server undertaking the public IP address of this,

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:08.900
go into my terminal.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.110
I have already logged into my Marvin's her work and go

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.100
to New Share button is hit and IP address.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.620
And I'm loading my keyboard here,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.635
I'm using gatekeepers might keep it because I

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:25.895
created this server to prepare my good course.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:27.710
So same thing I'm using,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.450
and I'm just connecting to the server by using ec2 user. That's it.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.180
So it's configured, our setup sometime back.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.440
That is the reason there could be

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.965
some security patches are there it is advising me to update,

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:42.425
but we can skip that one for time being.

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:44.240
And let me become route.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.590
Clear the screen and I'm going insert to OPT.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.290
And I have configured my Tomcat server under this location just to go here and there,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.130
here we have the other configurations and config Tomcat users dot xml.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.610
In this file, I have updated my user's information.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.445
You can see whatever information you have seen in the browser,

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:11.180
I mean to say, and this wealth same thing is updated over here.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.075
I'm going to use this admin user to

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:17.585
deploy the application from my Tomcat server 200 over here.

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.254
Okay, so just to, to differentiate,

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:23.975
I'm going to change the host name azure Tomcat for this one.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:25.730
Host name Tom cat.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.350
Okay, to make it affected,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.125
just you need to do is Udi way assume minus

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.545
so that the name is going to change it as atomically ID.

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:34.370
That's okay.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.755
So we helped set up the Tomcat server

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.725
as part of the documentation which I just shown you.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.860
Next thing, we need to start our Tomcat application.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.599
To start our application,

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.239
we just go to PT and Apache Tomcat.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.095
Here.

00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:55.460
We have been under been we have startup.js edge.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.455
So we just need to do dot slash startup.js switches to start the application.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:02.810
I think I have already started this application.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.655
If we have already started,

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:08.375
we can able to access this one on port number 800,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:09.995
800 from the browser.

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:13.730
So I'm just taking the public IP address of this one.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.150
I'm going to browser under 800, it's 0.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.930
That's it.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.465
Yep, I could able to connect to this one under go to manager app.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.405
Here it is going to ask for the user name and password.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:29.630
Again, these credentials also updated in the same file.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.580
And if I go with you,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.325
you can see here manager GUA role helps us to login the user on the command prompt.

00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:41.600
So here we need to use the user as your Tomcat password as a secret.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.175
So I will just connect to the Tomcat server from the browser user.

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:48.935
Next secret, I have given the password.

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:51.575
Okay, so I have logged into my Tomcat server.

00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:54.425
And if I see these all are the default applications.

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:59.240
Now we need to deploy your web application from Marvin server to Tomcat server.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.550
For that, we should copy the application into

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.060
the Tomcat server under location called web app.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.360
If I go out and PWD present working directory,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.595
we are under OPT Apache Tomcat.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:13.040
And if I do ls cd,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.020
we're back to which location under slash OPT Apache Tomcat web apps.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.460
Okay, it to this location,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.725
we need to copy our obligation.

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:23.180
So by using Marvin,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.955
it is automatically copies the application over here.

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:28.430
Okay, anyway, Marvin's or worries here,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.130
we need to do some configuration changes to make

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.010
it play into that Tomcat server in this location.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.535
Okay.

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:38.045
So this is Tomcat server and this is Marion server.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:39.710
What and L configuration changes.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.645
So we should do and how to update.

00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:44.630
We are going to see in the next lecture. Thanks for watching.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.290
See you there.
