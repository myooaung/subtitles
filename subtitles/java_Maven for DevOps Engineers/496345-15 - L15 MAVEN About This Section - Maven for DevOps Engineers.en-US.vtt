00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
In previous lecture, we have seen how the palm dot xml does work.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.654
In this lecture, we are going to see what is the transitive dependency.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:09.930
If you see over here,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.450
we just added only j in interdependency,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.260
but you can see one more extra came as a dependency. Okay.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.075
I'll remove this one.

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:18.520
Then.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.845
It is commented it out.

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.170
That's the reason it is not throwing an error.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.055
That's okay, and let me save it. Alright.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:29.205
So here we are using the J unit.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.980
Apart from this, this is also taking the spec

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.115
is this package we call digest transitive dependency.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:37.425
Nothing but to make use of this one,

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:38.940
it is mandatory without this,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.555
you cannot able to use that one.

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:43.760
And the same thing you can see over here, dependency hierarchy.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.930
If you click on this one,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.875
you can see here the J unit j in it also brings this package,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.300
okay, even though we don't specify it in our palm dot xml.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.320
Similar way, if I go to my dependency tab

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.550
and if I add the code which we have added previously,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.380
you can see here this is the quadrate.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.735
Actually it should add only one pack is,

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:08.405
but in the back-end it is adding so many files.

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.010
Let me save this file.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.725
And you can see lot of files has been added apart from what we have requested.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.935
These files we call digit transitive dependency,

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:22.085
apart from the one which we have mentioned over here.

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:24.860
And the same you can find in the dependency hierarchy.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.690
You can see here we call this one,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.035
but it internally calls lot of packages which are there,

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:32.990
okay, That is how transitive dependency does work.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.650
The transitive dependencies comes with the dependency jar,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.885
which we mentioned in the palm dot xml.

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:42.140
Alright, now anyway, we are not using this one.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.520
Let me remove it.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.440
Once we have removed, again,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.110
it is going to disappear once we save the file.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.790
I can even use controllers,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.410
but just for visibility,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.225
I'm using File Save.

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:55.010
Okay, that's all for this lecture.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.420
And see you in the next lecture.
