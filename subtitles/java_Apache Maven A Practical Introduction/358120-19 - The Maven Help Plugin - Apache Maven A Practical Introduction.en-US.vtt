00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
in this video,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.030
I'm going to show you how to use the help plug in to get information on plug ins that you

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.770
can use in the build and that can become favorable in some way.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.230
So,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.680
in other words,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.340
that help look in is really a plug in.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.960
It gives you a bit more insight into the maven environment on in this specific case into

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.350
the plug ins off the environment.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.950
So let's consider the maven compile a plug in which we've seen before.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.240
So when we looked at the Melbourne compiler plug in on the Melvin Plug Ins website,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.130
which we see here,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.730
we saw that it had a couple of configuration options to enable us to set the source level

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.930
on the target level off the incoming source code and the compiled biker that was output.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.600
So let's see how to get this configuration information using the help looking Okay,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.440
So if I go back to terminal and type may even help describe this is the describe girl we're

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.030
using of the help looking my honesty plug in equals compiler.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.640
This view gives you a very top level view off the goals available on the compile a plug in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.640
.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.320
So here we can see this compiler Compile compiler help on compiler test.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.000
Compile some of the words the office three functions compile help and test compile,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.140
which compiles the application sources,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.460
display some help information and compiles test sources.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.670
We can see here at the bottom it says if you want,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.890
we can ask for more detail with a minus T detail So we'll do that now.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.800
So minus D detail.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.480
But we're gonna ask for detail of a specific goal,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.940
which is the compile goal.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.570
In other words,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.050
what we're asking for here is we're saying,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.330
Look at the compiler plug in,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.760
take the compile goal off they and give us the full details about how we invoke it,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.440
the configuration,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.200
that kind of stuff.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.650
So if you clear that out and now presenter so now we can see we scroll up to the top.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.180
These are all of the available configuration options which we have,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.650
which you can possibly pass to the compiler plug in.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.740
So,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.230
for example,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.420
here we can see if wanted to set the debug information on such that we could have the line

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.030
numbers printed in stack traces when we encounter stack trace in a running application.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.310
You said that to truth.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.310
It's already set to true by default.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.060
It happens here.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.740
Conversely,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.270
if we didn't want to allow that to be set,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.770
maybe working with an obvious cater to obfuscate the statue writers in some way,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.550
we can also say that a false here as well.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.670
Anyway,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.650
if we go down,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.910
then we should see the two properties,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.650
which documentation told us about which are source and target,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.610
So we could then take this information and go across into a pond.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.160
XML file unplugged those values into a standard configuration block.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.220
So just to recall what that is,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.080
if we look back at the compiler,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.950
plug in on DWI,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.420
click the usage link and we scroll down.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.700
It says,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.750
Put your configurations here in this configuration block.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.910
So it's within this particular configuration tag pair that we could place source and target

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.370
tags,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.800
which include the actual values off the source and target versions we wanted to use.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.130
It's clear this out.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.340
One of the things you mention is the fact that when we invoked to Commander before,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.210
remove this,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.250
we don't need this anymore.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.430
We just gave the short name off the plug in which here was compiler.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.920
If you just give a one word plug in i d.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.480
Then the help looking assumes that it's,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.860
um,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.130
Evan default Plug in.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.700
In other words,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.620
it's in the order.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.900
A Patch it up Maryland that plug INS Group I D.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.400
On that.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.160
It follows the standard naming pattern of From Evan plug ins,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.500
which means that the word compiler is prefixed with heaven and Sir fix with Plug in.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.690
So what this means is this notation here with just one word,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.550
is actually short for Ogg door patchy.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.830
I don't know,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:08.750
even the plug ins may heaven compiler Plug in,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.280
and this will actually resolve to the same thing.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.040
But that's worth pointing out because if you do them with third party plug ins that aren't

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.300
part of the standard Maven package or registered to American catalogue,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.620
then you must specify the gap coordinates.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.230
In that way,

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.160
it's a group I D.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.340
Colon artifact.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.670
I d.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.800
On optionally aversion to anyway,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.060
that gives you some idea of how you can become a bit more productive with the plug ins from

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.090
the command line and use them more effectively in your moving bills.
