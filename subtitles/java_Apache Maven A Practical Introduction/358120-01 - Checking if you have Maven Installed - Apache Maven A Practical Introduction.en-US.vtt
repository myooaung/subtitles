00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
in this video,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.830
we're going to see how we can check if member has been installed onto a system which is

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.000
really straightforward to do.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.070
Before we do that,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.760
we'll just double check.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.010
We have Java installed.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.800
So 11 runs on Java,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.720
which is the reason that Melvin is platform agnostic,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.030
built ill in the sense that it can run on Linux,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.790
X windows,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.760
Mac or UNIX.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.530
Do two jobs,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.160
right ones run anywhere ability.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.260
It's the first off.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.120
Let's just check if we have job or installed safely.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.880
Type Java minus version and he answer.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.250
Then this tells us that we have the 1.8 version of the Jedi cane stalled,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.180
so the next thing to check is that we have heaven.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.600
So the way you interact with memory is the same,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.250
regardless,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.050
off whatever platform you're running on on,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.090
it's basically to use the M V N command,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.030
so envy N is the command line interface dmelvin on.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.280
If we type minus minus version afterwards on he enter,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.370
then we should see the version information message,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
which tells us that members being installed on the system so just a couple of things to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.250
point out here it tells the version of Meghan will be using,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.040
which is 339 which is the latest version As of this recording,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.150
it also tells us the Nevin Home Directory.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.200
This points to the direction where the meme Until is installed.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.900
So in this case,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.580
I'm running S t Cayman and it's in that particular directory.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.750
They're It also tells us which version of the J.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.880
D.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.520
K we have,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.330
which is 1.8 years we've just seen and tells us where the driver harms for that.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.680
In other words,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.500
what version of Java home it's gonna use,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.600
as well as some information about the platform settings.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.920
So the local character in carding and the actual operating system that we're on This is how

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.870
we determined that mavens installed on the system.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.360
So at this point,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.630
you can actually great your own projects and starts actually developing projects with

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.960
heaven
