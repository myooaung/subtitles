00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.440
[Autogenerated] Let's see where we are now.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.890
We started building the demo application and decoupled

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.710
to web player from the service layer.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.140
By using spring integration,

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.680
you've learned about the different ways you can configure

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.590
spring integration components using XML,

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.440
Jaffa annotations and the spring integration domain specific language.

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.790
We took a closer look at the service activator,

9
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.430
which is a message endpoint that you can use to call a business logic

10
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.740
component to handle messages sent to a channel.

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.440
You also have a good grip on the different message.

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.660
Colonel implementations The message Channels can be divided into

13
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.710
subscribe double channels and possible channels and point to point and

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.860
published subscribe channels in the next module.

15
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.040
We're going to continue with the demo application.

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.100
We're going to split it into two separate applications,

17
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.970
the front and on the back end.

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:01.000
And we're going to use a message broker to handle the messaging between them. Let's continue with the next module
