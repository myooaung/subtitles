00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.900
[Autogenerated] Let's take a minute for some practical things so that

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.480
you are prepared to follow along with the examples.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.830
In this course, you will need to have a few pieces off software on your computer.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.240
To be able to Follow along.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.420
First of all, obviously, you'll need a J.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.540
D.

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.740
K.

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160
You probably already have it on your system,

9
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.740
but in case you haven't, you can download it from Oracle's website.

10
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.600
There are also a number of other parties that offer bills off open J.

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.120
D K.

12
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.100
For example, Adopt Open J.

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.230
D.

14
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.440
K.

15
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.430
I will be using Jaedicke 11 since JavaScript current long term support.

16
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.000
Jaffa released all the example projects in this course Army even projects,

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440
so you'll need Apache May even to build them.

18
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.740
You can get Apache may, even at May, even not Apache to Torque.

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.310
I will use intelligent idea for the demos,

20
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.000
but you are free to choose whatever IDE you want to

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.940
use for some of the examples, we will use a message broker.

22
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.720
I chose to use rabid mq because it's open source available for free

23
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.240
and because it's popular and supported by spring,

24
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.270
you can install rabbit and Q directly on your system.

25
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.610
but I'm going to use Docker to run rabbit.

26
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.940
Mq.

27
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.060
It's not absolutely required to do this with Docker,

28
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.560
but I'll use that because it makes it super easy to install,

29
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.000
Start and stop are evident you in a container sandbox without having to install it separately on my system.
