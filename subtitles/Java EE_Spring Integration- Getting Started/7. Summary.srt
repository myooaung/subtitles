00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,100
[Autogenerated] This is just the first module and

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,640
you've already learned quite a lot.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,510
Spring integration is an implementation off the Enterprise Integration patterns,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,660
which is a set off 65 design patterns that are described in

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,190
the book enterprise integration patterns.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,000
Like Gregor Hope and Bobby Wolf.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,410
The patterns focus on integrating software,

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,760
components and systems,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,990
using a synchronous messaging a synchronous messaging as a number of

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,130
advantages over synchronous communication techniques that help make

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,540
systems more responsive and able to deal with failures.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,940
You've learned to core concepts of enterprise integration patterns.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,600
A message consists off a payload and headers and is transported from

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,740
the center to the receiver through a message channel.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,910
There are two main types of channels which are point to

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,840
point and published subscribe channels.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
Message endpoints are the way to connect to message generals.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,140
There are many different types off message and points.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,990
You will learn about channel adapters, gateways,

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,490
service,

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,990
activators and other types of endpoints as we go along to other main categories.

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,430
Off enterprise integration patterns are message,

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,540
transformation and message routing.

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,380
Spring integration gives you many ready to use message endpoint

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,800
implementations that you can use to connect to different types of

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,940
systems using different interfaces and protocols.

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,540
By using these endpoints, you don't have to write a lot of plumbing code.

28
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,000
After all this theory, it's time we start working this spring.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,920
Integration hands on in the next module will start

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,000
building our demo application by first learning how to

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
implement point to point messaging. Let's go.
