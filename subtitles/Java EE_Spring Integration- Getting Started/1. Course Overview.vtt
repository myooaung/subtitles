[Autogenerated] Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.060
My name is yes, but young and welcome to my course.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.410
Spring integration getting started.

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.470
I am an independent software developer with many years of experience

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.110
designing and building enterprise software systems in job harvest

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.150
spring In almost all software projects,

7
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.840
you're going to have to make your software connect to other systems.

8
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.880
Often this involves writing lots off plumbing code, which is code.

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.120
That's not about real business logic off your application,

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.200
and that takes a lot of time to write and maintain.

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.530
In this course, we're going to dive into spring integration,

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.060
which has lots off ready made components for connecting two different

13
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.540
systems without the need to write a lot of plumbing code.

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.840
Some of the major topics that will cover include

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.710
enterprise integration patterns,

16
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.880
which are the design patterns that spring integration is based upon.

17
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.940
Using a synchronous messaging to connect components within your

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.040
application as well as different applications,

19
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.570
point to point messaging and published subscribe messaging and ways to

20
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.780
handle errors in your spring integration application.

21
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.020
By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding,

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.290
offspring integration and enterprise integration patterns,

23
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.990
and you'll be ready to use spring integration in your

24
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.600
own work before beginning the course,

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.140
you should be familiar with the basics off the spring framework.

26
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.910
From here,

27
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.880
you should feel comfortable diving deeper into spring integration with the

28
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.140
other courses in the spring integration Learning path.

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.220
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn spring

30
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:47.000
integration with the spring integration getting start, of course, at Pluralsight.
