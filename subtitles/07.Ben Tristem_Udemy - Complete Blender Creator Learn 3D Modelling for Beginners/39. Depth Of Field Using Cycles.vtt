00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.320
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.450
We're going to discuss depth of field this time using the cycle's rendering engine.

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.870
So this is going to make this scene even better where we can blur out the trees and grass in the background

4
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.550
to really focus on our rabbit in the foreground so I'm going to make us seen even better than it was

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.540
before.

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.390
Now one of the first things to just work out here is and to tell you about is now a P.S. As you probably

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.970
gathered this isn't a Mac anymore and these it's the second thing is just to refresh my memory and this

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.530
will happen to you as well.

9
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.690
When you're coming back to a project and applying things you've learnt.

10
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.180
So first of all does this actually render as I expect it to I've opened this project to move computer.

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.050
Let's just make sure it does and I don't wanna wait in E on ALL I NEED TO SEE IS grasp being there.

12
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.870
So I'm still using s.p. rendering it's very intensive I know the GP on this computer can't even handle

13
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.580
it 16 by 16 is fine for my tiles sizes.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.470
So the first thing I'm going to do here is whack.

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.970
My resolution 1920 by 10 it is fine but the tone all the way down to just 10 percent and here F 12.

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.980
Now what this is going to do is give me an impression of how the scene is looking.

17
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.330
I don't care if this is full of detail or not.

18
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.340
What I do care about is is all the are all the bits that I want to be there there.

19
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.280
If they're not then I'm going to have to reconstruct something or move things about.

20
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.870
Now this often happens especially with images in a scene but as we can see it's rendered out there and

21
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.540
I've got everything I wanted my scene perfect.

22
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.560
So what's the next thing to do.

23
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.770
Well the next thing to do is to go ahead and start tweaking and adding in the appropriate depth of field

24
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.440
to the right camera in our scene.

25
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.800
So the next thing we need to trouble ourselves with is working out which camera actually looking to

26
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.480
an easiest way of working that out is to make sure your looking through the camera view with your number

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.860
pad is zero.

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.650
And when you've done that just go through your cameras in the outline clicking them one by one and we

29
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.240
can see there's a camera up here.

30
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.740
We've got one over there and one we eventually get to my cam.

31
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.220
We will see that the border around the camera highlights are in so we know that's the camera we need

32
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.230
to edit so we can go to that straightaway go into the camera properties with that's selected and we

33
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.260
can tweak our settings here and then we're going to need to scroll down to where it says depth of field.

34
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.120
Now just as we did way back in the chess section we can go ahead and use the Selecta here to select

35
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.350
the.

36
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.690
I threw up the object rabbit there and we've got that selected and we're focussed on the lens of the

37
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.070
rabbit.

38
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.660
That's good that's a good place to be and then we can start playing with ah settings now whereas with

39
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.570
Blender render you need to fake it cycles is really good we dont need to do that.

40
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.900
It's a it's a great tracing engine so we go ahead and change the camera properties.

41
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.040
It should change as well something to change sister f-stop rather than radius.

42
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.900
And I'm going to lower it down to something like one point to the number of blades that's going to change

43
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
the shape of the bokor the outer focussed area I'm going to go for six.

44
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.570
And that will be the same as having a hexagonal shaped aperture.

45
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.140
The next thing we can do here is flip into rendered mobridge shift in Z and start tweaking things.

46
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.930
We've already got this setting here.

47
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.560
We can see there's already a bit of blur going on in the background.

48
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.360
How about if we lower this 2.5.

49
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.670
Does that change the background even more.

50
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.260
Yes we can see it starting to get even fuzzier in the background.

51
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.380
You know what I might just leave it as that and just see what's going on.

52
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.440
When I go ahead and hit render Now this is one of these points at which hitching render I should imagine

53
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.090
is going to work well going to have a little bit of a longer render time but also with the resolution

54
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.830
that I have set under the render properties of escarole I am already up at 10 percent.

55
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.010
I might not be able to get enough detail in that in order to ascertain whether I've got the right depth

56
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.140
of field settings going on.

57
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.970
And here we go it's coming through so we can see that is definitely blurred compared to last time.

58
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.710
But I can't really tell how much.

59
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.810
Now I'm quite happy with the viewport and how it has updated obviously it doesn't give an impression

60
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.860
of the grass or how much of a depth of field we have there.

61
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.370
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go ahead and whack this up to 400 percent and I'm going

62
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.510
to go grab myself a cup of tea whilst that renders out because it is going to take a few minutes to

63
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.920
do.

64
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.250
In fact I'm going to whack it to 50 percent because I do want to be able to not have two cups of tea

65
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.060
so I'll see you guys back in a few moments after that has finished rendering out.

66
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.910
Okay so there we go second about two minutes to do that's not bad at all.

67
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.880
And we've got a definitely a separated image of foreground image here of the rabbit than the rest of

68
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.470
us seen again is still not particularly high detail at the moment but that's something we can work on

69
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.390
as we get to the final render.

70
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.630
Now one of the things that can be incredibly fussy when you're trying to work out where to place your

71
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.680
actual focal point so on the camera itself.

72
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.610
When we were setting it up we've picked the lens of the.

73
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.710
I wish that that is a good place to focus in this particular scene.

74
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.590
If we wanted to change the focus over time perhaps animates it so we've got the tree in foreground or

75
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:09.120
the bush in foreground and then the Rabbit itself with its eye actually focussed in we're not going

76
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.840
to be able to do it with that so we need a bit more finer control over what is happening.

77
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.890
And that is where an empty can come in.

78
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.360
So let's go over to the 3D view.

79
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.950
Then take a few moments to come out now.

80
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.490
Our 3-d cursor at the moment when we come out of rended mode our 3-d cursor or moving the camera around

81
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.180
I will one day one day remember to turn off.

82
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.930
Lock to camera view.

83
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.450
There we go.

84
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.040
So come out of there and our and our.

85
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.410
Yeah it is.

86
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.120
Three curses right on that eyeball there which is exactly what I want to see because with the 3-d cursor

87
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:55.370
there we can go ahead and add in an empty and smoke aeroplane access in this point and I'm going to

88
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.900
call this focus points straight away so focus points.

89
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:07.460
And now I've got a focus point I can go on so I can go to my camera and then change the focus to that

90
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.500
focus point.

91
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:16.110
And that means now we can animate that focus point in our scene and the focal depth will track wherever

92
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.670
that focus point is and we can demonstrate that with the viewport rendering.

93
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.170
Looking through the camera.

94
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.410
There we go.

95
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.750
So at the moment the rabbit is definitely in focus and the Bush is not.

96
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.420
If I come out and I drag that back to the bush I could be a bit more precise with it being placed.

97
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.780
But let's drag it back to roughly where the Bushes come back round to where the camera is and flip into

98
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:49.270
rendered mode and we can see here that now are but gone a bit fuzzy and ah Bush is in focus.

99
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.110
How about that.

100
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.660
That is pretty cool and that will enable you to animates that depth of field as well if you so wish.

101
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.730
So let's finish off this election now with a challenge.

102
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.250
And you've probably already guessed what your depth of field challenges it's to add depth of field and

103
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.160
depth of field to your scene and make sure you are tracking an empty that is important that is part

104
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.090
of this challenge.

105
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.730
I know you can go ahead and just click on a particular object but add an entity or scene and use that

106
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.160
for the tracking render out your final image and share it with everybody.

107
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:30.940
And there's a bonus if you feel up to the challenge of animating a depth of field change or maybe even

108
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.550
a bit of a focal change as well.

109
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.230
Go ahead and do that as a bonus as well.

110
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.130
And if you go ahead with that make sure you share that as well.

111
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.230
So go ahead pause video now and give that a go.

112
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.260
OK everybody welcome back let's go ahead and add a different depth of field to our scene.

113
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.910
And I'm going to make sure that I am tracking an empty which I think I'm doing anyway.

114
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.840
And you know what I'm going to go ahead and do that.

115
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.070
Bonus parts of the challenge as well.

116
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:02.010
Now I'm not going to get overly fussy with what's going on here I'm going to do a little bit of camera

117
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.010
movement.

118
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.470
I'm not going to make it too long.

119
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.850
I'm not gonna render it on this computer and probably can render it on why I probably am going to render

120
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.290
on this one but probably several computers.

121
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.860
So let's go through the process that I would now go through.

122
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:20.430
I'm going to start off focussed on the tree in the background then I'm going to move to the bush and

123
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.560
then to the rabbit itself and I'm going to just move or pan or do something with the camera.

124
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.610
Not quite sure yet but nice and slowly it's not going to be a big movement.

125
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:37.250
Now this point in time I am going to save my file and I'm going to create a new file as well.

126
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:43.920
Based upon this one fluffy Ben the bunny and with depth of focus and the reason why I'm doing that is

127
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.640
because I want to remove some things from my scene.

128
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.020
I want to keep it a little bit more simple so I'm going to go ahead and remove these extra cameras that

129
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.280
we were playing with before and almost delete the wrong thing.

130
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.610
There's another one that I camp.

131
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.550
Okay so who set those all up before just to get an idea of what's going on.

132
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.950
Now we can go ahead and I can move that focus point.

133
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.700
If I go g and move it will end up with things being out of focus.

134
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.210
I'm going now do that in this mode so I can place things in an appropriate place and I'm going to bring

135
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:19.380
up the time line at the bottom here so I can just key in some movements now to make this make any sense

136
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:19.740
to me.

137
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.950
Umm guns have switched to orthographic mode and look at things from above.

138
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.090
Did I want above.

139
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.750
Probably in wireframe all as she can't see what I thought I was going to be able to see.

140
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.120
Let's look at it from the side.

141
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.700
Move it back and then look at it from the front.

142
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.860
So that's that's fine.

143
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.310
Then I could track along here if I wanted to.

144
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.340
I wanted to go from here to the bush and then to the bunny's eyes.

145
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.810
I'm going to key in the original position so let's go ahead.

146
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:55.250
Key in the position and then I wanted to come down sort of in an arc by Fink I can do that later on

147
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.500
the bush itself.

148
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.800
If I see that from the top is about there just a little lower.

149
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.250
Let's look at it from the one side from the other.

150
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.020
Yep that's fine.

151
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.380
I forgot to move the time line lets move it.

152
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.210
It depends how many frames per second we're doing this is going to be a long animation if I'm not careful

153
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.110
not I'll do it.

154
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.000
Two seconds to move from here to the bush.

155
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.270
Now I can move it can't I.

156
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.820
Okay so let's move it down to roughly where the Bushes switch around to the other side.

157
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.560
There we go and keep that in AK So removing it from here to here and then to the bunnies.

158
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.270
I will be the last one a hundred and twenty frames.

159
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.000
I don't think I'm going to have many more resources to focus on it like that.

160
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:45.570
So in this particular case it's in the right place and I can cheat here because the three curses already

161
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.900
on it are not.

162
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.030
Going to call it cheating but I can move the origin of that to the appropriate location.

163
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.770
Shift in s n then where is it selection to cursor.

164
00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.440
There we go.

165
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.280
I've moved there mechanically that's in.

166
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.000
So let's just go through here to there and up there.

167
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:11.730
Okay so the next thing to do is a line that the movements of the camera itself with the rest of our

168
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.400
scene.

169
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.810
So I'm going to use the first person mode to move the karibe.

170
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:23.130
I'm going to set the camera up at frame 1 and then I should be able to see my focus point as well.

171
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.360
It's all the way up here.

172
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:31.860
I'm glad to make sure my camera selected shift F and move up to look at it and key those details in.

173
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:38.730
I'm not going to worry about moving the camera too much but by me it was 60 wasn't it.

174
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:44.970
It will be down at the bush so when I move around to the bush here and keep those in and then the final

175
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.600
scene was on the rabbits.

176
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.500
I says go ahead and show them.

177
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.330
Zoom in ever so slightly to the rabbits.

178
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.210
I look down as if he's towering.

179
00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Now this may not work out at all but it's a good idea that see how those movements are going to be.

180
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:08.250
So going to be focussed up here it's going to start pulling focus immediately round to there and then

181
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.030
to the rabbit cape.

182
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:16.520
I think I want more of the tree in this end shot some just going to move the camera back a little and

183
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.900
make it even lower and looked up.

184
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.810
Question is whether there's going to be a blade of grass in that that's ruining the shots.

185
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.450
There we get.

186
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.090
I'm going to go for that as my end.

187
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.020
Remembering to keep those two areas in.

188
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.950
I think I'm happy with how that's gonna be moving about.

189
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:44.250
So the next thing of course is to go and do a quick test render of an animation and I'm going to really

190
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:50.290
really crank this down and I'm not going to worry too much about how it's being output at the moment

191
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.240
and just be output to a temporary folder.

192
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.730
But I'm just going to do one percent of this and just to see if it kind of works.

193
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:02.220
I'm going to do an animation and unless you can see that's going to be very few pixels is going to take

194
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.660
a few moments to build up the scene and then hopefully it won't take too long to just go through these

195
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.670
120.

196
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.540
I've never actually done a one per percent render of 1920 paternity before so I'll be interesting to

197
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.660
see how it comes out.

198
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:20.160
And I can see from that straightaways just going to be probably too low a detail so I need to crank

199
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:20.980
that up a little.

200
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.970
I'm gonna go across and render this across a couple of machines now to get that rendering done.

201
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.760
Go to my output folder and set it to an appropriate location.

202
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.450
In this case I've popped it in completely the wrong folder but move it in a bit.

203
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.790
Except that because I've got everything set up ready to render.

204
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.940
Now that's the one not going to faff about with it.

205
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:46.920
The final thing I'm going to do here before I do anything else is a quick assessment of how many frames

206
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.290
I'm not going to render all 250.

207
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:55.470
Do you want there after it's finished moving when it's reached frame 120 for it to last another second

208
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.710
or so stationary some are going to take it to 150 as my end frames is going to be 150 frames in total

209
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:07.440
being rendered out and the render samples here are going to up them a little.

210
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.130
I'm going to go to 30 because we are using blender 2.0 7 9 now there's a couple of other things we can

211
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.710
do.

212
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.540
First of all on the settings the seed tab I'm going to set.

213
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.840
That's using the little clock which means that any noise that appears will be randomise because by using

214
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.800
a different seed every time that's useful I'm going to go over 30 samples.

215
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.370
But what I am going to do so I'm going to go to the next tab along which is the render layers tab and

216
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.980
then go down to D noisy and turn it on but I'm not going to have the strength set very high.

217
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.910
I'm going to set to maybe point two because what I don't want is it to make things unnecessarily bleary

218
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.120
and just clean up noise essentially.

219
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:53.560
So now that's all set out I'm going to make sure I've saved my file before I hit render and will start

220
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.940
sending out that animation and it is going to take a while to do.

221
00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:02.340
I know that Im going to employ the services of another machine as well so I want it to create place

222
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.530
holders in this folder because that's a shared folder with another machine.

223
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.940
And I'm going to not overwrite.

224
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.720
I want to turn that off so each time it starts a new render it will continue going.

225
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.090
Save that once more and go ahead and render that out.

226
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.570
I'm going to hop onto the other machine now and get that working for me as well.

227
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.700
And then in a few moments I'll be back.

228
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.630
Well a few.

229
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.590
Probably an hour or two for me but a few moments for you and we'll see how it finally looks.

230
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.260
Okay so welcome back.

231
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.780
I have stopped the animation at the moment.

232
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:39.960
I just thought even though I have animated from zero all the way to 120 after 120 is essentially the

233
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.470
same frame so I can pretty much just repeat that again and again.

234
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:51.300
The only difference would be that even though it's a static frame for these last 30 frames because the

235
00:15:51.300 --> 00:16:00.060
noise if you if we go back to or scroll down here because we've set the seed as randomise we will get

236
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.540
a slice of show you know it's going to change ever so slightly even though it's the same image.

237
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.730
But I can get away with that rather than waiting for it to render out the rest of it.

238
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.020
So the next thing to do of course is to put this all into one.

239
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.680
So I'm going to go ahead go to the video sequence.

240
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:21.090
Ed when I'm going to make sure we're right back at the very beginning and I'm going to add in an image

241
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.190
and then I need to go find those images.

242
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:29.340
Now Im going to change the view type here so I can see all of the images because I know these last ones

243
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.880
are not going to be great.

244
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:37.520
In fact they've not been rendered out so we can go from 129 all the way through.

245
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.820
Yeah that's fine.

246
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.640
We can select all of those with the exception of that last one so it's just the select that they're

247
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.830
going to add that image strip.

248
00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:52.020
And then in once I've rented this out I'm just going to extend the last frame in a video editor rather

249
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.690
than just adding the same frames several times.

250
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.160
We've got 130 there.

251
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.550
I'm going to render it out to one hundred thirty frames.

252
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.120
That's looking good so the next thing we need to do is actually render it out as a video.

253
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.600
Now of course you could do this in your favourite video editor.

254
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.780
I'm going to use Blender here so lets just make sure our output this time is not a P N G.

255
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:17.430
But its gonna be an F MPEG video encoding wise Im just going to set it as an MPEG for now there's lots

256
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:24.660
of presets here and I prefer just using this not the top one there but the 8 2 6 4 in MP 4 so that will

257
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.170
play back on most devices and you can upload that to the Web as well.

258
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:34.620
So now all of that has been set up the final thing to do here is to render the animation out and we

259
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.430
should find.

260
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.000
Here we go.

261
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.710
Its coming down be quite quick.

262
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.650
This stage because its rendering it out and this is quite exciting.

263
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.140
You know it did take a while to render this out.

264
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:51.090
I will admit perhaps I shouldn't have done 10 ATP something like seven 20 would have probably been fine

265
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.510
for this.

266
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.680
But you know what.

267
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.360
Yeah well I'm having fun and do it.

268
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.040
All right there's a bit of grass in front of the ah that was beautiful.

269
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.000
I am a Latino so I've that sort of thing.

270
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.260
And there we go there's the final frame.

271
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.370
They're all rendered out.

272
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.010
And then of course we can play back that rendered animation as well using the built in playback feature.

273
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.770
There we go.

274
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.590
Look about.

275
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:14.740
Awesome.

276
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.900
I am really pleased with how that's turned out.

277
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.860
I'm really looking forward to seeing yours as well.

278
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:24.050
I don't know whether you've gone ahead and done a debt for field animation like this as well if you

279
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:24.470
have.

280
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.330
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

281
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:31.210
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
