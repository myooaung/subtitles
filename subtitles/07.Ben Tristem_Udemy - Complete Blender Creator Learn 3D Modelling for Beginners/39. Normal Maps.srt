1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,370
So we've mentioned them lots.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,010
And it's time to discuss normal maps.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,110
So welcome to normal maps in this video you will understand that they are a type of bump map.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,730
You'll gain a greater understanding of how normals actually work and also that they contain direction

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,640
information and not hide information.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,470
And we will go over the fact that there are three main types.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,230
So first of all hite's Map vs. normal map a height map with a value of evil or zero toll one describes

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,980
the particular surface high to any point.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,050
And we can see that can be used to displace our model if necessary and provide some level of control

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,170
and even a basic bump mapping can make something look bumpy.

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,520
However a normal map is slightly better in the way that it controls the direction of light across a

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,500
surface.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,240
Here we have a normal map of the same surface.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,050
Now obviously these are too deep.

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,580
And when we work in three dimensions we can have a whole different gamut of colours.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,560
But in this instance we can see that this zigzag repeats itself so we've got the lower half and the

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,490
upper half.

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,010
And when we look at the normal map for that particular shape that we've got in front of us imagine it

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,060
was a profile of a 3D model.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,140
We can see that the normals are identical the first three are identical to the second three.

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,250
Now that gives us no indication of height differences between those surfaces.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:38,430
So Norman so normal maps themselves they contain direction information not hide information.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm not going to stop repeating that.

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,320
That is important a lot of people get too confused and think that normal maps convey some sort of height

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,830
information.

26
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:55,110
They in fact do not the RG be colour channel values define the direction of a particular normal across

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,320
a surface.

28
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:04,780
An x y z components are also defined with red green and blue Have you ever noticed that the 3D gimbel

29
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,910
in any package that you work with always sticks to these three colours.

30
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,970
There's a not a coincidence that I'm pretty sure.

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,930
So let's have a look at the first one and a hop over to my iPad and just draw this out for you.

32
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,440
We're talk about tangent space Normal's.

33
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,830
Okay so let's talk about Normal's in a bit more detail.

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,370
If we make ourselves a triangle for the shape that we're all familiar with it will be made up of three

35
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,950
edges and three vertices.

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,900
Each one of these vertices has their own normal associated with it.

37
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,320
Now obviously I'm stark in that 2D space when undoing a drawing like this.

38
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,970
But this also applies to a 3-d space.

39
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,360
Now these edges that are joined this particular one here will have a normal that something like this

40
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:01,530
90 degrees to this particular edge or indeed if we imagine it's face side on that would also apply.

41
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,340
And this particular normal is an average of this normal and this normal here.

42
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:15,030
Now ordinarily when light comes in the shade controls somewhat how light is bounced off a particular

43
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,770
surface.

44
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:23,880
But in general if lights were coming in here and hitting this surface we would expect it to bounce off.

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,960
At this sort of angle it was a highly specular surface that would be what it looks like and we can take

46
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,750
control of that when we map an image.

47
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,560
Now obviously we need a face to map an image to see.

48
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,360
But in this case we use a 2D representation.

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,850
So let me remove those light lines.

50
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,910
So we still have some light coming in here.

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,520
But instead we've mapped an image to the surface to tell the surface how to react to light.

52
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:58,630
So at these three points that we have weak control how light is actually bouncing as if there was more

53
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,160
geometry than there actually is.

54
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:08,410
So we pretended for instance that the surface looked like this at this point that it looked like this

55
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,540
at that point.

56
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:17,410
And it looked like well I don't know that at that point and we can do that with a normal map then we

57
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,730
would see that the light would bounce off considerably different.

58
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:28,530
So at this point it would bounce back off like that here is likely to bounce off like that.

59
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,930
In fact that might be a bit overkill in that case.

60
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,120
And this point here will bounce back off like that and we can see that this gives us a great deal of

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:45,400
control about how light is interacting with our surface itself much more control then a simple height

62
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,090
map.

63
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,970
Now often these two things are used in conjunction with one another in order to make a model look more

64
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,220
realistic.

65
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,350
Okay so let's have a look now at tangent normal maps an example of them.

66
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,240
This leaves over one of the most common ones along with object space.

67
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,940
Normal maps as well so a cover tangent first.

68
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,870
So here we have a view where we can see that smooth shading makes a difference where flat shading is

69
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,880
you can see that on the normal map and where the cube is says hang on a minute.

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,750
Why can't we see the cube on the normal map.

71
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,310
And the reason for that is because the top of the cube is the same direction.

72
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:34,780
It has the same normal direction as the plane itself and therefore it has no direction change and no

73
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,390
colour change on the normal map.

74
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,030
So a normal maps appearance when creating normal maps they are affected by whether or not the meche

75
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,680
object has smooth shading turned on normal direction is very important otherwise the map will end up

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,860
useless and you won't be able to use it properly.

77
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:59,140
So if we take the same scene again but this time inverts the Normal's of all of the objects that we're

78
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:05,410
mapping we can see that we end up with a much bolder normal map happening.

79
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,690
And that is actually going to be useless for us if we're using tangent space.

80
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,000
Normal maps is not going to look very nice.

81
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,790
Now there are other normal maps.

82
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:22,330
Now I know at the beginning I said there are three types but there are four I suppose in general and

83
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,270
a couple of them really aren't used.

84
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,790
And two of them are very similar to one another.

85
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,560
So there are three other normal types.

86
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,890
We've got the camera world an object.

87
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:39,910
These are all reference points for the normal map and they all have their uses and issues as all of

88
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,170
these things do when we've got choice.

89
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,970
So using the camera at normal space that is highly restrictive.

90
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,780
This is the Normal's according to the camera view itself so if you've got a static camera it's going

91
00:06:52,780 --> 00:07:00,790
to be possibly fine to use it in here but you cannot move the view of a scene without breaking the illusion

92
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:07,180
of detail as the lighting effect will get worse the further you deviate from that particular view point

93
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,030
because it's the Camrose changing how the normals react.

94
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,410
Using the world space.

95
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,320
Now this is also quite restrictive.

96
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,030
Not as much as the camera.

97
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,220
You cannot rotate deform anything made within the world normal space without breaking the lighting illusion

98
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,810
the moment you do that especially if you change the lighting it will break down.

99
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,000
So using the object normal space.

100
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:42,560
Now this is a more optimized form and is often used in games because it takes less computational power

101
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,130
because there is a one to one mapping to your objects so you can only use it once as it has this one

102
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,260
to one mapping to the object.

103
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,090
So you can't reuse a normal map across multiple items.

104
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:01,880
That's let's say we've got a brick work type normal map where you could use that over lots and lots

105
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,630
of different models.

106
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,290
However an object normal space.

107
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,660
Well it's got a one to one mapping to the object so unless the another object is either incredibly similar

108
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,290
or the same we cannot use it on anything else.

109
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,810
Now this is also called local or model space as well as object space.

110
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:27,090
Now it can generate higher quality maps as the normals are replaced not adjusted.

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,880
So with a tangential base it is a.

112
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:37,550
The normals are adjusted whereas with an object they are replaced with more Normal's so slightly better

113
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:44,030
rendering performance can result from this and it's easier to visualize because if something is facing

114
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:51,140
down it will have a completely different normal then if it's facing up now with tangent space we often

115
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,020
see that.

116
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,790
If if a Normal is 90 degrees from that particular face pointing up it will be the same colour wherever

117
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,470
it is on the model.

118
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,950
So using the tangent normal space whereas that you.

119
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:09,140
Well they are great because they are reusable Regardless subscale defamation or etc. of a model so their

120
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:16,900
great when used with animation for instance it can be difficult to avoid smoothing issues.

121
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,560
They do save memory and bandwidth because we are Count collating but because we count chelating they

122
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,030
have a slight impact on performance.

123
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,800
They can also be tiled and scaled etc. So that's great.

124
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:39,500
If we want to use a tiny normal map that we've made on one object much like we did with the displacement

125
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,660
map a moment ago where we changed the ground using a normal map that already existed in our scene.

126
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,280
That's a great too.

127
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,010
There was an enormous mazzara displacement mouth but you can see there that we can reuse these things

128
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,400
over and over again.

129
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,970
And that obviously saves us a lot of work if we can reuse something and it's not no too noticeable that

130
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,010
we're reusing it.

131
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,530
Especially when you're working on models of completely different scales.

132
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,840
It's unlikely that you would notice that the same texture was being used across multiple models.

133
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,340
So using normal maps outside a blender.

134
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,790
Now some external programs or engines will interpret your normal maps differently so adjustments may

135
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,930
be required.

136
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,090
That's just a word of caution when you're exporting.

137
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,900
Most are going to be absolutely fine.

138
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,370
However there will be some times where it doesn't quite work how you wanted it to.

139
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,020
In which case we would have to adjust the normal maps accordingly.

140
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,690
Okay so it's Challenge time.

141
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,460
I'd like you to think about which technique would you use.

142
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:49,390
So looking at the various normal mapping options which ones would you use in your scene and why now

143
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,840
there's a hint here you can use any of them.

144
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,760
So why is the important part.

145
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,700
Share your ideas in the discussions.

146
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,420
Pause video now and give that a go.

147
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,450
OK guys welcome back.

148
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,990
So which technique would I use.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,040
There is no right or wrong here.

150
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,590
As with most things in blender Now I will be using tangent space for the majority of my models.

151
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,980
And the reason for that is I am still prototyping a want to reuse maps where ever possible cross my

152
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,650
model.

153
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,100
I don't want to have to create unique ones every time for every individual model.

154
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,630
Now if I had a unique item that I knew that there was absolutely no chance.

155
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,920
I may also use an object space.

156
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,000
Normal map for instance.

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,830
I suppose if I produced a lectern or something like that I may use an object space for that but everything

158
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,250
else.

159
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,900
I think I'm going to end up using tangent space for what did you come up with.

160
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,300
Did you share your ideas in the discussions I hope you did.

161
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,420
I look forward to reading them and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
