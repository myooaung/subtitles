Hello everybody.
1

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.790
So we're talking about larger projects now the first thing to think about larger projects is they require
2

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.740
some forward thinking we need to think about what we need to do, where we need to place things what we
3

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.810
need in order to make this project work.
4

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.510
So you will need to create a folder structure we will need to go ahead and grab some reference material.
5

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.170
There are lots of things that we're going to have to do when it comes to a larger project and whether
6

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.790
or not you're following along with me right now or in the future.
7

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.590
Managing a larger project then is this is going to be crucial to planning out what you're going to do
8

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.600
proper planning and preparation prevents poor performance.
9

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.020
I've missed one of those words there.
10

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.680
So being prepared also to change as the project becomes clearer.
11

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.740
This is one of these key things where you don't want to be absolutely rigid with how you decide to manage
12

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.650
a project.
13

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.980
Now you may come up with a hierarchy system that works and then you decide to import your assets into
14

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.970
a game and that game engine may require a different hierarchy to work properly or you may work with
15

16
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.000
a team and suddenly your hierarchy needs to change again.
16

17
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.560
It's entirely possible for that to happen so you've always got to be open to change or as you're developing
17

18
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.120
the project you suddenly realize that things need to be in a slightly different place and we're not
18

19
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.240
just talking about like a chess set here where we've got distinct parts.
19

20
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.880
It could be one object that has many components as well.
20

21
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.430
So what do we need to do.
21

22
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.360
Well let's think about it.
22

23
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.370
The first and foremost is the models.
23

24
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.490
So we're going to have the pieces.
24

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.640
So we've got the pawns, the rook, the knight, the bishop, king and queen.
25

26
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.140
So we've got six pieces.
26

27
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.960
So there are going to be six models at least seven.
27

28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.940
We've got the board and there may be an environment that we place it in.
28

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.080
Now I wouldn't go over the top and say you need to model a coffee shop or a room of sorts but maybe
29

30
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.170
a table for the board to sit on or perhaps put it in a nice environment so that you can show off your
30

31
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.080
model, It's not great or that inspiring to see models that are just floating in empty space.
31

32
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.950
It makes far more sense if you can present them in such a way that entices people to look at them.
32

33
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.980
Then of course we're talking about the textures involved in this section as well.
33

34
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.130
So we've got the board the pieces and potentially the environments as well.
34

35
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.390
And when it comes to textures we may share textures across multiple places.
35

36
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.560
So we may use the same texture that's on the board on perhaps one of the other pieces if it suits and
36

37
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.480
of course here thinking about those pieces you do have to bear in mind that you could go a step above
37

38
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.500
the minimum 6 and make 12 so that each side has their own distinct look I'm not going to do that but
38

39
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.600
I do challenge the more advanced of you to go ahead and give that to go as well.
39

40
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.320
So your challenge for this lecture go ahead and make a folder ready to store your chess set in, consider
40

41
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.000
a hierarchy that makes sense to you.
41

42
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.840
We'll try a few things as we go.
42

43
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.330
And finally my way is not the way of doing it.
43

44
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.510
I will be showing you a way of doing it.
44

45
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.710
If you've got a system that makes sense to you then just go along with that and make sure you're just
45

46
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.310
aware of where things are and they'll be in a different place than I'm showing on the videos. Pause the video
46

47
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.630
now and give that's a go. Okay everybody, Welcome back.
47

48
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.380
Let's go ahead now.
48

49
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.240
I'm on Windows I'm going to hop over to file explorer and sort out my hierarchy.
49

50
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.110
Okay so here we are now.
50

51
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.800
I've already grouped my stuff in sections so I have Section 1 Section 2 Section 3 and section 4.
51

52
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.410
So I'm going to go into Section 4.
52

53
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.360
So that's how I'm organizing this because I'm organizing it based upon teaching you guys through a course
53

54
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.880
you may choose to organize things differently if you are modelling something.
54

55
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.190
I'm gonna right click and go to New Folder and that new folder is gonna be called chess set.
55

56
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.460
You can call yours whatever you like inside that chess set.
56

57
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.620
We've got to think of what's folders what system we can have now.
57

58
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.150
Could we have everything flat.
58

59
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.530
I think they'll get messy.
59

60
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.700
We've got at least six pieces and then textures.
60

61
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.340
And it might not be apparent on what those textures apply to so I want to separate out certainly the
61

62
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.660
pieces themselves so pieces from textures.
62

63
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.750
So we'll put those two things in.
63

64
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.020
So we've got pieces and textures and thinking about it.
64

65
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.280
Would you call the board a piece.
65

66
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.090
I wouldn't.
66

67
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.120
I'd call it a model we use the term models earlier and since there are six pieces and the board and
67

68
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.820
potentially one other thing I think seven things in one folder is absolutely fine we don't need to split
68

69
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.720
that out it's also going to call that models instead.
69

70
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.430
So I've got models and textures,  I'm prepared to change that later on if we need to.
70

71
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.410
But I think that's a good starting point for this particular project.
71

72
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.390
What did you guys do.
72

73
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.060
Did you come up to a similar solution to myself here or have you done something different if you have
73

74
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.160
done something different.
74

75
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.440
I'd love to find out why and where you're going with that's how you are organizing your work.
75

76
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.160
Please do share over in the discussions and I'll see you all over in the next lecture.
