Congratulations everybody and well done for completing Section 2. 
1

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,080
You're now able to make some really basic models and I suggest you put those skills to the test and
2

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,350
do a couple of other models as well whether it's from your favourite film, a book from your imagination
3

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,070
or just something you've got in front of your desk.
4

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,760
It's entirely up to you but I do suggest you just practice the skills a little more before you move
5

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,800
on with the course.
6

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,010
And once you've done that we'll be learning some additional modelling techniques in the next section
7

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,950
and before long we start texturing and animating too.
8

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,370
So there's lots of exciting things coming up.
9

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,550
So please share your work that you've done so far over on the discussions and really looking forward
10

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,680
to seeing what you've made.
11

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,400
And if you're revisiting this after being a bit more skilled up and you're going through the course
12

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,310
with 2.8 then please do share what you've created as well to really inspire the students that are just
13

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,360
beginning their journey.
14

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,370
I'd love to see what you've created with a bit more skill and a bit more time put into your craft.
15

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,380
Looking forward to the next section where I'll see you there where we all hop on over into blender.
16

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:04,920
Take care.
17

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,370
See you there.
