00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,420
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,010
In this lecture we're going to create our lampshade and we're going to use curves again and you will

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,450
find that the process that we're about to use is very familiar because we've used curves before to make

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,160
the base.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,340
But this time we're going to use them in a slightly different way and you'll see how you're able to

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,610
not only make this particular part of the lamp but you may also be able to make other detailing that

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,280
would be very useful for this type of object.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,530
Let's find out more.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,750
Okay everybody so what we are going to use here is the modifier.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,610
So let's go to the modifiers tab and we're going to be generating so the second column and we're going

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,090
to be using the screw modifier.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,350
Now the moment you do that you'll notice that we end up with a very horrible looking mesh.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,170
And what you're seeing here is the cube being spun or screwed around its own origin.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:01,970
Now what we can do is either give it an access object much like we can give a mirror a mirror object

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,640
or we can simply go into edit mode and just move the cube out slightly so it's not going to intersect

16
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,120
as it goes through and we can see as we play with some of these options the effect it has.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,410
So let's just make this a little wider so we can read everything the axis.

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,080
Well that's switch access is going to be screwed around.

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,580
So we've got a couple of different choices here.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,550
And you can see we get different results depending on how it's happening.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,230
Let's go back to Z for the moment and we'll have a look at some of the other options.

22
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,060
The angle.

23
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,900
Well what happens if we change that.

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,890
Well then it doesn't become a complete screw all the way around or maybe several screws going round.

25
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,610
It's entirely up to you how you do that.

26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,610
Now typically it'll be a 360 doesn't have to be and then you can use the iterations later on to just

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,770
repeat that.

28
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,860
So for instance this cube is two meters tall.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,040
So if we set the screw at two meters then by the time it's completed one whole revolution it will be

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,920
bang on top of itself which it pretty much is.

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,490
Now we can adjust the ever so slightly so it looks nice let's say from the side or the front.

32
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,120
That's looking pretty good.

33
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,790
And then we can just up the iterations and it will just repeat that consistently going up.

34
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,350
Now what does this remind you of.

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,370
Well hopefully it reminds you of some fun the helter skelter or perhaps a car park.

36
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,970
Some of them have or suddenly I had a toy car park when I was little it was like rats but also a spring.

37
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,380
This would be a useful model for our lamp.

38
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,270
Often the type that we're designing to have springs in them.

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,710
Let's just make this a little bit simpler again.

40
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,770
And I'm going to set the screw high back down to zero.

41
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,660
So basically creates a circle.

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,470
Now the next thing we can change here is the steps.

43
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,790
Now let's just this render steps and steps if I position my camera.

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,430
There we go.

45
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,360
And zoom out ever so slightly.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,340
Or rather just pull the camera back.

47
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,900
There we go.

48
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,540
If we adjust the steps that say we adjust this down to five steps we'll end up with a messy pentacle.

49
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,940
Let's see if we can do six.

50
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,410
Yes six looks better.

51
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,490
So we've got six steps running around here.

52
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,510
But if we render it it will look like it's got more.

53
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,630
And it has because the render steps is set at 16.

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,010
We have an option here for smooth shading.

55
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,500
It's entirely up to you whether you go for that or not.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,970
And it will depend on the type of object you're modelling merging vertices that can be incredibly useful

57
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,670
but you can see here if you do merge vertices your screw offset must be zero.

58
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,300
So that's what we were playing with at the top here when we've got the option to adjust the screw offset

59
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,490
that has to be zero to merge vertices and that just makes it a much cleaner mesh.

60
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:56,600
If we were to solidify this when we clicked apply now object screws currently grayed out because we

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,300
don't have an object that was screwing around.

62
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,360
But that basically means we can venue something like an empty much like he would do with the mirror

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,250
modify to change the objects offset as you lift up and down so you can change this using an empty which

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:18,260
is useful if you want to have a spring stretching and closing rather than just setting it manually like

65
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,640
this.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,360
And I've already covered the iterations on there.

67
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,370
So brilliant.

68
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,130
There's lots to be done then that's really useful.

69
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,680
But how does it work with curves.

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,840
Well it works almost the same.

71
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,510
So we've got our curve laid down here.

72
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,240
Let's have a look now at the moment.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,920
If we rotated this around its origin it would look a tiny bit silly but let's have a look down on it.

74
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,400
Let's go into edit mode because we want to leave the origin where it is and let's say we put that there

75
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,630
and left this part of the handle up slightly.

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,080
Oh sorry.

77
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,650
The control point and then move the handle down to something like that.

78
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,540
Okay.

79
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,800
So in this curve we've got a lot of information as we know when we made the base.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,660
Now do we need that much information.

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,730
Well let's go into our curve data and lower the resolution of the curve.

82
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:13,730
Now ASP at 1 It's just a straight line and at some point we will lose the amounts of data that we need

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,890
to convey that line and it looks like it's five or six.

84
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,740
So I'll leave it like that.

85
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:26,750
Now let's go ahead to our modifiers and add in the modifier that's the screw modifier OK that looks

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,420
not very good but we can see it starts and ends exactly where the curve data is.

87
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,250
So how about the X if we look at this and we've kind of set it up to rotate around the x axis.

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,090
So let's try but look at that we've got a lamp coming together.

89
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,410
Now look at this edge.

90
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,710
It's pretty jagged.

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,800
Maybe we can increase the steps.

92
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,480
Maybe we don't want to do that.

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,410
You could also lower the number of steps and then add in a subdivision surface modifier and increase

94
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,410
it that way.

95
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,650
There are many ways that you can go ahead making your model look better.

96
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,960
There's no right or wrong here.

97
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,670
But do keep an eye out.

98
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,810
If you've got your objects selected.

99
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,410
See we've got 5000 triangles here.

100
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,930
If we have it set that high.

101
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,350
So from one subdivision it's 320 1002.

102
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,400
Oh blimey it goes up so so quick.

103
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,790
But if we turn that down again or even turn it off and then just say increase the steps to 32 looks

104
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,240
pretty smooth now.

105
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:33,580
And we're at 320 without adding any extra information along here.

106
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,540
That's the curve resolution if we then for a little bit jacket.

107
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,910
On this side we can just increase that independently.

108
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,450
And that's basically changing the overall topology of our model if we put it into wireframe we can see

109
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,040
exactly what's going on here as we increase and decrease.

110
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,060
And of course as we talked about earlier we want to try and make this is balanced as possible rather

111
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,420
than having large you know large changes in the surface of our geometry like that.

112
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,920
So looks like perhaps around six makes all of these nice and uniform also.

113
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,690
So with that comes your challenge okay.

114
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,460
So this is going to be a relatively straightforward challenge because I simply want you to create your

115
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,720
lampshade using the screw modifier.

116
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,130
Now one of the things that I'll say at this point in time is there's no need to add a bone yet or link

117
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,270
it to the armature in any way because we're not quite at the stage.

118
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,970
There are a couple further modifiers that we're going to use to finish off the geometry of our lampshade

119
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,270
first and then come back and we'll rig it later.

120
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,170
And then finally I'd like you to add some materials to your model so far so I know certainly my lower

121
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,060
arm and my upper arm that have any materials applied.

122
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,430
And of course this lamp I'm going to think I think I'm going to make it match the base itself.

123
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:59,720
So go ahead pause video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

124
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:07,320
As hop on over into blender and create a lampshade Okay so this is where we left off with our lamp before

125
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:14,410
let's go ahead and get a view from the side turn on my overlays at the top here and we'll come out into

126
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,530
object mode.

127
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,640
Tape brilliant.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,230
Let's add in a curve a busier curve.

129
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm just going to move it to an appropriate location.

130
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,550
I'm going to go into edit mode rotate it.

131
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,120
I think it's gonna be on the x axis.

132
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,030
The y axis.

133
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,770
Yes.

134
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,360
K Well that's pretty big.

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,590
Let's go in a rotate.

136
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,010
Bring it round.

137
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,290
I'm just gonna scale it in for the moment.

138
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,570
Bearing in mind we're within edit mode so that's absolutely fine.

139
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,760
Now where the origin is is kind of important.

140
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,990
It's going to dictate where things are moved when we end up using the screw modifier.

141
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,320
Okay.

142
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,060
Let's go to our modifiers.

143
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,690
We're generating new geometry and let's go to the screw modifier.

144
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,150
Oh that's not what we want.

145
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,720
Let's try a different axis.

146
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,030
No that's not what we want.

147
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,310
Well let's try y.

148
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,110
Boom.

149
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,900
Look at that.

150
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,200
That's an almost perfect lampshade without doing anything.

151
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,980
Popham it's in the wrong place.

152
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,730
Because if we just move the data's here it's going to move.

153
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,920
That's why we need to come out and just place it in roughly the right location.

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,190
Looks like we're going to have to build up a joint here of some description but that's okay.

155
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,030
We can do that in a bit.

156
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,860
But before we do anything else let's have a look at the detail here compared to the base.

157
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,770
Now we've got this really low poly middle section which could just be metal arms.

158
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,550
You know it's very straightforward to make those into something that looks pretty reasonable for that

159
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,290
but this base and this this low poly ring around there is not undercuts sets.

160
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,650
So there are a couple of ways of obviously sorting this out.

161
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,360
We can add in a subdivision surface modifier.

162
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,780
We've played with that before what happens if we do that.

163
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes it's moved out quite nicely.

164
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,100
Of course we've got these two settings here render and viewport so we can just add that in.

165
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,820
That's entirely up to you.

166
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,110
And we can go back to the screw modifier and lower this down perhaps eight steps.

167
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,220
Now obviously gets a bit smaller when you do that.

168
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:18,030
So that's something to bear in mind but 16 steps produces on this particular item we can have a look

169
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,760
down here.

170
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,330
Seventeen thousand triangles.

171
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:27,720
That's a lots of information although there's also the curve resolution here that we can bring down

172
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,660
as well so we can have a look at this from the side.

173
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,360
Have a look at the curve resolution and perhaps bump that out to get the rough curve that we want in

174
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,260
here maybe five.

175
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,310
Well we start to lose detail very quickly so let's come back three's too low.

176
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,090
Five or six.

177
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,410
I want to go for six there.

178
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,610
We're down already to 8000.

179
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,010
But then we've got to think we've got this balance here between what the modifiers are doing.

180
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,480
So let's say eight steps.

181
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,660
They're still pretty smooth and little bits of Jack goodness around the edge.

182
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,910
But we've lowered it down.

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,960
All we can do the subdivision surface modifier.

184
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,600
It's a tough choice which when we want to go for I'm going to set this up at 32 six relatives relatively

185
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,360
smooth anyway and it's down to 5000 triangles or five thousand eight hundred.

186
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,270
Now that may seem an awful lot for this amount of geometry here but this is absolutely fine.

187
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,770
At this particular model if this was a model that was sat far far away in the scene.

188
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,030
But yes you would want it a lot lower than that.

189
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,100
However this is our main character.

190
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,310
So having them relatively high resolution absolutely fine.

191
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,740
Right.

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,750
I'm pretty happy with how that's worked out.

193
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,050
Going to save my work that perfect.

194
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,690
Let's have a look at what it looks like.

195
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,860
Haven't switched it out into.

196
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,990
Look Dev mode for a while.

197
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,510
I think what we can really do here to bring this whole thing together here is a sign our materials as

198
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,400
well because that is part of the challenge.

199
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,860
So let's go ahead.

200
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,800
Let's pick the lamp base here.

201
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,740
Interesting.

202
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,760
So I'm going to call this lamp paints instead.

203
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,890
And then we've got this arm here which we can do lamps them on.

204
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,000
And this one here as well excellent.

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,090
So now these all have the same color to them.

206
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:30,420
It's much easier to see can turn off my overlays here and then I can have a look around my model case.

207
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,970
There's a few details to sort out here but that is looking pretty good now.

208
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:44,020
I think yes I do want this here to be larger all about proportions and all that is only slightly larger.

209
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,870
I'm going to make sure I apply my scale.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,970
We can just make sure that it is applied by opening up the side bar properties there and then just save

211
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,200
my work.

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,000
What does it look like in or in cycles that looks pretty much the same.

213
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,770
There we go.

214
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,610
And as they look there for the moment and work there SAVE MY WORK.

215
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,500
LET'S SEE HOW YOU GUYS ARE GETTING ON please show your work over in the discussions and I'll see you

216
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,030
all in the next lecture.
