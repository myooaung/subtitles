00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.390
Welcome to the diffuse smap.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.450
In this video you'll create a hand painted texture in the movie image editor and apply it to your models.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.810
Now we've already created an image in the U.S. image editor.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.270
That was great fun playing with those settings.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.410
And now we're going to put those skills to the test that we can actually use on our models.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.340
We'll be creating the diffused map from scratch.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.400
And we'll also be explaining what the diffuse map does.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120
So before we continue let's start with that last point.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.650
What is a diffuse map.

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.780
Well it is the most common map and it's the one most people think of when you say texture.

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.890
It defines the colours and patterns on a surface.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.060
Now of course what we could do is build up a loaded geometry and then paint those little bits of geometry

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.260
different colours assign different materials to different faces and build it up that way.

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.940
So in a way a diffused map is a baking of detail that would be too arduous to do.

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.210
In fact we can get away with just painting it ourselves in many cases and we move onto more baking in

16
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.530
a few moments.

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.070
So diffused maps in general way they can be challenging to imagine a surface without a light source

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.830
or rather with a uniform light obviously without a light source would be completely pitch black.

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.840
So you often end up with quite bland looking textures.

20
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.500
Now that isn't a problem because we're going to make sure that the contrast is going to come from a

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.200
light source rather than baking it in to our diffuse map.

22
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.680
We're going to avoid creating detail that would usually be generated by bumps on the surface for instance

23
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.740
which means we're going to avoid painting shadows too.

24
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.610
That also means painting light in if we do that and I've said this word a couple of times.

25
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.480
This is called baking into the image.

26
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.760
And we do have to be careful that we dont do that.

27
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.060
If you go ahead and paint shadows and light into our diffuse map that can be great it can be a great

28
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.310
optimization.

29
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.880
However if you plan on changing the lighting in your scene this can cause some discontinuity with the

30
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.960
scene its in to the point that it looks out right.

31
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.620
Wrong because the shadows wont align with where they should be.

32
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.240
How we can use other types of maps specifically normal maps and displacement maps to control the way

33
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.990
that the lighting happens on the surface of our geometry.

34
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.970
Now we're not going to deal with that at the moment.

35
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.480
However we will touch upon those in a few lectures time.

36
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.850
So now let's go ahead and play with a few snaps and hop on over into blender.

37
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.290
Okay so we're back over in blender and the first thing I'm going to do is go work on a basic model and

38
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.700
the best one here is the wall piece that we've been working on.

39
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.310
Now I want to use the existing texture we've got as a kind of a reference for my block work it means

40
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.850
that we can almost apply it straight away to our model without needing to worry how we've got to make

41
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.400
a few tweaks first.

42
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.170
So one of the first things I've noticed and I'm going to have to change this in all my other files that

43
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.910
I have currently saved is that I am leaving the textures packed into the blend file and that's that

44
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.780
might cause me some problems later on when I think they're not packed and they in fact are.

45
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.330
So in this case I'm going to just go to file and external date I'm going to turn off the automatically

46
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.310
pack into blend and then I'm going to save the file also.

47
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.620
Don't forget that I'm going to unpack this image by clicking on the image.

48
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.060
Head to head at this box with a file in it that shows that it's packed clicked at.

49
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.710
Unpack do that.

50
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.190
And I'm going to use the file in original location and that should be absolutely fine use file and that's

51
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.520
fine.

52
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.260
We can go and check the Properties panel now and make sure it's linked to the right place.

53
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.120
That looks absolutely fine to me.

54
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.940
If I click on it I can see it's linked in the right places.

55
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.160
Not really much space there if I expand that we can see that it is there.

56
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.320
Until I run out of space completely anyway.

57
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.290
So now I've got that before I go and overwrite on this image.

58
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.710
I'm going to have to make sure I save a copy and I'm going to call this one.

59
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.190
Well I don't need it in my section assets so I need that in my texture's folder and I notice here it's

60
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.940
called a tiff.

61
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:42.540
Now I do prefer PND where possible so I'm going to call this church block work and on the left hand

62
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.810
side I'm going to make sure that I switch the savours image where the operator panel would usually be

63
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.640
over here.

64
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.200
I'm going to save it as a p n gene and do I need any compression.

65
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.140
A PRNG is lossless.

66
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.870
I don't think that's going to make too much difference.

67
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.590
Quite honest colour that I am going to go for 16 however and I'm not sure whether I am gonna include

68
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.980
our 4 channel.

69
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.320
So at this point in time with a warm texture Now I'm not going to include an out for Channel.

70
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.860
Some leave it as R G B.

71
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.630
Kate so that's fine.

72
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.100
I'm going to save as image.

73
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.200
That's great.

74
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.590
Can we pick it up from here yet.

75
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.350
No we can't say I'm going to go ahead and open up the image we've just save because that is important

76
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.440
and I will want to start working on the wrong image.

77
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.390
I'm going to go into texture's church block work.

78
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.230
There we go.

79
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.570
Well of course it will look exactly the same but the name will have changed down here and if we open

80
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.390
up the properties window we can see that ends in works.

81
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.890
There we go.

82
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.780
Church block work work.

83
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.300
Looks like I've typed block in twice.

84
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.280
Never mind I can deal with that later.

85
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.970
Okay so now we have that loaded in we can use it as a base to start working with.

86
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.950
But before we do anything else I just need to make sure that the actual texture is being applied over

87
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.240
in the 3D editor so I can see what happens as I update it.

88
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.380
Something will go down to the materials properties down here and because I've already loaded the church

89
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.540
block work.

90
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.450
I can select it there and that switch that one over.

91
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.900
And of course if I wanted it in the blender render I would also need to first of all not use nodes go

92
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.720
over to my texture's and switch it out down here scroll down.

93
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.030
Currently the cinder block.

94
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.020
We changed that over to the church block block.

95
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.770
I like that name up.

96
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.850
I think I'll keep it.

97
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.820
OK so now that we've done that we can go in and I'm just going to get rid of my 3D view for the moment

98
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.470
and just have a closer look at this.

99
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.850
I can use this to basically paint oversoul I've got a right scale.

100
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.760
I'm happy with my blockwork scale as it is at the moment so essentially this I'm not happy with this

101
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.600
particular texture.

102
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.700
It's a great place holder to make sure that the scale in everything else comes out about right.

103
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.580
Something to open up my tool shelf.

104
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.210
Go into painting mode so I can start doing something now before we do anything else.

105
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.210
This texture that we've got at the moment is a tiled texture.

106
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:18.450
Okay so we want to make sure that anything we do is also tiled and that is a real help especially if

107
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.280
we're putting lots of these together.

108
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:28.550
If we produce the image and it's untitled or not tiled we will end up with visible shifts in the texture

109
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.930
as it goes from one piece to another and we want to avoid that where possible because the moment we

110
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.480
introduce that it would look rubbish so we need to make sure they're tyred because we're going to have

111
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.200
them next to each other.

112
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:49.450
Lots Now over on the tool shelf of a bottom one by default is tiling and if we turn on x and y it means

113
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:54.310
that if we go off of one side of the image we come straight back onto the other.

114
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.420
Pretty effective and we can also from the top and bottom also do the same.

115
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.350
Pretty powerful.

116
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.120
Now if you want to see what this texture is looking like tiled that can be pretty difficult when it's

117
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:13.040
just a single image in the Properties window we can actually turn on tiling.

118
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.910
So down here under this splice out and get rid of the game properties under display they've got coordinates

119
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.630
and repeat.

120
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.260
If we put a tick in that box we can see it repeating.

121
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.180
The problem with this is we don't know where the edge of the image is anymore because this is a tile

122
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.820
texture is going to look pretty seamless so we can flick in and out of that to see how it's looking

123
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.410
in general as well.

124
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:41.830
Now this graffiti that are placed on the wall I'm going to undo for the moment and then I'm going to

125
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.520
close the properties panel.

126
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.470
I actually want it so I dont see the repeat and I can start painting.

127
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:54.320
Now one of the great things with painting obviously by hand you can get a lot of detail in.

128
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.950
However this is a wall so we may want to it depends on the type of wall you go for if you go in for

129
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.290
a bit more jagged blockwork you probably won't need straight lines but if you do want straight straight

130
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.790
lines you're going to have to select a different paint stroke.

131
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.630
So we go down in the tool shelf itself.

132
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.480
We can see paint stroke if we open that up.

133
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:21.910
We've got a stroke method and dropping down here we've got a series of options now the common ones that

134
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.980
I would use are space occasionally dots and definitely line.

135
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.790
The great thing about line is we can click and drag and we get a reasonably straight line.

136
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.870
The reason why it's bumped up over the top there and down here is because when we went from one side

137
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:43.080
to the other we actually went on to the other part of the image as you can see as I went down here.

138
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.330
I went onto the top of the next bit which would have been down here or indeed in this corner down here.

139
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.520
So that can be quite confusing at first when you're working with a tiled image.

140
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.270
But now when we put all of these bits together they will be seamless which is very powerful.

141
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.020
Let's just turn the repeat on and we can see that it is pretty seamless.

142
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.840
Now depending on how much detail you've got and how often it's repeated you kind of get that look and

143
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.840
feel especially from a distance that it is a repeated texture over and over.

144
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.060
The big ones here are these darker textures as we have a look at it.

145
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.750
We can see the repeating two blocks here here here here here etc..

146
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.660
And that really does stand out on my model.

147
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:28.720
So what I'm going to try and do is make sure that's essentially my brick work is a little more bland

148
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.010
than this one.

149
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:34.310
And then it sounds an odd thing to do but it's going to make it a bit more uniform the shapes.

150
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:40.480
However I can make a bit differently and make it a bit more exciting than the squares I think I'm going

151
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.410
to go for a more of an authentic kind of stone type look but I'm going to paint it and see what effects

152
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.290
I can do.

153
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.710
And of course with that I've got a challenge for you guys.

154
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.270
I would like you to paint they basic tile texture.

155
00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:01.800
So start with the wall as it is the simplest piece that we have hand paint a new texture.

156
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:07.770
Now you can use the a reference image that we've got underneath and base based upon that.

157
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:13.330
Or of course you can do any other type of texture that you would like but still have that reference

158
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:18.610
image underneath because if we align it with that then we know it's going to work across our model without

159
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.060
scaling or manipulating our current TV maps.

160
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:28.570
If you do do something that's that much different you may have to adjust your you v map or create a

161
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.700
new one to match up with your texture.

162
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:37.690
Do make sure that the texture is tiled and avoid baking in highlights or shadows.

163
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.560
That is important will deal with those later on.

164
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.560
So Boser video now and give that a go.

165
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.450
Okay guys.

166
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.370
Welcome back.

167
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.970
Let's hop back on over into blender and paint a basic tile texture.

168
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.560
Okay so in front of us we have the wall textures.

169
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.950
I'm going to base upon.

170
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.420
I'm just going to see here if I can undo some of those changes brilliant I can.

171
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.170
Now I'm going to go for a slightly different colour going over the top of all this.

172
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.960
First of all I'm just going to block out my lines.

173
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:16.000
So I'm I've got tiling turned on got a line on there and if we move the cursor over I'm going to use

174
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.430
a mixture of my cursor and my iPad in front of me here.

175
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.610
Now we can see that that is just too big for a line that's going to look ridiculous.

176
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:30.720
I also need to turn up the strength initially otherwise is going to not do the job.

177
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.450
So I don't know quite how wide are my radius needs to be.

178
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:40.150
So let's go ahead and work it down to two and see what it's going to be about five.

179
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:45.120
By the looks of things and that could increase the strength undo those other ones that have just bought

180
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.450
on for testing.

181
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.040
And I'm going to actually use my mouse for this one.

182
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.760
Yeah that's absolutely fine.

183
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:59.290
So at the moment this is quite a fun task as you can probably see this drawing lines across the screen.

184
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.350
I'm going to go too far because if I get that wrong it will look horrible.

185
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.370
The other side as well.

186
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.900
So let's just make sure it's time.

187
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.240
But it's also lined up.

188
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.750
If we can avoid putting bumps on the side that be great.

189
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:22.670
Okay so what you do need to be careful is the very edge is very very easy to forget about the edges

190
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.450
like the top edge and the bottom edge.

191
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.000
Otherwise you end up with mega blocks without a line under them.

192
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.710
So I'm going to going to put a line there and you can see that would get a faint one on the bottom as

193
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.960
well.

194
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.300
And the same is true of these vertical lines.

195
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.820
So I'm going to paint these vertical lines and I'll see you back guys back in a few moments.

196
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.730
Okay.

197
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.810
So I think I'm pretty happy with that.

198
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.580
Of course I'm going to quickly hop out and going to repeat and just make sure that's repeating quite

199
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.080
well.

200
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:51.660
Okay.

201
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.210
I'm happy with that but so I'm going to come out of there and what I'm going to do now is I'm going

202
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:05.490
to lower the strength to or about there I think I add a little palette and I'm going to call it stone

203
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.990
work for the moment because that is essentially what it is going to be.

204
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.020
So we've got a stonework there.

205
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.930
And now let's go in.

206
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.640
Or I don't know a kind of creamy colour that I quite like that creamy colour I don't have a reference

207
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:26.220
image on me at the moment to have a look at but I'm going to stick with that for the moment and if I

208
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.040
say for the moment once more you can highlight that for me now.

209
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:36.060
Is that going to be enough for some of the increase the Phil threshold to one.

210
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.480
Oh no no no no no need to be less than 1.

211
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.800
Go ahead and try that again.

212
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.880
That looks pretty good to me.

213
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.260
That's getting most of the detail.

214
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.880
I want in a.

215
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.930
That's a I don't know what's going on here why won't accept input on there.

216
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:55.910
It's quite odd.

217
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.170
I can go in and paint it.

218
00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.070
That's not a problem at all.

219
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:06.000
Of course this pixel size is quite small so I'm going to increase it now and keep the strength low and

220
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.920
going to make sure accumulate is turned off.

221
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.090
I want it to build up.

222
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.860
And what size of that brush.

223
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.810
That's pretty big.

224
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:22.000
I want to go over the image now and make the whole thing just a little bit faded.

225
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.470
I've got it online now.

226
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.520
Oh silly me I completely forgot I had it online.

227
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.390
That's why I wasn't moving this cursor around like a lonely search.

228
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.890
Of course you do need to change your brushstrokes I'm going to go back to space.

229
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:42.720
Now I should be able to go over the image and calls it these heavy lines to be a bit more faded and

230
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:48.320
now it's going to hit the F key and make this a bit smaller and do this area in here as well.

231
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.450
Okay so that gives me a rough idea of the guide.

232
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:58.710
I'm probably going to go over a couple more times and get this looking a bit better.

233
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:04.350
I'm not not going to go for the square fair I'm just going to use those as a basis and I will see you

234
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.770
guys back in a few moments.

235
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:17.460
But before I go what I will do here is I'm going to go into the colour picker and go and grab this mortal

236
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:17.720
line.

237
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.320
I like the colour of that and I'm going to add that is ever so slightly different.

238
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:27.210
But it will allow me to add the mortar kind of colour that I want into the model when necessary.

239
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.230
I see you guys back again in a few moments.

240
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.480
So I've done a bit of painting now and I just want to see how this texture is actually looking.

241
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:47.730
I've done the majority of the base sort of laraque and continue adding detail to this with the undulations

242
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.370
of the brickwork for instance.

243
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.450
But that's a good start for us.

244
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:56.070
Now I'm not using notes I'm guessing that's why I can't see my blockwork.

245
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.180
And there we go.

246
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.120
That is starting to look pretty good.

247
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.900
I think that's much better than the one we had but to begin with.

248
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:09.540
I'm not happy with some of the lines look a bit wobbly I'm not sure where that one is and I don't like

249
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:15.330
this one here so there's a few improvements that we can be done but that is coming along reasonably

250
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:24.780
well and is looking much more church like I suppose rather than knees or breeze block that we had before.

251
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.160
How are you guys getting on.

252
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.410
I hope you spent some time adding a bit more detail than I've got time for here.

253
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.500
Remember to share your brick work what have you come up with.

254
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.810
Have you gone full all of this creamy colour have you gone for a completely different style of block.

255
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.610
Have you gone for different shaped blocks more like some.

256
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:48.510
I can't think of like stone work where large stones are small stones or put together.

257
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:53.790
I'd love to see your results please post them in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next

258
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.450
lecture.
