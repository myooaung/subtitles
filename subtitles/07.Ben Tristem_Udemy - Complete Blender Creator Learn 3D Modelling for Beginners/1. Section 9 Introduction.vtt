Hey guys so I'm back in the video here because there's a bit of a change in the course.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.730
Now we have finished basically the main content of this blend of course the human hit is done.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.990
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.240
But when this course was born it was born over on Kickstarter and we made some additional promises.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.180
Now we didn't say they would all be in this cause but we did say we would cover decimation and destruction

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.390
and VFX.

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.400
This section is all about defamation and destruction I mean giving it to you all of these all you guys

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.840
for free.

9
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.710
So Mikey wills the section getting involved well as well as informed with the title we're going to start

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.880
blowing some stuff up seeing how we can actually actually destroy meshes breaking them apart.

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.640
That's great for things eroding like a sand statue or even literally just blowing something apart.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.710
We'd be playing with forcefield to sort of get objects attracting and bouncing off of one another.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.870
And also when it comes to defamation Now that's bending stuff obviously and things impacting indenting

14
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.750
in crumpling.

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.580
Great exciting things to do.

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.200
But computationally heavy but we'll get there.

17
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.590
So Lulu So that brings a whole new dimension to your blender because up to now things have been a little

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.170
bit either static or animated by hand by you.

19
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.880
Now you're letting the physics engine take over and come up with some really interesting things.

20
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.120
So that's correct of course.

21
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.140
I'll see you in there.
