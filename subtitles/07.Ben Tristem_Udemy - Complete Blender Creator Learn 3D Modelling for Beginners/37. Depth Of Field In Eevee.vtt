00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.250
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.730
In this lecture we're going to have a look at something called depth of field.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.090
It is often used to isolate a particular character or objects from its surroundings and background.

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.860
So we have a look at the scene in front of us here.

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.230
The background is definitely the white pieces and the focal points while we're looking smack bang at

6
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.040
our bishop it's right in front of us.

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.590
So the difference of applying depth of field can be quite dramatic as you can see here.

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.980
The bishop itself is fully in focus and this is the comparison from before.

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.840
Now some people like this fact some people don't if used well it can really make a change to a scene.

10
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.870
And I think it really does add a dramatic field to the scene and really does look like you're very close

11
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.800
to the object.

12
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.690
Now of course this can be refined and set up to be how you want it itself.

13
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.140
And this particular effect is a real world effect that happens with real cameras in cycles.

14
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.680
It will happen naturally you have to set anything up even however is a little more involved.

15
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.840
Let's hop into a blender and find out more.

16
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.570
OK so this is how our scene looks at the moment and there are several things to consider.

17
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.350
The first one being what you really need is a distinction between foreground and background.

18
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.510
If you don't have that everything's kind of flat like it is here.

19
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.220
Then adding depth of field is not going to make too much difference if there was something way behind

20
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.120
this particular chessboard or in front then adding depth fulfilled could be beneficial.

21
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.120
So let's go to a different camera view.

22
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.720
I think the camera near is gonna be the best one to work with on here.

23
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.860
Cisco control and zero and switch around to it.

24
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.950
And this is a great example with this perspective.

25
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.920
We've got the camera set up at 12 millimeters so it does look very wide angle of that particular setting

26
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.370
we can see here that the focal point really is that Bishop.

27
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.540
So what can we do here.

28
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.740
Well the first thing we can go ahead and do is turn on depth of field.

29
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.380
We scroll up on the properties panel we can see here we've got depth field as an option.

30
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.900
I would suggest leaving it just that's 100 pixels max size and shutting that down again.

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.120
Now in cycles you don't have to worry about setting it up.

32
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.700
If he forgets about it in evey you just won't see the effects happening.

33
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.960
Okay.

34
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.430
So the next thing we need to do once that's turned on is scroll back down and go to the camera properties.

35
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.140
Assuming of course you've still got your camera selected and at the moment I'm looking through the camera

36
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.210
near you go down to the camera properties we see that we've already played with the lens setting setting

37
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.670
different focal length.

38
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.050
We scroll down a little further we get this option depth of field.

39
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.190
If you click the little arrow to reveal the dropdown we first of all have a focus distance or a focus

40
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.900
on objects so you can focus on any of the objects in the scene.

41
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.450
Let's go ahead and use the eyedropper rather than this long list here because I'm not sure which Bishop

42
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.940
this is straight away.

43
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.170
We could use the eyedropper it's just here and there we go.

44
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.910
Bishop 1 black we can click on that and it sets that as the focus point the next setting is probably

45
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.260
the most critical.

46
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.070
It's the aperture now the aperture is the opening in a camera which lets light through the opening in

47
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.070
your eye for instance happens to be controlled by an IRS and the pupil size would be the aperture is

48
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.870
the hole that is letting the light in when the hole is small you can focus a very long distance so you

49
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.250
get a wider depth of field which means more of your image will be in focus and with a smaller number

50
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.860
less of it will be in focus.

51
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.960
So even though we've got the bishop selected if I was to set this as one everything goes blurry including

52
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.360
parts of the Bishop.

53
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.050
Now bear in mind because we've got the objects selected it won't be the surface nearest to us which

54
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.440
will be sharp and in focus it will be wherever the object is the middle of this object so we can control

55
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.390
that will learn more about controlling focus points later on for the moment we can just pick the object

56
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.270
itself.

57
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.590
So an f stop of one is too low for this particular scene.

58
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.610
Now depending on what scale you've made your model at these values will differ tremendously because

59
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.520
this is a very small scene.

60
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.080
Any changes because we're very close to this objects as well.

61
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.610
Any changes to the f stop will make dramatic changes to our scene if we change the scale of this make

62
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.840
let's make it a hundred times this scale then that will affect it as well.

63
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.960
In that case you will have to have a much lower f stop number to get the depth of field so that the

64
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.140
background is blurry.

65
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.640
For instance the next setting down is best controlled with Everything blurry so I can show you what's

66
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.150
going on with zero blades.

67
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.510
This is imitating a camera shutter the number of blades dictates the shape of the Boka or out of focus

68
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.500
areas.

69
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.040
So we're here we turn up the blades to one we can't do that the minimum number is three which makes

70
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.280
sense because that's the lowest polygon circle you can have and we can see that the Boka or the outer

71
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.290
focused areas look like triangles.

72
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.250
The rotation is also best experienced whilst it's at this setting you can see we've got the tweak as

73
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.700
to what angle at which the blurring happens.

74
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.280
Now you may want it low like this as an anesthetic especially if you're doing a more triangulated low

75
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.440
poly effect but I don't like that particular one I typically enjoy even five or six.

76
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.240
We shall be pentagons and hexagons accordingly.

77
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.550
So that's the sort of style I like in the rotation at that point really doesn't make a difference.

78
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.040
Well you may want it flat at the top in which case you would have to rotate it round ever so slightly

79
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.670
to around 27 20 30 degrees.

80
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.600
There we get the final one here the ratio is really to do with film making so if you were putting effects

81
00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:01.230
into a film anamorphic lens is something you use in the film industry for the ultra wide angle look

82
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.240
it's just a way of compacting it down onto the sensor correctly but we're never gonna play with that

83
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.620
today.

84
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.170
It basically wishes things.

85
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.460
Here's the simple answer that.

86
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.450
Right.

87
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:17.250
So now that we've played with these options here and how to set it up it's time for your challenge Okay

88
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.530
so your challenge is to set up depth of field with your nearest camera.

89
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.430
And of course once you've done that I want to see it.

90
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:31.170
So please render it out and share its Paul's video now and give us a go okay.

91
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.010
Everybody welcome back.

92
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.130
Let's go ahead now hop into blender and set up out there for field Okay so we're at this stage at the

93
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.100
moment but I'm gonna revert back to the very beginning so we can follow the whole process through.

94
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.850
The first one is to pick on nearest camera.

95
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.920
Easily done.

96
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.040
Control and zero will switch around to that camera.

97
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.940
The next day I'm going to do is pick my bishop as a focus point and I can see here is Bishop 1 black

98
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.310
as well just in case I wanted to search for it.

99
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.900
Instead let's scroll all the way down to the camera property something a select camera near.

100
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.700
And here we go.

101
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.040
The camera properties have automatically been selected because we were looking at the object properties

102
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.700
before.

103
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:17.990
I'm going to scroll down go to my depth for field and focus on an object and we know it's Bishop 1 black.

104
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.860
We can pick it straight away.

105
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.320
Didn't happen to be thinking about that but you could also just type in Bishop for instance and it will

106
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.070
also bring up those various objects aperture setting.

107
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.700
I'm going to set it down around 3 to begin with.

108
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.860
Now if you were actually into photography you may actually start thinking well I might use one point

109
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.680
two or one point eight or two point four or two because these are commonly numbers you would actually

110
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.300
see when you're actually dialing in the aperture settings on a camera.

111
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.350
If you're doing that that's absolutely fine.

112
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.370
You already know what you're doing if you're playing with the aperture settings on a camera.

113
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.860
Before I go any further of course I'm gonna turn it on.

114
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.330
So there we go it's turned on.

115
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
Otherwise I won't be able to see what's going on back here.

116
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.650
F stop.

117
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.520
We can go backwards and forwards a little here.

118
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.890
That's one of the things I love about this updating live in the viewport.

119
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:17.030
I mean even the goal I've got here is to make sure that my bishop is in focus but the background is

120
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:23.900
blurred out just enough so we know that the pieces if we go too far what we tend to find is that even

121
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.690
around the bishop itself it starts to gets a bit blurry which is essentially what would happen in real

122
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.340
life.

123
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.470
Okay so one point six is far too much.

124
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.380
Let's bring that up and down.

125
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.810
I'm gonna pixel peep here.

126
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:44.890
I'm going to look at the edge of my bishop itself and see when it starts to go blurry so it definite

127
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:51.280
these highlights are pushing through and blurring out but the edges still remaining pretty sharp.

128
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.660
But I really want them to still be chess pieces you can kind of see that sir a knight and these are

129
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.010
pawns but let's bring that down.

130
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.450
Or sorry.

131
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.230
Up a little bit further.

132
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.970
So about an f stop of around 8:00 is good.

133
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.350
The other thing to bear in mind is the blade does change the image significantly.

134
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.380
So I'm going to set it to six if it's a bit lower.

135
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.400
It's down at three.

136
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.890
Everything looks just a little bit more sharp but a bit more distorted as well because of it being such

137
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.090
a low number of blades.

138
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.600
Something set our back up to six.

139
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.270
I don't care about how it's focused I'm not going to see any of the Bowker detail and I think that looks

140
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.340
really good.

141
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.690
I really like that I'm gonna render that out as a test.

142
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.640
That's another thing to bear in mind at the moment we're working and look Dev mode a lot.

143
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.050
We switch over to render mode you get more of that realistic looking render that we have when we go

144
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.980
ahead and press F 12 to render.

145
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.050
That's why there is a significant difference there there's probably a few of you thinking this is a

146
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.720
much cooler image in terms of its color temperatures a lot blue much more neutral than this one which

147
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.670
is lovely and warm and that's the reason why we're just not looking at it in the rendered mode of course

148
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.630
you can do that is entirely up to you.

149
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.060
And there we go.

150
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.020
We've got art that the field well done.

151
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.270
How did you guys get on.

152
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:10.220
Did you rearrange your board perhaps so you've got different objects in focus did you focus on a different

153
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.590
piece perhaps a piece that you're really proud of due to the extra time you spent with it.

154
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.910
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
