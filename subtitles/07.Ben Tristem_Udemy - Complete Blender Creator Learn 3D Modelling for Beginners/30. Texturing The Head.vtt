00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.960
Welcome to text during the head in this video will make sure our scenes are actually in the right place.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.520
We put them on our model but we don't really know if they're in the right place.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.920
We start texturing we're going to connect our texture to the model itself because even though they're

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.940
kind of connected at the moment we won't be able to see what's going on and we have tests to make sure

5
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.010
it is working as expected.

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.830
Once we've plucked the texture into a model that's go ahead and hop straight on over into a blender.

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.660
Okay so in front of us we have you v mesh that we've been working on and let's bring up.

8
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.020
Well in fact on the change the outline I don't think I'm going to need it.

9
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.330
Famous last words of course to the 3-d view.

10
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.290
And let's scoot round and hit render in that viewport so we can see what's going on.

11
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.660
Now that looks okay for the moment.

12
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.930
We need a node editor up now.

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.820
Ahead a few smap after a star against sellers make sure I save that so save as image head a few smap

14
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.840
and I need to add that to my assets.

15
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.710
I'm gonna add it to my texture's head the first map.

16
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.980
There we go.

17
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.560
Now it is important that you save and I'll show you why in a few moments so first of all let's go ahead

18
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.280
and will.

19
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.620
Lots of things we can do here.

20
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.820
Let's open up the node editor.

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.310
First of all so we can see what's going on.

22
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.440
And let's find our diffuse input which is here.

23
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.600
And we need to go ahead and add in a texture to that and because it's you've even mapped and we've got

24
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.630
node Wrangler enabled in there add ons.

25
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.240
Okay so back over in blender there are a couple of things that I would want to do before getting on

26
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.610
texturing so we can see what's going on.

27
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.010
So first of all angara Changed my outline here to a 3D view image can make its tiny bit bigger.

28
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.370
So see what is going on.

29
00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.420
Excellent And so there's a 3D view and I'm going to pop it in rendered mode for the moment will switch

30
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.820
over to material mode as well just to see the difference between those two.

31
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.970
Now at the moment it won't show anything at all in rendered mode to do with this image because we've

32
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.050
not set any of that up.

33
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.330
And secondly we haven't saved our image someone is going to go ahead and save the image save us image.

34
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.550
Okay let's move this bit open and then go to the node editor that's whizzed down through the bottom.

35
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.040
Here we have art a few shader now.

36
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.480
The colour of that is going to be controlled by this texture.

37
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.400
Now because I have no Wrangler enabled I've lit she just go control and tea and that will add in the

38
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.200
necessary nodes for me and I can just move those across.

39
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.720
And because we've generated this texture in blender it should just be on this drop down here head diffuse

40
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.480
smap.

41
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.340
There we go.

42
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.830
We can see it's made the colour off the overall face I suppose and man made this orthographic.

43
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.890
Wow a difference perspective makes an orthographic huge difference.

44
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.260
Okay so let's leave it like that for the moment.

45
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.990
So we've got this now controlling the texture itself of the colour strip of the femur and is matched

46
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.260
with you visalus absolutely fine.

47
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.610
So we should be able to do now is hop on ovett in TO PAINT mode.

48
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.100
In either of these and start painting if I go ahead I need a different colour than black so you can

49
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.710
see it.

50
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.650
Now if I go ahead and paint in the U V Ed panel nothing changes here.

51
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.580
In fact if we isolate the diffuse map itself everything will go black because something that is a true

52
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.580
black doesn't reflect any light it absorbs all.

53
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.850
So that won't happen at all until we go ahead and I can't hear EF 3 Unfortunately on my Mac it won't

54
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.360
work.

55
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.890
But as soon as I go to save his image and save that image it will then show the actual text to change

56
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.110
that I have done.

57
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.770
Now that's a bit different.

58
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.570
If we're in material mode if we're in material modem with a hop out of edit mode as well so we can see

59
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.810
what's going on and then go in to paint texture paint.

60
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.090
We can actually all that is probably going to slow down.

61
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.920
Blender didn't mean to do that straightaway but basically if you go ahead and paint directly on your

62
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.180
model whilst in texture mode in the viewport itself we will see the changes occurring on the rest of

63
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.740
our model.

64
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.360
Once it's caught up then or whether you see the spinning wheel.

65
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.810
There we go.

66
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.950
For you V map itself has actually updated or rather the image has updated but it hasn't saved.

67
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.210
It works one way and not the other so if your painting in the view port it will update your image but

68
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.970
you do need to make sure you save your image.

69
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.220
If you don't save your image then you can end up what you will end up losing it.

70
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.510
And don't worry I have lost data that way too.

71
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.590
Everything link looks great with your model and then all of a sudden you reopen your file and you like

72
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.880
well where's my dick.

73
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.280
No I know I've done I've not bothered saving it.

74
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.870
Whoops.

75
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.740
Because everything looks right.

76
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.960
We do need to make sure you've saved your image songas going to get into the habit of saving my image.

77
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.230
You can of course pack the data into the blend far as our special use will if your giving the file to

78
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.760
other people to work on as well or even just to share that model with other people.

79
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.730
Remember to pack into the blend file otherwise they will get something that looks magento rather than

80
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.980
your actual wonderful texture that you've done so.

81
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.080
The final thing to go over in here is when actually painting it may be worthwhile turning down the malty

82
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.500
rows modifiers preview setting because then you're not having to render quite so many triangles and

83
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.090
the view poor be much more responsive for painting than it would be otherwise.

84
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.950
And we can see updating there now one of the things when you paint in the viewport is you will end up

85
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.230
with anything that's not facing the camera.

86
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.430
Anything that's beyond that 90 degrees you sometimes end up with this horrible black outline.

87
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.340
Well that's when you need to use the u v editor itself the U.S. image editor itself in order to paint

88
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.690
that detail on.

89
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.930
And of course providing you've remembered to save in the rendered mode and you can see that it hasn't

90
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.780
updated since the last render so are half up from the last save.

91
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.380
We can go in and save as image.

92
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.070
Once you've done that there we go we can see that one half of our model is now shaded a map or that

93
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.830
is actually pretty cool.

94
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.290
That's a bit of a side point there.

95
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.450
When you shade something like this you can create quite an artistic effect.

96
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.370
Not intended but that does look pretty awesome anyway.

97
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.090
So now it is time to give you guys a challenge.

98
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.280
I'd like you to go ahead and create your diffuse and gloss map.

99
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.690
So remember a diffused map is a map without any shadows.

100
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.140
It will look quite washed out and that is okay.

101
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.110
We will have colorin it of course.

102
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:12.670
Now use the same UV map for all your images so whether you're using it for a class map a normal map

103
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.340
or anything else you'll want to use the same you v map that we've already unwrapped.

104
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.660
Now looking at reference material to get this right is quite important.

105
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:31.750
Remember start off with a almost a block work colour model so the base colour and then start adding

106
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.300
in colour variations and you can even go down to Freckles.

107
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:42.670
If you want to to add that little bit of extra realism and have a look at where the skin is naturally

108
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.810
shiny that's very important very useful.

109
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.170
And of course above all else remember to save your images that is really important.

110
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.200
We don't want you losing your work.

111
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.230
As I said I've done it before and it's really frustrating.

112
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.570
Having opened up your file again to find that the image that you've spent a couple of hours working

113
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.150
on has gone or at least part of it has gone.

114
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.730
Okay so pause video now and give that a go.

115
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.270
Okay guys welcome back.

116
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.680
Let's go ahead and create are diffuse anger loss maps.

117
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.990
Okay so back over in blender here and one of the first things I'm going to do is just make sure we've

118
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:27.300
got a basically a default covering of our model.

119
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:34.440
So you've got something to work on and because I want the overall white I can go in here right now make

120
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.350
sure we've got white selected and then go ahead and paint in the necessary colour.

121
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:47.700
Now you may see the screen go a bit funny on the side here I've got myself my iPad plugged in so I can

122
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.970
literally just go in and scribble over the areas that I need coloured in.

123
00:08:53.010 --> 00:09:00.030
Okay so we've now got a white base mesh around our model and of course I've got to remember to go ahead

124
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.100
and save that image in the moment.

125
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.200
I save the image the rest of the screen showed up dates for us.

126
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.490
I'll just click in this window here.

127
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.120
And move it around.

128
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.670
I go in and out.

129
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.410
There we go.

130
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:22.080
So if that doesn't work for whatever reason come in and out of rendered mode as well will help you massively.

131
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.040
Now this is going to be the diffuse smap and it's certainly not going to be bright white.

132
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.970
It's going to be a slightly different colour.

133
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:36.350
So of course you can pick for colour that you want and then go ahead and colour it in how you want to

134
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.210
have your mesh coloured in.

135
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.320
And again don't be shy with just experimenting with how things look.

136
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.350
Of course any to go ahead and save that.

137
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.900
So go ahead and save that now go down the image.

138
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.870
Save as image and save as image again.

139
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.690
That's a refresher.

140
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:02.280
We've got her a nice base colorin here now I've got a few streaks but I'll go in and sort out those

141
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.290
in a bit.

142
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.290
One of my favourite tools brushes to use is either softer or smear to try and blend in different colours

143
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.280
especially when you go ahead and let's say.

144
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.070
Oh I don't know Pop.

145
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.780
I don't want to use it just yet.

146
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.240
Let's say I go in and create some bags under the eyes.

147
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.070
Now they're generally slightly pinkey so I can go in here.

148
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:33.300
Zoom into the eyes themselves here and let's say add this source of colour effects to one and the other.

149
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.160
And then once we've got these the colours in there we can scroll back up.

150
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:44.160
Go and use the smear tool for instance come in and just blend it around our model a bit more.

151
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.650
Now this is on point a low setting a strength of 30 percent a bit higher.

152
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.520
I can start moving this colour out and around our model.

153
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.620
Now you will have to obviously have a look at some real reference images.

154
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:04.650
I'm not doing that right at this moment so I'm going to go and grab some as I'm just demonstrating the

155
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.040
art of what I'm about to go off and do.

156
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.250
And I'll rejoin in a few moments.

157
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.410
So I've got basically a base map here so I'm going to go around now and start adding in the textual

158
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.320
variants across a the model itself.

159
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.910
Remember specifically looking at colour and not lighting information it's very easy to mix the two up

160
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.310
if we're not careful.

161
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.930
So the final thing I want to do here is actually switch over from rendered mode which chews up my computer's

162
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:40.030
processing power into material mode and then we can see what's actually going on life.

163
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.170
Now of course this isn't particularly bright at the moment.

164
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.070
That's not to worry.

165
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.840
We can also be in texture mode and we can also see what's going on.

166
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.540
I mean see of whopping great big line across the top.

167
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.430
Of course these are the scenes.

168
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.750
This is why you want to avoid.

169
00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:00.120
In fact the seams look like they're in a really nice place with they be hidden behind a hairline or

170
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.120
out of shots even better.

171
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.940
Hmm.

172
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.910
So here's our model looking pretty good now was we're here of course we can also use the smear tool

173
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:15.790
so I can go to this area here and make this look at least well try and make it look a little bit better.

174
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.820
And the same around the eyes here as well.

175
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:28.290
Now of course depending on how fast your computer is amongst other things you can up the preview count

176
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:33.040
as well if you want to do some more detailed textures on the surface of your model.

177
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:40.030
Anyway so I'm going to go off now and do some more texturing and I will see you guys back in a few moments.

178
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:49.460
Okay so playing about with a bit I've managed to get a basic map done and we can see the various areas

179
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.150
here that just make him a bit bigger.

180
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:57.630
So I've got some slight freckling on the fore head and over the bridge of the nose as well.

181
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.350
I could work on those a bit further to bring them out a little more but I'm happy with the subtle effect

182
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:09.890
that creates as well as I have hit F 12 and rent that out just to see what it's like in full rended

183
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.040
our Mugler bore you guys wait for that to all come out because I've got the spec map to do now the glossy

184
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.770
map and of course that's going to be a black and white image based upon this.

185
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:25.450
So the first thing to do of course is to make sure that we have saved any work we've done.

186
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:34.850
And then I'm going to literally just hit new and I'm going to call it head on Lossie.

187
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.680
And I'm going to make sure it is the same size so that when I hit.

188
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.910
Okay.

189
00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.790
There we go.

190
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.890
We're ready to go.

191
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.950
Obviously if I made it a different size I also have the scale that you've map accordingly.

192
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:59.540
So the next thing to know is where glossy areas are will be white and where not glossy is are will be

193
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.570
not white or black in this case.

194
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:10.900
Now of course it won't be a one or the other there will be a sort of a gloss fall off so it will go.

195
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.130
Well we just use the paint brush basically.

196
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.060
This one here will draw the areas white that need to be white.

197
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:24.810
And let's go in here set the hue and saturation to zero and the brightness all the value to one.

198
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:30.620
And then we can that she say with the fall head is going to be glossy and I can just build that up like

199
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.290
so.

200
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.600
And of course I can paint.

201
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.140
This is what this looking like.

202
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.420
By the way that's come out of some nice rough marks on it this coming out really well I'm really pleased

203
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:40.870
with it.

204
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.190
I leave it all to the eyes.

205
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.590
They're not looking right.

206
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.420
On this side for some reason I am in the middle but not around the edge I still think that the face

207
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.490
isn't forward enough on this right hand side of the eye anyway.

208
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:58.630
That's what you get when you play with your models you start to see things that are wrong quite often

209
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.870
no doubt how the bridge of the nose will also be shining.

210
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:06.880
So you start painting that and I'll do this in 3-d mode as well because we're about to do symmetry.

211
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.400
If you're in 3-d mode in your painting.

212
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.210
You can turn on the symmetry down at the bottom here on the tall shelf.

213
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.380
Very useful.

214
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:19.660
Of course I want to be able to see the map I'm working on some will go to slots and make sure that when

215
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.600
I'm here I'm not painting on ahead diffused in facts.

216
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:30.320
In this case I have to save my image because it has not been saved yet and still says available to lots.

217
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:30.790
Nothing.

218
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.410
And that is because in the node editing we've not plugged it into anything.

219
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.570
So you've got the layaways at the moment controlling what's glossy and what's not.

220
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.490
And this time we can go to a.

221
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.130
We just go control here no we can't unfortunately get control TV.

222
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.130
So I wanted to add an image.

223
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.130
Texture.

224
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.080
So the image texture.

225
00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:02.440
And of course for the rest of this is not going to be a nothing is going to be a nonkosher data and

226
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.790
that can come out of there.

227
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.850
Now the rest of this the facts are and everything can be taken directly from here.

228
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.790
I can't see everything at once.

229
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.520
They're a bit far away of that of there.

230
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.840
And that will be basically saying what is glossy and what is not.

231
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.610
And we can have a look specifically at the bloche shade.

232
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.610
We're not attached to anything just yet that's go ahead.

233
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:31.340
Head glossy so we can see where it's going to be glossy on here now by preview and this image here.

234
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.350
Of course if we preview one further down the line it'll look completely different.

235
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:41.590
But let's start working on this and I'll see you guys back in a few moments once I've covered in the

236
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.650
areas that I want to be glossy.

237
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.850
Okay so after playing around with a while I haven't finished off the years quite yet but this is what

238
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.770
my model is looking like.

239
00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.630
So I think it's time now to go out and save it.

240
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.880
First of all I have not done that.

241
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.620
Otherwise I won't be able to see it working and miss isn't fully on my screen.

242
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.470
There we go.

243
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.360
Okay so we need to savours image and save fat and we know it's in there and let's just have a quick

244
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.350
look at it on the rended moaned.

245
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:26.380
Cause I haven't previewed the right areas that go to my node editor and go to the final mix so we can

246
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:32.890
see where things are now excellent so we can see where it's shiny and where it's not that's working

247
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.290
really well and now just a matter of tweaking.

248
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.100
The mix of things coming in so we've gots is it.

249
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.010
So there's not enough of that coming through now.

250
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:52.820
The actual gloss shelf we can see here after playing with it it has made some areas very shiny So I

251
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.730
think I actually need to tone that down a little and I'm going to do that by adding in a colour ramp.

252
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.280
So only need a vector.

253
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.370
No I need to convert a colour ramp.

254
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.220
When I've lost my colour ramp over it's gone.

255
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.180
There it is.

256
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.920
Pop it in there.

257
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:15.400
Now I can change where the white value starts and ends can make everything shinier or I can make everything

258
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.830
less shiny and less shiny is what I need to do and I need to zoom in to do that I can actually click

259
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.790
on the right.

260
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:22.990
Okay.

261
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.140
And I don't want to shift the Black Value up or the white.

262
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.500
Let's preview what's going on.

263
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.630
Okay.

264
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.560
I think I need to bring the white value down.

265
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.130
That's making everything white.

266
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.080
I need to change the white to a grace.

267
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.790
Ah there we go.

268
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:45.720
So let's go for a mid Grey let's go back into render mode and see what's going on.

269
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:52.720
Let's view the right things we need to go to this make shader here and preview that's our that's starting

270
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.950
to look much much better.

271
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.880
Excellent.

272
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.220
Tell us looking much better it's not.

273
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:07.200
Well it is no longer overly shiny but it's shiny in the appropriate places like around the lips along

274
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.410
the nose et cetera et cetera.

275
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.230
Really.

276
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:15.750
How did you guys get on how how did you did you make a similar sort of blue.

277
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.610
Brillion How did you guys get on.

278
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:24.710
Share your work in the discussions I'd love to see how you've combined these maps and the matou as you've

279
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:25.580
come up with.

280
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.180
I need to alter my eyes I'm signed to spot some things that I just need a whole touch and tweak with

281
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.130
my model because they're not quite right at the moment.

282
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.280
And they've started to come about by just looking at the model and actually doing this materials work

283
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:40.850
on it.

284
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.340
They really start to stand out.

285
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.770
Appreciate your work in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
