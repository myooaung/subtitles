00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.090
Hello everybody and welcome to this quick reminder video about applying your transforms.

2
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.380
Now you've already seen at least one of these videos in this course already.

3
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.030
Unfortunately it is a reminder video because I've seen so many people forget to apply their transformers

4
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.030
and obviously getting confused when they're applying a particle system across their bunny for the hairs.

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.880
And I've seen people go from having not very many hairs on their body wondering what's going on.

6
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.910
I say have you applied or transformed and all of a sudden the thing becomes incredibly hairy.

7
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.360
Now of course you can get around that simply by applying your transforms.

8
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.820
So now just a quick reminder by hopping over into a blender and finding out more.

9
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.690
Hello everybody and welcome back in front of us here we have three spheres that all look the same They've

10
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.710
all got the same particle system on them as well that there is a difference between them.

11
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.330
And that is their scale.

12
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.270
So the one on the left as the view is at the moment we have a look has a scale factor of point one.

13
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.700
So actually this ball in reality is 10 times larger and it's been shrunk down.

14
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.410
Now the middle one has a scale factor of one.

15
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.920
And if we go to one on the very end you can see it's got a scale factor of ten but they're essentially

16
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.640
all identical.

17
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.440
We go into edit mode we can see we've got a ball here.

18
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.850
We've got another uni sphere here and another Yuri sphere here.

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.170
So they are all identical.

20
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.020
And when you go ahead and put a particle system as you can see here they all look pretty much identical

21
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.220
as well.

22
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.570
So what's the problem I hear you say well when it comes to the scale and particle systems it's all to

23
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.140
do with about the number of them and the distribution of them.

24
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.550
And what you will see in the viewport Unless are in rendered mode it will be completely different so

25
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.870
we hop into rended note mode.

26
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.740
Now my computer will slow down lots because there's lots of hairs on there but you can see there's a

27
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.150
dramatic difference between these three even though they looked the same.

28
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.380
So if you have a ball that looked like this all sparse and you then applied the scale it would change.

29
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.500
In fact we can do that live.

30
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.030
It's got this ball selected this last square on the left and if I go control a and apply the scale it

31
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.620
will look.

32
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.600
So here's something that goes all crazy and you can see that's exactly what you need to be careful of.

33
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.090
Now this is quite funny when you're creating the fluffy bunny in a bit.

34
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.070
And we'll go through all these settings and how to control them later on.

35
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.450
But you can see how that would be rather annoying if you spent time combing brushing cutting and neatening

36
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.850
up your Bunny's hair only to find it just goes off and turns into a big fluff ball and then undo that

37
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.200
for the moment and go back to where we were before.

38
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.230
So you can see here is very important that we do make sure we apply our transforms specifically in this

39
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.790
case we're talking about the scale of the object itself.

40
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.120
That's the main thing that's going to affect the particle distribution.

41
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.560
And that goes with any sort of particle systems whatsoever.

42
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.040
And of course this will be the first time we touch upon it in this course.

43
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.590
So there we go.

44
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.870
That's a quick summary of why you should be applying your transforms and just make sure you do as you're

45
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.580
going through things.

46
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.990
And a reminder that if you're editing something be in edit mode thing you don't really need to worry

47
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.590
about this.

48
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.660
And if you do adjust the scale of something that's so we grab this middle one here and scale it up ever

49
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.780
so slightly.

50
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.550
Once you've done that REMEMBER TO GO control an A or go down to the object menu and apply that scale

51
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.360
do it straightaway.

52
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.390
Dont try and remember later on we can see each change we've made it bigger.

53
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.940
So the distribution of hairs is much thinner now and that's what you need to watch out for.

54
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.150
If we go ahead and this one on the left it got really puffy.

55
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.310
Let's see what happens.

56
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.110
It's the other way.

57
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.100
It's a really small object and then you go and apply a scale.

58
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.840
So let's go and apply a scale to that.

59
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.130
You can see some it thins out lots.

60
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.640
So you do need to be careful because that's a tiny object.

61
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.720
And of course it's meant that the hairs proportionately smaller as well.

62
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.330
So there we go a brief overview of why you should be applying your transforms in this section.

63
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.650
Do remember to do it otherwise you could end up with some crazy hair on your bunnies.

64
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.470
Catch you in the next lecture.
