00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,330
Welcome to reviewing your work objectively.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,750
In this video we will take an objective look at our model and see what is missing.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,130
Hopefully not too much.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,320
It's just some tweaks that need doing but we'll find out.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,130
So first of all will be any improvements to the modelling itself.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,570
Now modelling is important that we cover this one first because the second one.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,050
Any improvements that need to be made to texturing Well it's reliance on the model itself if we change

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,070
the model dramatically the UVB map or change and if the UV map will change well the textures will change

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,760
as well.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,010
Or will need to be changed to match the V map.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,510
So that is something that needs to be considered before making any major changes.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,730
If you decide to put in some creases here and there just to accentuate form that's probably not going

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,400
to make too much difference to the overall you v map so don't worry about that.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,230
However if we decide to move an eye socket or the nose Well that's going to probably need another U.S.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,420
map creating from it and the texturing update it.

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,460
Now finally the lighting and environment.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,050
Now we've got a three point lighting set up at the moment and that is working really well.

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,650
However if you wanted to experiment with different lighting which can dramatically change the overall

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,190
feel and look of your model remember to take a copy of those lights and then move those around and then

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,160
you can switch between those two lighting groups and see the different effects it makes rather than

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,350
moving your current lighting and losing the position of it.

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,150
And finally the environment.

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,510
Well in this particular case we can go with a plane or graduated environment.

24
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,030
I mean I'm going to work with that plinth that we have there.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,320
But to be quite honest we just want the focal point to be our bust.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,050
We do not really want to have a messy environment or at an exaggerated environment's going to be plainsong

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,940
and it probably stick with the black background.

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,290
Just so the model stands out from it.

29
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,470
So let's go and hop on over into blender and take an objective look at our model.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,550
Okay so I've gone ahead and rendered out my model to see what it's going to look like.

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,130
Once we start doing that so once we start getting to the full details and I'm quite happy with the skin

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,730
colour and everything but there's something that strikes me.

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,340
First of all there's a really harsh shadow down this eye and I don't like that something I have to move

34
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,960
my lighting around slightly.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,530
Perhaps having the main light directly in front of the face and then feel like slightly to the side.

36
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,530
That's that's the first thing I'm going to try in terms of the lighting.

37
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,100
Terms of the modelling.

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,110
Well I am pretty happy with the overall model here.

39
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,820
There's nothing that stands out as horrible and there's a little dimple in here but again that's an

40
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,880
under under here that's absolutely fine because skin is not smooth.

41
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,450
And that leads me on to something that's very very glaring.

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,490
Is this paint brush working.

43
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,950
Because I'd like to be able to draw on this if possible.

44
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:15,000
I've got you on soft and at the moment I'm going to go to drawing so I can actually draw what's going

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
on in my mind.

46
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:25,410
So these particular highlights I think are about right but they're really telling us a story of how

47
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,480
smooth the skin is.

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,690
And certainly this person that I've modelled here in myself I don't have baby soft skin anymore is not

49
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,630
super smooth so the cheek here should have a bit of texture to it.

50
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,520
And I think what's missing from our model is a nice normal map now going in the modelling all those

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,030
creases is quite time consuming that's one way that you can do that you can go ahead and model in all

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,460
the little dimples and creases and that might actually be the fastest way of getting around this particular

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,960
issue.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,170
If there's a texture that um I can apply to the surface and then use a another map like I've done with

55
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,600
the specular map or the glossy map to say where that texture applies and where it doesn't.

56
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,720
That's another way of working it.

57
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,980
Now of course I need to be careful with the node set up and everything else there.

58
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,250
So there are a couple of ways of doing that.

59
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:23,850
Now whether you go the sculpting route and then baking the Normal's or whether you go the texture route

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,390
and then converting it to a bump map or a normal map from there you can get pretty similar results you'll

61
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,570
have more control obviously if you manually sculpt in than if you just use textures.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,170
So there's a time penalty for doing it one way but there's a realism penalty for doing it another.

63
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,290
So it's time now I've had an objective look at this particular model.

64
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,880
Is there anything else before I go on.

65
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,100
Well the lips themselves are quite smooth and lips aren't smooth if you have a look at reference material.

66
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,730
They have lots of fine lines in them.

67
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,240
Certainly there's even I've added freckles here it turns out on the full render they're not coming out

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,960
too well.

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,530
I mean there's someone for head here.

70
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,310
And to be quite honest they just looked like smudges.

71
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,690
So there's work to be done on that diffusely there as well.

72
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,940
Perhaps just bringing them out that little bit more imp maybe even being a bit more prominent with them.

73
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,940
I was thinking Oh I don't want them so bright badgely we mix everything together like we've done.

74
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,360
They're not quite as prominent as I thought they were going to be.

75
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,600
So it's time for a challenge.

76
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,030
I'd like you to go ahead and assess your model so use reference material I know have said this a lot

77
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,230
but it is important.

78
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,350
If you are unsure or if something doesn't look right you're going to be able to see and compare from

79
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,030
that and take a close look now at the level of getting detail right.

80
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,740
You really do need to see where the skin folds where it changes in texture and how it changes in texture

81
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,150
as well.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,530
Share your work with the community and get their feedback.

83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,180
We've got a whole course of wonderful people we've got the community site as well that you can just

84
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,450
come to post to staff and ask for feedback and people will gladly give it as well.

85
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,430
Now remember to go ahead and make the changes you want to do.

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,850
I know mine at the moment looks more like a plastic doll than it does a human.

87
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,650
And that's because it's too smooth.

88
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,650
That's the major issue I have with my model at the moment so I'll be working on creating a normal map

89
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,120
or certainly a bump map and using a normal node to make the skin more textural.

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,650
And remember do one thing at a time and assess the change has it done what you thought it would.

91
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,950
So that's very important if you if you go make 20 changes and it doesn't work out how you wanted it

92
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,590
to.

93
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,040
We don't know which one of those 20 changes might have been the one that caused everything else not

94
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,610
to work the 19 beforehand might have been perfect.

95
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,510
So it very important that you take things one step at a time.

96
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,480
Now as on doing the normal map for instance I'm going to be looking at handing it stage by stage.

97
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,130
I might just.

98
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,500
Do the cheek or the fore head or something along those lines.

99
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,170
Just one area of the face and then seeing if it's made the right effect.

100
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,350
If it has brillion I can get on with the rest of the model as well.

101
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,960
So go ahead pause a video now and give that a go.

102
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,880
Okay guys welcome back.

103
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,460
Let's go ahead and make those changes to the models.

104
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,710
Okay so I've started going through and adding a bit more detail to the inside of the eyes.

105
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,280
I've literally just been sculpting for a while.

106
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,330
Hot Hand then what.

107
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,110
Let's make this fit my screen properly.

108
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,910
There we go.

109
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,840
And then I've also started adding some micro detail to the lips themselves literally.

110
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,200
Again just sculpting.

111
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,880
Well the approach I'm going for here is I believe it's going to be easier to sculpt this detail and

112
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,540
have much more control over it then trying to use textures and masks because I can literally use textures

113
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,990
in a moment.

114
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:16,060
Well let's do a live example here and hopefully let's save my file before Heidi it is experimentation.

115
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's go to the textures themselves and go to a brush mask.

116
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,560
Well let's go to let's say Clay strips and then texture.

117
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,850
Go to the brush or the brush mask it doesn't matter.

118
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,180
Depends which way you want to go about it.

119
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,050
And here the type I'm going to set of or annoy.

120
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,530
Now I don't know what scale this is going to be at the moments and no good.

121
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,870
Let's make sure it's applied.

122
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:48,160
So in the tool shelf texture Yeah and texture is there and it doesn't look to be working just yet.

123
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,790
Let's try a different one let's try not inflate and deflate.

124
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:58,270
Let's try all whereas it sculpting draw no texture of air yet that's shoes the foreign texture.

125
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,390
So let's make it a little while let's make this bigger.

126
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:08,110
Okay so we can see the size of it there is that's going to be quite a skin graft or an alien skin.

127
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:14,110
So if you'll go in for that type of effect you can and obviously the bigger and more pixellated or the

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,540
the chunky that texture is going to be.

129
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,340
So what we need to do here is scale it down now.

130
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:26,050
I believe there's a scaling here so this is one of these things where you actually increase the size

131
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,240
to make it smaller.

132
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,670
So let's try a hundred and see how that turns out.

133
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,070
Bear in mind that this will change depending on how Zumas you are you mean so something like that will

134
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,510
be completely different to something on those lines.

135
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,070
And that's getting there although the strength of that is far too strong we can see it's really pulled

136
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,290
the skin quites are lots and we don't want that.

137
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,950
So let's zoom out.

138
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,500
Let's try just a little bit higher than that.

139
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,040
Try five hundred five hundred five hundred Okay.

140
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,880
And then finally up here.

141
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,920
Let's lower the strength down to maybe 20 percent.

142
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,720
Okay.

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm starting to like Fats.

144
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,830
Quite a bit.

145
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,600
And of course you can make things wrinkly.

146
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:19,100
And then of course smooth out the detail as well if necessary to make it not so wrinkly in place.

147
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,830
It's a case of us actually working out relatively well obviously resumes and but we get the whole face

148
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,320
looking very horrible would happen to me if I stayed in the sun for too long.

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,330
So obviously you can go for an extreme effect like this.

150
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,080
And in fact whilst we see this extreme effects I'm going to go ahead now because we're actually altering

151
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,330
the model I don't need to bake this into a texture.

152
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,980
Obviously if you were now exporting this you would take this as a normal texture.

153
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,920
So you it can be reapplied to a low poly model but since we actually have a well it basically alive

154
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,740
and ready to go under the rendering settings because under render under the vomity rez it's also air

155
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,890
force so we get the full benefits.

156
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,660
Let's just have 12 and see what that ends up looking like and I'll see you guys back once this is rendered

157
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,100
out.

158
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,140
So as expected it has had a relatively extreme result.

159
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,550
We just saw my windows out here.

160
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,900
Let's bring this one across.

161
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,380
Can I do that.

162
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,620
Yeah.

163
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,480
There we go.

164
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,360
So we've got a relatively textured surface to a model now.

165
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,430
In fact it's been so extremely in places with that taste.

166
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:35,810
You can see by its casting quite a deep shadow on are particular mesh has also taken a while to render

167
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,540
that took nearly six minutes to render So this is where doing the sculpting and working out and perhaps

168
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,570
making a normal mat from it.

169
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,130
We should see a render time improvement because it's not having to handle all of the geometry.

170
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:56,120
So in this particular scene itself there's one point four million trying goals which is quite a bit

171
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:04,070
there's 700000 births he so as to render all of those out the less vs. It has to do the better and having

172
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,420
a look at the lips.

173
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,820
I'm quite happy with those.

174
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:13,340
They've got the the right texture obviously they've been hammered by my silly use of this particular

175
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,790
texture brush but otherwise I'm really happy with how the lips turned out.

176
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:25,250
So it's time to work a bit more delicately with these particular wrinkles and folds in the skin.

177
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,710
Well I'm going to go off and do that now and I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

178
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,790
Okay so this is the render how it stands at the moment.

179
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,980
It's not a complete render and there's still some further diffused texturing to add in I haven't added

180
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,580
in my wrinkles yet but I have fleshed out my face.

181
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,640
So it's a lot more representative of me.

182
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,540
In this case.

183
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,780
So I noticed when looking from the front if I move round my model here and certainly just put it into

184
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,680
orthographic projection.

185
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,520
My ears dont stick out quite as far from my face as they do normally.

186
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,170
I I have made them in fact so I have had to puff out my cheeks a little as you can see here I've added

187
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,480
in my little double chin.

188
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,650
Well if you're doing something realistic you might as well get there.

189
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,810
So there's just a few.

190
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm happy with all the indentations that I haven't made it in my face.

191
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,570
There's a little bit skin texturing to do in terms of the gloss map I just need to refine that where

192
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,470
things are glossy and where things are not.

193
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,550
And another thing that I have done and I almost forgot about when setting up my nodes is that skin is

194
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:41,100
also translucent so I just take you to my node set up as it is at the moment so we've got these layers.

195
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,140
If we think about them and how much of them come through starting with the deepest layer of the skin

196
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:57,280
and working up and as we go down this list I have added in a translucent B s the f shader which is also

197
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,960
using the same colour the base colour in the model.

198
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,730
And if we just isolate that self the translucent slits isolate that we see that with the colouring there

199
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,560
it makes it obviously much better than if it is just a plain old white but with the colour there we

200
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,680
can actually see it adds translucency to the areas that need it and when that's mixed in with everything

201
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,250
else that gives a slightly more realistic feeling.

202
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,530
If you don't have the translucency in your model you lack that one fundamental thing about skin.

203
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,160
And that's the fact that it is translucence you need to make sure you tell blender or certainly in the

204
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,460
nodes that is translucent.

205
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,230
So I've done that here and I'm very happy with that so the final thing to do for me at the moment is

206
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,360
just to work on the diffuse textures so I start getting some of the freckles that are through and just

207
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,040
bumping up where things are slightly shiny and where they're not because that's not coming through quite

208
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
as well as I'd want it to.

209
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,080
And I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

210
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:08,020
Okay so after some final tweaks and rendering this is what I'm going to class as my final mesh for the

211
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,370
moment and final textures.

212
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,910
I've worked out what was going on with the gloss shader just in have the right one attached.

213
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,860
For some reason during my creation I had Let's just see here.

214
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:26,730
I had a head glossy which was just blank and his glossy PRNG and only that one was applying the Course.

215
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,260
Black will mean that that's not there.

216
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,930
So that's why that was missing.

217
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,220
No matter what I tried that should disappear now it's not being used on anything after I've saved and

218
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,140
reopen.

219
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,380
Let's have a quick look at the no set up anything else that I've added since we've last seen.

220
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,470
We've got this bit here we've got the translucency that I've added in.

221
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,590
That's absolutely fine.

222
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,410
What I have done is art the image texture itself.

223
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:57,610
I've used a hue saturation and value just to tweak my mesh ever so slightly to see if we can see it

224
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,240
in action.

225
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,570
Okay so the bass is here.

226
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,000
Now I've just boosted the colours slightly and given it a slightly more yellow cast to it.

227
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,110
I mean I could boost that up even more to maybe one point.

228
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:16,320
So if you go to high of course you just look sunburnt as it goes up to a maximum of two.

229
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,750
There are maybe and stretch to 144 and have slightly darkened the model as well.

230
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,570
It was slightly too light.

231
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:31,890
Okay so after doing those the next thing that I did was I literally plugged in a very annoyed texture.

232
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,630
And made it with a bump note and then plug it into the diffuse the translucent and the glossy notes

233
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,700
and then that gave us a very little bumpy surface across the entire model itself giving us a slightly

234
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,630
textured feel.

235
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:55,410
But it's never that strong so it's not really seen across the model because we don't colour we want

236
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,700
the the factor there.

237
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,270
So it's is is kind of one of those things that's not seen but is seen.

238
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,050
So you won't see it directly but it does have an impact on the render.

239
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,490
I tried different scales I found that thousands seemed to work for my particular model.

240
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,610
One is obviously you can be big and blocky and won't work at.

241
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,460
And why aren't we seeing it at the moment.

242
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,670
Be a preview that for an I text ulrich's in to almost every went into rendered mode.

243
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,890
Let's boost that up so I tried 10 and obviously it out then work till it tried a thousand and found

244
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:37,440
that when I zoomed in that gave me the right sort of level of detail around the thousand mark pumped

245
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,440
into the bump and obviously I wanted to make sure here that it wasn't too strong.

246
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,400
I had to play several times.

247
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,320
Checked out the glossy individually because I saw one that would really sparked off and that's a nice

248
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,660
little textured feel across there.

249
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,860
I didn't map that at all I found that once everything was all plugged in it worked rather well.

250
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,340
Brilliant.

251
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,800
Well how did you guys get on How's your head coming along.

252
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,950
As just a few final things that are obviously missing from this model but we can sort those out in good

253
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,880
time.

254
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,010
Of course I'd love to see how are you getting answered.

255
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,150
Do remember to share your work.

256
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,780
And of course as always I will see you guys in the next lecture.
