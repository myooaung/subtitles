00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.820
Okay so how is it coming together in this video.

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.520
You check that things are looking right in your main scene so I'll be hopping over to my Gothic church

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.850
scene and just see if the materials that I have applied and the the textures that I've applied are actually

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.010
coming into my scene as I'd expect them to.

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.080
And also I'll be checking sternly to blend the model is working correctly so were being leaned about

6
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.280
but we've changed a couple of things in our model itself and the basic building blocks.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.830
And I just want to make sure that those changes are actually the change that I need and want to make.

8
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.980
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.850
Okay so the first thing I've done here is gone ahead and opened up my Gothic church scene.

10
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.490
I've been working on the course you will open up your interior model slash exterior model that you're

11
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.650
currently working on.

12
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.210
The first thing that's going to do here is literally turn off all of the portals have already discovered

13
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.950
that they are not helping at this moment in time.

14
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.800
I'm not going to go ahead and remove them at all from our scene.

15
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.680
In fact what I'll probably end up doing is adding them to the mesh objects themselves and bring them

16
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.180
in that way.

17
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.320
But otherwise I'm ready to stice blurring my model.

18
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.850
Now I can see that the door is sorted.

19
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.890
So we've got um I'm just going to click on it and zoom in.

20
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.170
So the main door has blockwork over it.

21
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.840
The windows have blockwork over it the corners are still missing the tail and this bits here should

22
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.760
be the plain wall.

23
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.850
And that doesn't have any texture on it and we've definitely added texture.

24
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.600
So let's go have a look at what's going on there.

25
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.060
So let's go and open up the wall space and hop in to render mode here.

26
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.640
Okay was seemed to be OK.

27
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.200
Now we are in blender render and it has remembered that.

28
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.740
So let's switch that over to cycles.

29
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.050
Remember to click he used notes on your material.

30
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.320
So we've got that back in.

31
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.400
Brilliant and well save the file.

32
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.300
Now it all remember that it's cycles that that object again where copying the object data blocks oversoul

33
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.320
is expecting it to be in blender render at that point.

34
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.040
And touch wood.

35
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.210
When we go into a 3D view here what I'm going to come out of camera view and have some perspective.

36
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.010
It's tense Yes.

37
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.430
There we go we've got some texture applied to the rest of the model.

38
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.400
And at this point we can start to see one of my concerns was where it goes under.

39
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.240
There's going to be a line of squished material but actually I think that adds to our model and in fact

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.420
it lines at the edge of the wall was going to be one of my concerns.

41
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.000
So you don't have a corner piece that seems to have worked out pretty well as well.

42
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.060
And of course it's more of an interior scene and it's quite fuzzy inside it.

43
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.540
So it's going to take a while for rendering now but that is looking good the main point here is what

44
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.780
we have been working on is immediately taking effect in the scene that we're working on some just going

45
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.880
to go ahead and once again unhide all of these.

46
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.840
So I didn't save it before.

47
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.120
Let's go see how this is working now.

48
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.160
Over in the unity game engine.

49
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.590
So I'm going to go ahead and open up my Gothic church scene.

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.150
Now the way that unity works is it does convert the blend file into an FBI X in the background which

51
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.250
doesn't give us much control over how that happens.

52
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.990
And we seem to be lacking textures I expect to see textures in here almost straightaway.

53
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.090
No I would expect to have to apply the textures of these parts.

54
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.070
So let's just give that a go.

55
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.170
I'm going to click on one of these and see whether.

56
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.000
Okay.

57
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.860
It's got that texture replied.

58
00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:01.190
I wonder whether I just need to save the changes to my scene here first before it will update properly

59
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.840
over in unity.

60
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.750
Come to think of it I think I export to design as an FBI ex.

61
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.070
It was a while ago and I can't remember.

62
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.920
I don't think we're having unity open up the blend file.

63
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.880
I think were manually doing the FBI.

64
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.150
So let's go ahead and do that now.

65
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:26.030
So now I'm scared to try selecting the various parts of our scene with control held down to make sure

66
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.240
that's going to bring the mannequin in as well just to make sure that the various parts of the scene

67
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.690
and the hierarchy underneath are included new parts I don't need to bring that in.

68
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.770
Then I'm going to go file an export I'm scared to try exporting the whole thing as an FBI x.

69
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.750
I'm going to overwrite my previous FBI and make sure that selected objects on the export be X ticked

70
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.430
as go ahead and export.

71
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.540
And hop back on over into unity.

72
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.240
Now this gothic church that we've got here I'm not sure.

73
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.330
I'm just literally going to delete that from our scene completely.

74
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.970
In fact in this case I think I was working with that so I did need a Forgot I was working with an FBI

75
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.120
ex.

76
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.750
There we go.

77
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.110
That's why that wasn't working.

78
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.990
I needed to refresh it.

79
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.490
So can I undo that.

80
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.550
The least no one shall have to re import it so that's important assets and go find that as in my scenes

81
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.160
folder if I remember correctly assets scenes.

82
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.680
It should be X..

83
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.160
What I've just changed and let's drag and drop it into the scene.

84
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.640
Ha.

85
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.870
Excellent.

86
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.810
That is starting to look pretty good.

87
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.370
Now I wonder why it has applied to some and not others.

88
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.940
Again let's go here.

89
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.200
I guess I just need to apply the map the U.S. map should have come across or just to add the texture

90
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.550
map to it.

91
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.340
And the same for this doorway.

92
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:09.950
Okay so that is working over in a game engine as well as we can see here I do have to rebuild it slightly

93
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.270
but not much.

94
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.900
And if we go ahead hit play we should be able to walk around our scene.

95
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.490
It's going to make that full screen so you guys can see what's going on.

96
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.760
How about that.

97
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.090
That's looking pretty good.

98
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.800
And that is quite lean.

99
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.470
It does mean that I need to remember takes more FBI checks before I do anything else.

100
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.830
I don't know why wide jump through the window.

101
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.240
Habit I suppose.

102
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.180
The ceiling is solid but it is also letting light through as we can see on the floor here so that can

103
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.660
be improved.

104
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.620
I don't see anything else around my scene that that looks a bit horrible there and there and probably

105
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.910
here as well.

106
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.340
No just there and there.

107
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.720
So that doesn't look too hot there.

108
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:56.130
And this is the great thing you know we've we've exported Do we haven't done much and we can.

109
00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.730
I was for there was some sort of artefact it's not it's the light coming through one of those gaps.

110
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.560
This is coming along pretty well as you can see it's very lean.

111
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.760
I can now go ahead and change things.

112
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.900
I just need to remember to export the f x.

113
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.660
And of course it's time for a challenge I'd like you to check your model so check your model for air.

114
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.670
Any glaring obvious issues that need fixing and of course being lean about it fix them straight away

115
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.780
or at least make a notes that some things need altering.

116
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.150
If you can't fix them straightaway because it's going to have a big impact on something do make a note

117
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.830
so you don't make the same mistake again of what's going on there.

118
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.050
And of course share your progress in the discussions.

119
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.440
Pause of the year now and give that a go.

120
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.480
Okay guys welcome back.

121
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.590
It's going to take a quick tour around my model and see if there's anything else that I need to know

122
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.270
down.

123
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.320
Now I'm going to look around my model since I've got it already loaded into.

124
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.150
And just see if there's anything here.

125
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:03.100
There have been a couple things that I've noticed that will also make a difference in blender.

126
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.970
So one of the things I have noticed is a graphical artefact.

127
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:13.300
If you look at this corner piece here it is flickering backwards and forwards.

128
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:20.210
And that's because of how the mesh is a line some of the parts as I've been putting them together overlap

129
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.500
with other parts.

130
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:27.840
And I think they're overlapping by that point two of a blender unit or about 20 centimetres I suppose.

131
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.650
But as you can see it's causing a horrible glitching artefact.

132
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.190
It's certainly in unity and I'm pretty sure and there it is again on that doorway corner piece there.

133
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:44.570
I'm pretty sure that if we start rendering things in blender it's also going to rear its ugly head there

134
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.410
as well.

135
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:51.170
If you remember back in the lamp section I had the two meshes on top of one another the original curve

136
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:56.750
that made the lamp base and then the mesh I made from that curve and they were both being rendered at

137
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.510
the same time that cause some horrible artefacts.

138
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.990
And I'm pretty sure this is going to happen as well.

139
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:08.990
So that is a very big thing that we need to sort out otherwise an end render is going to look quite

140
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.620
horrible.

141
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.520
Hello it's me again.

142
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.070
Okay.

143
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.040
So in the other parts that I need to start focussing on really is just need turning up these corners

144
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.390
the great big holes there and these vaults.

145
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.740
They need a bit of work.

146
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:27.260
They're a great standing place holder racette but they're really starting to let down the rest of the

147
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:27.590
scene.

148
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.220
Now they're nowhere near the quality level of the rest of this scene.

149
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.830
So I think that's the next they are going to be focussing on a bit of detail on.

150
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.750
And then of course we've got to put something in this church I mean at the moment it's just an empty

151
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.710
building.

152
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.820
So how did you guys get on.

153
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:46.970
Did you find out some glaringly obvious errors like this one I've made here with my alignment of my

154
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.960
mesh.

155
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:54.140
That itself is probably going to take me tens of minutes to fix so I won't bore you with me moving about

156
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.850
pieces.

157
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.500
In this particular lecture you'll see the end result shortly.

158
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.720
Please post your results in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
