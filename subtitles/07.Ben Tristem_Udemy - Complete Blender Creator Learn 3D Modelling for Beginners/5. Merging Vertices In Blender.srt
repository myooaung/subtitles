00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,450
We are going to learn a couple of things first of all that you can merge vertices together this was

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:17,300
once four vertices at the top and now it is one vertex and you can see it's linked to all of the ones

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,170
underneath.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:24,740
The other thing that we will learn is how to select things and make things individual i.e. unlinked

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,420
or have the mesh linked together so that we can select everything at once.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,270
All things individually and we will delve into some of the reasons why you may want something separated

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,650
like that or as one solid mesh.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,460
So let's go find out more Okay everybody Welcome to the default blend scene.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm going to go straight into edit mode and select these top vertices to make sure that I've got border

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,340
select turned on I'm going to select everything and you can do that in two ways you can double press

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,480
the A key and a will obviously select everything if you want to d select rather than selecting all you

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,420
can use alternate I'm going to then use the border select tool that's already enabled and just select

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,340
these top vertices.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,620
Now you may have already experienced this.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,240
You can scale that down to zero.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,140
And when you do that you get a single point at the top that immediately you can start moving around

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,280
and you may think at this point it has collapsed all of those four vertices down into one.

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,260
I'm afraid you would be wrong if I was to just then click to select a vertex you can see that that's

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,210
not the case we've got one two three and this fourth one so far.

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,060
Undo all of that stretching about how do we merge these all together.

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,390
Well there are a couple ways of doing it and there are reasons why you may or may not want to do it

23
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,220
as well.

24
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,960
So the first one why you might not want to do it well in this case I can't think of a very good reason

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,350
because they're all in one individual place.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,150
However if you've got separate paths that a co-exist in the same place that's when you may want to keep

27
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,170
it the same and I'll show you an example in a few moments.

28
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,260
Now you think we'd be able to just draw a border around to select all of those vertices.

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,030
Unfortunately that doesn't work.

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,190
Can you hold down shift and keep selecting.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,310
No that doesn't work either.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,100
The reason for that is because geometry is on top of itself and it can be very frustrating and difficult

33
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,200
when that happens.

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,190
How do we select everything that's here.

35
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,890
Well there are a couple of ways we can put our view into wireframe mode which is the first one along

36
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,530
here that when we draw a border around we see that the four edges connected to that have starts become

37
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,170
highlighted and we can go back to solid mode and then manipulate it all together.

38
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,110
We can see that's there.

39
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,710
Alternatively what we could have done is click this show whole scene transparent next to the shading

40
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,460
options if we turn that's on then I can do exactly the same thing and I can turn that off again.

41
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,970
That may be more useful if you if you need the context of shape because the moment you switch the wireframe

42
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,200
mode it can get a bit iffy as to where things are I'm going to turn that back off again because it's

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,900
very easy to leave it on and end up selecting through a model when you don't want to do that.

44
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,450
So now I've got all of those vertices selected.

45
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,540
How do I saw that.

46
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,020
How how do we keep it in one place.

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,550
The first way is go into the vertex menu at the top and going to merge vertices.

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,420
Now you see here it's got a shortcut key as well.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,440
An M.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,260
Now what it will do is it will collapse all of those vertices at the center of them all.

51
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,010
So if I was to go out and am because they exist in the same place we get an option here at Center at

52
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,970
cursor and collapse.

53
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,310
Now I'm going to choose at center in this case.

54
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,700
And there we go.

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,730
It's all merged down into one.

56
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:52,240
And if you weren't sure you can glance down at the lower right notice it says here we got the cube which

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,310
is the objects we're working on.

58
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,130
The vertices one is selected out of five.

59
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,650
If I undo what we've just done it was for I selected out of eight.

60
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,970
So going alternate M and at center has done that.

61
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,360
Now you may be thinking and you'd be right thinking this if we go all the way back.

62
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,100
If I can with my undo levels.

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,130
Nope.

64
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,740
If we go ahead and just load up out the false scene again go into edit mode clearer selection and select

65
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,910
the top slots and then merge them at center.

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,160
We had it got to the same point much much quicker so you can see sometimes.

67
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,860
Whereas you would have taken two or three steps to get there.

68
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,960
You can actually do the same thing in one step if that was the shape you were trying to create ultimately

69
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,610
with this top vertex all connected.

70
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,030
The other thing that you can do is if you had scaled it down by zero is you can select everything in

71
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:54,580
your scene press F three to search and then tie pin remove and doubles.

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,600
You can also type in doubles and it would have probably found it quicker.

73
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,420
And then we can see down at the bottom right is removed three vertices and we're back down to having

74
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,280
five in total.

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,030
In our scene

76
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:17,090
Hey guys Mark here are an update to select here for those using newer version than Mikey remove doubles

77
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:23,180
has been renamed merged by distance and the menu is slightly changed the old remove doubles option that

78
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,620
used to reside under the merge vertices menu now sits within its southern menu and is named by distance

79
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:39,800
this has also been renamed in the search box with the f k and is now found by typing merge by distance.

80
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,290
Or you can just type merge so any time Mikey refers to and remove doubles.

81
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:55,030
Just search will use the alternative menu to make a so the final thing to discuss is where and when

82
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,580
and why would you want to do that.

83
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:04,030
Well for a start if you with 3D printing something or exporting this elsewhere or just following good

84
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,790
practice it's a good idea to have topology where your vertices edges and faces are.

85
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:16,980
That makes sense and having 4 groups at the very top of our pyramid makes no sense whatsoever.

86
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:24,730
While some here by the way I'm just gonna call this pyramid is always a good idea to name your objects

87
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,100
early on rather than forgetting about it and getting in a pickle later.

88
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,090
There are some cases however where you don't want things linked together.

89
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:41,810
So if I go ahead and shift this entire object up by 1 so it's on the 0 plain.

90
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,630
Excellent.

91
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:42,930
Okay.

92
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,250
And then I'm going to add another primitive into this mesh object so I'm going to add a cube bits of

93
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,610
mesh data into our pyramid mesh objects.

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,830
I'm gonna move it down by minus one.

95
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,610
And there we go.

96
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:03,500
Now we may want to keep these two bits of mesh data separate from one another so that this vertex in

97
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,680
the corner is separate from the other vertex which is part of our pyramid at the top.

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,670
Our good reason for this is if I had different materials or you wanted to apply different properties

99
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,490
to each individual section there is a point at which you'd make them completely separate mesh objects

100
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,300
as well.

101
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,880
Bear that in mind both are all part of a one mesh object.

102
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,290
You can also do really cool things like in this case I'm going to have a face select enables is nice

103
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:40,910
and easy to do if I just press the L key it selects all linked mesh data with the face that my cursor

104
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:48,350
was over the same if I go to the very top and this can make selecting parts of an object really really

105
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,340
easy whereas otherwise it could have been really painful to do and I can do shift and L to D select

106
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,630
those groupings as well so that's a really useful way of selecting large parts of your objects at one

107
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:13,350
go and of course finally if we did want all of these to become one mesh objects I can select all and

108
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:20,130
remove doubles notice that I remembered my last search very useful and that will remove the four that

109
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,210
are in the middle.

110
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,860
Now if we didn't want to do that because we've got other doubles in our scene that we do want to keep.

111
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,730
I'm just going to undo what we did.

112
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:35,040
I'm going to d select everything I'm going to turn on transparency and just select those individual

113
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:41,010
vertices that I want select making sure I'm on vertex selecting modes I'm going to clear my selection

114
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,740
again select all of those.

115
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,920
Now I know that they're all selected then go to our menu and this time just remove double vertices and

116
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,780
there we go those individual ones have gone perfect and now it's time for your challenge.

117
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,110
Okay so your challenge delete a cube.

118
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,570
Yes we're finally getting rid of that the fault cube and working with something else at a u v sphere

119
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:13,410
with 16 segments and eight rings in order to specify that you will need to have your operator panel

120
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:20,520
open after you've added the movie sphere and then I'd like you to delete the lower half the sphere to

121
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,500
make it a dome.

122
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,670
Now it's easy to do this if you've gone around into one of the side views and with wireframe or transparency

123
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:38,440
on selected the vertices you want to delete then go ahead and add a cylinder was 16 vertices and again

124
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
you're going to need the operator panel to do that.

125
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,470
Now once you've gone ahead and done that place the dome on top of the cylinder or the cylinder underneath

126
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,970
the dome they should align perfectly and finally have your new tower set where z equals zero.

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,850
So on that ground plane as we discussed before you could even add a plane there if you want for reference

128
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,700
and let's give you a quick idea of what it should look like at the end.

129
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:11,590
So here we go here's our domed tower and if I go into edit mode because see we have our 16 segments

130
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:20,290
and 16 vertices around our cylinder aligning perfectly half your new tower set where z equals zero.

131
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,330
So on that virtual ground plane if you want to add a plane there and call it ground feel free to do

132
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:25,980
so.

133
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,570
And no double vertices.

134
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:35,230
So where the Dome and the cylinder join you need to remove those doubled vertices and before I tell

135
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,700
you to pause the video let's have a look.

136
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,240
This is what we're aiming for by the end of the challenge.

137
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,960
So we've got a nice dome on top of a cylinder and as we can see here one final thing.

138
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,760
If you haven't named it it's still called sphere.

139
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,000
Make sure you go ahead and name that something like domed tower so that you know that you've named things

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,540
as you've gone along.

141
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,100
There we go.

142
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,980
That's all sorted.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,560
I'm going to save my work and now pulls video and give that a go Hey guys.

144
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,900
Mark here with just a little reminder don't forget did this in edit mode not object mode.

145
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,010
Back to Mikey Okay everybody Welcome back.

146
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:18,080
Let's go ahead and make this domed tower okay.

147
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,690
So here we go.

148
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,700
Let's delete our cube and add in a U V sphere.

149
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,020
I'm going to open up b operates a panel and set that at 16 and 8.

150
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,810
Oh my number pad was turned off.

151
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,320
Here we go.

152
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,040
Sixteen an eight.

153
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,840
And there we go.

154
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,520
I'm going to look at it from the side.

155
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,780
Make it transparent D select everything and just select these bottom vertices I want to select the middle

156
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,120
ones because if I did that they would disappear as well and I deleted vertices.

157
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,180
So there we go we've got a basic dome pretty good so far.

158
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,830
And now I'm going to add in a cylinder.

159
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:01,150
There we go with 16 vertices so what we should find as they line up perfectly with the segments and

160
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,870
we'll go GZ minus one effects and that starts to look really neat.

161
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,440
The other thing we need to make sure here and I'm going to look at it from the side again is making

162
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:20,180
sure that this middle selection I'm going to go to vertex and remove double vertices or root the 16

163
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,220
around the edge there.

164
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,960
The final thing for me to do is go GZ too.

165
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,670
Oh no.

166
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,290
Was it just one.

167
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,800
There we go.

168
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,480
I must have hit three instead.

169
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,600
My apologies.

170
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,120
And there we go the dome is sat on the surface perfect.

171
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,700
And there we go we've got Aunt domed tower.

172
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,290
Now did you create this a different way.

173
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,370
Did you get stuck at any part as we were going through.

174
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,900
Remember if you do get stuck to reach out either on the discussions or in the Q and A so we can lend

175
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,150
a hand.

176
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,830
Now even though this is a simple dome tower you can see this might be the start of something much more

177
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:02,210
interesting perhaps a silo a farm an engine for a jumbo jet or the nose cone of a plane or a rocket.

178
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,040
There are so many things that this could start to become.

179
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,650
I'm starting to get quite excited here thinking about what we can make this into but as you can see

180
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,900
we've now started to hone the skills of putting different mesh objects together and getting to grips

181
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,760
with these segments of the sphere and the vertices of the cylinder.

182
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,690
They are lined perfectly and allow us to create really neat objects like this.

183
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,060
Remember to share your work over in these discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
