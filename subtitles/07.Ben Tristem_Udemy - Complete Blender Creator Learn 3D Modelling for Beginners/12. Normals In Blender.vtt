00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.830
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.310
In this case you're going to have a closer look at normals in blender in front of us.

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:15.680
We have this cube with the top chopped off and I cannot tell you which way these face normals are facing.

4
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.250
Just by having a look at this particular object it doesn't even help us if we switch over into different

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.210
rendering modes it still renders as we would expect it to.

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.870
So how do we find out which way a face is facing.

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.840
Well let's find out more and hop on over in splendor.

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.150
Hello everybody and welcome back.

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.770
So now that we're over in the default blend scene the first thing I want to show you is the overlays

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.620
dropdown.

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.260
So we go to the top of the 3D view we see there's an option for overlays.

12
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.670
There's also a toggle right next to it to turn everything off which can give you a nice clean the parents

13
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.680
if you're trying to work on your models or if you're just sharing their current state really quickly

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.940
with a screenshot.

15
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.830
Now I'm going to turn those back on.

16
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.720
Otherwise we won't be able to see what's going on.

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.120
I'm going to go to my overlays dropdown and we see at the bottom there's an option here for face orientation.

18
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.080
Sounds quite cool sounds very useful as well.

19
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.220
Let's turn it on.

20
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.450
OK.

21
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.550
It's gone blue now.

22
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.250
This stage of course we don't know what blue actually means now because the default cube we can assume

23
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.080
it means outwards.

24
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.020
But in order to test that out we're going to have to be in edit mode.

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.770
So let's go ahead.

26
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.400
Press tab whilst the cube is selected and then when we go to the overlays dropdown it contains a lot

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.810
more information.

28
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.420
Now do feel free to play with these other areas.

29
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.810
Now scroll wheel goes the opposite way to what you'd expect it to.

30
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.250
There we go.

31
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.410
It's jumped down and towards the bottom.

32
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.590
We have normals and we've got three selections plus size.

33
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.410
We're interested in face normals.

34
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.440
And if we turn the size up we can see that the blue lines are going outwards.

35
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.870
That's good.

36
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.830
That means we go outward facing normal.

37
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.140
That's exactly what we want.

38
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.040
And also what we would expect from the default cube we wouldn't expect it to be the wrong way round.

39
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.490
Now what color does this turn.

40
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.040
If it is the wrong way round Well one of the quick ways we can do that one of the things that is very

41
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.590
easy to do especially if you're in edit mode because it doesn't do in object mode is if we scale something

42
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.850
and accidentally push it inside itself.

43
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.100
Now it looks like the Normals are still facing outwards here but they're not they're actually going

44
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.550
from the inside of the cube from the other side of it all the way through if I make the cube large enough

45
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.960
you'll see that those will disappear.

46
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.500
That means we've got inward facing normals.

47
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.220
Now you may think well what's the issue because you probably have noticed by now that even if you have

48
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.670
done that if we go into shaded mode let's turn off base orientation the cube still looks like the Cube

49
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.250
in every other mode.

50
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.850
It still does look like a cube.

51
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.130
All we have done is it changes with the face orientation.

52
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.500
Well fortunately it looked Dev mode and shading mode.

53
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.830
If we go across to the shading dropdown there's an option called back face culling.

54
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.100
I believe it's also there in the shading mode.

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.160
Yes.

56
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.720
Hi guys.

57
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.730
Mark Akers backflips culling has actually been moved and changed.

58
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.560
It's still here under the solid mode.

59
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.650
You still get the blackface coming here but if you try and find it under the viewport shading mode or

60
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.480
the full rendered view it's not here to access that in those notes that you can get view that you get.

61
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.470
Here you go into the it's going to look death mode and it's down here on the material properties panel

62
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.510
and you click it on here and again that would be the same if you wanted it in the rendered view without

63
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.130
mind.

64
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.340
Back to Mike.

65
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.270
This is what the cube would look like if you were to take it into a game engine or some other programs.

66
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.170
It would get confused and it will only render the face with the normal coming out of it an outward facing

67
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.820
normal.

68
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.290
Now if you do happen to have a cube or any other object like this we have a couple of options for correcting

69
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.010
that normal.

70
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.940
The first one is to make normals consistent.

71
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.980
So I'm going to tap back into edit mode make sure everything is selected and go shift in n.

72
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.420
Doing that will make normals consistent.

73
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.710
And if I open up the operator panel we can see we have two options outside and inside.

74
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.740
Sometimes that doesn't work.

75
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.140
However sometimes you will have to select the face manually and with that face selected go to the mesh

76
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.030
menu go to your normals.

77
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.600
And in this case I'm going to have to scroll up a little and we can flip the normals the shift in the

78
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.880
recalculate outside won't work all the time in which case we can flip an individual normal.

79
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.950
So it's facing the other way.

80
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.440
And because we still got black face coming turned on it has disappeared into the model and we won't

81
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.800
see it.

82
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.130
So if I go ahead and just deletes that face we've got a bucket and we can see here it looks transparent

83
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.640
even though in Blender without black face culling turned on it looks pretty solid.

84
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.780
So unfortunately you cannot just export an object like this and expect it to work.

85
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.220
Now this could be a glorified flower pots what would happen inside a game engine or some other programs.

86
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.460
Is it all just look see through which is absolutely no good.

87
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.690
And we can test that live.

88
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.360
I can go here and export it to the GLC f format.

89
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.360
I'm not going to do any other options here but I'm just going to save this.

90
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.340
And then on the right hand side click GLC F two points.

91
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.060
Oh it may take a few seconds the first time round that you do this but then it will export and if you

92
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.060
have Windows 10.

93
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.690
And here we go.

94
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.060
If you've got Windows 10 you can open up your testing normals file which is pretty cool and we see we've

95
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.200
got the same issue is invisible from other sides from inside.

96
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.150
So this is something that you'll have to work on and get used to when you're working with Blender and

97
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.860
other programs as well.

98
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.970
If we wanted to make this look like a box that you could look into.

99
00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.950
You could either enable double sided faces if it exists as an option in the other program or you will

100
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.560
have to make sure that your object is genuinely 3D and there are loads of other options that will cover

101
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.670
as we go through.

102
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.490
But this is just something to bear in mind.

103
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.740
And another option to show you as it is one that commonly people get caught out with.

104
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.520
So in summary we have our overlays our face orientation whilst we're in edit mode.

105
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.920
We can change and see face normals if we scroll down on the overlays option we can turn on face normals

106
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.270
and look at their size and with this orientation it's very difficult to see them but there they are

107
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:39.560
and both in Look Dev mode and solid shaded mode rendering mode under the shading option there's an option

108
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.360
for black face culling if you turn on any faces that would appear transparent in other programs will

109
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.390
go transparent.

110
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.800
So it's a good way of catching normals that have been accidentally flipped especially when you're editing

111
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.220
scaling and moving things around.

112
00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:01.780
And with that in mind comes your challenge Okay so your challenge is to open up the lecture resources.

113
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.030
I'll show you where is in the moment.

114
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.760
If you're not sure download the normal mass zip file extract and open up the normal mass blend file

115
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.270
and then once you've done that I'd like you to go ahead and fix any inward facing normals.

116
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.240
And while still there do you notice anything odd about the interface when you open up that particular

117
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.390
blend file.

118
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:27.220
Think about it and if you want to you can correct it if not you can just accept how it is on that particular

119
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:33.310
file and if you're wondering lecture resources are up in the top left click on resources available and

120
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.770
you'll be able to navigate to those resources.

121
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.970
So go ahead pause video now and give us a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

122
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.540
Let's go ahead now and fix these inward facing normals over in Blender.

123
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:46.820
OK.

124
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.830
So let's do this challenge.

125
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.030
I've already downloaded normal mass I'm going to drag it into blender and select open.

126
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:52.830
OK.

127
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:58.360
So with this file open one of the first things that you may spot is that the layout is ever so slightly

128
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.020
different.

129
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.060
So what is going on here.

130
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.670
Well if we have a look.

131
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.120
The header bar is now at the bottom.

132
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:11.980
Now the reason why I'm giving you the file like this is to show you that your file remembers where you

133
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.720
put things.

134
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.150
It doesn't just go back to its default layout.

135
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:20.470
So if you have saved your files especially earlier blender files if you're bringing them in it's just

136
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.000
a reminder here that if the header bar was on the bottom before when you open it back up the header

137
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.320
bar will still be at the bottom.

138
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.790
Now to be consistent with the rest of the course what I'm going to make sure I do here is just right

139
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.780
click and flip it to the top.

140
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.400
And there we go.

141
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.530
It looks exactly the same as it did before.

142
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.130
So there are a couple of ways that we could go about doing this.

143
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.800
Now in order to edit the normals that are wrong we're going to have to be an edit mode.

144
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:48.400
But to make sure that I know what's going on I'm going to go to overlays and turn on face orientation

145
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.600
and boom straight away.

146
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.340
We can see that the whole bottom face here in several squares are facing the wrong direction.

147
00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:00.580
So we don't really need to do anything else there but you could also with Edit Mode Selector gone in

148
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:07.360
and gone all the way down until we've got the option of normals turn on face normals and turn their

149
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.840
signs up and it's very quick and easy to see which ones are facing the wrong way.

150
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.010
And finally of course we could be in Look Dev mode and make sure blackface Cummings turned on and they

151
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:24.490
really do stand out at that point I want to turn back to solid shade and blackface Cowlings at the top

152
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.390
as we can see there.

153
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.180
And then of course I've got one of two options I can select faces individually if I wanted to but in

154
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:37.450
this case in the press the A key to select all shift in N and hopefully all of the normals will now

155
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.430
be pointing outwards.

156
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.860
Brilliant.

157
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.250
So there we go we've covered normals in actually quite a bit of detail right down at the fundamentals

158
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.350
of how they handled in Blender.

159
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:54.220
Now this may have seemed quite simple but later on in the course and during your time with Blender you're

160
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.320
going to end up with some inverted normals and whether it's with modifiers whether it's with the particle

161
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.810
system or if you're exporting it to a game engine if you don't watch out for inverted normals it can
