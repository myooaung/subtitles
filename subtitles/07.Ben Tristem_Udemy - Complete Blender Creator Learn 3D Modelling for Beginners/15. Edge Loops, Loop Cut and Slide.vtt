Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.490
In this lecture we are going to focus on a loop cuts and slide and that's going to enable us to slice
2

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.800
through our model and add extra geometry.
3

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.210
That's going to be incredibly useful as we can see on our model here we've got a little entrance way
4

5
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.490
at the top here we can modify that later to have more detail in it but more importantly we've got an
5

6
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.270
area here that we can now start using to create some steps.
6

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.720
Now we're going to have some smaller steps running up and down here but the first thing to do of course
7

8
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.680
is to chop the entire thing in half like that in two specific places so that we can start modelling those
8

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.060
stairs later on.
9

10
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.750
Let's find out more and hop on over into the blender.
10

11
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.430
Okay so we've got our default cube in front of us and we'll work with the default cube initially and
11

12
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.580
then we'll explore a couple of other shapes as well to see the impact of loop cutting and where it will
12

13
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.690
work and where it will not work.
13

14
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.170
So in front of us here is the default cube we go into edit mode because we're going to be editing, now
14

15
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.620
loop cutting you can find that if you scroll down it's here loop cuts and if I hover over its control
15

16
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.610
and R is the shortcut key I tend to use control and R when I do that you get this yellow line that
16

17
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.990
comes along and shows you exactly where that new geometry where we're going to slice through our model.
17

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.650
Now what I can do is I can click straight away and then it gives me the option to slide backwards and
18

19
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.490
forwards.
19

20
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.230
And if you've inadvertently moved and you do want it directly in the middle you can either press 0
20

21
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.810
to lock it to zero or you can press escape and it will cancel the sliding that you were doing but it
21

22
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.950
won't stop the cuts that's already been done.
22

23
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.100
If we open up the loop cuts and slide we see that we've got a couple of options in the operator panel.
23

24
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.800
We can actually increase the number of cuts that are there pretty useful.
24

25
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.960
And we can change some of the other options in it as well.
25

26
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.810
I'm going to do that for the moment though we just want to work on our simple cuts.
26

27
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.980
Now if I press control and R again you can see that we can still cut it in various places and we can
27

28
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.930
even bisect the cuts that we've already done.
28

29
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.790
Now if I pick another area and instead of clicking just use my scroll wheel you can see I can increase
29

30
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.740
the number of cuts straight away.
30

31
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.080
And there we go.
31

32
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.560
And if I did that once more along our cube we get ourselves it's divided into subsections pretty
32

33
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.180
awesome.
33

34
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.280
And you can see here I've got five one side and four on all the rest I intended to get five sorry four
34

35
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.800
and well I missed it anyway you can see how I divided up the previous cube when we were discussing normals
35

36
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.740
so those are the basics of how to use a loop cuts to slice up your object that question is why would
36

37
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.100
you want to do that and what is it about loops.
37

38
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.870
Well with loops it enables you to edit your model incredibly quickly because it enables a path of geometry
38

39
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.200
around your model and as your models get more complex the topology how a model is put together with
39

40
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.260
its vertices edges and faces becomes more and more critical what you do want is is much geometry as
40

41
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.160
is necessary to represent the shape you want but not so much that it becomes a bit of a pain in the
41

42
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.000
backside and there are often modifiers that will do what you want to do without adding extra unnecessary
42

43
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.800
geometry let's get rid of the cube that we've just done and this time have a look at a UV sphere and
43

44
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.770
if we go into edit mode we see that it has a series of loop cuts essentially already going round it
44

45
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.210
so we have a band going around the objects which are called rings when you go ahead and add a UV sphere
45

46
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.480
so they've already been cut in and if I go ahead and just clear the selection with either alt and a
46

47
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.790
or a double tap of the A I can then hold down control an R and we can see that we get the additional
47

48
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.750
loops that we're used to but haven't noticed there as we get a vertical cut it doesn't go all the way
48

49
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.990
around our model whereas the ones going around our model do actually continue all the way around and
49

50
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.830
it does this because blender doesn't know how you want to cut that.
50

51
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.650
Now intuitively you would you probably say you and I let's just press escape so we can go and look down
51

52
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.810
on our model pressure control and R again you probably say well we needed to just continue over the
52

53
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:27.490
other way but the top of this sphere is a vertex and all of these current segments all meet at that
53

54
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.270
one point blender simply does not know which way to continue because it does not know your intentions
54

55
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.160
and it can't guess.
55

56
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.470
So it just doesn't do so we just end up with it cut in half there and if we wanted the other half we
56

57
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.170
would have to find the appropriate location and do so but if we zoom in even further you'll see that
57

58
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.760
this face that's highlighted and this face here don't have a cut in them as we would expect and that
58

59
00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.820
is something to watch out with more complex models and we'll talk about how we can mitigate this problem
59

60
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.680
later on in the course when we get some more complex models because there are ways that you can have
60

61
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.240
a sphere like this and still be able to loop cut all the way around.
61

62
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.310
Now before I go and give you your challenge I'm going to add in a cube again go into edit mode and talk
62

63
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.720
about the loop cutting again because on certain shapes it can be very difficult to end up cutting evenly
63

64
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.720
about a central place and that's about and that is what we're about to do.
64

65
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.140
So in this cube for instance I can put in two cuts like so.
65

66
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.540
However on our pyramid we're going to have a slightly different type of cuts and we don't want it flaring
66

67
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.720
out at the bottom which will happen on our pyramid.
67

68
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.620
So in order to really replicate that Let's undo it and just scale in the top here.
68

69
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.430
Now when we go ahead and add two loop cuts you can see that the top parts of it in the bottom parts
69

70
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.880
it flares out.
70

71
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.740
And we want two dead parallel lines going down.
71

72
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.360
That is not easy to achieve by fiddling about with the settings we could try.
72

73
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.910
Even we could try flipped to you know you can you can try and adjust these to your heart's content and
73

74
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.210
you just won't get there.
74

75
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:19.650
Now if you recall in the insetting lecture I was talking about placing geometry temporarily on top
75

76
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.020
of other geometry and that can be incredibly useful for this particular instance.
76

77
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.320
So this is a work around thinking about our model.
77

78
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.470
So if I clear down that loop cut and add a loop cut but do nothing to it and then I can add another
78

79
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.470
loop cut and but it right up against the other one.
79

80
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:45.480
This now gives us two loop cuts that we can go G and Y and move them a set distance apart from one another
80

81
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.510
and they're still dead straight and parallel.
81

82
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:56.580
Very useful for getting those straight deadlines when we have a model that has an uneven top and bottom
82

83
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.930
to it.
83

84
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.720
And one final thing before we get onto the challenge here and when you've got to on top of each other
84

85
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.690
like this we're going to have to go G and X to move them apart.
85

86
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.010
If it ends up horrible and hashed like that you're actually pushing geometry inside itself.
86

87
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.870
You'll want to avoid doing that.
87

88
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.330
So let's pull this back out this way and of course we can type in a number there negative number of
88

89
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.030
possible here it's going to be about point five to pull it in to a negative place.
89

90
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:31.620
Now you may go around your model then selecting by holding down shift all of these other edges and then
90

91
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:38.160
moving it the great thing about having a loop cut is you can select all of the edges within that loop
91

92
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.940
by holding down Alt first and then clicking on the edge.
92

93
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.630
Super useful and it's going to be pretty necessary.
93

94
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.410
I don't fancy clicking all of the edges around the pyramid.
94

95
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.680
That would take quite a while.
95

96
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.720
So now we've covered that.
96

97
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.640
It's time for your challenge
97

98
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.300
Okay so your challenge is using loop cuts.
98

99
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.630
Place two cuts on the Mayan pyramid.
99

100
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.560
Ensure that those cuts are parallel and place them one meter.
100

101
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.800
Either side of the central point of the pyramid creating two cuts.
101

102
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:17.670
That are two meters apart and I'll just refresh your memory on what that's going to look like now.
102

103
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.610
Okay so by the end of the challenge you will have two parallel cuts running through your pyramid.
103

104
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.910
We can see that all the way around.
104

105
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:31.250
And if I look at it from the side dead on we can see that it's exactly two meters wide at the bottom.
105

106
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:37.300
So go ahead pause a video now and give that a g.o Okay everybody Welcome back.
106

107
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.930
Let's go ahead now and create our parallel cuts on our pyramid.
107

108
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.120
Okay everybody Welcome back.
108

109
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.280
So we've got our pyramid here.
109

110
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.120
This is going to be very straightforward to create these cut so I'll go ahead and do it straight away.
110

111
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:55.090
So control and R, now is very tempting as I said before to just scroll up and add two cuts in that's
111

112
00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:00.970
not going to work so we're going to keep it as one I'm going to loop cuts again and then push it all
112

113
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.640
the way up against as we did with the cube.
113

114
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.500
Now that I've done I need to move around to the appropriate side which in this case is the right.
114

115
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:15.400
Now if you have happened to put your cuts down front to back that does not matter at all in this case
115

116
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.460
I'm going to be locking to the Y axis.
116

117
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.790
Now I'm going to press G and Y to move this about and we can see that we get this horrible hashing.
117

118
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.290
Now that's me pushing the model inside itself.
118

119
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.360
We don't want to do that.
119

120
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:34.270
So I'm going to have to move this one in a negative direction so I'm going to go minus one.
120

121
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.450
And there we go.
121

122
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:42.460
This other one I'm going to go ahead and select and you can select a loop that you've made by holding
122

123
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.800
down alt and clicking on it.
123

124
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:51.380
Now that you've done that go G T and one and there we go.
124

125
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:57.950
We have moved everything so we've got two meters we've cut the entire thing in half and we're all done.
125

126
00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.110
Brilliant.
126

127
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.110
How did you guys get on.
127

128
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.420
Hope your pyramids are coming along really well going to start adding some extra details to it soon
128

129
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.280
which is really going to flesh it out and make it look more convincing and I will see you all in the
129

130
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.910
next lecture.
