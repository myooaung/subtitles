00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.620
Welcome to a three point lighting so lighting our subject is incredibly important.

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.570
In fact if we don't light it.

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.980
We can't see what's going on.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.380
Now my scene contains no direct lighting as of yet there are no lamps in the scene.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.890
There's some environmental lighting that I've bumped up to just a sort of a white background there.

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.220
Just so I can see what was going on.

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.810
But I think is the time that we take control of the lighting to give it a better appearance.

8
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.560
Now lighting is great it can change the feel and look of a scene very dramatically and very quickly

9
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.290
as swell.

10
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.680
We've probably all done that thing where you hold a torch under your chin and suddenly you're all scary.

11
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.830
But it was in front of you you just squint your right so it can change a lot.

12
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.870
And a lot can be learned from photography and video or graphy as well because we're using the cycle's

13
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.860
render engine.

14
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.130
It basically follows the same rules that real lighting does.

15
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.400
So we mimic and take some lessons from actual photography and video or graphy.

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.460
We're going to get much better renders at the end.

17
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.720
Now when using cycles lighting should be set up as it would be in the real world for best results so

18
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.630
bear that in mind if you ever seen a photo studio or you've ever had professional photos taken you'll

19
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.140
know that they have all sorts of special lights all over the place and that is to make things look really

20
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.130
and now in the in the real world if you're out and about in the middle of a field you don't generally

21
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.090
have spotlights but you can still have lighting.

22
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.790
In addition to help bring out a much better model.

23
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.680
Three point lighting is a common lighting method.

24
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.320
It's where there are three lights in a scene and we'll go through those.

25
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.070
Now there's the key light the fill light and the back light.

26
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.220
Now those three lights the key light is the main light.

27
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.800
It's going to be often the brightest one in the scene itself.

28
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.360
The film light is usually off to the side and you don't have to quite take off his configuration but

29
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.310
is usually off to the side.

30
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.490
On the other side of the camera and the back lights or sometimes called a hair light is a behind the

31
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.990
subject itself.

32
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.660
So lets us have a quick look at how we might lay this out.

33
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.400
I mean this is highly symmetrical.

34
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.210
You don't have to do anything like this as long as you sort of follow the same principle.

35
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.970
So we have our subject or object in the middle and weve got a camera straight facing it.

36
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.800
Now weve got a key light.

37
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.930
This is going to be our brightest light.

38
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.910
Weve got a fill light and thats going to be slightly dimmer and then we have a back light as well and

39
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.630
I've put that off to the side.

40
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.990
Of course you can move these lights around depending on the feel that you want.

41
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.080
You can even have the back light brighter than the key light all the film lights if necessary so you

42
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.650
can play with these to your heart's content of course just a standard ratio here.

43
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.550
I tend to go something like 5 3 1 so the key lies five times five times or level five and then we've

44
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.960
got the Phil lie of three so we could have a key light of strength.

45
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.990
Five hundred Phil why three hundred bachleda of 100 but I will play with those and see what it comes

46
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.420
out like.

47
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.490
Does it give me the the lighting I need for the scene that some are working on.

48
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.860
So I'm going to hop now straight into a challenge for you guys who know how to place lamps now to tweak

49
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.780
lamps so it's time to go and set up your scene lighting so set up a three point lighting setup.

50
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.200
Try some different types of lamps.

51
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.340
You don't have to use just point lamps.

52
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.180
You could try an area lamp you could try using in a missive surface if you wanted to do that.

53
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.190
Try different coloured lamps.

54
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.950
And I do suggest being subtle.

55
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.300
If you put it bright red it will tint your entire model red so end it will go into actually making things

56
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.550
absolute colours in a later lecture.

57
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.630
Now decide whether you want any ambient lights at the moment I've got that environmental light turned

58
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.620
top white and that itself is going to be too bright for me so I'm actually content and all the way down

59
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.450
the black and just focus on the lighting itself and I will.

60
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.200
I might bring a bit of ambient light in back in if the three point lighting I set up is not really suitable

61
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.660
or doesn't give me the effect that I want or there are some areas that are too dark.

62
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.890
Remember light also bounces off surfaces and we don't have any surfaces last seen at the moment.

63
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.170
So darker areas can be illuminated with one.

64
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.950
So yes we can put in the same ambient light some environmental light once again but we could also put

65
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.990
in a surface and since the basket is sitting on probably a plinth at the end of the day I could put

66
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.410
a little Clane underneath so we get a bit of bounce lighting so the underside of the the mouth sort

67
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.400
of like the chin area does get some light and if that is something that is used in photography they

68
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.450
will hold reflective material lower down beneath the person take having a photo taken so the light bounces

69
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.500
and hits the underside of their face.

70
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.450
See don't get any harsh shadows.

71
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.480
So go ahead.

72
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.880
Pause a video now and set up your scene lighting.

73
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.680
Okay guys.

74
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.570
Welcome back.

75
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.040
Let's go ahead and set up some three point lighting over in blender.

76
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.110
Okay so we're back over in blender here.

77
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.580
And the first thing I want to do is just expand the outliner.

78
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.570
Oh we do in fact have a lamp in my scene it looks like I completely forgot it was there.

79
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.830
So I thought I'd removed it.

80
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.110
I just hit the net and there's the camera as well so let's first of all set the camera up looking straight

81
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.250
at my mannequin.

82
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.330
I'm going to use the walkaround feature to move it around.

83
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.950
There we go I'm happy with that shot.

84
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.870
Then we can switch quickly to rent mode to see what's going on.

85
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.090
Okay.

86
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.200
And we can see here that that's where that light is hitting in the fact I'm going to leave that one

87
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.020
and call it backlight because that's what it is.

88
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.800
Now I'm going to duplicate that's twice.

89
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.460
Okay.

90
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.760
Brilliant.

91
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.350
And um I come out of this rendered mode for the moment and lets you go to the top and move things about

92
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.860
now.

93
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.740
I've just got a a.

94
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.800
A point light source here at the moment I'm going to move these around.

95
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.440
So I'm going to stick exactly to my my diagram earlier and have the key light.

96
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:56.820
On the left there the film lights on the right now because my arm or my mannequin itself is actually

97
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.560
quite a large mannequin.

98
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.720
I'm probably going to end up scaling the lighting up either the strength of that lighting quite considerably

99
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.260
as well.

100
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.230
But let's see what it's looking like now from the camera view and I'm gonna use a render border because

101
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.860
my computer is not particularly quick when doing this type of rendering.

102
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.830
Scana in here.

103
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.110
Okay so what we've got at the moment is obviously it's quite dimly lit still.

104
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.660
So let's go to the key light.

105
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.730
First of all and go to its properties.

106
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.110
Now we can play with these.

107
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:38.230
We can make it a oh the key light is coming in from over there vye renamed things bad Layng key like

108
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.550
Phil writes.

109
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.590
I wouldn't leave them as point lights for the moment.

110
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:50.540
Let's start with the film lights have a used nodes and I'm going to make the colour of it sly.

111
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.670
I have a slight yellow eating in fact I'm going to have it massively yellow and then reduce it in a

112
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.780
bit just so we can demonstrate what is going on.

113
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.270
Someone to turn that up to let's say a thousand.

114
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.590
Okay oh sorry I'm playing with Phil light at the moment so let's call this Phil White.

115
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.570
So I know.

116
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.370
Because these are the Phil right.

117
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.480
Propertys.

118
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.800
So I'm going to make that one actually slightly blue so I can see that's coming in from the right hand

119
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.710
side.

120
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.570
Now the key lights I'm going to make that slightly yellow.

121
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.610
They use the nose and I'm going to pump mats up to 2000.

122
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.430
And then finally the backlight itself.

123
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.650
I'm going to leave it as white for the moments I can see what's going to.

124
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.520
And as you can see here the blue in yellow I actually go quite well together.

125
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.750
I'm going to turn this up too.

126
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.820
That's two.

127
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.950
Eight hundred and again I'm I'm just playing here which you can see that does.

128
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:58.130
If I turn it on and off is it give us a highlight to those very dark areas which otherwise it wouldn't

129
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.350
actually get any lights of course.

130
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.830
You can try some other lighting if you try spots or some such.

131
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.430
You need to work round sun.

132
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.450
It doesn't matter where it is in your scene any way.

133
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:14.840
I'm going to stick the point lights for the moment because it gives me a little more freedom about moving

134
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:21.200
things about now I don't want quite as contrast to yellow and blue as we have there something to go

135
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:28.190
back to my key light and with a name Mickey light as well under the lamp properties.

136
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.320
And whereas backlights I can name that properly as well.

137
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.410
Oh.

138
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.330
Back loit Okay so now we've got the the three lights in the scene set up.

139
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.750
We can fiddle about with them a little some are going to have it that blow and then to reduce it down

140
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.760
to a more subtle blow.

141
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.450
And the key light among them have bright yellow even that's very stylized.

142
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.350
That would work in certain conditions.

143
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:59.660
But I don't want it obviously if I sense set something up as 100 percent red or 100 percent yellow it's

144
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.640
going to cause a few issues and especially trying to identify the skin colour itself.

145
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.400
If you start tainting it with Will is it is the skin greener is the light in green you know.

146
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.320
So.

147
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.310
Just a slightly off white there.

148
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.280
Okay that is starting to look pretty good.

149
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:26.020
Now one thing I can see here is there's some pretty heavy shadowing there's heavy shed doing under the

150
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.500
chin.

151
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.560
We can see that now what I'm going to do here if before I actually start in do any bounce lights is

152
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:39.380
just notice the height of these lamps and lower them down so they're roughly eye level on both sides.

153
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:45.060
I'm happy with this one being slightly higher but I am going to centralize it a little as well.

154
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.500
So let's zoom back in and see what difference that has made.

155
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.990
Okay that's made it much better but the still quite harsh shadow just here.

156
00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:01.180
So we could do with having some bounce lights actually happening and we can set that off scene quite

157
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.820
easily and we're going to create two planes so it bounces were the first planes going to be roughly

158
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:12.820
underneath and we'll see if I can do this in the sort of alive manner so we can see the rendering as

159
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.790
it happens.

160
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:19.220
So get rid of those tools shelves and properties pain.

161
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.630
And there we go.

162
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:27.270
So I can see what's going on rendering wise over there so let's go ahead and add a plane.

163
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.370
It happens to be off this list.

164
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.260
There we go.

165
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:37.490
And I'm just going to scale that up and we can see straight away with if we have a look at the chin

166
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.390
over here having the plane off it's a lot darker than having it on.

167
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.560
And then we've got this area at the top here.

168
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:52.670
Now in terms of the the first one to do is just literally lift our lamp up a little and probably increase

169
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.570
its strength a little as well.

170
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.580
Okay.

171
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.100
Starting to look good other ways around my model going to come out of that mode.

172
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.990
Okay so that is quite high at the moment.

173
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:12.070
I mean that's the other thing I can do is literally make a hair light by having it quite high above.

174
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.260
That's looking good.

175
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.950
So I got this quite harsh shadow here that may be because this isn't bright enough.

176
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.060
There we go.

177
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.750
We do want some shadowing because shadowing helps emphasize features.

178
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:32.400
But of course at the same time we want to watch and make sure that we don't have too harsh a shadow.

179
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.910
Now the other thing we can do with this plane underneath is actually rotate it.

180
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:45.400
Rotating around the X axis for instance and that can change the bounce of the lighting itself as we're

181
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.670
going to leave it flat because this is going to be where it sat.

182
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:54.100
And unless you're going to make it a bit smaller in so it's almost as if the plinth that it sat on and

183
00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:00.580
I'm not going to worry about it intersecting too much but let's make it into a plinth as well.

184
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.420
Whilst we're here.

185
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.670
There we go.

186
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.280
It's not a very good plinth is it.

187
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.730
It's not that central to the busts.

188
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.260
There's no chest at the moment.

189
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.120
That whole area needs coming forward.

190
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.950
By the looks of things specially if I look from the side.

191
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.740
You say that's a very narrow chest line that needs sorting out.

192
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.920
But there we go we've got our three point lighting set up.

193
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.290
We got the camera set up as well so we can see what's going on.

194
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.800
This is looking pretty good so far.

195
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.950
We're not going to need some more details.

196
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.340
As only the eyes are rabbits.

197
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.850
Well white at the moment and nothing else.

198
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.120
But we're getting there is starting to come together really nicely.

199
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.560
How is yours coming on.

200
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.430
Please share in the discussions.

201
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.310
All up before I go.

202
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:56.610
I do need to name this plinth Mary I don't get told off for having something that's not named properly.

203
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.660
And as always I will see you guys in the next lecture.
