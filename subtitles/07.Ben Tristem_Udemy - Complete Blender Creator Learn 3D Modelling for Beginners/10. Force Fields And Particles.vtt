00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.830
Welcome to force fields and particles.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.660
So what are they won't force fields are not SHIELDS that will protect you against anything but they

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.720
are a way of exerting different forces onto our models.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.250
And specifically we're going to have a look at particles in this lecture they affect particles more

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.240
so than meche objects were play would mesh objects.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.650
In the next lecture.

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.190
Now they do not affect themselves or an object if they are part of the physics for that object.

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.900
And we see that in closer detail.

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.650
Once we hop on over in a blender.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.660
Okay so now that we're over in blender Let's go ahead and first of all make sure that when we're using

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.990
the force field itself are no other forces in our scene could be playing with it.

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:56.750
So first of all let's go ahead and pop on a particle system so let's select ucu first particles.

13
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.410
A new particle system.

14
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.770
Now I'm going to set the lifetime to 200 so they do not disappear and moschonas at the end of our scene

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.380
two hundred two.

16
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.610
So let's go ahead first of all before we even add a forcefield Let's go and play our animation.

17
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.370
So the first thing we can see here is they are falling and that's because gravity on the scene is turned

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.090
on.

19
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.670
So in this case I'm going to turn gravity off some going to go to the scene menu and it's seen properties

20
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.490
here and go down to gravity and just until the gravity box.

21
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.400
Okay.

22
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.900
So now the particles are still moving so there must be some force acting upon them.

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
Now what could that force be.

24
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.270
Well I'm not going to get you to guess at this point because it's hidden deep in the particle setting

25
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.590
So let's go ahead and switch back to the particle properties and scroll down.

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.690
And at some point down here we get to velocity.

27
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.570
So they're having an initial velocity normal to the faces that they're being emitted from of one.

28
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.210
Now I'm going to set that down to zero.

29
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:07.200
Now as the particles come alive and over frame one two hundred they just get stuck to the face of our

30
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.790
model.

31
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.560
So I'm just going to lower that down to 50 so they all appear in the first quarter of our scene of our

32
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.210
little animation that we're playing.

33
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.060
Okay.

34
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.440
So there are a couple of ways of adding force fields.

35
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.180
One is to the object itself.

36
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.190
Now this cube is the emitter of those particles.

37
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.340
Therefore if we go and add a forcefield to it it does not affect the particles that are being emitted.

38
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:42.000
If we duplicate this cube over here we can see Virts let's just let the whole animation reset.

39
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.630
Okay.

40
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.020
There they're actually pushing each other's particles away because of the forcefield itself.

41
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.210
Now let's have a closer look at the force field settings so let's scroll down here so we've got a strength

42
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.890
of one.

43
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.410
Let's go back to the top.

44
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.840
Jumping ahead there.

45
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.810
So we've got what type of forcefield is it.

46
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.450
And there are lots to pick from.

47
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.420
Only to leave it as force for the moment.

48
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.870
It's a point force.

49
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.540
And with all the settings left there's the fault.

50
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.460
It will be as if the force itself is being pumped out in every direction.

51
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.290
Equally we've got the strength of the force now the force strength can be negative and positive.

52
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.180
So the moment this cube on the right is pushing away the particles of the cube on the left.

53
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.670
However we can if we type in minus one it'll actually suck them in.

54
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.250
Now the particles themselves will not actually impact of Cube yet because we've not set it to have collision.

55
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.070
If we clicked the collision as well we should see the particles hit the surface and start bouncing off

56
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.910
and deflecting and then being attracted back again.

57
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.830
So this could be great for some sort of I don't know orbital mechanics we are trying to get something

58
00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.460
to follow around in fact on this particular cube itself we can see that they're just falling out of

59
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.410
the faces.

60
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.640
But in the particle settings themselves we can scroll down a little the where we set the velocity to

61
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.180
zero where we can say in the x and y direction equally so come out towards us towards the viewer itself.

62
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.850
We can set that I don't know at five and five and let's see what happens when we reset the frame.

63
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.700
They're being thrown out this direction in fact because it's the same particle system that was a bit

64
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.660
strong Let's go down to one and one or not five and one does one and one and reset and see what happens

65
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.900
then.

66
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.780
So they're being thrown out and then they're being sucked in and they'll probably orbit around this

67
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.960
until well until they actually hit it or our animation runs out as we can see there.

68
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.330
So that's now sucking them in towards this.

69
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.050
So that's great.

70
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.910
We can see that they don't affect each other's particles.

71
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.110
However they do affect other particle systems.

72
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.720
Now there are a couple of things that you can do.

73
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.720
Say we didn't want this to happen but we wanted it to curve away anyway.

74
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:10.090
We can set up our particular emitter and set up the forcefield separately and that's the second way

75
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.390
of adding a force field to our models.

76
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.330
Someone had the leave the other cube for the moment and were going to try and get the same thing going.

77
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.970
But would just this individual one so selected it and I'm going to turn off the forcefield which because

78
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.940
it's not doing anything for us.

79
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.680
He's not changing the direction of these particles.

80
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.320
However if we go ahead and add a force field.

81
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.630
So that's the admen you just like you would add a new mesh object or curve etc..

82
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.450
We've got the option to have a forcefield and it will be added whether 3D cursor is.

83
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.170
And because I haven't moved the 3D cursor it's going to appear smack bang in the middle of our cubes.

84
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.180
Let's go ahead and add a forcefield.

85
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.790
The same one again just a forcefield and that attracts so I'm going to go from minus one on this force

86
00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.690
and hopefully our hat so there's not enough ejection force this time round so in that case we're going

87
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.730
to have to make it so would go back to the Q.

88
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.410
Go back to the particle system.

89
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.660
Scroll down to where we have the velocity I think I was actually there anyway so the velocity here is

90
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.950
just being emitted in the it says x direction there that's just check this cube particle just 0 x and

91
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.900
y I was misreading.

92
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.640
So let's set it going off in the x and y direction.

93
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.900
Let's set it up.

94
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.900
Let's try five.

95
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.470
This time it doesn't seem too strong.

96
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.690
Okay so OK they're being chucked out quite a ways.

97
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.390
But they will eventually come back as we can see this slowing down and starting to group and come back.

98
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.790
So five was obviously still too strong.

99
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.640
I'm going to try to leave it at that for the moment.

100
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.460
So we've got this these particles being for south of the system and then being sucked back in which

101
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.580
is pretty cool.

102
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.010
There we go.

103
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.060
They're coming back again.

104
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:58.090
So that could be you know something being ejected from our model itself and in fact we can do in explode

105
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.070
with those as well and have some sort of funky explosion going on unlike what's going on here so far.

106
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:12.470
Now in order to make sure that this particular cube itself and the force feel the air that's within

107
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.640
sort of the emission we need to make sure it kind of stays together and in which case we can literally

108
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.800
we can see here it's a field.

109
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:28.480
It's got the same symbol as an empty and we can drag that in to the cube and make it the parent of the

110
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.810
cube.

111
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:36.160
Then wherever we move the actual cube itself the simulation I suppose is still running from the same

112
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.860
point.

113
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.080
Brilliant.

114
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.290
You can of course move them individually if you select individually.

115
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.020
So I'm just going to.

116
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.650
Undo those couple of moves.

117
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:50.380
Okay so we're back at this point here what happens now if we have more than one of these because they

118
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.860
are self affecting and they would affect others.

119
00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:00.910
So let's go ahead and duplicate that cube and pop one here one here and one here.

120
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.150
We should start getting some interesting effects.

121
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.200
Because these are all emitting However only one of them is attracting.

122
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:15.670
So you can start to get some really interesting orbits going on or suctions or whatever you actually

123
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.500
wanted to do.

124
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.940
Of course we all know that these particles themselves can be changed to be objects as well so that could

125
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.350
be a swarm of bees or whatever he wanted it to be swarming around that central cube.

126
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.280
Okay.

127
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.030
So armed with that knowledge I've got a quick challenge for you.

128
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.920
Okay I would like you to go ahead and dissolve a cube.

129
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.500
So set up a cube that will break in two blocks of pieces.

130
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.680
I do recommend setting it up in a zero gravity environment initially just to get the hang of what's

131
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.450
going on.

132
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:56.160
If you have any gravity whatsoever things will just be poured southwards in negative z direction by

133
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.800
default.

134
00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.130
Course if you go ahead and change the gravity to a different direction it will disappear in a different

135
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.850
direction.

136
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:10.800
So use a force field to break the cube up into little pieces as if it was be made out of fragile sand

137
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.040
and it was just eroding away.

138
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.650
Borzov video now and give that a go.

139
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.140
Okay guys welcome back.

140
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.660
Let's go dissolve a cube over in blender.

141
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.780
Okay so this is where I left off here.

142
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.470
This is where we've got some particles being emitted.

143
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.520
Now we can use those particles obviously to dissolve cubes.

144
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.460
Now we need the cube itself to be in multiple pieces and to make sure that I'm not repeating myself

145
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.510
a you're going to use the scene I've got set up here because I think that would be quite interesting

146
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.100
watching it being blown apart and then swirling around this central bets.

147
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:56.830
I'm going to literally make sure all of these cubes have the same meshed data.

148
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.780
So all of these are obviously different objects.

149
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.310
Do they have all different mesh objects or mesh data.

150
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.280
Yes they have.

151
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.020
So I'm literally going to switch them all to just cube.

152
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.930
So a bit of a time consuming thing but it's not going to take too long.

153
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.980
There's not too many of them.

154
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.410
Of course I could have just selected them all and made a link to them.

155
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:21.090
So there's lots of ways of doing things in blender are chosen to do a little long handedly.

156
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.730
Never mind.

157
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:27.210
Okay so all of these are sharing the same mesh data which should mean if I go into that mesh data and

158
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.410
subdivide I'm gone.

159
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:35.240
Press Dubey there is term a keystrokes I'm going to press Dubie there and that subdivide and going to

160
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.310
open a tall shelf and how many cuts are we going to do.

161
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:43.440
Well bear in mind this is going to be multiplied by five times as well.

162
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.170
I'm going to go for maybe 250 cuts.

163
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.680
Well is that going to be too many might know though.

164
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.360
That's tiny.

165
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.960
Oh how.

166
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.200
How many faces is this produced 61000.

167
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.810
Yes that's going to be a bit too many that's going to slow down my computer something chronic.

168
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.010
So let's try 15.

169
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.590
Yeah that's a much better.

170
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.250
Fifteen thousand faces.

171
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.690
OK.

172
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.170
So now I've done that.

173
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.310
Every other one should also be 15000 faces.

174
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.120
Sure.

175
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.300
So we have got how many phases in total.

176
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.350
Eighty thousand.

177
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:16.540
OK.

178
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.630
And these are all sharing the same set up.

179
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:25.260
So we should have no trouble at all making all the settings to say some let's you can add the explode

180
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.010
modifier to our first mesh here.

181
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.610
Excellent.

182
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.820
And a way it goes it's orbiting properly.

183
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.470
Excellent.

184
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.430
And it's it should be a matter now of adding the explode modifier to these other bits.

185
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.840
So modifier explode modifier explode.

186
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:49.890
Again I could make links across or it's starting to slow down now so perhaps I had a few too many.

187
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.580
Anyway that's that's a good start isn't it.

188
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.530
So there we go.

189
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:54.960
Okay.

190
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.060
Some may be too many there but we can see the cubes rule breaking apart and they're all in separate

191
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.940
locations and they all start to orbit round.

192
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:09.090
Now what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to let this run this animation itself for a little bit

193
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:09.500
longer.

194
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.450
Some gear up this and I will see you guys back in a few moments once I've left it cashed all this out

195
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.810
and I'm going to render it out as well just to see what it looks like.

196
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:23.760
Of course cinnamon make sure my details are low so I'm just going to pause it there and before I go

197
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.390
off and disappear I would consider going to show you how I'm going to set this up.

198
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:34.500
I'm going to go to the world properties and set a colour background to basically black so there's no

199
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.700
ambient light in our scene and I'm just going to switch here over surrendered modes it's going to look

200
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.440
like that.

201
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:46.340
Now we've got this sort of bready colour I'm going to go in and pick something a little lighter.

202
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.460
And of course I've got some materials here you can choose a different colour if you want it.

203
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.000
I'm going to go from my terracotta colour mainly because I like fat.

204
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.580
And then finally the light in the scene is all coming from a lamp.

205
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.870
And at this point all of these pieces of course will self shadow one another.

206
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:11.550
But if I go ahead here and we've got sunlamp with a setting of three let's set it a little higher.

207
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.190
Okay that's five let's go for 10.

208
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.570
Okay.

209
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.500
That's getting some real highlights on it.

210
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.000
Now let's zoom in and make sure it's real blowing out.

211
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.010
Okay I like that as well.

212
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.220
OK.

213
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:29.790
A final thing I'm going to do which will tax my computer so I may end up leaving it a while to do the

214
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:35.160
run in fact I'm probably going to do it on my P C which is a bit quicker than my laptop.

215
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:41.700
I'm going to increase the number of particles for each one to the number of faces that are on each cube

216
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.230
and if we remember there were something like 15000.

217
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:50.640
That will give me a lot lot smaller set of particles and I'm going to run that simulation and hopefully

218
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:56.760
get some sort of ring system going around my central point there.

219
00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.040
So I'll see you guys back in a few moments whilst I've sorted that out.

220
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.980
Okay so things have changed not too dramatically.

221
00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:13.010
I've still got a load of cubes that are dissolving but I've replaced that middle one with a sphere and

222
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.320
I've kind of got a young Saturn.

223
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.790
How about that or something else.

224
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.150
Like I have no planet with Square moons that have been broken up anyway.

225
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:27.740
So this was super exciting to bake and when I was making it I was shocked to see the resources it took

226
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.530
up so a word of warning.

227
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:36.070
This particular blend file with all of the cache data for those particles and their movements because

228
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.050
blend the stores that ballooned at 12 gigabytes.

229
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:46.520
Not to mention that blender used well over twenty eight gigabytes worth of RAM when actually rendering

230
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:53.510
this out now suffice to say if I was trying to run that on my GP you there was too much data for that

231
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.570
to handle it just crashed out.

232
00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.530
So this is the sort of thing that if you start getting lots and lots of particles you are going to suffer

233
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:08.350
ram issues vs ram issues even on modest cards like a titan X or something crazy like that.

234
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.900
It's got 12 gigabytes of RAM cost thousands.

235
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.980
So in this case a s.p. you would be the best place to render this on as you can see.

236
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.120
This was lots of fun to make.

237
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:23.270
I hope you guys have made some similarly wacky dissolving of the cubes.

238
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:28.490
Oh so you've gone remember to share that work over on the forums so we can all see it and I will see

239
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.910
you guys in the next lecture.
