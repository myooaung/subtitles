00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,190
So we're going to jump straight into a challenge here and that is to create a window.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,950
So I'd like you to go ahead and create a window in the same style as the door.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,690
Now if you've gone off on a different style then make sure you're matching that and not the one I'm

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,300
making.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,350
You can use any techniques at your disposal.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:30,880
I am very likely to just replicate exactly how I make the door but in a window for now what I would

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,790
like you to do especially if you've used different techniques is write down the major steps you used

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,830
to create.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,110
Now I'm going to say here the window or windows you could have more than one and share how you made

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,790
the window over in the discussions.

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:53,050
I want to see how many variations of construction you guys actually go through Paul's video now and

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,250
give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,890
As hop on over into blender and create a window.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,090
Okay so for this challenge it's almost a repeat of what we've done already.

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,130
In fact I'm going to see if I can reuse my block work that I've got here.

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:16,750
One of the great things about building up a any any scene is having some sort of common features across

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,950
your models.

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,530
Now this is something that I can reuse again and again these big blocks small block and perhaps pop

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,280
some other blocks into my wall in various places.

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,160
However what would be really cool is if we can now use them in an archway perhaps a smaller variety

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,600
or smaller variance of them for Iowa window itself.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,300
So let's go ahead I'm going to hide everything here for the moment and go and grab a copy of the wall

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,290
itself.

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:53,490
So I'm going to duplicate the wall and I'm going to call this a window so WMATA Mary Kay and I'm obviously

26
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,750
going to need to cut a hole in it.

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,010
Let's hide the doorway for the moment.

28
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,090
Now we have to decide whereabouts our hole in is going to be.

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,730
And you know this is part of where I perhaps should have kept the door cutout.

30
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,900
It's not a difficult thing to make but it would have been consistent if I'd gone and grabbed the cutout

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,880
shape that we had made and just made it into a smaller version of itself.

32
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,500
But we can't do that so let's learn from our experience not adding EUV sphere definitely circular.

33
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,670
But I do want to add a cylinder again 32 vertices might be a bit much actually for this particular window

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,540
but we'll stick with it for the moment.

35
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,280
I need to rotate that's around on the y axis by 90.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,710
Oh I do apologize.

37
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,770
It's going to be the access is rotate exorcist by ninety and gonna pop it roughly in the right place

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,420
now its execution is gonna be to Z location too.

39
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,630
Yeah I think that's a pretty good start in the y locations zero is absolutely fine it should be cutting

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,470
everything into.

41
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,780
Okay so how high is our window going to go in fact let's get the basic shape working first.

42
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,460
So we're basically going to delete the lower half of our cylinder here.

43
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,670
Now you can you circle selects if you want as well as that half way.

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:18,910
Yep.

45
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:25,700
That is we don't want to select the halfway point excellent so let's go ahead deletes all of those words

46
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:34,740
sees that leave us with an archway that we can fill up there and also fill up fill up along here.

47
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,520
It does need to be a solid object for the boolean modifier to work for is important.

48
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,800
Okay that looks really good something to lower this down.

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,510
So going back to object man I'm going to slow this down to just one meter off the floor looking good

50
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,210
I'm going to have an archway coming up but I don't want it that wide says go ahead and skeleton on the

51
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,850
x axis.

52
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,620
C is already taking on the arch shape which is awesome.

53
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,300
I'm going to try.

54
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,640
Point five Yeah I think that's okay.

55
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,120
I'm gonna have to have a bit of a window sill there or a lip at the bottom.

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,980
I'm going to not quite go that find the skeleton by point seventy five instead.

57
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:21,510
Okay that has lifted it up ever so slightly.

58
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:29,270
So let's make sure that the face at the bottom is selected and then selects everything else and then

59
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,410
we're going to scale around the active elements are changing a pivot point to the active element.

60
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,480
Now let's scale by point seven five and it won't change its height.

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,230
Okay.

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,110
Let's grab this top edge.

63
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,820
Turn on proportional editing

64
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,570
and I'm going to look at this front on press g z and lift up and I'm just going to turn down some of

65
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,540
the options and set that two meters.

66
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,630
Now it's not quite the shape I wants at the moment.

67
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:10,380
I think what I'm going to do is select all of these edges but that bottom one and then what I can do

68
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,030
is pull everything up.

69
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:23,530
So with this mega g z one well without proportional I think turned on G said one excellence that's lifted

70
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,280
it up who have pushed it back along the y axis.

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,690
Let's try that again GZ 1.

72
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

73
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,270
Is that a little high.

74
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,580
Yes.

75
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,010
Probably I'm not going to get the Arch Way in with that height so GZ point five.

76
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,190
That's a good start.

77
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:49,780
Now let's try pulling that up GZ gonna need proportional editing turned on that looks much better.

78
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,140
And songs that don't make that too big.

79
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,210
I have my arch way.

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,620
Where do I want it going up to well.

81
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,800
Choices choices.

82
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,870
I want to go all almost all the way up and go to about 2.5.

83
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,450
Something like that.

84
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,620
That looks good.

85
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,440
Okay.

86
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,330
So I'm going to cut that out straightaway so I need to select my wall.

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,770
This is still called war.

88
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,730
I want my window and I add a modifier on it.

89
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:26,600
I'm going to use the boolean modifier with the difference being the cylinder do you see this looks a

90
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,400
real mess if we're not careful.

91
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,930
Has that actually come to town.

92
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:38,900
Let's hide our cylinder and also our wall so we don't need that anymore.

93
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,930
Yes perfect.

94
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,190
Okay let's go ahead and apply that and then have a look at the damage what's it done to our mesh.

95
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,260
That's a pretty clean cut through actually I'm I'm pretty impressed with that.

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,100
Okay.

97
00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:01,400
So now we can go ahead and I'm going to grab the window arch so let's go into edit mode on that should

98
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,810
be a lot easier to select.

99
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,880
There we go.

100
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:09,260
It's a lot easier to select because there is no edge loop down there are actually terminates because

101
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,100
this three edges meeting so it just doesn't know where to go.

102
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,830
Excellent.

103
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,130
So I'm going to duplicate that.

104
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,910
I'm going to separate it.

105
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,420
I'm going to immediately convert it to a curve.

106
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,810
Here we go.

107
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,250
And we don't want to keep the original in this particular case.

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,260
And what should we call it.

109
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,240
Let's call it window curve.

110
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:32,980
Okay.

111
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,780
So the window curve.

112
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,110
Let's see if we can just have our block work following it.

113
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,870
So I'm going to lean back archway bricks again but this time it's gonna be window breaks.

114
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:53,520
So that's go ahead enable it so I can see them let's go ahead and select just the archway bricks itself.

115
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,900
I'm going to duplicate those.

116
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,100
So we get archway bricks.

117
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,580
I'm going to call it window bricks.

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm going to hold down shift as I nest under Windows so that's drag set it's as a child of the window

119
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,580
as the curve should be as well.

120
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:16,850
And I think really the bricks should be a child of the curve gives an idea of the hierarchy it's following

121
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,420
the curve.

122
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,290
It's important.

123
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:19,730
Yeah.

124
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,980
I like that.

125
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,320
And we don't need the 0 0 one here.

126
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,240
Okay.

127
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,900
So it's not following the right curve at the moment so we can come in here and pick the window curve.

128
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,750
Ah look at that.

129
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,140
It's amazing it fits.

130
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:39,200
Straight away I'm going to hide my archway bricks and I think this is going to be the wrong way round

131
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,120
when we have a look.

132
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,100
Yes.

133
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,990
So this is an opportunity here to just follow the curve precisely and because we haven't rotated the

134
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,300
curve you can see here that these bricks can actually now face the right way.

135
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,090
So we can go in in edit mode and rotate them I'm going to turn off proportional editing for my own sanity

136
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:09,700
or take them on the z axis to bring them to the right way round and then rotate them on the x axis put

137
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,250
them the right way around this way which isn't 90 degrees probably minus 90.

138
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,210
There we go.

139
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,400
And it's a bit of a mess at the top.

140
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,630
So what can we do here in fact.

141
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,800
Yes it's a bit of a mess in many places a g y will now move it backwards and forwards which makes a

142
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,100
lot of sense g z will move it in announced just like it did before and I only want it going through

143
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,980
ever so slightly but this is where we get an issue here because if you remember we play with the length

144
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,750
and now the length is probably far too much.

145
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,860
So let's play with this until we get it meeting up in the middle which is about right there and then

146
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,800
we can play with the relative offsets as well we can bunch them up together or commit them.

147
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,520
Asked a little looser until we get the merging at the top.

148
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,550
Aha.

149
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,170
Look at that.

150
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,460
Perfect.

151
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,510
That works out really really well.

152
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,650
It looks very similar to the door.

153
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,310
The only thing we don't have at the moment is something along the bottom and there's a couple of ways

154
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,640
of doing that as well.

155
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,870
What I'm going to do in this case is I'm going to d select everything to do it by block work here and

156
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm going to go ahead and just select one of the blocks using the L K will select everything all the

157
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,090
geometry that's linked there and I'm going to duplicate that look I can stack bricks in random places.

158
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,710
I'm going to separate that's by selection I'm just going to call that one brick because it is a lone

159
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,730
Brick.

160
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:48,100
I'm going to remove all of these extra modifiers that are attached to that single brick and the mirror.

161
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,570
I'm going to keep the mirror on for the moment.

162
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,280
Let's go back to this individual brick wall which one was I deleting.

163
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,290
Oh no I was deleting window bricks by mistake.

164
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,590
Let's hope the undo buffer serves me well let's make sure I only have window bricks selected this time

165
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,930
so make sure you are an object mode otherwise we can't swap out that's called this brick.

166
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,980
Delete the array and the curve Phew.

167
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:19,010
Okay let's look at our window straight on and then we can move this to the appropriate location.

168
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,660
Okay.

169
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,610
And let's go ahead and rotate this not in object mode because it's gonna be very difficult to manage.

170
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:33,450
So let's go into edit mode first and rotate and let's set that to a bog standard 90 degrees.

171
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,850
Now how we manage this is entirely up to you.

172
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,510
But I do think that it needs to be here slightly.

173
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,230
It's going to need to come out further so let's scale on the y axis so intersects I think because our

174
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,800
mirror modifier provided we got clipping turned on.

175
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,530
We'll merge those vertices really well.

176
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,680
Okay.

177
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,420
And I'm not sure shall I keep it like that.

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:07,760
Push out a bit further of choices here are big.

179
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,210
So that scale that in the x axis and then just play with it for a moment move on the accesses to here

180
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,690
duplicate that's g.

181
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:29,730
Z No G X g x I can probably merge those together whilst still keeping a decent sized slab on each side.

182
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,010
K That's D select everything.

183
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,210
Press the L kits that's here in scale that on the x axis as well.

184
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,200
And that looks pretty neat.

185
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,350
Not sure if I should have an extra one in the middle or I like it like that.

186
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,320
I don't like the big gap though that needs to.

187
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,390
That needs to be solved.

188
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,560
So let's go ahead and just go g x and push one into the other.

189
00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:01,000
Ever so slightly search just showing a tiny bit of the scene where they join together.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,290
Yeah that's much better.

191
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,490
Yeah I like that.

192
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,870
I'm not sure about this plane area inside at the moment.

193
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:14,050
I think once we've got some texture on it that that will go away and people are really going to be paying

194
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,820
a lot of attention to the window.

195
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,760
Maybe maybe not.

196
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:24,470
But you know what we can start doing very soon after of course you name your objects.

197
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,390
So what I call that Brick I'm going to call this windowsill.

198
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,670
This is no longer just a brick we should look at that we've got an inside and an out which is really

199
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,940
useful.

200
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,760
I really like how that's coming together okay.

201
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,500
So we've got an option here instead of just pushing forward and modelling more and more pieces.

202
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,160
We should really see how these would be.

203
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,590
When we start fitting them together and we'll do that in the next lecture.
