00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome to hiding.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.820
Objects in this video you will learn more about hiding objects in blender and you'll see how to hide

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.200
everything except the objects you want to work on.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.240
So let's jump straight on over in a blender.

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.030
Okay so we're working on a scene that's getting increasingly more complex so we're going to have lots

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.780
of things going on and some things will be in front of the others noticeably the highs are within the

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.020
head of the bunny.

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.330
So we want to be able to separate part of our objects we certainly got the layers there already which

9
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.850
is absolutely fine we can separate major objects into various layers.

10
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.820
That's a good workflow to have.

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.000
However when you're starting to do with more detailed objects with it in just one object like this lovely

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.750
rabbits I hear I'm just going to say that that's a smooth shading though the much better.

13
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.180
We've got this eye here and we want to separate it out as a couple of ways of doing all of this in the

14
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.540
objects menu itself further down.

15
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.300
Here we have all the way up.

16
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.000
Actually there we get show and hide and there are three main options which are show hidden which is

17
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.980
alternate.

18
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.990
Hide selected which is H and hide unselected which is shift and H.

19
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.480
So let's run through those all together.

20
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.660
So if we wanted to work on the AIs themselves let's just come out of still locked locked camera view

21
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.510
I hope I haven't ruined my view I had before.

22
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.750
Whoops forgot to unstick that.

23
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.400
Okay so I'm going to just spin out of here and select our I.

24
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.000
I make sure the eyes are selected in the outline here and if I just hit the H key well and every other

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.170
key around it apparently if I just hit the h key.

26
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.200
Sorry I just realized I had something meant on the keyboard pressing down the tab key just there.

27
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.020
Okay so with the h key.

28
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.250
You hide the thing you selected and now we've removed the eyeball from the rabbits itself and if we

29
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.790
selected the cone we can hide that.

30
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.980
Now we can bring things back any time with oltz and H and that would just bring everything back to the

31
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.950
scene.

32
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:24.070
Now if I just wanted to work on this tone down here I could select that cone and go shift an H and everything

33
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.650
else in the scene gets hidden and we can see that over in the outline.

34
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.340
We have absolutely nothing else showing but the current Then we can bring it all back with old s.h.

35
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.690
to bring everything back.

36
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.010
That saves you going through this list and trying to turn everything off if we've got things parents

37
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.130
together remember to hold down.

38
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.270
Control when you're clicking to make sure everything in the hierarchy is hidden so it's very very quick

39
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.720
way of being able to just focus on one part of your model and then bring everything back really really

40
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.600
quickly.

41
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.920
Okay guys nice a short lecture.

42
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.930
I'd like you to show only the eyes so peronne the eyes of the rabbit match.

43
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.570
If you've not done that already I haven't so I will be doing that and hide everything but the rabbit's

44
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.810
eyes.

45
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.410
The video now and give that a go.

46
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.500
Okay guys.

47
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.390
Welcome back.

48
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.590
Let's hop straight over into blender and go ahead and hide everything.

49
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.170
But the eyes themselves.

50
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.870
So I'm going to rotate round select the eyes and then hold down Shift and H.

51
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.020
And there we go we've got two eye balls floating in the middle of space and out of course when we go

52
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.690
ahead in a few moments and go and edit these and make them look more like eyes we don't want them to

53
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.430
move from the bunny other.

54
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.040
You know if I picked them up and move them up then at unhide everything is going to look a bit silly

55
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.140
so we don't want to do that Swan just undo what I've just done checked for I haven't ruined it with

56
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.970
Oulton H Yeah still Verts shift in nature select shift.

57
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.840
H.

58
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.760
Going well.

59
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.630
My eyes are selected shift in H.

60
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.740
There we go.

61
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.450
So you do have to make sure you've got the thing selected.

62
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.340
So now we've got that there.

63
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.090
I'm just going to go over to the outline and literally drag eyes over the top of rabbits so that they

64
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.800
are linked together.

65
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.300
Obviously that doesn't stop me moving these but it does mean if I move the rabbit later on the eyes

66
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.120
aren't left behind.

67
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.400
How did you guys get on.

68
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.770
Hope you've now got your eyes on the screen so we can progress and make them look like proper eyes.

69
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.360
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
