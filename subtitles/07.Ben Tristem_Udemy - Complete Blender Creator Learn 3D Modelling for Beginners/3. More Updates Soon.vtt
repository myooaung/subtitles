Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture now you've reached the end of the 2.8 remaster as it is

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.790
at the moment.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.030
And there will be more content coming real soon.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.820
Now of course you can follow on with the rest of the course and translate it to 2.8.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.770
There's still lots of good content coming up there but if you'd rather wait for the blend to 2.8 stuff

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.300
that's absolutely fine.

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.100
Now I will warn you that there are some things that have been deprecated in Blender 2.8.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.800
So they just don't exist anymore.

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.540
But some of the content is absolutely fine.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.670
So go ahead if you want to wait.

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.330
If you want to and the new concept will be with you really soon.

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.490
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture.
