Hello everybody and welcome to the section where we make an animated lamp similar to those famous ones

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,240
you've seen in the films but not quite.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,630
And this is gonna enable us to focus on first of all bringing your models to life whether it's an animated

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,670
object like the lamps being or whether it's a camera moving around a scene is going to add the extra

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,930
dimension to your renders that we've never had before.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,910
We'll learn some key skills and how to manage the exporting of all those different frames and also focus

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,710
on lighting.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm going to delve into the cycles rendering engine in this particular section as well as eevee and

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,650
we'll switch backwards and forwards between the two and you will see that there is a stark difference

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,350
depending on what the outcome is that you want.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,050
So let's dive into this section and start off by mocking our past scene and we'll start back in the

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,820
next lecture.
