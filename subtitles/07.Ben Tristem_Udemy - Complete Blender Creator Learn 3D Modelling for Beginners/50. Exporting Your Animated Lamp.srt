00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,750
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,790
In this lecture let's export our animated lamp into two game engines.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:16,670
But also let's explore what else we can do how else we can export our models.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,100
So when it comes to exporting your model the first thing to think about is where are you exporting it

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,870
to.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,820
So in this particular case I'm going to be testing the Unity game engine and the unreal game engine.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,380
There are obviously plenty of other places that you could export you could be exposed to another 3D

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:40,250
program you could be exporting into another game engine there are plenty of different options now you

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,310
do have to bear in mind that those different options will come with different export settings so we

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,900
can't possibly go through everything at this point in time.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,530
First of all we need to figure out what are we exporting because we could export absolutely everything.

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,850
In fact that's something a lot of people accidentally end up doing.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,640
So here we have a look at our entire scene.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,490
If we didn't have anything selected whatsoever.

15
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,870
OK if we go up to file and go down to export we see we've got quite a few options and we're not limited

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,160
to these options but these are the ones that are bundled with Blender.

17
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,990
Now we'll go through every one in detail but let's just gloss over some of the ones that I'm very familiar

18
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,990
with myself.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,400
A collider you if you need something in Trimble sketch up colliders the way to go with that way front

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,820
would also work but way front tends to be very basic and doesn't often export everything that you want

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,720
it to.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,350
Now the other thing to have a look at here and the one we'll be focused on.

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,640
You just saw unreal pop up there we're going to hop over to that in a moment.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,320
And that's why we're going to focus on SB X in this lecture are both unreal and unity both supports

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,680
FBI X so we're gonna be using that as our example export formats.

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:02,330
The other one that a lot of you may be interested in is the S T L format that is traditionally used

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,360
with printers.

28
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:10,990
So when you actually put a file into your slicing program you'd typically export as an S T L first.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,810
This final one at the bottom have a G.I. t f 2.0 standard.

30
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,960
This is an up and coming standard and I really hope it gains a lot of traction and hopefully unity and

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,530
unreal will start supporting this fully soon.

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,670
And it being an open standard means that everybody can contribute to it.

33
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,770
And we've seen what open software can be like.

34
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,040
Blender is absolutely phenomenal because of that.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,110
Anyway let's just go to SB X export so you go ahead and go to export it.

36
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,410
Now it's come up with animated lamp FBI X surely we just click export FBI X and away we go well they

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,310
would export absolutely everything in our scene and really all we want is our lamp and its armature.

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,420
So we need to think very carefully about how we're going to do this.

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,000
A couple of ways that we could do this is we could create a new scene in blender with only those two

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,870
items in it.

41
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,030
But to be quite honest we don't want to flash around too much with that what we can do is select the

42
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,600
lamp hold down shift select the armature.

43
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:19,840
Then when we go to file an export under FBI X we have an option selected objects in fact most of the

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,270
export options have the option to Export selected objects and we've got a load of other options in here.

45
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,650
I'm not going to dive into the details at this point we just want to see whether this works outside

46
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,550
a blender.

47
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,110
There's a couple of tabs along the top here.

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,460
One thing actually before we explore those you will notice above the export there there's an invisible

49
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,480
bar here.

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,720
And I've seen this all the way down here and you've got this little up arrow that can be incredibly

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,370
confusing let's click it to bring that back up or I've seen this all the way at the top here covering

52
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,430
up the other ones not great UI but it's easy to fix as well.

53
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,940
The other options along these tabs then we've got geometry apply modifiers is usually a good idea so

54
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,170
we'll let that go.

55
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,960
And then we've got an option here about normals and we'll see in a moment the unreal will actually complain

56
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,600
when we go ahead and export.

57
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:23,650
So what we can do here is switch this from normals only to face and that will sort out some of the error

58
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,950
messages we will get armature.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,300
Well we do want to export our armature.

60
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,300
I'm going to leave it as the fault here for the moment and the animation we do want to export that as

61
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,560
well.

62
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,680
So I'm going to export it into my animated lamp folder is going to export SB X and let's see what happens

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,650
when we first of all have a look at unreal.

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,980
So I've got a scene already set up here.

65
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,240
Let's go ahead and click the import button in the content browser.

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,960
It's going to go straight to the folder that I wanted.

67
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,340
This is so it's nice and quick and we get a load of options here.

68
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,960
Now you may not see this area just here.

69
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,270
There's the little arrow that you can drop these things down if you're doing this.

70
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,880
We don't actually need all of those details so let's hide them away.

71
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,070
So it's a skeletal mesh.

72
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,430
That means we've got a rig controlling it a Bowen based rig and we also want to import the match.

73
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,790
That's that's the standard here.

74
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,780
That's a given.

75
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,630
Now it may look odd that the skeleton is not coming through and we'll get back to that in a moment and

76
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,650
import constants like geometry and skinning weights is absolutely fine.

77
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,850
Well we want that we do want to import animations and the animated length make sure it's set at the

78
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,950
moment animated time.

79
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:42,960
What we can do is set a specific range that's useful if you need to import certain animations on a timeline.

80
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,040
Now just remember that at the moment our animation isn't one that would loop around like an idol or

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:56,440
a walking animation but it is an animation over a set time which might be akin to a death animation.

82
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,730
So let's go ahead.

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,390
An animated time is what we want.

84
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,670
Everything else okay.

85
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,050
And we're going to click imports all.

86
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,130
Now when it comes to things like materials if you'd set up something fancy we've got a couple of errors

87
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:18,070
or not they're not errors they're warnings they're warning us that something might not work as expected

88
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,980
or it's expecting something else to also be there.

89
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm just going to ignore those for the moment though not important for us testing here.

90
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,250
Now if we double click in the content browser under our animated lamp in the top right we end up with

91
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,400
four separate areas that we can look at we can look at the individual skeleton and then we look on the

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,110
left hand side those we've got the base the look and the stamp.

93
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,620
Elvis is quite interesting.

94
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,220
These are bones what we've seen before that's the skeleton.

95
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,010
We have a look at the mesh we see the mesh and we look at the animation.

96
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,840
This is where it starts getting a bit weird.

97
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,170
It seems like it's playing something down here but I can't see anything going on and you might struggle

98
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,650
with this without even knowing what the issue is.

99
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,880
I do want to quickly look at the physics tab because I like pushing this button here and watching our

100
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,480
lamp go flop.

101
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
Anyway simple things as they say.

102
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,680
So what's going on here with the animation.

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Well there's kind of a bug in the FBI export what it comes across from blender.

104
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,880
So the first thing I'm going to do is just click the cross at the top hits close and those extra windows

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,640
I'm going to hold down shift and select all of these things that are imported.

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,930
Notice it's imported some materials.

107
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,900
And whilst it has imported those base colors in general when you import any model into a third party

108
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,890
program you're going to have to set up your materials your textures again.

109
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,020
Then that's important.

110
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,850
We'll get to that in the next section where we start unwrapping our models because that will tell blender

111
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:58,010
specifically and external programs as well how to map a texture to a particular model.

112
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,190
Anyway let's delete those out the way and I'm going a forced delete them to get them out of there.

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,230
Let's go back up to blender.

114
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:04,940
OK.

115
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,500
So the problem here is that our armature is called armature.

116
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,250
You won't believe it's that simple.

117
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,760
Unfortunately it is.

118
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,790
So we go and change this to something like lamp rig and do exactly the same export.

119
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,570
Let's make sure that both of our models are selected.

120
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,510
So our model and our armature are selected and then go to export.

121
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,480
Now there is a warning here or rather that isn't a warning when we go ahead and try and export under

122
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,780
the same name and click export aspects.

123
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,540
It didn't say Are you sure that's something to watch out for if you've got a a series of models in a

124
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,500
folder.

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,880
It's very easy to accidentally end up overwriting something that you didn't mean.

126
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:55,290
So let's go over into unreal and repeat the same process we did before so I'm going to import our animated

127
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,950
lamp and when we do that I can just click imports all its can to remember the previous settings.

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,670
Now when we go ahead you will notice that some of these icons look slightly different which is pretty

129
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,630
awesome.

130
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,080
We've got less errors even better.

131
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,480
I should say I shouldn't say Error Sorry less warnings.

132
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,650
And if we have a look at our animated lamp underneath the animation tab there's now something there.

133
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,690
In fact it's our animation.

134
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,150
How awesome is that.

135
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,040
And even better if we go ahead and let's come out of this window for the moment and drag our animated

136
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,220
lamp into our scene there we go.

137
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,960
It's in the world live and we wanted to drag the animation in now we could do that as well.

138
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,450
We could go ahead and drag this next one into the scene and I believe if we're lucky they'll probably

139
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,490
jump out of our view off it goes there brilliant look you can see its shadow just falling away.

140
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,620
Excellent.

141
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,340
So that's some real covered.

142
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,810
Let's go dive over into unity and see what happens there.

143
00:09:53,910 --> 00:10:01,860
So over in Unity One of the things that you may find interesting is that you can open up or what seems

144
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,880
like you can open up blend files within unity.

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,240
That's not strictly true but I'll show you this very quickly anyway if I go ahead here and grab my animated

146
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,850
lamp blend file and drag it across into the assets folder.

147
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,530
Give it a few moments and it seems to have imported it.

148
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,820
In fact we could click and drag it across and you know what.

149
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,660
That's pretty impressive that we can get a working scene over from blender into unity and it just comes

150
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,570
across like this.

151
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,290
That's pretty awesome.

152
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,820
But it's a problem.

153
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,910
And the reason why it's a problem in our particular case is if we were to go ahead and modify anything

154
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,590
in here it will update in this scene which is really awesome.

155
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,830
Apart from when you start getting very large files at that point if someone in a team let's say were

156
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,480
to modify blend file your Unity project would update immediately.

157
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,870
That's really annoying if you're trying to do something else at the time.

158
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,460
And it's also really annoying if you're trying to work on something you alter one model and it's just

159
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:13,420
a tiny change but it's a big model unity will have to open up blender in the background and redo all

160
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,590
of its fancy exporting and then bring it in.

161
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,760
So in general I would avoid doing this unless you wanted to bring in a static scene that you've already

162
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,260
made over in Blender.

163
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,250
Okay.

164
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:31,200
So what about importing and SB X so we go ahead and grab our animated lamp.

165
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:37,310
SB X which is kind of what unity was doing in the background and drag that in that looks a lot better

166
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,190
that looks like something we can use.

167
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,670
If I go ahead and drag that into my scene if I am just going to plop it's in the scene hierarchy and

168
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,490
then it's going to be at 0 0 0 in our world which means that if we have a look at the game tap we can

169
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,310
see it there.

170
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,990
Now it won't work straight away we can't just click play and do anything because we've not set up an

171
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,130
animation controller.

172
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:07,320
However if we go into the details with this little arrow here we can open up one of the animation files

173
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:14,510
and if I scroll out here and then press play we will see that it's playing the animation.

174
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,280
Now obviously this is jumping onto an invisible block we haven't brought that across.

175
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,240
And then it's landing on the floor.

176
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,630
And if you bear with me a few moments I can set this up so it does it in unity as well.

177
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,880
OK.

178
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,410
So I think I've got everything sorted out there and the camera I don't think it's in a good position

179
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,010
so let me move that okay.

180
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:43,230
So with everything set up I think the final thing here is to play our game and see if that works Excellent.

181
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,250
So there we go there.

182
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,280
In a nutshell is exporting from blender and seeing your work being alive in another program as phenomenal

183
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,780
now as I've mentioned before and I just want to repeat myself here.

184
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:02,050
When it comes to things like materials and setting all those up that is really done in the game engine

185
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,780
or in the third party program you're using.

186
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,910
So here for instance even though it's come across and brought across the base color that red in both

187
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,120
unity and unreal is not set up properly it's not quite any of that shyness that we'd set up and that's

188
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,110
because materials work differently in each of the engines.

189
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:26,680
Now unreal and even rendering engines are very very similar which is incredibly useful.

190
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,540
He can pretty much copy your settings across and almost the same hair as well.

191
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,850
And we're getting to some of these other things the albedo or the bass color metallic normals height

192
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,970
maps et cetera and they're all coming up in the next section.

193
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,000
So please share your work if you have exported your model into another program.

194
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,480
Let me know which program and share your results as well.

195
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,130
I'm really looking forward to seeing how you've brought your lamps alive in different places as well.

196
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,020
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
