00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,480
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,320
In this lecture we're going to have a look at our model and go around it and just double check that

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,890
we've got things without transforms applied to them transforms are incredibly useful because they allow

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,940
you to scale rotate to model things very quickly.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:28,150
However when you're animating what you don't want is some funky stuff happening which is unintended

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,230
in the way we can do that is to make sure that transforms certainly the scale and rotation of our models

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,310
especially our mesh objects are applied.

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,750
OK so let's go ahead here and have a look.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,920
Our models are going to turn back on overlays.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,030
Now the way of quickly doing this is to click around your model and just see what's happening.

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,170
And we can already see if we have a look if this if this panel isn't open this is the one you need open

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,230
or indeed you could use this one over here as well in the properties panel it's entirely up to you.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,330
It's the same information on the Object data.

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,750
If we press the end key we can bring that open and it's under the item tab we've got location rotation

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,920
and scale.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,020
These are the three possible transforms that you can apply to your models.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,790
And it's incredibly useful because it enables you to as I was alluding to earlier be able to rapidly

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,400
model any parts of your mesh.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,930
The problem is that things don't always act as you would expect them to.

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,650
It transforms aren't supplied.

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,860
We already saw earlier.

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,170
That's because there was a transform applied to this lower arm.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,800
The moment we printed it to something else it had an offset immediately happen.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,230
And that can cause issues.

25
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,920
So what I'd recommend is going round your model.

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,360
And in this case I've got my stems selected and we've got a scale of nought point eight eight five.

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,330
So we can go control in a.

28
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,570
Or go to the objects menu and apply and then we've got a couple of options we've got location rotation

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,580
and scale or we can do a rotation and scale together.

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,920
Now typically those are ones that you do need to do together all transforms though can result in your

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,910
model falling apart.

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,300
So it may sound like a good idea to do transforms but that's not gonna be a great idea.

33
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,880
For instance at the top here what it would do is it would take the origin point its location and move

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,060
that lower arm down to the center of our scene.

35
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,880
Well speaking of which I picked up a move that bottom bit so we can go here straight away.

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,910
I'm going to highlight all of that and put it smack bang in the center of our scene again.

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,270
Otherwise it's just going to confuse me when I look at it later.

38
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,670
Now that I've done that I'm going to go ahead select this stem see it's got a scale applied but nothing

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,600
else.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,060
And then when we go and have a look at our transform information for our lower arm we don't have any

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,360
rotation applied to it that's fine.

42
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,790
But we do have location and scale.

43
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,500
Now if we were to go ahead and apply all transforms it looks no different.

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,370
You think a ha.

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:09,310
Brilliant but what it has done is it's move the origin all the way down here to the center of our scene.

46
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,240
That might not be desirable.

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,370
Origins are very useful for manipulating your models and of course if you export your models they are

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,440
often used as pivot points.

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,740
So you probably don't want to apply any locations.

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,020
However this one's got a horrible scale of points one applied to it which means we are going to have

51
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,590
problems.

52
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,420
If we were to add particle systems submissive we would seize the physics engine and we might even end

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,860
up with something quirky happening with animation which is what we're covering here.

54
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,640
So let's go ahead.

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,740
Go control a and apply the scale.

56
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,390
And there we go.

57
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,500
That's all sorted.

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,780
We're not going to apply location and there's no rotation to adhere to either.

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,590
So there we go.

60
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,350
I apologize for mentioning this repeatedly throughout the course but you'll be surprised how many times

61
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,960
that it's forgotten and it causes so many issues so many questions come up.

62
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,440
And often it's a case of.

63
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,340
Well have you applied your transforms.

64
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,400
That's almost the right answer.

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,920
90 percent of the time.

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,640
So of course I've got a challenge for you okay.

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,230
So here we go.

68
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,010
Nice and straightforward.

69
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:18,170
I'd like you to check your model over for anything without the scale and rotation applied.

70
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,680
Remember it's not just the mesh objects that you need to look at.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,900
Do have a look at your armature as well because that can also have transforms applied to it pulls the

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,010
video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

73
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,840
Let's go ahead hop on over into blender and just check for all transforms are all applied okay.

74
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,760
We've done the lower on that's fine.

75
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm going to select my armature because I don't want to miss that.

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,400
That's got everything absolutely fine.

77
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,010
Let's have a look at the empty.

78
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,020
That's fine as well the base.

79
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,340
Well it's also got a scale so going to go Alton a.

80
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,830
Apply the scale.

81
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,190
This has also got scales.

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,700
Alton I apply the scale.

83
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,430
Perfect.

84
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,830
Okay.

85
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,400
I don't think there's anything else that's important but I'm just going to zoom out to the wider scene

86
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,050
and see what we've got going here.

87
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,630
So we've got this backdrop here I don't think we would involve in the animation at all.

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,500
However just to be complete I think we should check everything.

89
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,780
Yep that's absolutely fine.

90
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,230
Okay.

91
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,810
So this platform or bench here.

92
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,910
Yes it does have a scale.

93
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,620
Let's go ahead and apply that scale save our work.

94
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,350
I'm liking how this is coming along.

95
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,860
There are a couple of other things if we just click through they will be selected because they're on

96
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,880
top of each other.

97
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,340
As I click through them I did see one point eighty five again.

98
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,620
So let's go ahead apply that scale we got something here.

99
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,670
No I think we're done.

100
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,250
I think we've gone through everything.

101
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,840
Of course there is a hierarchy here in the outline that we can quickly click through as well if we want

102
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:51,980
it.

103
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,620
So of course we're dealing with primarily mesh objects here and the armature itself.

104
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,770
And we can see here because the armature has the bones in and we're starting to parent things to those

105
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,700
bones.

106
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:13,130
That is why we now have our mesh objects being nested underneath the armature because the mesh objects

107
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,990
are now a child of the armature.

108
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,540
Excellent.

109
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,040
Now did you have many things to go through and clean up.

110
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,240
I'm just going to tidy up my scene here.

111
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,950
I think that looks pretty good.

112
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,690
I'm also going to move my camera for the moment into a better position.

113
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,960
So if we do decide to render anything soon Yeah I can see what's going on.

114
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,420
Perfect.

115
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,770
How did you guys get on.

116
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,830
Did you have many things that you hadn't applied the transform for so please do share your work over

117
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,580
in the discussion also let us know if you're having any issues at this point in time.

118
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,870
It's at this key stage that things can fly apart.

119
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,860
So this is why we're going through and doing things bits by bits rather than making a model adding an

120
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:04,850
armature to it and it just fly apart and be very difficult to solve iterating through your model building

121
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,030
it up piece by piece is going to make a big difference to that.

122
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,280
So go ahead show your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
