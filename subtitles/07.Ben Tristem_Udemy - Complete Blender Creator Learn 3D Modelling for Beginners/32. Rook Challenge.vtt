00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.740
Hello everybody and welcome in this lecture.
1

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.200
We're going to jump straight into a challenge.
2

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.500
After that night this should be pretty straightforward.
3

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.660
The night was possibly the most complex piece that we had to make in this section.
4

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.960
So using the mirror modifier again if you wish to I'd like you to go ahead and make your rook pause
5

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.400
a video now and give that a go. Hello everybody and welcome back.
6

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.320
Let's hop on over into blender and make our rook. Hello everybody and welcome back.
7

8
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.970
Let's go ahead.
8

9
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.360
I'm going to open up my bishop and use that as my base piece.
9

10
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.590
So I've got the right size base.
10

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.510
I'm going to go around to the side view switch into wireframe and go into edit mode so I can select
11

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.020
everything making sure I've got the select tool on I'm going to just chop off everything about their
12

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.240
next delete vertices and we're gone.
13

14
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.110
Obviously this will leave me with a hole in the top of a switch back to solid shade.
14

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.570
I'm absolutely fine with that.
15

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.680
Let's go ahead turn on our image come out of edit mode and delete the one that's there and then add
16

17
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.170
another image as a plane.
17

18
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.230
And I'm going to pick the rook.
18

19
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.160
And of course the rook is going to be the wrong size as always, Let's go into LookDev mode so I can
19

20
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.540
see what's going on and the scale it's in until it's roughly right.
20

21
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.270
Zoom in a little further.
21

22
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.100
Start scaling again and I'll stop it around four centimeters remember you can hold down the shift key
22

23
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.150
to be more gradual I'm now going to rotate it's on the X axis by 90 and then it's just a matter of lifting
23

24
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.730
it up.
24

25
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.070
So it's on the ground plane G, Z and lift it up.
25

26
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.930
Now this one's actually a little bit wonky but that's okay we can deal with that as we go.
26

27
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.570
Right would definitely still working in the bishop file.
27

28
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.090
This is dangerous.
28

29
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.180
Whoops.
29

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.020
To save this as rock.
30

31
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.010
If at any point I'd say save that, I'd have lost my bishop.
31

32
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.930
Okay okay.
32

33
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.900
So we've still got the notch in our scene as well let's get rid of that and so we've got a rook and
33

34
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.650
the staunton rook
34

35
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.980
Okay.
35

36
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.930
And we've got this boolean modifier applied.
36

37
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.290
Okay.
37

38
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.440
So I think we're pretty much tidied up and ready to start modelling.
38

39
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.720
This is a really straightforward model.
39

40
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.740
I am going to go into edit mode but I'm also going to set the display as to wire so I can see through
40

41
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.990
highlight this and just start moving things around.
41

42
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.170
Now much like the Knight this also has a very sharp lip around it.
42

43
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.310
I'm not sure I'm going to adhere to that on this particular model.
43

44
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.570
I thought it was very useful with the with the knight itself but with the rock I don't think it's going
44

45
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.950
to be quite as useful.
45

46
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.330
I might try it and see how we get on.
46

47
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.330
Let's move this down a little and this edge the pair and scale it in and then finally this one here
47

48
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.770
pressing G twice to move it along and then lock it scale that's it.
48

49
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.160
Okay.
49

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.130
So that's a good start here.
50

51
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.520
I'm going to grab this edge loop here and literally extrude it straight up
51

52
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:19.710
come to the top here extrude by a little bit on the Z axis and scale up or which one to pick.
52

53
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.370
I'm going to eyeball this because it is going to change and then extrude on the Z axis.
53

54
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.890
Not all the way I'm going to make these castlements in a moment by insetting but for the moment I'm
54

55
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.600
happy with how that is.
55

56
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.220
That looks wonky.
56

57
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.310
It is wonky.
57

58
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.700
aw no what happened there.
58

59
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.940
You know what I'm gonna do here.
59

60
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.920
I think one side's fine and because this image has been here I've been unable to select.
60

61
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.070
So this is another benefit of the mirror modifier.
61

62
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.580
I can look at it from the side that is broken, oh that's disastrous, highlight the select two vertices and
62

63
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.940
just delete them.
63

64
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.820
And I'm going to do the same there.
64

65
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.770
Okay so we've now got half a model and we can add the modifier back in the mirror modifier and they'll
65

66
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.210
be on the Y axis this time.
66

67
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.720
Okay.
67

68
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.930
So unintended consequence of having the image there but never mind.
68

69
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.900
Let's go in and make a few other changes so this does come in quite a bit more at the top here.
69

70
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.850
So about there I'm going to bring that in.
70

71
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.380
Now we have got extra detailing here and I said I would give it a go so let's have a look at that bit
71

72
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.420
there and then it'd be another bit in the middle as well to bulge out and this is thing if you're not
72

73
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.050
careful.
73

74
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:45.340
You very quickly end up with something that doesn't look quite right because you've added too much detail
74

75
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.230
into a lower point.
75

76
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:55.450
I want this to also scoop up a little bit all the scale that here so follows a nice curve as it goes
76

77
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.220
up.
77

78
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.790
We go.
78

79
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.750
I'm happy with that transition as it goes.
79

80
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.220
Okay so the very top here.
80

81
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.260
Let's go back into solid shaded mode and also on our object.
81

82
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.110
Change it back to solid so we can see what's going on.
82

83
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.700
I'm going to hide my image for the moment and select the very top face.
83

84
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.810
Fill it in.
84

85
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.570
Now when we use the inset tool.
85

86
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.860
This is where we're gonna have to use a special option when we insert otherwise we're going to end up
86

87
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.050
with it coming in here.
87

88
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.660
So what we have an option with is boundary.
88

89
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.800
We turn that off.
89

90
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.350
Then the boundary will continue around.
90

91
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.030
Neat.
91

92
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.470
Okay.
92

93
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.670
So we're going to have a bit of an issue of the consonants at the top.
93

94
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.490
And I've noticed a slight separation here as well.
94

95
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.850
So whilst I'm dealing with this that's a matter of making sure that everything is selected all the way
95

96
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.670
through which it is this time.
96

97
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.000
And then scaling on the y axis local y axis C Pressed twice by zero.
97

98
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.470
And that should solve all of those issues.
98

99
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.340
Most are gonna remove doubles make sure of not duplicate.
99

100
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.010
Okay.
100

101
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.630
Brilliant.
101

102
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.550
So now it's just these castlements on the top and we are gonna have an issue with the mirror modifier.
102

103
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.500
So this is gonna be one of these occasions where I'm going to apply it oh it can't be applied in edit
103

104
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.760
mode.
104

105
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.020
Got to remember that.
105

106
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.430
And then I can select these individually.
106

107
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:20.920
Otherwise what will happen is if I was just mirroring that and that one then we'd get that and that
107

108
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.210
one moving up and I don't I want alternate ones coming up.
108

109
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.690
There we go.
109

110
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.810
So if we look at the top of the rock here now it's not lined up perfectly with the ground so I might
110

111
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.480
change that just for aesthetics really.
111

112
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.650
Let's lift these up ever so slightly.
112

113
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.860
That looks good to me and this bit here I'm going to I can't just pull it down ever so slightly.
113

114
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.020
I'm going to insert it again but I do need to do some other work first because at the moment we're still
114

115
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.590
going to get this issue here which we didn't have before because of the mirror modifier not in spite of.
115

116
00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.100
I'm going to delete those vertices and I'm going to delete this face I'm going to fill in a new face
116

117
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.200
along the top and go F to fill.
117

118
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:12.220
And now I can inset and then go down slightly and this actually round here I'm also gonna bring that
118

119
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.660
down.
119

120
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.800
So it looks a bit better along the top.
120

121
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.490
Perfect.
121

122
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.940
So we're going to select my whole model and rotate it by 45 on the z axis.
122

123
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.630
No no I think it's twenty two and a half.
123

124
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.260
There we go.
124

125
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.740
Excellent.
125

126
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.660
So this is that's just purely aesthetic.
126

127
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.530
There's no real fundamental reason to do that.
127

128
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.880
It just happens to be in this case.
128

129
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.190
That's what's necessary.
129

130
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.470
Okay.
130

131
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.390
And we've got an issue at the bottom here that needs to be filled in as well some of the select that
131

132
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.760
and fill that in and I'm going to save my work.
132

133
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.040
Okay.
133

134
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.490
Brilliant.
134

135
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.430
Whilst I'm thinking about it I'm going to open up my bishop but hasn't got it on the bottom.
135

136
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:50.730
Okay.
136

137
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:56.010
So it was deleted at some point during the creation that's fine so long as we know why it was deleted.
137

138
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.120
Let's go back to our Rook.
138

139
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.140
Excellent.
139

140
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.700
That's coming along really well.
140

141
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.850
I'm like in my low poly Rook I'm going to get rid of any mean creases that we've added to this.
141

142
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.330
We don't need that we're not going to you be using the subdivision surface modifier on this particular
142

143
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.120
model and then save it once more.
143

144
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.660
Okay.
144

145
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.650
Brilliant.
145

146
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.870
How are you guys getting on looking forward to seeing your rooks please share them over in the discussions and
146

147
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.880
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
