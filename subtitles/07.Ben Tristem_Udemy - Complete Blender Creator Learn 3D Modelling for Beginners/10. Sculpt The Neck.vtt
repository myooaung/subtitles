00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.260
Hello again in this video.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.120
We're going to be creating a nick and some shoulders and without any reference material just slapping

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.150
down some muscles for the neck.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.490
But we're giving our head a little bit of a body to connect with.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.470
So let's jump in and get started.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.440
It's the technique I like is to grab our mask tool and then make sure we've got mass it to one so we've

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.640
got sharp edges decrease it a little bit and then I'm going to paint where I want the neck to be pulled

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.790
out.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.410
You can see it's just a little bit back from the jaw from the chin.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.960
I should say and it goes backwards and then from the base of the head probably around about just make

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.060
a little note on our model here ran about there I think at the back.

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.970
Is that going to be right.

13
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.970
Yes.

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.060
That's pretty good.

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.370
Maybe a little bit higher.

16
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
And then at the front I want it to be a round about here.

17
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
That's where the neck is going to come out yet.

18
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.280
That looks pretty good as well.

19
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.520
So is solid that up and then how close the edge well.

20
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.220
I've got a little of my jaw lining in there already so I can probably paint right up to the edge of

21
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.780
the crease that I have

22
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.700
I can just make it neck shape.

23
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.670
If you're not sure what a neck looks like then find yourself a mirror.

24
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.320
Play around with the thing that's coming out from your head and you get a pretty good idea of how it

25
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.740
all works.

26
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.220
RICKY Now I'm going to hit control I to inverse chief in my grab tool.

27
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.200
Make it nice and big.

28
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.920
So grabbing a big chunk and then in the middle of our neck just pull pull pull pull pull backwards and

29
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.060
downwards.

30
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.860
Take note of the angle it's a little bit backwards okay.

31
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.370
And then back to my mask.

32
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.840
Let's just have a look and see how that goes.

33
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.640
It's not too bad.

34
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.770
There could be a little bit further around the outside but we'll tidy that up in a moment from the front.

35
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.300
That's pretty good as well.

36
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.600
Okay.

37
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.580
So get the mask select a tool hold down control and then just disliked everything.

38
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.860
Excellent.

39
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.630
You can see naturally what I've got here is already a little bit of the neck muscles that that accidentally

40
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.710
happen which is cool.

41
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.090
I don't like all of this stretching that I've got around here kind of bugs me what I'm going to do straight

42
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.080
away so it doesn't bug me as hop on two Clay strips or you could just go straight up clay find out Diane

43
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.120
top and make sure it's not too crazy back down or I think 30 for now is not too bad making a brush size

44
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.270
reasonable strength not super huge.

45
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.930
And then just quickly do a little bit of strip and then smooth it down straight away.

46
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.310
And rid of a strip that's too powerful it's coming out too hot and heavy.

47
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.850
Make it lower just a little bit of a clay strip there.

48
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.860
Bridge the Gap smooth it out makes me smooth.

49
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.720
Kaye just going around a bit smoothing it out getting rid of the stretching that we had when we pulled

50
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.840
the head out holding down shift to smooth.

51
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.440
Now what do we want our shoulders to be let's start grabbing and yanking.

52
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.240
Just yank out some shoulders you see the detail there is a little bit yucky so I'm going to use my snake

53
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.560
OK to increase the size increase the power a little bit.

54
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.560
Point five is fine to see how that goes if we pull this out snake OK too.

55
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.910
It's creating new geometry I think looks a little bit nicer side view at Kay Smeal of this out in a

56
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.110
moment just getting the general shape we can see my computer starting to not be happy with the amount

57
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.380
of detail that's going on this might be something that you need to refine.

58
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.720
If 30 resolutions too much try.

59
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.980
20 is getting the shape for the moment as we've done shape shape shape just as some basic shoulders

60
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.430
were not going to actually model the shoulders properly at this point in time just getting the general

61
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:52.340
shape of a bust as this is called the head and the top of the shoulders dropped off.

62
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.240
Feel free to exaggerate your shoulders make yourself look buff if that's what you want to do.

63
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.760
You might want to go the other way around make them look a little bit leaner

64
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.120
I'm going to go back to my clay strips I do like the clay strips approaches to lay down a little bit

65
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.830
of geometry and then to smooth it and we can do it the other way round we can hold down control and

66
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.400
kind of do reverse Clay strips then shift I think my throat isn't looking too good let's do a little

67
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.650
bit of add some strips to the side and put a little bit of an Adam's apple in there if you're a dude

68
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.370
not so much of an Adam's apple if you're a lady speed up the video again here I'm using the clay strips

69
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.670
smoothing grab tool to pull things around you might want to look at a reference image if you want to

70
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.860
get the neck and shoulders right I'm just going by memory and at this point I'm going to work on the

71
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.570
Adam's apple just playing down the road of clay and then creasing around the outside of it little bit

72
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.570
of a lump there to show where the Adam's apple would be and readjusting the chin the jaw just constantly

73
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.850
fiddling pushing things around making sure that you're happy with where things are lining out the dimensions

74
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.510
the size going to use the clay strips and the carved tool just to make a little bit of muscular look

75
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.460
and feel in here if you're using a reference model you'll get a lot more accurate than I am but basically

76
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.480
just doing what feels right for me at the moment and you know what if we have enough interest in our

77
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.230
community we can do a course that is more about studying the human form and creating more accurate characters

78
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.500
but for now it's just practicing with the tools using the clay strips laying it down where you think

79
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.210
muscle would be and then digging in between the muscles so you get a good shape for the shoulders and

80
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.370
the neck and the back but I think that's pretty good for now you get the idea of how to make this sort

81
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.040
of neck pulling it out and then adding some curvature to the muscles in the next video we're going to

82
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.010
take on the mouth giving this guy the ability to speak.

83
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.150
See you in the next lecture.
