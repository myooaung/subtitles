1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,910
And there's video we're going to play around with metal balls just experimenting I'm going to make this

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,870
slug by the end of the video and I'm going to challenge you to come up with your own sort of biogas

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,910
slug or Caterpillar that you're going to create.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,580
So let's jump in and talk minerals.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,140
So I started a new project here.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,040
I've just turned off the camera and the lights so they're not getting in the way of what we're doing.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,230
I want to start by talking a little bit about organic modelling versus hard surface modelling.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,280
So we have our cube here we're pretty familiar with the cube hit tab to enter edit mode hit three.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,770
So I can click on faces.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,330
You don't need to do this I'm just showing you a little example.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,570
This is us doing some hard surface modelling we're extracting.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,460
We've got sharp pointy bits on the end we've got flat lines we've got right angles.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,360
It's the sort of thing that is relevant for a chair or a building or a car or an aeroplane.

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:55,300
Those sort thing things that have a hard surface what is not as good for is making organic objects like

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,320
you can see here it's a little bit more difficult for me to create a human with all that kind of squishy

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,250
ness that us humans have or an animal or a caterpillar or a plant or a mushroom.

17
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,710
It's more difficult with this structure of modelling so I'm going to delete my cube.

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,220
Thank you.

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,720
Cube and add a metal ball into the scene.

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,670
I'm going to shift a and then find my meatball menu and we've got five different types.

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,480
Doesn't matter hugely when you choose you can change it later on I'm going to start with a bowl drop

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,370
that into the scene.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,240
You see we have this bowl.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,870
Not much is going on just yet but if I add a second bowl I'm going to shift to duplicate.

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,250
Move it over to the side.

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,620
You can see that there's a connectivity there there's an influence where it allows us to have this smooth

27
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,740
transition from bowl to bowl.

28
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,700
I'm going add by hitting shift a I'm going to add a capsule as well to show you that it's pretty much

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,270
the same with these different objects.

30
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,120
The capsule I can add down here I can scale loops not that big.

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,560
Come down I can scale it up.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,990
I can move it around I can rotate all the good things that we can normally do but it has an organic

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,650
feel to it.

34
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,690
Now if I look into wireframe let's see what's going on here with our metal balls I've got three minerals

35
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,400
in the same mineral mineral won a medal too they're named automatically like that if you click on the

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,250
outside ring you can see currently we have this orange selection if I click on that it'll allow me to

37
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,130
move the first medal I put into the scene and as I move it you can see that my whole mesh is changing

38
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,740
super cores being updated I move it to there and it snaps away now those two aren't connected to this

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,570
not connected to the main body there if I click on one of the other rings of influence that was the

40
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,910
capsule I can move the capsule around again you can see how it's changing and morphing based upon the

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,890
positioning of where that capsule is there's no harm in adding lots and lots of minerals because you

42
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,720
can see the information on the inside is not retained so I'm gonna add another capsule just to plop

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,490
it over there I'll go back to my solid mode so we can see it drop another capsule in over there duplicate

44
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,420
pop another one over in there just to kind of get a feel for what's going on and in this video I want

45
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,690
you just to experiment that's what we're doing we're not keeping any of the stuff we do in this video

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,870
we're just experimenting.

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,260
So click on any of the metal balls and we have a look in the properties you can see the the green here

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,720
with the two balls click on that that's the metal ball properties we can change the resolution there's

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,990
two resolutions he wants a resolution in our viewport.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,080
One is when we go to render it the viewport is the one that I'm most interested in at the moment I'll

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,560
go back into wireframe mode as I reduce the number there we get a lot more detail on our mesh.

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,520
Now be careful you could accidentally make your computer lock up if you go a little bit crazy with this

53
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,780
in dropping it too low but you want to have the right amount of detail for what you're doing at the

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,870
time generally you start off with less detail and you add more detail as you go and as I said that's

55
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,210
changing all of the the mesh for all of the metal balls that I've dropped into this object it can also

56
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:49,510
change the influence threshold and that will make the metal ball mesh itself smaller or bigger within

57
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,650
the area of influence here.

58
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,820
Similarly we can click on one particular metal bowls say Mirabelle oh one here or I can click on the

59
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,860
outer ring as I pointed out before click on this outer ring if I go into edit mode just hitting tab

60
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,750
on my keyboard now in edit mode I'm looking at just this one metal ball we get a few extra options down

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:15,550
here so I can at this point change the type from bold to capsule to cube and so on I can also change

62
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,140
the size of it nice and easily change the radius now something I point out with the cube is as you change

63
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,280
the radius to be smaller on the cube it gets a little bit sharper around the edges if that's what you're

64
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,350
looking for if you make it bigger it kind of gets a little bit more rounded and gruyere on the outside

65
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:39,310
of the the cube we can also change the size of it on the x y and z axes if I was on the capsule then

66
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,040
I would just have on the x axis if I was in a ball and we don't have any of that we just have the radius

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,020
that I can make larger or smaller it's kind of good if you want to finesse something and you don't wanna

68
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,340
go playing around with the scale or you could just see s and do a pretty similar thing with the scale.

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,960
However when we are in a capsule there's a little bit more control we can say just scale on the this

70
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,220
x axis and the other main the owner to jump within this menu is really cool we have the ability to make

71
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,280
a negative metal ball I love the common his set metal ball as a negative one.

72
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,530
So if you click on that that will eat into the other metal balls now it's disappeared which is called

73
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,090
is negative but I can still hit G and move it around you can see as I move it it's absorbing into the

74
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,420
other metabolize that creates a pretty cool effect here it's also a good way of chiseling out a hole

75
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,410
within something.

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,450
So let me just show you that super quickly which one of my meatballs were on a grab here that one duplicate

77
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,490
moved over to the side Oh okay I've made my first error here I did this deliberately while I didn't

78
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,880
actually but let me show you if you duplicate while in edit mode all manner of nonsense happens so I'm

79
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,250
going to undo that I'm going to jump back into object mode now I'll duplicate it will create my object

80
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,940
properly I'm going to now jump back by hitting tab into edit mode just reduce the radius so it's a little

81
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,480
bit thinner and I will rotate this guy around rotate rotate.

82
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:09,190
Okay so I need to g z bring it up in the world now when I click on negative it should be eating a hole

83
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,770
within the rest of my object so as I move it around you can see it's creating kind of a cool organic

84
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,970
bullet hole or a cave or some sort of weird wound on my blob object here you can see the amount of detail

85
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,320
around the outside don't stress about that too much we're using meatballs as a strategy for blocking

86
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,210
things out as opposed to giving us the final detail at some point you might get there and say that's

87
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,590
not quite enough detail I don't like that messiness around the outside I'll click on my first of all

88
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:42,340
back in object mode I'll click on my top level met a ball and I will decrease the value here to give

89
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,320
us more fidelity so it makes it a little bit smoother.

90
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,280
Okay that's enough watching it's time for some doing I have a challenge for you to make a bug so using

91
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,380
medals make some sort of or Slough or Caterpillar or something similar to that I'd like you to use at

92
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,900
least two types of metal so a sphere and a capsule not just spheres entirely use a couple of different

93
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,000
things and also use at least one negative metal bowl so to subtract the shape from your overall shape

94
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,570
if you come up with something that you're proud of then please do share in the forum.

95
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,860
This is not something we're going to put a lot of time and love into is just to practice the process

96
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,780
and to make our mistakes now so that when we're working on our proper animal later in this section we've

97
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,640
already had a chance to play around with it so pause a video take on that challenge and when you come

98
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,810
back I'll take you through my process of making my own little caterpillar okay I've deleted my other

99
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,390
things because I'm going to start from scratch.

100
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,730
I'm going to shift a ad metal bowl.

101
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,120
I will add an ellipse soit I think because that kind of feels a little bit like a caterpillar body.

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,140
My idea is to make my caterpillar look a little bit like it's walking if I can figure out how to do

103
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,050
that so shift D.

104
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,790
Moving that long I'm just going to hop into my side view and shift D dropped along again.

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
Could I get a little bit variation in the height.

106
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,930
Don't have it all exactly the same.

107
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,440
You know I'm going to make this go up in the air.

108
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,900
This is where it's going to look like our thingy is walking a little bit of an arch because that's what

109
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,540
caterpillars do when they walk.

110
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,460
I think they do an arch definitely that exaggerated.

111
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,600
Okay.

112
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,020
And then the tail I think this is the tail yes it is the town in the end here.

113
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,780
Okay.

114
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:21,760
And then up the front end we will do a head click on this metal bowl duplicate up in the air a little

115
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,090
bit.

116
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,460
I think I'd like to have the head as a sphere rather than our lips oid just before I jump out of this

117
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:27,870
view.

118
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,340
I'm going to just change some sizes of things that doesn't look quite so everything's exotic exactly

119
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,420
the same.

120
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,340
Just go a little bit variation in there which is good to do I think when you've got organic things you

121
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,900
don't want it to look too precise.

122
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,890
Now do we.

123
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,300
So this first medal shift move it up to the top.

124
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,450
Going into edit mode in edit mode I'll change this to a bowl.

125
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,120
Increase the radius.

126
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,590
Nice and big.

127
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,820
Excellent.

128
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,810
Back into object mode so don't forget which I sometimes do and we'll have the head just there.

129
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,700
Excellent.

130
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,020
The zing around looks good.

131
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,210
I like it now.

132
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,480
What's a caterpillar need.

133
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,980
Couple of antennae back into my side view I'm going to duplicate this metal ball move it up not too

134
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,350
far scale it down to about that big we move it back a little bit of forward.

135
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,780
How would the antenna maybe forward.

136
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,050
Looks like it's in racing mode or racing mode it might be behind anyway.

137
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,280
Don't overthink it Rick.

138
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,170
I'll just put the metal bowl there in the front you are holding down old and middle mouse wheel just

139
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,320
zinging around.

140
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,830
G move her over to the left a little bit.

141
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,070
Shift D.

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,500
Move this guy over to the right a little bit now and use a capsule to join the two.

143
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,540
Here is scrolling a little bit.

144
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,180
Shift D move that down into the place if I use a sphere it doesn't looks quite so good but I think a

145
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:56,230
capsule will work nicely there and change into edit mode changes to a capsule to a bit of rotating that

146
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,210
should be the right spot.

147
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,230
Make a little bit smaller radius and play around with detail just to get it to the point where we don't

148
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,760
have too many of those weird artifacts going on that's pretty good don't want too much detail.

149
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,350
Decrease the radius a little bit.

150
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,650
I got to speed the video up here while I make the second one.

151
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:16,970
Okay.

152
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,440
Not too bad and just a reminder I know that you know this already because you've been through a lot

153
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,240
of this content but make sure that when you duplicate you in object mode not edit mode because that

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,700
will create all manner of nonsense with our middle balls if you are accidentally in edit mode when you

155
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,630
duplicate.

156
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,080
Now I said that I would subtract something let's subtract a mouth.

157
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,010
I'm going to shift a metal bowl ellipse soiled hit G on the keyboard move it down to the front jump

158
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,260
into edit mode hitting tab and I will flatten this out a little bit so it looks a little bit more mouth

159
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,110
ish.

160
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,630
That's not too bad.

161
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,410
What view do we want here side view.

162
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,240
That's good.

163
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,420
Up up up up up up over to front view.

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,840
Back view front view.

165
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,600
Okay.

166
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,220
Get into the right spot.

167
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,200
Now you can see that we have a thing in its mouth doesn't look so good but while I'm in edit mode I

168
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,520
can click negative blink.

169
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,420
There we go we've got a mouth.

170
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,080
I can even make came out to be.

171
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,640
Yum yum yum.

172
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,040
Eating.

173
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,510
There we go.

174
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,490
Awesome.

175
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,520
So we have a very quick Caterpillar.

176
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,020
I'm not quite done with the metabolic yet so I'm not going to convert it into a mess just yet but that

177
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,520
will be a step that we need to do before we start sculpting and playing around with it and getting it

178
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,960
looking exactly how we want to look.

179
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,910
So make sure that you've finished twiddling with metal balls before you go onto that next stage which

180
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,850
we will do in one of our upcoming videos.

181
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,600
So as I talked about before I'd love to see what you've come up with please do share in the forums and

182
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,780
I'll see you on the next video.
