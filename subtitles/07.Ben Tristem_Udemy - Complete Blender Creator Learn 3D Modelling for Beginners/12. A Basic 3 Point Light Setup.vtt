00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.620
Hello everybody and welcome back in front of us here we've got our wonderful model Suzanne with one

2
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.830
lights in the scene.

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.010
However if flights are a bit better it's much easier to see her face and other details around as well

4
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.500
because our subject is properly lit and that can make all the difference.

5
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.160
No end of time in students renders people always forget lighting.

6
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.720
And it's so important.

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.830
So let's hop on over and make a three point light sets up over in Blender.

8
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.470
Hello everybody and welcome back.

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.420
So let's go ahead and get rid of our cube as having something more exciting.

10
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.120
Suzanne the monkey will do okay.

11
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.060
So the view itself that we want to capture here.

12
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.030
I'm going to move the camera first because the camera is kind of important as it dictates where the

13
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.250
lights are going to where we're going to actually place the lights in order to get our three point lighting

14
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.930
setup.

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.560
It's going to do that really quick and going to hop into camera view with over here and just look at

16
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.050
Suzanne face on quite close.

17
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.300
So she's filling up a lot of the frame now it doesn't matter if that's perfect.

18
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.840
That'll do.

19
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.000
Now going to go into all the graphic perspective and look down from the top.

20
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.380
It's our scene.

21
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.740
And when I do that I'm going to select my lamp and move one of them about 45 degrees over there.

22
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.550
Now at the moment we can't see any lighting information in our scene so I'm going to go up to the very

23
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.330
top.

24
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.650
We're making these adjustments.

25
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.890
I can't see them along the top here is rendered mode.

26
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.880
Now hopefully you're still in the evening Jim but you might have played some going to click that and

27
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.380
it should look like it does now.

28
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.870
It is a bit fuzzier.

29
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.510
You may have cycles turned on if we go over to the properties panel and go to render.

30
00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.960
We can change the render engine between cycles workbench and eevee for the moment we want it set on

31
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.470
eevee and we probably will for most of the course and you'll see why later on but for the moment we

32
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.850
can leave it on TV and we can now see the effect that lighting has if I just press the GK here move

33
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.300
that around we can see that real time shadows are happening on Suzanne the monkey.

34
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.030
Now the light is all the way up in the sky we don't want that look at it from the side and pull the

35
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.650
lights downstairs highlighting her face.

36
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.920
Now let's have a look at how she looks.

37
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.290
So that's a bit dramatic at the moment we really have lost all of the all of the detail around the other

38
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.680
side so we have our main light sets up.

39
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.260
We have not called it main lights or key lights as it's known in the industry so let's go in and call

40
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.600
it the key lights.

41
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.560
So that's good.

42
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.700
It's named key lights.

43
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.610
We know what it is.

44
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.420
In fact I'm going to quit light key.

45
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.510
The reason for that is then all of the lights will be duplicated in the moment and they will have the

46
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.530
word lights.

47
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.520
So they'll be grouped together in the hierarchy as well and they'll be easier to find.

48
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.650
So let's go ahead and look at this from the top again.

49
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.260
Now the next lights that I want will be over here and they will fill in the shadows that are over on

50
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.220
this side.

51
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.140
So I'm going to duplicate the lamp with it selected and place it roughly in the same place on the other

52
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.230
side.

53
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.860
And whilst I'm here I'm going to rename it immediately going to have a look here it's called key like

54
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.920
0 0 1.

55
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.870
I'm going to change it from the key light to the fill lights and then there's one final lights that

56
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.710
we need which is the backlight.

57
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.720
And what that does is it helps highlights around the edge of our model and make it not looks quite as

58
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.500
distant.

59
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.740
Now in general that would be kind of in line with this but to have to be perfect with these things at

60
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.190
all because you can adjust them to get the effects that you want.

61
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.630
So I'm going to rename that straight.

62
00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.940
So we don't forget.

63
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.850
And I'm just going to call that back for backlight.

64
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.290
OK.

65
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.020
Let's have a look through the camera again.

66
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.260
Hi guys.

67
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.590
Mark again you may have come to your camera view by pressing a number pad 0 OK.

68
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.710
Like Mikey in the video and you may find that your scene looks like this.

69
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.300
What's happened is if cast your eyes to the right my screen where I've got the lights set up the power

70
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.170
has been changed.

71
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.250
It used to be energy.

72
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.210
It's now power.

73
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.590
And it's actually a lot brighter than it was that you need to set it.

74
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.660
So if we set these up to a factor of 100 600 watts we get something comparable to what Mikey has in

75
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.920
the video.

76
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.700
You also might notice that there's issues with the shadows.

77
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.820
These have changes.

78
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.380
There is a document on the 2.8 one Iva changes but the main ones are under the contact shadows and you

79
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.030
have to use the bias a lot more to make things a little bit crisper.

80
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.320
Just under Suzanne they're in the middle of the picture.

81
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.590
So these are the changes that you'll encounter in this video and possibly later on videos as well.

82
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.800
With that in mind.

83
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.340
Back to Mike and let's turn the back lights on and off.

84
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.650
Does it make a difference.

85
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.710
It does indeed.

86
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.630
Look at this.

87
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.140
Very important here.

88
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.510
There's this highlights right in the middle.

89
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.860
That is actually affected by the backlight.

90
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.790
And just under here.

91
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:36.830
So it is highlighting the rim of our model and there's other places this edge of the air as well.

92
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.320
So it is worth having that extra light there.

93
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.200
Brilliant.

94
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.360
Sometimes you can't really see much of an effect but this even though it's only one or two places makes

95
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.870
a big difference.

96
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.400
So Suzanne's much much better lit than she was previously.

97
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.560
Now sometimes a dramatic effect like that is pretty awesome.

98
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.430
So we can toggle on and off the visibility with these little icons to see how our objects is looking

99
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.030
as we add lights.

100
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.020
Now there's one thing that we haven't done yet and that's adjusted the value of these lights.

101
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.550
They're all the same.

102
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.740
Typically the key lights is going to be the brightest the full lights will be slightly dimmer.

103
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.670
To add a bit of contrast in shape to our face.

104
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.720
In this case or objects in something else.

105
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.970
So what we can do here is go to and make sure that we've got a full light selected and then go find

106
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.260
the lamp properties.

107
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.680
Now the icon for that just changed depending on what type of light it is.

108
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.300
I'll be further down on the properties.

109
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.980
And here it is we hover over that's the object data for our lamp and we notice that if we change it

110
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:51.980
to one of the other types of lamp a sun lamp a spot lamp and an area lamp the icon changes accordingly.

111
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.930
We're going to leave it as a point lamp for the moment and we revisit lights a lot later on in the course.

112
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.870
But it's the energy value that we're focused on.

113
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.330
So I going to turn the energy value down to maybe six and there we go we've got a slight difference

114
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:12.720
across the face of Suzanne how we can do a similar thing with this light in the background as well we

115
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.900
could turn that down too so it's got a much more subtle effect on our model but there we go.

116
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.200
That's a three point lighting system set up.

117
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.150
Now I'm going to do one final thing here a bit more of an advance thing but it's something that you

118
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.170
can incorporate into all of your models.

119
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:37.830
Firstly what we've got set up here is generally for a static object if you've also got extra lights

120
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.700
in your scene you can use that for effect.

121
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:47.590
So like on my well I might choose to put a lights up inside the well that highlights all of the structure

122
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:53.560
in the roof because a three point lighting sets up like this might not highlight everything.

123
00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:00.070
And with them all selected I'm going to press the M.K. create a new collection and I'm going to call

124
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:06.380
it lighting rig because that's essentially what it is and then click Okay.

125
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:14.260
And that has grouped all of these objects that are crucial to the lighting in one place which is really

126
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.300
really useful because it means we can hide all of those components out of the way when we're working

127
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.110
on our model and bring them back in when it's necessary.

128
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.570
The final thing but I'm going to do here

129
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.270
the final thing that I'm going to do here is make sure if I move my camera the lights come along with

130
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:35.600
us

131
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:50.490
so with the camera as the active selected objects and the press control and P and parents them and you

132
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.900
will see these black lines all going to our camera.

133
00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.640
Well this now means that we can move around our camera and that lighting rig stays with us.

134
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.330
Now this is really only good for this one particular model if we have a much larger model in our scene.

135
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:14.570
It doesn't really work or if it's too small it won't work that well either.

136
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.910
So it's to bear in mind that the rig does have to be set up per the scene.

137
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.750
But now we've parents had all of these lamps to the camera.

138
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:30.740
It does mean that if we wanted to we could move this around rotates it on the z axis pull it background

139
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.490
and now it lifts up in the same way we were before.

140
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:40.850
In fact even better if we're in first person view our lighting is consistent as we're moving around

141
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.170
our object.

142
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:48.470
Otherwise it wouldn't be lit consistently as the lighting itself wouldn't move with us.

143
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.010
Wow.

144
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.070
A lot to take in there the whole parenting thing at the end.

145
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:57.320
That's just a little bonus for you will cover that in much more detail later on in the course as well.

146
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:04.710
But now it's time for your challenge Okay everybody see your challenge is to add lights to your scene.

147
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:11.120
Now do start with a three point lighting set up and then add additional lights if you like.

148
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.030
What's important here is that you're not afraid you experiment and you have fun as you go.

149
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.390
Suppose a video now and give that's a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

150
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.790
Let's go hop on to blender and add some lights to our scene.

151
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.160
Okay everybody Welcome back.

152
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.520
Let's go ahead and I'm gonna open up the well.

153
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.120
I've been working on obviously you open up what you've been working on as well and we switch over to

154
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.730
rendered mode.

155
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.770
Okay so the first thing that I'm gonna say here is that the shadows are too harsh.

156
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.960
Let's see if we can go ahead and set up similar setup as we had with Suzanne and see how it looks with

157
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.430
our model.

158
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.550
It might not work.

159
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.000
It might do.

160
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.390
Okay.

161
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.790
So I'm going to have a look at the top.

162
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.600
I'm going to set them all so an appropriate place so let's have a look.

163
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.990
Where's our camera our cameras over there at the moment.

164
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:04.270
So our first lamp is gonna be roughly over here Annex 1 we'll be over here.

165
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.950
And the other one will be back here.

166
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.330
Okay.

167
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:12.750
So let's just duplicate those and move them around something like that.

168
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:20.500
The next thing I need to do with them selected but not the outer is just go round to the side and lower

169
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.650
them down to an appropriate height as well.

170
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.760
I want to keep them in line with the camera for the moment because what they see that's cause a lot

171
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.600
more interest around the well itself at the bottom.

172
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.530
Okay.

173
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.510
So that is all sets up what isn't setup is the naming.

174
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:45.310
So I'm just gonna come in here selects or let's have a look which one is gonna be my main lights.

175
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.040
I'm gonna have this one over here as my to have that one is the main line.

176
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.160
This is just called Lights.

177
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:57.530
The 0 0 1 I'm going to call it Main and I'll call this one fell.

178
00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.330
I don't think I've been named the object.

179
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.020
No I haven't.

180
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.620
There we go.

181
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.070
So there's lots of names in Blender it's easy to fill in the wrong one.

182
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:13.040
This is going to be main four key lights subsidy which naming convention you use as long as you're consistent

183
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.820
with it.

184
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:20.810
So in the aim of trying to be consistent I'm going to rename that key and then I'm going to select all

185
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:28.880
of those with select my camera in the outline of struggling to select it in the report and I'm just

186
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.680
going to group them all together.

187
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.280
Excellent.

188
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.530
So I can turn them on and off as I need to.

189
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.160
Right.

190
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:38.120
The first thing is that these are all creating hot spots because I've got ground.

191
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.280
So that's something to bear in mind that does look a lot lot better.

192
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.560
Can I see through that.

193
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.500
Or is it some sort of funky shadow happening.

194
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.590
Mm hmm.

195
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.370
Cool.

196
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.880
Well I quite like it like that with the light bursting through so that's a good start.

197
00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:01.950
Now with the press G and Z and just lift everything up is definitely coming through there.

198
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.240
Yeah I'm okay.

199
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.600
Brilliant.

200
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.170
So the next thing to do here is just tweak some of the values of these lights.

201
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:14.040
So we'll take this down to to make it a bit dimmer so those light rays coming through aren't quite as

202
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.480
strong this lamp here in the double down as well slightly although

203
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.830
this is really the face of the objects isn't it over here.

204
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.420
So let's let's raise that one.

205
00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:36.440
Cool that one the key lights this one the feel like oh I was going for the convention lights.

206
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.810
Phil Wilson High before so let's stick with that light.

207
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.790
So be the.

208
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.010
Yeah.

209
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.160
Simply the Phil lights.

210
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.880
That's fine.

211
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.990
OK so now all of those are named appropriately.

212
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.230
Let's make sure that they have the right settings.

213
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.860
Twelve.

214
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.650
Yes.

215
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.110
And eights over here.

216
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.620
Perfect.

217
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.500
Let's have another look at it.

218
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.260
And there we go.

219
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.440
My lighting setups.

220
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.170
All done.

221
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.280
I'm really liking the look of it so far.

222
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.540
I hope you guys are having lots of fun.

223
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.800
I certainly am.

224
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.340
I can't wait to see what you've created.

225
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.670
Speaking of which we're going to need to render out our models to do that.

226
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.450
We'll find out more about that in the next lecture.
