Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture.
1

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.060
This is gonna be more of an exploratory look at modelling in general to think about future work flow
2

3
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.850
and also focus on not having too much geometry I've already said that a couple of times but how can
3

4
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.370
we go about making this higher poly.
4

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.620
As I've mentioned even though we were I know we're working on a low poly model at the moment but how
5

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.370
would we go about making this high poly from low poly.
6

7
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.620
I feel like I need to show you that rather than just saying yeah yeah it can be low poly and still be
7

8
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.630
high poly at the same time that doesn't make any sense especially if your new to it.
8

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.750
So what can we do here.
9

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.530
Well one of the things that you can do almost immediately is whilst in object mode make sure smooth
10

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.070
shadings turned on when you have smooth shading turned on opposed to flat shading.
11

12
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.250
You will see.
12

13
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.900
And that's that's the right mouse menu there the context your menu.
13

14
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.000
Some people will like this faceted look and I think I'm going to go for more of that faceted look almost
14

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.200
like cut stone rather than the smooth look.
15

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.740
It's entirely up to you.
16

17
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.840
And of course we've already explored how you can go into your object data properties and go to the normals
17

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.160
and turn on auto smooth and then you can change where that threshold occurs.
18

19
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.990
So that's also another option for you when it comes to that.
19

20
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.040
But if we're working on a higher poly model it's generally going to be smoothed in general and then you
20

21
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.510
will control sharpness in another way.
21

22
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.500
So the first and primary way of doing this and the one I want to cover here is to simply add in a modifier
22

23
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580
that is a sub division surface modifier.
23

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.200
This is a modifier that's awesome.
24

25
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.700
You can see he has already started to make things smoother but it's also changed it from looking like
25

26
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.130
a pawn to a chocolate marshmallow or something like that.
26

27
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.680
Anyway if I then turn the subdivisions in the view up once more you can see it's getting smoother.
27

28
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.490
And let's go all the way up to three on both the view and the render, the render is important because
28

29
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.290
if we set the render down at zero let's say yet the viewport is lovely and smooth.
29

30
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.480
When we go ahead and render it it will still look all jagged.
30

31
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.990
Now is common to have a lower view setting and a higher render setting for optimization.
31

32
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.500
Now in this particular case I don't mind it being at three you can see the amount of triangles that
32

33
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.550
have appeared polygons in this case is much much higher than that vertices we've gone from I can't remember
33

34
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.590
what it was let's go back 52 all the way to two thousand eight hundred and twenty two.
34

35
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.000
So huge increase and that's one of the most important things about subdivision and anything that can
35

36
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.520
get exponential like this is you need to be careful you you can very easily either crash blender or
36

37
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.100
lock it up when you play with this and we'll talk about this particular modifier in much more detail later
37

38
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.510
on.
38

39
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.460
One cool thing that you can do is if we tab into edit mode you can see that it is still the underlying
39

40
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.850
geometry is this flat faceted look.
40

41
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.110
Although we have a look at it from the side it doesn't resemble that much anymore.
41

42
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.810
But there are things we can do to change that.
42

43
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.680
So for instance here I'm going to turn on adjust cage to the modifier result.
43

44
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.320
I think that makes it look just a little bit better and easier to see what's going on rather than leaving
44

45
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.910
it all jagged like this.
45

46
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.040
It means when we start adjusting things in a moment we can adjust them knowing that the cage.
46

47
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.310
The outer bounds match what we're doing.
47

48
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.040
So the first thing that I will show you here is if we open up the sidebar here whilst in edit mode if
48

49
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.600
I select the edge loop that runs around the top here what I can do is increase this option here.
49

50
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.830
The mean crease.
50

51
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.080
And because this top bit here will be somewhere where another piece will be mated onto I want it to
51

52
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.820
be an exact circle like it was before.
52

53
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.200
So I can turn that mean increase all the way up to 100 percent or a value of one and the same is true
53

54
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.770
at this bottom point here so I'm gonna select that edge loop and increase the mean increase there and
54

55
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.880
you can see straight away I'm going to go all the way to one one and knock it back ever so slightly
55

56
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.020
to keep the edge slightly rounded.
56

57
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.840
And there we go.
57

58
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.910
It's already starting to look much much better and I can hold down alt and select this edge loop around
58

59
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.310
here and I'm going to flip into orthoprojection so I can watch what's going on.
59

60
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.970
I can simply scale that back up to fit and I can do the same for this one here so I can scale this back
60

61
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.880
up.
61

62
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.550
One thing you'll notice with the subdivision is it shrinks things.
62

63
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.620
So you do have to watch out for that.
63

64
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.040
And I can bring that back in here and we can see we've got a nice looking model again.
64

65
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.060
But the underlying geometry is very very simple and I think that's the real appeal here.
65

66
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.250
So that next thing I want to think about here is this previous bit is very very smooth.
66

67
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.470
However is lacking the little hump that it had before so I feel that I need to add in a little bit of
67

68
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.020
geometry here and perhaps scale out to reintroduce that hump that was once there.
68

69
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.210
Now whether or not that's the look you're going for is entirely up to you.
69

70
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.730
And remember you can adjust this mean crease to change how hard that transition is.
70

71
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.690
I say that all the way at one we end up with a much different look a very sharp top to it there.
71

72
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.100
Then if I just turn that down slightly so we can adjust things accordingly.
72

73
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.330
And where this transition is I think that's where a mean increase could be in where we go if we increase
73

74
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.590
it we get a much stronger step between the two places.
74

75
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.940
And then again you can come back in and tweak these options and sizes and scales to your heart's content
75

76
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.630
to make it look better.
76

77
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.160
And generally with this workflow as you can see there's far less geometry to worry about.
77

78
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.780
And of course we've got ourselves a pretty good looking model.
78

79
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.770
Now I didn't say there were other ways so I'm not just going to leave it there.
79

80
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:25.060
We could go back to our bowling pin and make the pawn or suddenly the base that we're working on at
80

81
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.660
the moment in a very similar manner but you will often find you'll end up with more geometry as you
81

82
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.700
probably noticed.
82

83
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.770
This base contains a lot less geometry than our pin did when we were working with that.
83

84
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.830
And that is because we're employing a different type of workflow which relies on generated geometry
84

85
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.200
rather than real geometry that we can work on directly.
85

86
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.350
And as you can see here we end up with some very nice smooth curves and transitions between and we can
86

87
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.140
still control it quite well.
87

88
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.210
I'm going to take this bit in the middle and increase the mean increase here to really tuck that 
88

89
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.950
in I'm going to whiz round to the side and scale that out just a little more and then I'm going to increase
89

90
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:15.580
it again to make that that transition between the areas much stronger and then we can have a look at
90

91
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.280
it and just see how it looks overall.
91

92
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.500
And as you look across it you will notice it looks a bit lumpy I suppose.
92

93
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.550
And that's one of the things about it being so low poly.
93

94
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.800
Ultimately it's trying to round something that was quite faceted to begin with.
94

95
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:39.160
The only way really around that is to keep bumping up the subdivisions and eventually you do end up
95

96
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.270
with something that's pretty smooth but that comes at a cost.
96

97
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:52.990
We are now when we hit six subdivisions up at 212 almost two hundred and thirteen thousand vertices.
97

98
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.240
That's an awful lot for a small piece.
98

99
00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.790
And if we think the rest of our scene is going to have multiple of these pieces you really do have to
99

100
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.820
be careful. Now,
100

101
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:09.030
Whereas in a game engine the graphics card is capable of handling a lot of vertex data.
101

102
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.500
That's what it's doing because we're constantly editing and moving around even though we're using our
102

103
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.720
GPU in certain ways.
103

104
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.450
All of that vertex data is being held with the CPU on our computer so we can get really bogged down
104

105
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.960
and end up with a very slow viewport if we're not careful.
105

106
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.930
So it's worthwhile bearing that in mind when you start cranking up the subdivisions.
106

107
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:38.530
However if you go in for a photo realistic scene there's no reason why your final render subdivision
107

108
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.330
count couldn't be high.
108

109
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.190
So we can knock this down to maybe even now not not one but two subdivisions.
109

110
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.960
That gives us the basic shape.
110

111
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.200
There's not much of an improvement in shape when we go beyond two with this particular model.
111

112
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.040
What does happen here is you get a much better looking model.
112

113
00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.670
And when we're modelling that's not necessarily what we're after or after performance in the viewport
113

114
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.130
itself.
114

115
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.510
So we can get away with that.
115

116
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.650
However the render.
116

117
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.480
That's why you might want to bump it up and then when you do render it you may find it takes longer
117

118
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.360
to render than it would have done before.
118

119
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.820
But as you can see here that looks pretty sweet at this point.
119

120
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.630
It's almost time to put materials on this thing but I think we finish off the rest of the model first.
120

121
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.920
So there we go there's an exploration on sort of alternatives to bevelling and you can see that the
121

122
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.520
power of modifiers and just taking a different look at your models and realizing they can be incredibly
122

123
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.340
low poly yet high detail at the same time.
123

124
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.910
So that's it for this lecture if you've got any tips or different workflows that you want to share with
124

125
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:48.520
the community then do reach out over in the discussions let us know how you would do this.
125

126
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:54.160
I'd be very intrigued if you've got a different workflow and share it because there's never a wrong
126

127
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.720
way of modelling in Blender that's just different ways.
127

128
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.720
So share that over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
