00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.920
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.820
In this lecture we can work out a different type of texture to our board itself.

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.600
A generated texture.

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.060
The brilliant thing about these is they are procedural so we can change them continually until we just

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.670
find the one that we want.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.300
As you can see we've got a marble effect one here and some other crap called Mosaic type pattern as

7
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.890
well representing the back squares.

8
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.130
Let's find out how we do that okay.

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.280
So we will start off in our chest scene file here because I can show you on one of the color squares.

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.340
Of course you guys can go and finish off the other color first of all let's have a little zoom out and

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.150
have a look at our general setup for a material and the moment we have the wood material selected we've

12
00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.160
got a texture corner telling blender how we want to map all texture to our model.

13
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.460
In this case we're going to use the object the mapping node itself.

14
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.670
I don't think we're going to need that with our generate texture.

15
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.890
Then we've got our texture itself followed by the principal BSF and the material output.

16
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.760
So let's go to our white pieces.

17
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.550
You wouldn't use this dropdown here this is going to change the assignment of materials.

18
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.650
You want to go to where it is slot 3 and pick the white squares.

19
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.240
So you've got our principal B SDF and the material outputs.

20
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.240
Let's go ahead and add in.

21
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.350
Now we know it's called a texture cordon.

22
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710
You can find it under the input menu.

23
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.690
You can add texture horn in and we need a texture.

24
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.020
Now I'm just going to pick or a wave texture for the moment and plug in generated or object.

25
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.060
I don't think it's going to matter too much in this case and the color output into base color.

26
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.790
Now you wouldn't necessarily have the color output you could put the factor in the base color as well

27
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.180
or even the factor into something like the roughness and where it's black which will see more of in

28
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.860
a moment as I turn this up.

29
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.880
There we go.

30
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.140
You've got the stripy lines.

31
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.540
If I plug the factor into the roughness you'll see that where it's black.

32
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.420
Look at the eyes also shiny.

33
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.240
And of course then you can start playing with all of the extra bits and bobs a long pair trying to get

34
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.230
it looking much better.

35
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.610
And then we go get a mottled effect on the surface of our white squares pretty quickly.

36
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.310
And having it look pretty reflective in those parts and being controlled by this generates texture.

37
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.790
Now this points of course I can turn down the scale and hopefully what we do get is a more of a marble

38
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.650
effect.

39
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.880
So if we set that one there we go.

40
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.290
We've got a marble effect across our board.

41
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.160
So these are the basic four notes that we need in the set up.

42
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.010
You can use a texture not only to control the color but other aspects as well.

43
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.670
Now that's something we'll delve into much more detail later on.

44
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.770
But for the moment using the fact to change the values of the roughness is a good idea.

45
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.210
Sometimes you can use the color as well but you don't have to we can turn that off and you see here

46
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:30.620
we get a completely different effect which could be just as awesome as having the color there as well.

47
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.720
Of course at the moment we don't have anything in place to control the color more accurately or indeed

48
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.330
control the facts or more accurately and make things shinier or smoother or even a slightly different

49
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.880
color if we want to we're lacking that control in this sets up but we'll learn more about that later.

50
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.180
So now we've got one square sorted it's time for the black squares and I think that will be done in

51
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.440
a challenge okay.

52
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.400
So your challenge is to use a generated texture for the black squares on the board.

53
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.270
Straightforward pose video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back let's hop on over in splendor

54
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.120
and get those black squares a generated texture Okay everybody Welcome back.

55
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.240
Let's go ahead and going to go to slot 2 which is my black squares.

56
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:28.910
I'm going to add in a texture a very annoyed texture and I'm also going to add in an input texture corner

57
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.820
and just link these things together Hey guys.

58
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.980
Mark hair.

59
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.380
They've updated the very annoyed texture so it looks a bit different from what you're used to seeing

60
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.210
in the course.

61
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.600
We just go to an input texture coordinate first of all and go also to our textures.

62
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.000
And if I can get on that and get very annoyed texture note that's what we want.

63
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.700
There we go.

64
00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.600
And you know if they've brought in this new dropdown you can project in to get one day sorry to day

65
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.800
three day which is what we're used to seeing in Blender and also a fourth dimension.

66
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.320
Let's not go into the fourth dimension.

67
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.650
Let's get the object not the generated and put that into vector and also put the color into the base

68
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.160
color node.

69
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.430
I've also got it on looked at mode.

70
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.010
So that comes up almost immediately.

71
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.780
Now the difference here is going to be mainly the scale that we go if we turn that down that's more

72
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.130
to what's in the lecture.

73
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.810
We put it back default by this randomize.

74
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.810
That's quite cool.

75
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.680
You take it all the way down you've you've got a Minecraft blocker the Minecraft.

76
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:42.630
Awesome bringing around this back up but as we're saying it bring scale in that and you get a bit more

77
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.730
of what you're seeing in the lectures there.

78
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.770
I'm not quite sure what these are different although all different patterns they get a bit more variation

79
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.290
I think for this purpose.

80
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.840
We're using a Euclidean maybe Manhattan maybe Manhattan.

81
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.870
I'm OK with that in mind.

82
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.080
Back to Mike now.

83
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.290
This is one that actually has color in it.

84
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.780
So if I was to go in and change the cells you can see here if I turn the scale up we get a load of different

85
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.970
colored cells in our scene.

86
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.370
That's not what I want in this case.

87
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.720
So I'm not going to use that.

88
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.940
I could use the factor for instance and then I get a black and white version of that in fact that might

89
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.790
look quite nice on those white ones.

90
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.300
I'm not quite sure you know there's so many options that we can go for.

91
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.610
In fact I could leave the base color a solid color and just use the factor on the roughness itself.

92
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.820
See what happens then Woo.

93
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.340
I am liking that.

94
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.190
That's a very so faceted look much like the board and all sort of the pieces itself that turned on the

95
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.000
scale on it.

96
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.810
So let's play with the scale a little and so we're happy I'm happy with those larger versions.

97
00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:01.460
Now they are still quite light squares so I'm going to turn down color on that all the way down to black

98
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.370
and see what we've got.

99
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.640
OK brilliant.

100
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.640
I like the way that this is now starting to come together.

101
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.650
Of course there are many many other options that we can play with.

102
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.740
But for the moment let's keep it simple and see where we go.

103
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.040
Now I do encourage you to play with the different texture types.

104
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.970
Not only do we have Warren oi here but we have many many others some of which of course will not work

105
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.570
in this particular circumstance but it's useful to play around with them on a simple model like this

106
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:39.660
to see what their real effect is so that's it for this lecture please share your boards and your generated

107
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.710
textures how you've applied them over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
