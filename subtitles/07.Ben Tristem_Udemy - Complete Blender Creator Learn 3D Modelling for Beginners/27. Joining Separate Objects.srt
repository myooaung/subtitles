00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,380
Welcome to joining separate objects in this video.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,840
We will join the two meshes we've created together forming one mesh object.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,000
Now there is more than one way to do this.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,570
Obviously not the joining but the actual mechanics of how to make it look seamless between the two objects.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,860
Once you've brought them together and it of course it is likely to involve some read topology.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,650
So let's go explore this now and hop on over into blender.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,180
Okay so we have to mesh objects here and.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,140
Well first of all let's join them together so selected to be active one.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,520
Excellent.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,410
And then press control in J.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,250
And there we go.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,750
Done.

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,270
No I'm kidding.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,010
We've got a bit more to do because if we have a look at the topology we can see is or mis matched.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,670
So there's a couple things to think about here so the area that the ear is in.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,880
Well first of all let's select the whole ear and we can do that because all of these vertices have no

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,150
links whatsoever to the rest of them so we can just hit the L key select the ear and hide everything

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,030
else.

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,840
Now we select the outer edge loop running around here we can see we've got 20 vertices.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,250
Okay.

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,910
That's a starting point.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,990
And it's a nice even number as well which can help.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,240
OK.

24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's bring everything back.

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:32,960
Let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten.

26
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,430
OK.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,780
So we've got a a nice relationship here between this group here and the ears themselves so we've got

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,060
a tenor around here.

29
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:50,290
And a 20 around the inside so we can potentially start from this point and create more geometry.

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,330
But looking at the head itself does the edge of flow make sense at the moment.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,660
I don't think it does sir just like the ear itself if we have a look at the I how it gets more and more

32
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,540
detailed as it goes in and the same with the mouth.

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,460
What we don't have that around here there's no edge flow around the ears.

34
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:17,330
In fact the closest one I believe is along mutt's hop just here this one here.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,740
So that's the closest we have to this is having any edge flow around it.

36
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,220
And we want that so do we have one here almost.

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,600
So we almost have one running around there.

38
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:36,980
Let's make this happen around the edge itself and then we can get down to more and more detail and then

39
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,660
join it on to the 20.

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,130
Around here I am.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,860
I would rather do it that way than trying to make this twenty into 10 and taking it the other way.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,600
So.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,240
Guess what.

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,460
It's time for a challenge.

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,490
I would like you to go ahead and merge the ear and head together.

46
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:03,940
Now you've got all the necessary tools available to do this joining these two mesh objects together.

47
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,730
I'd like you to go ahead and merge the ear and head now join the two mesh objects together if you haven't

48
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,330
done already and then think about redefining the head or ear topology to match each other.

49
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,910
Now that will take some thinking and planning said Do save your file or create a new one so you can

50
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,710
play with it.

51
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,390
That's very important I don't want you ruining your head at this point having no way to fall back so

52
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,140
make sure you save Vance at this point because you're about to do some destructive work.

53
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:45,430
Finally think about the Edge loops and face loops on the side of the head hulky make it flow around

54
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,690
their ear much better.

55
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,170
Ideally I don't think I'll want to change the topology of the Iraq.

56
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,270
Rather the head itself.

57
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,440
So I think about rooting the edge loops that are around there to the rest of the head as well.

58
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:08,020
Perhaps there is too many at that point in time 20 but I'm sure I'll be able to fan that out relatively

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,150
successfully.

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,580
Do remember I only repeat myself here but do remember to save as and then work from there rather than

61
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,140
just saving one continuous model.

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,970
I don't want you guys losing you work you're doing wonderful so far and we don't want to spoil that.

63
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,680
So remember to save often and save as often as well when you're trying something.

64
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,050
Especially when it's destructive.

65
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,210
Considering things like bridging edge loops as well that's one way of joining these things together

66
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,750
if you manage to match the two edged loops running around.

67
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,360
Or you could do a very destructive process and remove half the side of the head and just reconstruct

68
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,340
the geometry from there is entirely up to you.

69
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,010
So go ahead pause a video now and give that a go.

70
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,220
Okay guys Welcome back let's go merge the ear and head together now over in blender.

71
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:10,020
Okay so first of all I'm going to go file save ours and I'm going to name this year and hared merge.

72
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,770
So I know exactly what this save as is.

73
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,540
There you go.

74
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,250
Oh I tried not to do that there again.

75
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,400
Difficulty with having a whopping great big mike framed between you and the keyboard.

76
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:21,930
Right.

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,300
So there are a couple of ways to approach this.

78
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,940
You can be highly destructive or not destructive.

79
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,940
That's all we've got.

80
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,440
If we go around this area we've got 10 edge loops in total.

81
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,830
That's that's one possibility.

82
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,700
What I'm going to do at this point in time is just explore some individual possibilities so I'm going

83
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,030
to just hide the air from the scene.

84
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,690
Well that was a great example of hiding the wrong thing.

85
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,710
There we go.

86
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,420
Okay.

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,020
I've not got select it.

88
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,050
Oh I didn't select everything.

89
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,940
Silly Billy.

90
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,700
Like this unhide everything.

91
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,080
And just the head and high beers.

92
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,500
Okay.

93
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:08,270
So I'm just going to explore what happens if we delete these vertices here right.

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,670
That will create an edge loop inside of mcclatchey 12.

95
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,890
Let's go ahead and delete this vertex here.

96
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,400
Now create an edge loop of magnitude 14.

97
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,060
That's the.

98
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,130
This one here.

99
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,490
And this is just one example of playing with the model.

100
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,280
This will be 16.

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,960
OK.

102
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,230
So this point we've got a decision to make I'll be 18.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
That'll be 20.

104
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,590
So this is one way you could approach it so we've got a massive great big hole in the head.

105
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,970
So we could bring those together and that's going to cause a bit of pinching so we could play with that

106
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,580
too.

107
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,570
You know a little bits without being too destructive.

108
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,930
You can make a hole in the head completely.

109
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:56,190
Okay so I'm going to leave it like that for the moment and just see what happens when I do a little

110
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,840
bit of merging because this may work it may not is a you know it's all about experimentation sometimes.

111
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,530
And there we go.

112
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,750
Got two edged loops sorted.

113
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,350
Let's.

114
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,730
Bridge edge loops and see what happens.

115
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,610
Okay.

116
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,680
Now does that destroy the top ology.

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,470
How much pinching do we have from.

118
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,830
Case So here's some horrible pinching behind.

119
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,560
There's a little bit stretching towards the ear which is fair enough.

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,520
And as a little bit underneath but actually has worked out relatively well.

121
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,640
I on it.

122
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,960
I'll be honest with you I was not expecting it to be quite so for chewits doing that.

123
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:42,450
Okay so I'm gonna stick with this and I'm going to add in an extra edge loop around here and I'm going

124
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:50,940
to use the smooth virtex command to try and smooth that out a little bit more.

125
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,190
I'm probably going to select this one up here.

126
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,930
It's edge looped round here.

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,180
Okay so we've got a couple of breaks in flow here.

128
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,250
Do we want.

129
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:05,940
So this edgerley running around here is broken up there and we've also got a five pole here so that

130
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,110
to me is kind of okaying kind of not so we've got a flow around the top and the bottom of the ear and

131
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,190
then we've got this flow in the middle here.

132
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,200
It would kind of be nice not to have too many of these pinch points.

133
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:27,300
So for instance it would be better if this point here was merged somewhere up here if possible or at

134
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,780
the top here so we've not got the she flow round.

135
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,620
Okay we've got another pinch point here for example.

136
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,650
So there's lots of little playing we can do around our model itself to try and get it looking just that

137
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,510
little bit neater and of course the the model itself gets quite dense around here.

138
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,310
In fact the whole air itself you can see that because the top colleges are being pushed down rather

139
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,300
than going around that's causing a little bit of a problem.

140
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:01,650
So around here perhaps if we take the edge flow and try and redirect it round of the year rather than

141
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,500
into the year that will stop this sort of funnel affect that's going on.

142
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,880
So I'm just going to manipulate these vertices for a moment and I will see back in a few moments.

143
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:21,460
Okay so having a look at the model now I have redirected some of the edge loops around.

144
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,290
I believe I've gotten rid of all the unnecessary junk that did exist.

145
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,640
There are a couple of things to do.

146
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,380
Like the fact that this ear is in fact sticking out of the head.

147
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,680
A very weird angle.

148
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,250
I've had a look at the back of the head and I don't have this bulge that exists on my ear coming out.

149
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,320
We have a look there.

150
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,720
Apologies out so a couple of ways of resolving that would.

151
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:56,270
Well there's two ways we can either movie in or this part of the model needs to not be bulging so much

152
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:02,700
so we can go along here and select the appropriate edges that we want to move.

153
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,270
Excellent.

154
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,710
Kevin this edge loopier G twice.

155
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,310
And just shift along there.

156
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,830
How's that looking much better much more smooth.

157
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,470
It just needs to be pulled out ever so slightly.

158
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,480
Okay let's hop back into object mode and have a look around the model.

159
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,220
Any nasty pinching.

160
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,470
Now no nasty pinching Okay that's looking pretty good.

161
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,630
The only thing that I don't like here is this rage that's going on here that needs to be pretty smooth.

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:42,760
And that again is a product of this edge here just being too low.

163
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,490
Of course if we lift it up don't quite get there entirely.

164
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,980
So I'm going to try just smoothing those out.

165
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,070
All of these around here huffin as the last thing I used as well.

166
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,850
Yet there you go.

167
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,000
Moving the virtex Okay there's Hopkins of.

168
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,930
Looks a bit better.

169
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,280
Not quite there yet.

170
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,760
Again there's quite a bit of bunched up information here.

171
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,330
The question I now have is is this age loopier even necessary.

172
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm going to guess not.

173
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,200
And to have room dissolve the edges so disappears.

174
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,440
That should get rid of some of our issues.

175
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,080
And then the next question is is this one of any use.

176
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,780
And again I don't think it is so.

177
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:36,430
Again we want as much geometry as necessary but as little as possible that is looking a lot neater already

178
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,090
and a lot smoother because of it.

179
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,970
Excellent.

180
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:47,510
Okay so the final thing is this bit here I am looking at the reference material.

181
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,220
Let's just make sure it all looks okay so it's not quite there yet.

182
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,040
We've still got a few issues along that stop.

183
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,330
Let's go into perspective mode as well.

184
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:07,890
Where's my model gone come up then it just makes it a little bit easier working around here.

185
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:16,510
I don't know what camera I've got set up to scroll down and have not seen that it's in a bit too wide

186
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,320
angled so lens here.

187
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,780
No it's set to 35 on the set 50.

188
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:30,130
So it's not so and barrelled as we're moving about how Kate so that looks fine.

189
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:36,310
It's just it's now after all that manipulation and moving some of the bits are missing.

190
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,950
So this area here needs moving down.

191
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,960
Now as you can see it's very easy to push it through itself.

192
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,810
Some of the term proportional editing on and try moving that again and then it will move the lock the

193
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,850
whole lot at once as it moved back round to the side.

194
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,250
So give myself a bit more space as well.

195
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,740
Okay.

196
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,960
This topic here this just needs lifting up and he's lifting up from here.

197
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,420
By the looks of it it's.

198
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,320
This back bit here and this top bit here or bit fiddling.

199
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,150
There we go.

200
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,810
Let's whiz background to the side and literally just lift that's up.

201
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,930
Okay.

202
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,890
That looks good.

203
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,220
This top bit here needs pressing back in.

204
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,130
So again back down to the side.

205
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,360
That's move it back ever so slightly have a go that's a better shape.

206
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:39,190
And again I'm half using the reference material for you know getting it right.

207
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,700
But on the flip side I'm also using my judgment on what I think looks good in this particular case.

208
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:54,010
Now if you were trying to do a case study of a real person obviously the better you pay attention to

209
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,360
their features the better the model will end up looking.

210
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,230
Simple as that.

211
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:09,970
I'm just going to pull this bit in these set of verses here and pull them into the model slightly.

212
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,000
There you go.

213
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,910
My liking.

214
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,090
That's OK.

215
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,470
Hey right let's whiz back out again.

216
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,420
There's lots of whizzing back out and forward and out.

217
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,780
Okay the ear looks much better now.

218
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,340
I'm happy with that.

219
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,880
How did your ear go.

220
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,290
Does it now look good when it's attached to your head or any disc these eyes out shortly.

221
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,960
We'll get round to the front of the face very shortly.

222
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,280
Case I'm um like in that that looks really nice.

223
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,430
How's yours getting on.

224
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,210
Please share your head as it is at the moment in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next

225
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,820
lecture.
