Hello everybody and welcome to this quick lecture on what are normals, Now normals are an incredibly
1

2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.400
useful part of Blender and generally we don't need to touch them but some things can happen that make
2

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.320
them go wrong.
3

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.280
But first of all before we get into it we're going to have a quick discussion about what a normal actually
4

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.810
is.
5

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.160
So if you grab a piece of paper in front of you and draw a straight line across using a ruler of course
6

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.860
the normal to that straight line is straight up at 90 degrees to it.
7

8
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.470
Now in the 3D world the simplest face we can have is a triangle.
8

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.100
And when we draw that triangle it creates a flat surface.
9

10
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.340
And if we were to take 90 degrees from that flat surface that is the normal of the surface.
10

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.640
Now normals are used all over the place.
11

12
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.230
We haven't started even discussing them yet and that's why they're coming up now.
12

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.920
If we just have each face having its own normal you get a very faceted look to your model.
13

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.290
You can see where all the individual faces are.
14

15
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.640
However we can do things like turn on smooth shading, If we go and turn on smooth shading what you will
15

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.160
find is something that looked like a disco ball originally starts to look more spherical more smooth
16

17
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.040
as the name implies now smooth shading is just one of the things that normals are used for, We use them
17

18
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.310
later on in texturing to make sure that a flat surface actually looks like it's textured that's faking
18

19
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.430
normals and we'll get to that later in the course.
19

20
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.950
Now the one thing about normals that a lot of people don't realize because blender doesn't show it that
20

21
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.730
well anymore is if you've got an inward facing normal just like the hairs on your body they're great
21

22
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.610
if they grow outwards and not inwards an inwards facing normal is going to cause you issues especially
22

23
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.090
if you exports your model to a game engine it will end up looking invisible and they will show you the
23

24
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.320
ways in a few moments that you can actually get round that and make sure you don't get any of those
24

25
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.910
problems.
25

26
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.620
But even I've been caught out occasionally where you inadvertently scale something negatively and if
26

27
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.770
you do that you will flip the normals of a face and if you were to export it or for a 3D printing it
27

28
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.950
would fail for a game engine it would turn invisible.
28

29
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.400
Now you can get around some of that but it's actually very computationally heavy.
29

30
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.310
You've probably seen this yourself when playing a game if you've ever clipped the level put your head
30

31
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.680
through the wall or even fallen through the floor in some games where the physics collisions just don't
31

32
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.330
work.
32

33
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.430
You don't see the rest of the world it goes invisible you can see through everything.
33

34
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.210
And that is exactly why we need to be conscious of what normals are and how we can correct them.
34

35
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.880
So let's dive deeper into this now in the next lecture will have a look at normals within blender how
35

36
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.700
we can manipulate them and also how we can watch out for those pitfalls that I've been discussing and
36

37
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.590
I'll see you all in that next lecture.
