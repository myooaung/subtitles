Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture.
1

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.200
Quick tip on sliding now we've touched upon sliding in the last lecture when we were talking about loop
2

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.000
cut and slide and you saw that we could move that loop cut backwards and forwards.
3

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.370
That is the act of sliding but we can do that individually with vertices edges and faces so as you can
4

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.110
see we've got a vertex selected here.
5

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.810
If I was to go ahead and slide that it will slide along any of the edges that are already there.
6

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.190
Now this is incredibly useful when manipulating any of the existing geometry that we have on our model.
7

8
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.690
Let's go find out more.
8

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay.
9

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.020
So we're going to start with our default cube going to zoom in slightly and go into edit mode and we'll
10

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.770
start with vertex select.
11

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.730
If we go ahead and select a single vertex and press the G key twice now that turns on sliding that's
12

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.910
all there is to it.
13

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.330
And now we can see that this vertex will move along the edges that already exist.
14

15
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.210
If we do the same thing with Edge select turned on it will move along the faces of just G once will
15

16
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.990
do that.
16

17
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.350
And the second G will help slide this along the faces of already exist and with face select it will
17

18
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.660
slide along long press G twice.
18

19
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.960
It'll slide along the existing edges that exist that make up that face.
19

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.790
Now one thing to bear in mind if I accept that slide and have a look at the operator panel we're not
20

21
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.900
moving in an amount we're moving it a factor.
21

22
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.420
So 50 percent if we wanted this to be half high it would be point five.
22

23
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.770
And we've got some other options here that may be suitable depending on the model that you're doing.
23

24
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.160
But that's something to bear in mind that as you're moving it you're actually moving it relative to
24

25
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.420
the overall size.
25

26
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.680
In this case of the edges that make up this cube with zero being in the middle minus one being 100 percent
26

27
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.470
one way and one being 100 percent the other way course in this case we just want point five.
27

28
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.640
There we go.
28

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.410
Now this is going to be useful through out your modelling and that's why it's just a quick tip.
29

30
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.910
But I want you to use the skills that you've just learned now in a quick micro challenge if you remember
30

31
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.910
the base of our pyramid is currently two meters high.
31

32
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.450
I'd like you to use edge slide rather than just moving in order to shrink it.
32

33
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.880
So it's only one meter high like all of the other steps of our model, pause the video now and give that's a
33

34
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.150
go.
34

35
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.380
Hello everybody and welcome back.
35

36
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.890
Let's go ahead now and open up our pyramid.
36

37
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.400
There we go.
37

38
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.650
So we're gonna have to go round in face select at the very bottom we see that it's not it's not actually
38

39
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.260
on the ground plan at the moment it kind of goes beneath.
39

40
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.540
So if we go and have a look at the bottom we're gonna have to select more than one face so let's go
40

41
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.390
ahead and do that with those three faces selected.
41

42
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.180
I'm going to go G G.
42

43
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.620
Now I know that you could just go G Z one at this case but I'm going to practice the skill we've just
43

44
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.150
learnt and indeed show you that there's another way of doing this.
44

45
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.100
Now we remember it's relative we just discussed that.
45

46
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.260
So it's very tempting to hit one and wonder where where it's gone you know it was too high you only
46

47
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.770
want to move it by one but actually in this case we want to move it by point 5.
47

48
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.060
Whilst it's locked on those axis there if you move your mouse it may lock to another place which will
48

49
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.790
end up looking a bit horrible.
49

50
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.790
So we just move it back to the right place and I'm just gonna press Enter to confirm that I don't need
50

51
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.930
to do anything else I don't need to adjust our operator panel at all I'm happy with how that looks brilliant.
51

52
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.910
So a nice straightforward challenge there.
52

53
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.730
Hope you've now got a pyramid with the base at Z equals zero and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
