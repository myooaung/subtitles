1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,110
Welcome to possible construction efforts.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,860
So before we get cracking on with any actual modelling we need to plan our journey.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,440
And there are many ones we can take.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,140
And has always with everything.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,680
There is no right way.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,280
Now we could go ahead doing box modelling we could build up the model from a primitive adding more and

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,830
more detail as we go.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,640
We could do what's called Polly to Polly which is building up your model one polygon at a time.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,170
And this can be.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,160
It feels like it's going to be a slow way but it does give you a lot of control over your model.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:44,240
And then finally we could sculpt the actual head and bust itself and then reet apologize.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,600
And this can be very time consuming so there's a balance to be had.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,990
The box modelling at the top may be great if you didn't need to animates because you're likely to end

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,990
up with your edge flows that we were talking about in the previous lecture in the wrong place you'd

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,830
have to do a lot of Rita apologizing which is where you reconstruct your mesh and in order to add that

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,720
detail and add the loops going in the right way.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,290
Polly to Polly is great because it does allow us to create the loops from scratch and that gives us

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,940
a lot of control over the model with something as complicated as a head that might be the way to go.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,780
Now sculpting and then reet apologizing afterwards can be very time consuming but it does give us a

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,950
high detailed model that we could potentially bape detail from back onto a lower poly model and then

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,570
that does give us some advantages.

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,900
However there is no right way so it depends what you want to achieve.

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:53,130
So let's hop on over in a blender and have a look at all three and see which ones we could work with.

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,260
Hey so we're back over in blender here and I've got the default cube in the scene and we have a quick

25
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,710
look about how we would go about just a quick rough model here how we might go about making it in a

26
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,260
block model style.

27
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,680
So I'm going to hop into edit mode on my Cuban scale it up by about two times.

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,380
So it's a bit easier to work on can always scale it backwards forwards afterwards.

29
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,620
I'm now going to hop back into object mode because I'm going to use the subdivision surface modifier

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,750
to actually make it more give me more polygons to work with.

31
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,140
Now you could use loop and slide and work from there or indeed you could just subdivide the cube.

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,470
But I'm going to go to the modifiers tab and do a subdivision surface modifier and set it to number

33
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,420
level two and then click apply.

34
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,550
Now before I go any further because that gives me a good starting point to work from I would probably

35
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:58,320
go around to the front view in orthographic projection and then either with wireframe mode turned on

36
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,020
or limits a selection limited selection to visible turned on.

37
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,210
Course we need to be in edit mode to do that which is there so we could use each other one.

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,390
It doesn't really matter I only use wireframe make sure nothing is selected and then using the board

39
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:20,160
a select highlight half the models vertices and delete them.

40
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,480
Now I'm going to go in and add another modifier which would be the mirror modifier and make sure clipping

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,970
is ticked so I can't cross over the barrier in the middle.

42
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,370
Now this gives me another turn.

43
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,160
Wireframe back off.

44
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,610
This gives me a basic head shape for I can work from.

45
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:47,700
And of course here then I would start going here and maybe it should doing vose downwards we go.

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,570
So that gives you an idea of how we can start block modelling.

47
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,200
I grab that and pull it slightly forward etc etc. and we can go round and use proportional editing of

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,110
course to help us out.

49
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,510
We of moving lots of hertz's it was easy to see how very quickly you can build up a shape from there.

50
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,630
But this does have loops but they're kind of in the wrong place.

51
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,000
This one's got all.

52
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:20,350
I say they're in the wrong place but this one has a loop around the face but it's kind of broken up.

53
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:28,360
We see here in the corner there is a Pole where three joins us not continue sedgley going round there.

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,080
The loop itself is broken by the acts of their being.

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,000
These three edges meeting one another.

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,290
So that's an example of a pole stopping an edge loop.

57
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,590
If I were to try and select this one just beneath it.

58
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,910
We can see it runs all the way round.

59
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,650
So in many ways that's a good starting point but it doesn't give us any flexibility straight away over

60
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,940
the eyes themselves or the nose we'd have to add a lot of detail in and let's have a look.

61
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,560
Now at Poly to poly modelling so I'll start my self up a new file and then get rid of the cube.

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,150
In this case I'm going to move around to the front view and just zoom in a little and I'm going to add

63
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,610
mesh and single vertex there is.

64
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,570
Add a single vertex and then from this single vertex you can literally extrude and start making the

65
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,260
shape that you want.

66
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,790
And of course once you've done that there is our first polygon.

67
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,610
Now I don't have any reference material on the screen at the moment which is something I would advise

68
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,270
you always have.

69
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,730
And of course from this point you could do things like grab the edge and extrude.

70
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,840
I do want to be on the front view at the moment so that not extruding into the middle of nowhere and

71
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,260
then I could rotate that edge extrude rotate that edge and you can probably guess what I'm building

72
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,010
up at the moment.

73
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:04,910
It's going to become the eye and of course we want to make sure there's a much detail in there as possible

74
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,130
and you can go round and you can do this unless you can see this can be a little bit time consuming

75
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,810
but it does give you lots of lots control of the model as we go.

76
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,360
And of course I do need to do things like rotate a few bits around should press rotate instead of E.

77
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,740
Omega rotate that one round.

78
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,600
Of course I can turn snapping on make it edge select.

79
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,100
Now let's do virtex and move it in.

80
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,130
That's that one done.

81
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,570
Going to get a furtak Select here.

82
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,130
Move that one across.

83
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:44,960
Now because I haven't turned on the merging vertices on the snapping at all over here I'm going to have

84
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,560
to just select everything and under the new space and type in doubles and remove those doubles and that's

85
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,430
remove those extra bits there then I can play with this to my heart's content.

86
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:02,270
Then I can select one of these outer loops perhaps extrude it by nothing and scale it out as starts

87
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,780
create the loops around me.

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,760
I very powerful doing it that way because it gives us a lot of control.

89
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,160
Of course we do need to remember this is a 3D package and we'd need to start moving these in and out

90
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,340
as well to get the face shape that we want.

91
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,700
Finally let's have a look at sculpting.

92
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,850
So here we are back with the standard cube in our scene now going through the sculpting method.

93
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:36,750
You could start by working with this and strain to sculpt and then obviously you can't do anything when

94
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,210
it's just Scott's.

95
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,840
These four vertices in but you could turn on dynamics apology and work from their mouth.

96
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:50,670
I wouldn't recommend doing that straight away as it somewhat destroys the mesh topology having good

97
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,430
topology.

98
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,690
You definitely have to re to apologize if you did that.

99
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:02,130
However that is good adding detail in certain areas for baking that to a lower polygon model.

100
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,990
So one of the first things I would do here would be to subdivide it again.

101
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,890
Oh I missed subdivide there.

102
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,740
I would subdivide it again by a couple of times just to get started from there.

103
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:22,140
I would once again go into edit mode around the front in their orthographic projection and wireframe

104
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,080
on to the border select off the sand deselecting everything and just getting rid of those vertices and

105
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,490
then adding in the mirror modifier with clippings turned on.

106
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,870
That's absolutely fine.

107
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,960
But from here because I'm sculpting I would then go and add in a multi resolution modifier and subdivided

108
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,260
a couple of times in object mode.

109
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,310
Perhaps to this level initially so you can see it pinches slightly in the corner.

110
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,440
It's not going to be great topology to begin with but it's somewhere to start.

111
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,540
Especially if you want to sculpt.

112
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,500
And now I can unhide that and they go there's a basic nose coming in.

113
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,720
And if we were to recess.

114
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,740
I shif.

115
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,420
That's moving that's just subtract.

116
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:17,890
Okay so you can see here how with a bit of care you can start building up a head and obviously heads

117
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,830
aren't spherical like vats so you'd change the size of your brush perhaps push in the back a bit at

118
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,220
the back of the neck.

119
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,590
And of course most people don't have a face looking support.

120
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,100
Height fat you'd need to pull it out down here.

121
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,110
Course what we're not seeing at the moment is how it's looking in this mode.

122
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,020
In object mode so we'd switch to that.

123
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
See here that the preview as we build it up.

124
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,940
When you get there and we can see that there's a seam happy down the front face as well so that something

125
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,790
will have to pay attention to later on.

126
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,810
Does it disappear with higher subdivisions.

127
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:01,090
No and that's basically the mirror modifier when it joins together it's not joined together completely

128
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,630
flush so would have to bear that in mind.

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,220
In fact at this point does re the mirror modifier actually make a difference.

130
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,230
No because the mortie Rose has to exist at the top in this case so we can't do that.

131
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,550
But you can then play around with this.

132
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,000
If we hop back into sculped mode of course we only see one half so it's worthwhile bearing in mind that

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,560
we only see one half and then you can really start to zoom in and say well let's make it easier.

134
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,550
It's mean that Brusher bit smaller.

135
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,360
In there we go very quickly you start building it up and of course this is rough and ready.

136
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,300
You could take a bit more care over it and I have at the moment but you can see how you could start

137
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,730
building up a model really quickly.

138
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,600
Okay guys it's challenged time.

139
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,750
I would like you to think about your construction.

140
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,460
So plan how you're going to build up your model.

141
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:02,110
Sketch out your plan whether you're using the blender itself to mock it up in 3D or using plain old

142
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,870
pen paper or digital pen and paper.

143
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,100
It's absolutely fine.

144
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,880
Just so you get an idea and start thinking forward about your modelling.

145
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:19,750
Now think carefully about each stage how are you going to generate the shapes that you want to generate.

146
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,330
Now at this stage I'd like you to keep the level of detail to a rough shape because this will be the

147
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,870
base mesh that we could use for other things as well.

148
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,230
And remember to place loops at key features.

149
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,020
Now at the moment you're not going to be making the detail for the eyes or things like that but you

150
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,250
will be keeping the general level of detail so if you.

151
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,920
But you will be defining where things are both horizontally and vertically across your model.

152
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:57,310
And at those points that's a good place to place the loops so balls of video now and give that a go.

153
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,210
Okay guys.

154
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,340
Welcome back.

155
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,060
I just like to show you my sketch of the plan.

156
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,440
I am going to go through it of course if you got a slightly different plan I encourage you to stick

157
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,670
to yours and see how it pans out as well.

158
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,290
So let's have a look at it.

159
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,350
Okay so as you can see here I am going to start with something that looks very much like a cube.

160
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,130
I'm then going to subdivide the cube.

161
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:27,310
Now we've been through that in the previous example and then I'm going to go ahead and get the rough

162
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,950
shape.

163
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,400
Of course I'm going to mirror it at some point I've forgotten to write down that step so I don't have

164
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,780
to do the same thing on both sides and the extra loops in to help define some more shape as we go No

165
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,850
for there and extrude down the neck area and then the final thing that I am going to do with this base

166
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:53,880
is I'm going to finalize the shape and if we have a look in at the face itself you can see I've started

167
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,070
think about where things are going to go.

168
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,880
There's going to have to be an extra couple of loop around there.

169
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,970
Of course I might already have placed one in the right place which is great.

170
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,270
I'm going to use the reference material for the position as well which is very important.

171
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:16,060
And finally just a reminder there for myself not adding too much detail at the moment so even though

172
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,920
we're going to define whether features will be unknot going to be defined in the actual features just

173
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,650
as yet.

174
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,780
And then of course um.

175
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,610
Just a reminder there to savour as.

176
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,760
So that's going to be my base meche done and I can obviously take that mesh and use it for other characters

177
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,460
as well as it's just going to be a generic shape.

178
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,490
Of course it is going to be based upon my particular reference material.

179
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,480
So if you want to use your own reference material than of course it's going to be a slightly different

180
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,660
shapes you go along with me.

181
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,290
Okay.

182
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,160
Brilliant right.

183
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,020
I think we're almost ready now to start modelling.

184
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:58,330
So please share your methodology in the discussions so we can see how your planning to get your particular

185
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,110
model made.

186
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,320
Are there any steps that you've thought about that aren't here.

187
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,650
As I say I've missed out mirror there.

188
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,770
Be interesting to see how your going to develop your model forward.

189
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,700
So thank you for sharing and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
