00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.930
Welcome to the malty resolution modifier in this video you will learn how to use the malty resolution

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.940
modifier.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.210
See the similarities to the subsurface division modifier and see that it is great from multiple resolutions

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.170
of a single model will learn how to control sharp edges using another technique for also works with

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.110
the subsurface division modifier and understand that it is best applied to a base mesh that is close

6
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.820
to the final lower poly version of the model you're working on.

7
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.740
So let's go hop straight on over in a blender.

8
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.900
Okay so we're back over in blender and the first thing we're going to have a look at is the sub surface

9
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.870
division modifier some just going to go ahead and apply it straight away to this cube.

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.790
So we've played with these before.

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.510
I'm going to take them up to a level of five.

12
00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.360
So we end up with 12000 triangles and we end up with a relatively smooth ball shape especially if we

13
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.320
turn on smooth shading.

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.170
Now one of the things that we can do when we're in the subsurface division modifier is when we hop in

15
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.230
to edit mode we can actually see the effects of what's going on and that isn't the case with the multi

16
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.500
resolution modifier.

17
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.260
And the option to turn it on and off if he ever did want to do that is that on the modifiers tab over

18
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.200
here there is a cube with four vertices highlighted and that means display the modify in edit mode not

19
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380
all modifiers can do that.

20
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.350
The subsurface division can.

21
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.630
So let's talk about creases how to make something sharp.

22
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.060
So there are a number of ways of doing that so one of the ways that we already know about is perhaps

23
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.430
to add a loop cut in and then pull the vertices closer together and we can even inset the face here

24
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.740
or even put them on top of one another.

25
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.060
And when you do put them on top of one another.

26
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.130
So let's just move them on top.

27
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.430
We end up with a very very sharp edge.

28
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.170
And this is one of the examples where perhaps you did want to put geometry on top of one another.

29
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.880
Unfortunately you don't generally get really sharp edges like that unless it's a knife.

30
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.890
In real life some asking to undo those steps there.

31
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.310
So we end up back without those that extra geometry.

32
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.270
The other thing we can do in order to make sure we don't have geometry is actually select edges so you

33
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.500
can use the vertex silhouette or face select to give us.

34
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.700
I'm going to select the four edges at the bottom here and if we go to the properties panel we can open

35
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.270
up that and go to edges data and go to mean creese and turn that up and we can see we get to a very

36
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.610
similar level we were before.

37
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.440
Very very powerful However because we don't have the extra geometry there.

38
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.130
Notice how you have some shading artefacts around this edge here because the shade doesn't quite know

39
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.130
what to do if we were in flat shading mode need to be an object mode to do that.

40
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.600
You will see that it looks sharp again.

41
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.860
So there are benefits to having a extra geometry there because it helps the shade and know really what's

42
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.440
happening underneath.

43
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.150
So that's one way of making sure there is a shortcut for that which is shift in E.

44
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.080
And then you can control that level with the mouse and obviously that's a much quicker to pull together

45
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.100
a certain shape and you can see here because we've got fundamentally were starting with a cube.

46
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.520
If we look at it it pinches in four separate corners here.

47
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.200
And that's where those shading artefacts have come from when that is set at 100 percent.

48
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.990
And when you put smooth shading on so smooth shading you can see it pinches here here in here.

49
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.570
And it's ultimately that's just adhering to the underlying geometry.

50
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.820
So now we've played with those particular tools.

51
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.360
Let's see how that works if we go ahead and add in a multi resolution modify nothing happens initially

52
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.170
because we need to go hit this subdivide button.

53
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.510
Now as always be very careful when you are working with anything that does subdivision you can very

54
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.230
quickly end up at a crazy level.

55
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:18.370
So whereas the subdivision's surface modifier caps out at what was it about six levels of subdivision

56
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.020
already on eight and at seven hundred and eighty six thousand polygons we can go to nine which is three

57
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.100
million polygons and I'm not going to click subdivide again because there's a good chance that I will

58
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.800
either lock up blender or cause it to crash so I'm not kind to do that during this demonstration.

59
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.510
Now we do have to be careful here.

60
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.720
When working in such high resolutions.

61
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.960
But this high resolution is very good for sculpting because it gives you a fine control over the geometry

62
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.000
of your mesh.

63
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.580
So what we can do here is actually turn down the preview amounts.

64
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.980
So let's say something like two.

65
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.030
Now that's going to be a bit too dense on the term flat shading back on.

66
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.290
So you can see the underlying mesh that is creating there.

67
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.810
So that's quite low polygon and you probably could get away with one lower.

68
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.610
Yeah do that.

69
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.800
But when we go into sculpt mode now we see that we've got a lovely smooth surface which we can start

70
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:23.200
working on so a little bit jerky at the moment but it's got far more control than the lower poly version.

71
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.930
When we hop out of that in to object mode we can see the effect that it's made on the lower poly version

72
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.440
so actually changes the low poly version too which is incredibly powerful.

73
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.850
Now there are some caveats.

74
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.660
If we go into edit mode we just see the cube again which isn't very helpful if you've got to modify

75
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.540
the geometry in this particular case.

76
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.630
This is what I mean by when I say when you're close to the fine or low poly version it doesnt have to

77
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:59.080
be the final low poly version but you need something that resembles the lowest pot level on this preview

78
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.630
that we've currently got set.

79
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.670
So a preview of three so what I'm going to do there is not do any more sculpting because that is going

80
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.720
to be a waste of time.

81
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.440
What we need to do is actually go ahead and apply a certain level of detail first.

82
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.170
Now you may have made this manually so I'm just going to close off the modifier completely.

83
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.810
I'm going to use a subsurface division modifier to generate a low poly and let's call it a bullet.

84
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.570
It kind of looks like one.

85
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.950
So here's my low poly bullet and I'm going to apply that so that's my low poly model when I go into

86
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.600
edit mode.

87
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.100
I can see physical geometry here which is great.

88
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.790
Now when I go back into the multi resolution modify and obviously crank that up.

89
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.620
It it's very tempting to click on the actual preview level to move up.

90
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.720
Don't you click on the subdivide and Im not going to go any higher than 5 on this count and will drop

91
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.890
the preview back down to zero because that is ultimately the preview and its light and fast in the viewport.

92
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.930
At this point as well and then when I go into sculpt mode it goes to the higher resolution version.

93
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:11.770
Now if I decide to add some detail on here let's just wade all about a bit and get that on there and

94
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.850
then put some let's say smaller spots on it doesn't really matter.

95
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.000
The amount of detail we're going for here.

96
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.350
But this is a detail that won't resolve when we have a look at it in edit mode.

97
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.990
Notice that it hasn't changed in object mode as the geometry.

98
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.960
We need a preview level of at least one to see that the underlying geometry changes.

99
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.360
But in edit mode it does not.

100
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.940
There is a button here called apply base which will sort that out for us so if we go to object mode

101
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.760
and say we're happy with that level of geometry and the shape that it's created we can go ahead and

102
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.200
apply base and once we've done that we can then go back into edit mode and see how it's really changed

103
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.970
the mesh and then alter it accordingly.

104
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.130
If we want to that is an optional step of course and gives you more control.

105
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:09.360
So when we're in object mode here and we can see the underlying geometry here what would be really cool

106
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:16.380
is being able to bake the detail of the higher poly version onto this lower poly model and you can do

107
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.090
that as well.

108
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.230
Now we're not going to do that in this particular section but you can already see how if you had a high

109
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:29.850
poly model whether it be a character or anything else you can actually get high detail and transfer

110
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:36.770
it to an exact low poly version of it very quickly using the multi resolution modifier because we've

111
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:42.700
got the low poly version here at only three thousand polygons if I'm looking up here at the top right.

112
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.020
And every hopping to sculpt mode we can see that we're really working with underneath.

113
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:55.140
Seven hundred and eighty six thousand four hundred thirty two polygons which is significantly more than

114
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:02.030
the low poly version but we can probably get all of this detail applied to that low poly version.

115
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:08.190
And through normal maps and bump maps etc. and it look pretty much the same in fact I'm going to use

116
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.140
this as a demonstration not in this lecture but in a future one so I'm going to go ahead and just save

117
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.460
that file after I've made the blob and call it a blob.

118
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.920
Why not.

119
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.110
I'm in the wrong area.

120
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.590
Make sure I'm in the right area and I do.

121
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.250
As always I do recommend especially when you're playing with modifiers or rendering that you make sure

122
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.420
you safe because there's a good chance blender might crashing you some and put this in my resources

123
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.110
folder and call this multi rez blob because that is all it is.

124
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.150
At the moment.

125
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.340
Go save that file.

126
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.140
Excellent.

127
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.110
All sorted now of course.

128
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.140
I've got a challenge for you.

129
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.160
I would like you to go ahead and use the multi rez modify your scene.

130
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:57.170
Now I will be making a basic pillar getting the size and shape right and then increasing it to a level

131
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.730
of details or b type of level I may even go above that.

132
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.990
Of course if you've already done Pillar's or you need to make something else you're not making a gothic

133
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.220
church for instance.

134
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.750
Perhaps fine ornaments or if you are doing a church practice an angel or something like that really

135
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.960
challenge yourself at this point to make the best use of a multi resolution modifier.

136
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:25.160
Now I would suggest applying a mortie Rose of around four subdivisions that is usually the right difference

137
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.560
between the low poly and the high poly detail then it gives you a lot of scope for modifying.

138
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.820
Of course choose whether or not you want to use a bit of sculpting in there to perhaps add a bit of

139
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.700
a symmetry a lot of things we build in any 3D modelling package tend to be very symmetrical and you

140
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.070
start prodding and poking vertices.

141
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.060
Of course the sculpting is a great way of doing that.

142
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.290
Set the origin to the centre of the base of whatever object you're doing and the reason for that is

143
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.420
it enables you to position it a lot lots easier.

144
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.570
Then if it's not because then on the object when you're in object mode you can actually just move it

145
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.500
to the floor for instance or move it to a certain height or position with great ease.

146
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.820
Some of the mini set in the origins of the centre of my base of my pillar.

147
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.280
Remember to use the mean edge crease to keep the desired shape.

148
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.810
Just to give you a heads up here before we plough back into blender we are going to start with a low

149
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.750
poly model something looking similar to this.

150
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.800
We are going um of May.

151
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.510
Im probably going to make mine in some sections we can see we've got a base there.

152
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.520
We've got three or sorry four sections there that look the same.

153
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.560
Very similar.

154
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.400
And then of course we've got this area here and the top one at the top.

155
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.320
Now when I say apply I mean edge press when you go on apply V.

156
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.120
Multi resolution modifier and something like this it ends up looking a bit like this which is.

157
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:56.090
Well it doesn't look quite right now of course we can construct this with detail using similar methods

158
00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:03.320
to the chess set that we've done but just applying the mean edge on it will make it look much better

159
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.270
much more crisp in place as you can see the difference there and also the rendering artefacts tend to

160
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.510
disappear as well.

161
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.950
You make it a bit neater So that's brilliant.

162
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.950
So balls are video now and give that a go.

163
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.480
Okay guys.

164
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.630
Welcome back.

165
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.280
Let's go use the mortie resolution modifier.

166
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.860
Okay so we're back over in blender and I've got a few things that I need to work on.

167
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:35.310
First of all and that is how high does my pills have to be because I haven't a clue.

168
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.400
I've four completely forgotten to manage my measurements here so let's go to my mike off a church.

169
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.650
I'm going to go into walkaround mode.

170
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.730
Oh not with a camera.

171
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.860
Moving the camera if I do that so it's position that I'm just moved away.

172
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.550
So it's some points in here.

173
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.310
All those things have appeared there.

174
00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:01.170
We're going to have pillows coming up to these points so I need to have a look at what height these

175
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.830
rats compared to the rest of our model.

176
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:13.860
And I think it's going to be eight points two because we've got a point to Undeground then we've got

177
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.410
a one wall section to wall sections.

178
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.540
So I think we're going to be at a level of eight point two so I'm going to go for that.

179
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.570
And we've got the width here also I'll probably do is import one of these vaults into a separate file

180
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.480
and use that as a reference and then just remove it when necessary.

181
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.750
And I seem to have everything turned on at the moment anyway.

182
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:40.110
I'm also going to sort out this belltower because belltower don't look like that I've actually had a

183
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.790
look at reference material and as cool as that is it doesn't help.

184
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.870
I thought it didn't look right and now I know why.

185
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.200
It's because they don't look like that normally.

186
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.710
Brilliant.

187
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:55.180
Okay so I'm going to go and get all that stuff ready and I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

188
00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:01.990
Okay so I've set up now a basic column as you can see here at the appropriate high.

189
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.710
I'm not making four of them because these are buttoned up next to one another.

190
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:11.930
I would end up with them overlapping basically So I'm going to place them in the scene manually and

191
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:12.820
use arrays.

192
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.020
But there's my basic column using this Voltz as reference as you can see I've got some legacy stuff

193
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.590
left over from the vaults.

194
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.490
I'm going to clear that down I'm happy with the height afterwhile.

195
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.890
I will after I've compared it in the Gothic church scene so let's hop over there and see if this column

196
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.710
fits.

197
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.320
So I've imported appended it into the scene and we're going to save this particular one because it's

198
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.130
just for testing by can see here that the pillars are indeed the right height.

199
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.040
In my scene absolutely fine.

200
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.510
They are too big of a right height but they're too big.

201
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:51.140
So this is one of these great examples of doing things as lean as possible bringing them in.

202
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.960
Arguably I should have brought them in earlier if I was being lean because then I wouldn't have this

203
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.430
oddity around the roofline.

204
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.800
Perhaps I'll make that into the model since it's interior.

205
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.630
I might even just leave that.

206
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.960
No one can ever see it although we've got an exterior Plus in case you're looking out the window.

207
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.930
So let's go back into the church.

208
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.390
So I'm happy with the height.

209
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.180
I'm not happy with the width there.

210
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:21.070
They can be a lot thinner and obviously a bit more shapely as well to reflect the opulent nature of

211
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.990
the rest of this building.

212
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:30.040
So with that in mind I'm going to go in and model my pillars and I will see you guys back in a bit.

213
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.920
Okay so I've moved my final pillars in.

214
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.370
Well perhaps not my final but the ones on working with at the moment a vault of the top of the church

215
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.510
as you can see there.

216
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.410
And let's go and fly on inside and take a look at the pillars.

217
00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:51.530
So I've added some detail to the pillars and made them a bit smaller.

218
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.950
And of course the final thing is just to do a quick render here and see how it pans out.

219
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.720
Now there's some alignment time.

220
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:07.460
Now it looks like I might need to do in between these that one spots on as does that one actually I

221
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.170
think this was just looking odd because of the corner.

222
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:15.890
So there are some extra bits geometry I can put in there are not an architect after all.

223
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.170
But that is looking pretty good.

224
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.780
So the final thing is to do is to render it out and see how it looks.

225
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.210
How are yours coming along.

226
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:28.110
I'd love to see them in the discussion so please share them so I can see how you're getting on.

227
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.010
And so the other students can as well.

228
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.230
And of course as always I will see you guys in the next lecture.
