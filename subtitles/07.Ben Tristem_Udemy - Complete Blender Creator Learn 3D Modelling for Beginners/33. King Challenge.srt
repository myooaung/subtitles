00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,040
Hello everybody and welcome to another challenge.
1

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,870
Yes it's time to make the last piece the king.
2

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,900
Now I suggest starting from something like the Queen as it's a good starting point although you can
3

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,950
also just start from just the base if you want to.
4

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,060
Now look at your specifications.
5

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,920
Is your king bigger on the base.
6

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,830
Now mine is going to be 4.5 centimeters across the bottom rather than the four for the rest of the pieces
7

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,360
except the pawns which were three.
8

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,980
So with that in mind pause video now and give that to go
9

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,140
Okay everybody Welcome back.
10

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,570
Let's hop on over into blender and make our king.
11

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,540
Okay Welcome back.
12

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,920
Let's load up our queen to begin with.
13

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,160
Go file save as king.
14

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,380
Unlike last time.
15

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,700
Okay so we've got a good starting point.
16

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:03,280
Need to turn on my previous image and then to delete and add back in making sure that the 3d cursor
17

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,830
is in the center of the scene.
18

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,140
Image as a plain pick for King.
19

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,580
Scale it by a lot.
20

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:17,330
To begin with roughly there and then press s followed by holding down the shift key to move it slowly
21

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,010
into 4.5.
22

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,390
Now it's gonna be relatively easy with this to scale it up to 4.5.
23

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:32,570
Since we just need to scale it by and I already know this one point 1 2 5 Ah look at that is a rounding
24

25
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:32,940
error.
25

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:40,550
And now to scale it and hold down shift just to get that final bit of so close.
26

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,900
Anyway I'm going to grab this.
27

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,640
Rotate it around on the X axis by 90.
28

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,470
It's just a matter of moving it up.
29

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,030
Now one thing to note here if I go G, Z it will look like it's coming towards and away from us.
30

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,810
That's because at the top here it still said the transform orientation.
31

32
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,140
Last thing we do is playing with the queen.
32

33
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,880
Let's remember those settings.
33

34
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,780
It's going to set that's a global.
34

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,330
And then when I go G, Z guess what it will go up the global up.
35

36
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,690
OK.
36

37
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,080
The next thing I want to do is a bit of a tidy up around the top here.
37

38
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:19,430
I'm going to go ahead grab all of these faces and what that should do with all of those faces selected
38

39
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,810
is remove when I delete vertices pretty much all of the spikes the entire top basically so we go extra
39

40
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,250
delete delete vertices.
40

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,250
There we go.
41

42
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,270
We end up with something resembling a crown almost there.
42

43
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,670
Those two areas on linked.
43

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,550
We can do that now with a bridging of edge loops and of course this might all be undone later anyway
44

45
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,150
but I'm gonna go G, Z and just lift that up.
45

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,950
So we've got the rough shape at the top.
46

47
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,120
Perfect.
47

48
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm also going to select everything from the top going down so I will select the top vertex there hold
48

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,160
down control and press the number pad plus until we get a little bit further down and just go G ,Z
49

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,710
and lift that's up to roughly the right height.
50

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,330
Looks like we're going to have to do a different amount for different pleat pieces.
51

52
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,680
So about their analysts lift this up G, Z lift up to about there and scale it out.
52

53
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,060
Now one of the things you'll notice here is this image is wonky so I'm going to correct that as well.
53

54
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,350
Well as best I can.
54

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,980
Now if we rotate is rotating about his midpoint which is okay but it's mainly wonky from the bottom
55

56
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:38,850
so I'm going to set the pivot points to the 3D cursor before I start moving this from side to side then
56

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,510
I want something that's roughly equal either side which is going to be something like that give or take.
57

58
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,320
We could argue and pixel peep all night if we wanted to.
58

59
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,550
Okay.
59

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,900
So all of that is set.
60

61
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,720
We don't have this called a king yet.
61

62
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,410
So let's do that.
62

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,750
And modifiers are it's got the boolean.
63

64
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,820
So we use the bishop to create the queen and that modifier still sat there.
64

65
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:11,400
I don't get rid of that and whilst I'm dealing with it hopping to my queen and do exactly the same because
65

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,000
otherwise that might come back to haunt us later.
66

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,110
Back to the King before I start modelling the king itself.
67

68
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,260
I'm going to apply its new scale.
68

69
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,960
There we go it's never scaling or scaling transform of one which is a good place to be it's roughly
69

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,480
the right height as well about nine and a half centimeters.
70

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,740
It's probably going to be a little bit taller by the time we put the cross on the top.
71

72
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:42,750
So let's go to our object properties scroll down display as wire so we can see through and then providing
72

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:49,530
we go ahead and select edge loops we should be able to edit our model also going to change this back
73

74
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,850
back to individual origins.
74

75
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,440
No no we don't want individual origins that's going to cause a problem.
75

76
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,300
Let's go for the medium points.
76

77
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,800
Individual origins when we start scaling things we could quite easily end up in a bit of a pickle.
77

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
So I'm gonna start at the bottom now.
78

79
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,130
This is one of the one pieces that actually looks like he's got a lip running around the bottom so making
79

80
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,380
sure we're in edit mode.
80

81
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:21,810
Let's add in a loop cuts around the bottom and we go scale that out slightly before coming in.
81

82
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,400
Now I do want to be careful it's very easy at this point to add in too much detail at certain levels
82

83
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,170
and when I've been when I have been practicing this particular model it was very easy to run into the
83

84
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:41,100
case where it looks different from all of the other pieces because is it's the most important piece
84

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,040
it's the king's are you you tend to find you focus on it's a little bit more and when you do that you
85

86
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,510
end up with much much more detail in all the wrong places.
86

87
00:05:51,540 --> 00:06:01,070
Let's go G, Z and lift that up so I'm just hyper aware of that's being a possibility which I don't want
87

88
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:07,610
to be honest I want to keep it is low poly as all of the other pieces in fact this area here pretty
88

89
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,200
neat.
89

90
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm going to come out of it now.
90

91
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,160
So I've been playing lots.
91

92
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,580
Has it gone all wonky.
92

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,540
No it hasn't.
93

94
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,280
Brilliant.
94

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,530
And we select everything and lower the mean crease as well.
95

96
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,380
Okay.
96

97
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,300
Now the bottom.
97

98
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,610
I don't know if there is a face on the bottom it looks like there is.
98

99
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,530
It's highlighted.
99

100
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,840
Perfect.
100

101
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,230
So there would be a hole at some point I'm sure that we'll have to fix looking good.
101

102
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:41,140
Okay so it's almost worth adding another loop cut in at some points on here because it's a very tall
102

103
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,700
piece compared to the others.
103

104
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,970
It can have a little bit more geometry not too much more but it's a little bit more proportionally more
104

105
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,670
scale that's in.
105

106
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,890
And what that will enable us to do is come in and out again.
106

107
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,010
Okay G.G. good and live up and then scale that in.
107

108
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,770
And here is one of these examples where I could round off the edge a little bit more but I think it's
108

109
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,920
going to cause us a bit more pain than it's worth doing.
109

110
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,600
It's going to end up meaning that our model itself has too much geometry in all the wrong places.
110

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,450
So here I'm going to come out and then straight back in again so I'm going to imitate the fact that
111

112
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,620
there's something there but not with too much detail.
112

113
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,550
Again this is a low poly model.
113

114
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,870
It's very easy to get bogged down with the detail.
114

115
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:43,300
This top area here lets, I am going to select the top one and just go control and plus come down and
115

116
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,590
I'm going to go one level up and just delete the bits at the top there.
116

117
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,220
Okay.
117

118
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,420
G, Z lift that up to here.
118

119
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,190
G, Z about there? That looks pretty good.
119

120
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,820
Okay.
120

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,980
The next thing here I'm going to scale that all.
121

122
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,700
Oh no before I do that let's go E, Z.
122

123
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,750
Lift it up.
123

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,260
Scale that in.
124

125
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,100
Scale this one in as well add a loop cut to about here and scale that out.
125

126
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,970
Now this is an area that will have detail and it won't be disproportionate detail because it is still
126

127
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,220
going to use the octagonal form that we currently have but we're not adding extra curves in.
127

128
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,960
Now there are loads of ways that we can do this topic her, I'll press the W key instead of the E key, what
128

129
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,060
I'm going to do is I'm going to go up a little come out and check my model looks good.
129

130
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,470
Okay.
130

131
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,890
Let's go back round to the front.
131

132
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:52,840
Now focusing on this very blurry image we can extrude all the way up to the top and stop now what we can
132

133
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,980
do is add in a couple of loop cuts and I'm also going to add in one to begin with and bring it all the
133

134
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:07,690
way down so we get a very sharp transition and these two top places are going to be this one and this
134

135
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,180
one are gonna be all the way over here in a bit.
135

136
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,570
So we want an odd number so we've got a cut in the middle.
136

137
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:21,970
I think that many he's going to be others try it with three cuts I know I tried it with five.
137

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,460
In the example I think I am going to need five tries three not going to need five keep going backwards
138

139
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,420
and forwards indecision.
139

140
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:38,090
Now I can grab this one and this one and just scale it on the Z axis I bring them closer together.
140

141
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,300
Perfect.
141

142
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:48,000
Now I can grab the top edge loop and not quite the bottom edge loop and scale them outwards on oh X
142

143
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,470
and only X then we can have a look at what that looks like.
143

144
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,540
Almost there.
144

145
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,030
But it comes out just in one plane which is pretty useful.
145

146
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:12,770
Okay now we need to select these four faces here and to the other side and here and here.
146

147
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,870
That's a lot smoother than I thought it was going to be.
147

148
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,680
And I need to extrude by nothing and then scale them out on the X axis.
148

149
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,110
I was going to do that a different way but because I'd already selected them I couldn't do anything
149

150
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,080
else and I'm now going to have to select them individually.
150

151
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,870
Any way to scale them by X, 0 and that should flatten them.
151

152
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,710
Yes it has.
152

153
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,210
Okay.
153

154
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,330
And the same here.
154

155
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,430
Got a bit of a clipping issue going on I might play with my camera settings if that caused me any issues
155

156
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,840
again.
156

157
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,320
Scale X, 0.
157

158
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,110
Excellent.
158

159
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,310
So that's flatted those two edges.
159

160
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:56,450
And now of course what I can do is scale them up so I need them all selected to do this back round to
160

161
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,880
the front.
161

162
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:06,590
And just scale on the Z axis we get and exaggerate ever so slightly so it fits in with everything else.
162

163
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,380
Scale them out as well so flares ever so slightly and that should look pretty good.
163

164
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,250
Yes excellent right.
164

165
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,330
Right the next thing to do is this bit's on the top.
165

166
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,710
Now it is a ball.
166

167
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:25,220
So one of the easiest things that I can do here is add in a UV sphere and work from that.
167

168
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,110
Or I could start doing some scaling and other bits and bobs.
168

169
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm going to add in a ball at the 3D cursor roughly where it needs to be and then sets the or the X
169

170
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,590
value here.
170

171
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,350
I'm just having a look to 0.
171

172
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,280
And the Y to 0 because it needs to be smack bang in the middle UV sphere.
172

173
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,880
That is point 1 radius r.
173

174
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,410
That's almost spot on.
174

175
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,300
I did not know how big that would be.
175

176
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,370
That was a pure guess eight segments.
176

177
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,800
Six.
177

178
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,730
Four.
178

179
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,950
Yeah I think it's gonna have to be four at this point and I'm going to go
179

180
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,700
G, Z and lift it up go into edit mode.
180

181
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,600
Yes sorry I'm in edit mode.
181

182
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,270
It wasn't a new object.
182

183
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,120
Go back to the selection tool select this bottom one and delete it.
183

184
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:19,330
Select this edge loop and this one and bridge them Ooh! I had some extra selected that I didn't want that one
184

185
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,670
and this one and bridge them.
185

186
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,210
Excellent.
186

187
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,770
So now let's just have a quick look Oh what's going on there.
187

188
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,360
Something where it's brigdged it's cross bridge them at some point which isn't great.
188

189
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,410
It's very hard to sort out.
189

190
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,520
So let's hide the image for the moment so we can see what's going on.
190

191
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:45,800
I think what I can do here instead is perhaps fill and merge that way.
191

192
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,860
I do need a bit more camera room so the clip starts I'm going to put down two point one and I should
192

193
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,030
be able to get really close.
193

194
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,600
Perfect.
194

195
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,830
So here we go.
195

196
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,570
This top bit here.
196

197
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:05,270
I'm gonna fill this in and then I'm going to inset on the scale only on  X and bring it back in line.
197

198
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,150
Now these two should bridge properly.
198

199
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,630
Excellent.
199

200
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,170
So the final thing to do here is ooh that's still going to have an interior face.
200

201
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,850
I want to get rid of that if I can possibly select through this model that's hide that and select the
201

202
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,100
face on it.
202

203
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,300
No it doesn't.
203

204
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,980
Perfect Alt and H to come back out so that looks alright.
204

205
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,800
It just needs to be a much much more squat now.
205

206
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,290
So once again select everything here perfect go G, Z and bring it down.
206

207
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,820
Then this very bottom edge loop here.
207

208
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,280
I'm gonna.
208

209
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,180
No not that one.
209

210
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,060
Not that one.
210

211
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,850
This one.
211

212
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,440
Now we go.
212

213
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm just going to scale that in so inside and go G, Z and left.
213

214
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,240
That's up Excellent.
214

215
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,610
Now this cross on the top.
215

216
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,050
I'm going to go G, Z and bring the top down ever so slightly as well.
216

217
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,990
Give it a bit of a smoother appearance.
217

218
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,010
I quite like how that's come along now I can play with the rest of this and make it a bit more like
218

219
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:17,770
the other one so for instance I can grab the these vertices here and here and go G, Z and just lift them
219

220
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,170
up ever so slightly giving it a similar appearance to the top.
220

221
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:29,140
And again here and here just to give it a bit of a visual consistency G, Z pull it down again it's
221

222
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,740
only a little and the bottom bit is fine how it is.
222

223
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,510
Again if you wanted to keep that sort of flaring consistency this one isn't so bad because they are
223

224
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,990
both in line so it's easy to do with one little tug and there we go.
224

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,580
So there's the cross on top.
225

226
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:54,510
Now there is a lot of detail but in the grand scheme of things it's not that's come out save my work.
226

227
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,860
How do I think that looks.
227

228
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,910
I think that looks awesome I can't wait to see all of these pieces together.
228

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,100
And I'm also looking forward to seeing your King as well.
229

230
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,440
Perhaps you approached it in a slightly different way maybe a completely different way.
230

231
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,290
Make sure you share your king's over in the discussion and how you created them as well.
231

232
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,860
Have you gone for a slightly different look.
232

233
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,750
Did you use a completely different modelling technique to share your work over in the discussions and
233

234
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
