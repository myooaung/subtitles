1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,700
Well, again, in this video, we're working on whiskers and eyebrows for our animal.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
Let's start straightaway with your challenge to add some whiskers.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,000
This is a good one to take on on your own before I go through it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,790
So you can see if you've remembered all the steps in the process and add some hair, some eyebrow hair,

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,930
if you like, as well.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,650
Some cats do have some pretty pronounced eyebrows when you have a close look at them.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,550
Some hints if you'd like, some hints if you don't, then pose a video and dive in.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,460
Now, if you want some hints, then be sure to create a particle system first, then set, create your

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,220
particle system first, then set the emission to zero.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,400
And hand place each hair as opposed to having the hair randomly spawned by the particle system.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,070
There's no need for children in this particular instance.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,800
We're going to be, like I say, hand placing each individual hair.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:54,050
And you might want to tweak the hair strand thickness to get the right kind of thickness for the hair.

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,440
Maybe it's a bit thicker, maybe a bit thinner than usual.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,750
That's up to you to have a play around with and figure out.

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,580
So pause video and take on that challenge.

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,340
And after you've done that, I'll go through my approach.

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,460
First, they've got to do is just turn off my other particle systems from the viewport here so I can

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,140
see more easily what's going on.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,840
And second thing I need to do is create a new particle system from within our particle system tab.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,290
Click on.

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,940
Plus, I'm going to rename this to be Whiskers and I'll also rename it within the actual execution of

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,070
the particle system to be whiskers as well.

24
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,900
Dishonouring get confused.

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,360
Click on hair change.

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,660
The hair length down two point three I think might be a good size.

27
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,020
Now, as I said, the challenge going to change the number to zero.

28
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,670
There they were young, we have none.

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,060
Excellent.

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,510
Good job.

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,090
Next up, we will hop over in to particle edit click on plus to add more particles.

32
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,100
I'll turn off interpolate for the moment.

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,420
I'll turn that back on soon.

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,970
I'm working with the middle the point selection mode, the middle of these buttons here so that I can

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,750
see all the points.

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,620
I think that works better.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,420
Now where do we start off our heads.

38
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,410
I'm going to be starting off.

39
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:08,930
My hair's kind of not right on the outside of this face area, but a little bit more on the inside so

40
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,980
that then we can see the hair going across.

41
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,300
Let me show you what I mean by that.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,290
Add one down there.

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,250
Pretty good.

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,120
Now I will comb comb to the side and the hair generally at the top is more heading straight out.

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,910
And then as we go down, it curls more and more downwards.

46
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,800
So we'll add a few of these initial hairs.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,750
Click on plus add another one.

48
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,120
Just drop the size of my brush a little bit.

49
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,610
Plus loves having turn on interpolate.

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,870
Let's click on Interpolate.

51
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,110
So that is heading generally in the right direction.

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,480
Yep.

53
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,430
Yep, yep.

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,550
Okay, I'll start off with four.

55
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,390
I'm going to do each side independently rather than trying to mirror this.

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
I think that's gonna work best.

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,220
I will need to comb this one over there.

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,460
Karl, just quickly add a few more of these.

59
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,950
And I think I need to make them a little bit longer.

60
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,450
Going to my lengthen brush.

61
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,590
OK.

62
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,640
Lincoln Lengthen, lengthen.

63
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,180
Now, little bit of grooming just starting off with these four.

64
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,130
And then I'll probably end up with about, I think eight or nine on either side would be nice.

65
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,570
Caven, grab this one.

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,740
It's gonna be going.

67
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,220
Atwood's straight out.

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,630
Straight out.

69
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,020
Straight out.

70
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,340
And then droop down.

71
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,730
Drew down.

72
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,210
Tore down.

73
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,540
The middle ones tend to be a little bit longer than the bottom ones and the top ones I find okay now

74
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,380
and repeat the same process on the other side.

75
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,780
Like I said, you could mirror this, but I think I like to have a little bit of differences as well,

76
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,370
a little bit of uniqueness on each side.

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,850
I don't want them to look exactly like they've been cloned, which is check the forwardness of them.

78
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,190
I'm not exactly sure.

79
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,720
Or a little bit leaning backwards.

80
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,440
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,860
So that requires a little bit of readjustment of these.

82
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,100
So once again, imagine that your cat is running through a wind tunnel and we want to have all the hair

83
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,230
systems behave appropriately.

84
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,060
They're not gonna be pointing forwards because that would not be very aerodynamic, would it?

85
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,920
Now, dropping another couple interpolate on.

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,610
Yes.

87
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,180
Good.

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,460
One more at the back there.

89
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,040
One more front the side.

90
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,410
Little bit of messiness in there is a good thing.

91
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,450
That last one is going to overlap.

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,170
They tend not to overlap hair.

93
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,340
The whiskers on cat, they tend to have their own lane that they swim in, if that makes sense too.

94
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,850
So we don't, we don't cross the streams.

95
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:24,230
This is very Ghostbusters where the hair just sits in its own lane and one or two that just sort of

96
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,450
tend to dig right down.

97
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,820
OK, now let's get our color figured out for this, so I will go to a different view.

98
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,650
Back over to object mode.

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,610
Okay.

100
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,350
Looking pretty thick as well.

101
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,230
But let's get the material sorted first.

102
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,250
I click on material.

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,120
Click on plus add a new material, new to create it being new.

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,850
Rename this to the let's see whiskers going to change it from principled b.

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,870
B SDF to principled hair.

106
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
B SDF.

107
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,050
Give ourselves a little bit more room on our shader editor.

108
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,470
And I'll change the color to be a pretty light, very white ish kind of color.

109
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,830
Little bit of gray in there, so it's not too popping and back to our particle system.

110
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,930
We need to under render change the material to be whiskers.

111
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,860
Excellent.

112
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,420
Also going to within here in render increase the steps up to seven.

113
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,250
Seven.

114
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,960
And in the viewport display as well, the Strand steps.

115
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,430
I'm going to increase to seven.

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,420
Okay.

117
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,330
I think some of these down the end aren't curving downwards in us.

118
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,740
I need a little bit of work on that.

119
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,050
And you can see it's looking very kind of translucent See-Through through.

120
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,840
So if you play around the roughness and the coat to get to the point where you're happy with that,

121
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,600
you could go just regular BSD.

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,450
If we go the hair BSD.

123
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,230
If you don't go, have to go principled here.

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,160
The SDF.

125
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,170
But we do get a lot of controls this way.

126
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,430
You can see this is a great place to see actually just with a few strains and not much else going on.

127
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,910
If we increase the roughness all the way up then.

128
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,510
It's a little bit less See-Through.

129
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,880
If we reduce the roughness all the way down, then we do get that translucency, which is kind of interesting

130
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,340
look, but not exactly what a cat's gonna have for whiskers.

131
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,020
And then again, radial roughness.

132
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,850
You can see that gives it a much flatter look versus if we have that all the way down to zero.

133
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,400
Then once again, it has a very See-Through look.

134
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,990
So play around with those values until it gets the point where you happy with the relationship between

135
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,290
the See-Through hardness or the transparency, if you will.

136
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,020
And the opaqueness, some reasonably happy with that, what I do need to do is change the thickness,

137
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,020
I think, because the cat whiskers are very long and thin.

138
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,700
So let's scroll down, scroll, scroll down and find hair shape.

139
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:46,350
I think I'll change mine to values of point six and point two sets a little bit fatter at the tip,

140
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,990
but a little bit thinner at the root.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,030
And just do a test render on that.

142
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,460
OK.

143
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,860
They're looking very white.

144
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,190
Kind of looks like a spider is jumped on the face, looking little bit fake at the moment.

145
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,870
So we'll see if we can do a little bit to that.

146
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,130
It could have to do.

147
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,960
I've got a bit too much roughness going on here.

148
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,500
I might decrease the brightness of the color a little bit.

149
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,660
Well, just have them blend in a little bit more.

150
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,410
And I'm going to do a little bit of tweaking to the positions.

151
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,690
OK, I'm reasonably happy with this.

152
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,370
You can see there's a lot of Faid over in the outer area of my whiskers, but that's okay.

153
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,820
I don't mind that whiskers tend to do that if we look at this cat over here.

154
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,610
There's a real kind of dark whiteness when it's boarded or when when it's backed up by the face.

155
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,180
But then when it's got the green grass behind it, hopefully you can see that on your screen.

156
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,320
It kind of fades out.

157
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,670
It comes out more translucent.

158
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,470
So I'm happy with that general direction.

159
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,840
Next, I'm gonna put some eyebrows on my cat.

160
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,050
Let's get a little bit of inspiration from our reference images up in the top part, right above the

161
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,590
eyes.

162
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,700
Just got a few strands poking out.

163
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,340
What about this guy?

164
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,430
Bit hard to see in that image.

165
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,480
What about this guy over here?

166
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:56,280
Our guy kind of scraggly, pointing forward and with the high brow hairs, are they eyebrows when they're

167
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,650
that long?

168
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,210
I whiskers, whatever they're called, similar size.

169
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,030
So they're similar size and shape to the whiskers.

170
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,140
So that's why I think I'll do exactly the same particle system, if not create a new particle system.

171
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,900
So I going gonna place a couple of eyebrow hairs.

172
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,690
So this is the end result of what I've come up with.

173
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,910
I could probably make the eyebrow whiskers a little bit more prominent and you can see there's a little

174
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,550
bit of kind of white and then not white throughout.

175
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,350
If we zoom in really close here.

176
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,420
But that's the general texture.

177
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,480
If we have a look at our reference images, the eyebrows and the whiskers tend to jump in and out of

178
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,070
being visible and not visible.

179
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,490
In particular, when you can see the whiskers with some body behind it, they're a lot whiter and they're

180
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,980
a lot more see through a translucent when it's just background behind it.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,190
So I think we've hit that reasonably accurately and looking pretty good, pretty happy with that overall

182
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,300
look of the whiskers, so.

183
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:00,870
Great stuff.

184
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,980
I'll see you in the next lecture.
