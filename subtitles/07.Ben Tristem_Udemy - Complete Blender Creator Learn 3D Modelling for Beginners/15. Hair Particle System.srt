1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,710
In this video we're gonna stop playing around with the hair particle system and I'm going to be coming

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,550
up with something that I think could look like a bit of animal fur and I'm gonna be challenging you

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,350
to come up with your own interesting kind of hair experimentation.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,590
So let's get started.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:16,850
Okay.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,030
We might be coming back to our sculpture in the future but for now we're gonna save say thanks very

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,330
much.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,870
Jump up into new general start a new scene here our new project I'm going to remove the default cube

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,660
and I can hit shift a at a mesh.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,610
This will be an icon sphere down in the bottom left you can see an icon sphere open up that little a

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,120
menu I'm going to increase the sub divisions to I think 6 we'll see how 6 looks can looks pretty good.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,360
Sona enough detail that this is all going to work.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,400
And just to emphasize here that we're just having a bit of fun don't worry about creating something

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,160
that looks exactly like a thing.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,420
Just go crazy be creative.

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,600
Now we're gonna be playing around in the particles property tab so click on particle property over on

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,370
our right here and I'm going to click plus to add a new particle system hasn't really done much just

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:02,540
yet.

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,290
You can see one little blob this there it'll really turn to magic when we click here you can see we've

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,980
got a here button click on that and one.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,680
There we go.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,970
Job done lovely.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,320
Now first thing I do is just reduce the hair length so that it's not quite so crazy on the screen.

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,010
There we go.

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,050
Now what this has done is it's adding a certain number of hair so it's adding 1000 over my object.

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,370
If I reduce the number Berber proper you can see that it reduces the number of his that we've got that

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,720
may increase it back up to say 500 just to see how it goes.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:33,950
Okay.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,060
So to get some fullness on this hair what we want to do is scroll down within our particle properties

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,560
tab and find children open that up and click on interpolate and there we go.

31
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,930
We get a whole bunch of extra hair that we can see.

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,400
Cool.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
It's looking a little bit ferret them out if you scroll out it looks more fairy is growing it's a little

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,760
bit less free now is something in here.

35
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,790
If we look at the render amount and the display amount you can see the display amount is 10.

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,220
Let me just give us more real estate here.

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,910
We're gonna render it.

38
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,820
We'll see a hundred.

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,510
I'm just gonna increase my display amount to 50 so it makes it a lot fuller it's a lot more similar

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,890
to what the render amount isn't you know I'll put the render amount at 50 so I should be getting if

41
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,330
I render I should be getting what I'm seeing at the moment rather than seeing something this very sparse

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,230
like that and then you render it like whoa it's a lot more busy than I thought it would be.

43
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,010
So I'm gonna leave mine at 50/50 can put it whatever you want I'm just playing around with numbers at

44
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,280
the moment we can also now change the length from them from one which was the maximum that we determined

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,620
previously in terms of our hair length up here point for one all the way down to zero.

46
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,810
So we can change the length of our children and we can start to add some randomness and some variations

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,120
and cool things.

48
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,260
One cool thing I do to scroll down scroll down you can find we're still under children.

49
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,100
I'm going to change the clumping so open up clumping and I'll increase the clumping As I increase it.

50
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,950
Guess what happens.

51
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,750
The hair clumps to the extent where we get our spiky little clumpy Spike ball thing there which is pretty

52
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,360
cool and is reduced I live it.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Have a little bit of clumping and if I want to have some clump noise You see there's a little bit of

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
randomness going on in there.

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,790
I can also open up kink which is how it's going to bend and change kink type from nothing to will say

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,660
curl.

57
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,260
And there we go.

58
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,360
That's an interesting kind of curly ball effect that we get.

59
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:23,410
Or I could change it to radio what's going to look good here radio or maybe a wave or braid wave.

60
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,630
You know live on wave at the moment.

61
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:32,110
Again we can change all of these values amount of clumped the shape the fatness of it nice and fat and

62
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,690
amplitude would too.

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,490
Okay cool.

64
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,670
Lots of great things we can play around with here.

65
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,570
What I'm looking for at the moment is what sort of effect would be good for animal fur.

66
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,720
Because we we want to have a couple of settings we say yeah that looks like an animal it's not quite

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,400
there at the moment.

68
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,880
That's something I've kind of got my eye on as I'm playing around with this.

69
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,520
And then the other main thing I want to show you as part of this exercise is how to make it look different

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,190
from a color point of view and from a rendering point of view.

71
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:02,700
So I'm just going to jump up into my material previews so we can see the colors that have been present

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,800
at the moment we have no color or just the default color.

73
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,780
Now there's two colors going on here one from the emitter which is our now ball that we put our icons

74
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,020
fear we put in there and one is the hair itself.

75
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,080
Let's go and change the color of the ball first of all the way I'm going to do that is by clicking on

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,760
material properties click plus and then click new material.

77
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,750
I'll call this skin just so it's clear it's the underside will change the base color to what am I making.

78
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm making an animal kind of thing so I'll change it.

79
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,770
So it's darker sort of brownish and you can see because the particles.

80
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,460
In other words the hair don't currently doesn't have its own color.

81
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,460
It's just taking the color of the skin that's underneath.

82
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,110
I'm just gonna make it a bit clearer by reducing the amount of hair that we've got in here.

83
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:57,580
Actually I'm gonna go to nothing in the kink type reaction that you can see the color of the actual

84
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,990
skin itself.

85
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,740
Now let's change the color of our hair that sits on top of the skin the way we can do that is by the

86
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,090
game within our particles.

87
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,500
Particle properties let's find render.

88
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,140
So you can see we've got a tab here called render it's just above viewport display render excellent

89
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,630
and leave it as path yes instead of the material being skin we want to create a new material currently

90
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,670
on and have one in there so I'm going to jump back down to my material properties scroll back up the

91
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,750
top click on plus this will allow me to click on new I will change this to hair and the hair itself

92
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,690
let's make a what color show and make this just to make it very clear what's going on I'll make it a

93
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,600
pink just to be super clear.

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Now back to our particle system particle properties fine we've got render and then render is path material

95
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,380
we are going to change to here.

96
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,460
Okay now we've got a very beautiful pink hair on top of a brown base and as I said before I'm looking

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,710
to make this look a bit like an animal so instead of pink I'm going to jump back to my material properties

98
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,980
make sure that I'm selected on hair seems like you're on hair base colour I'm going to change to more

99
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,780
of a brown kind of color to get animal look and stuff.

100
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,150
OK.

101
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,750
There we have it now it looks okay but not great.

102
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,220
And one of the things we can do to have it make a little bit more impressive is to add or to turn on

103
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,710
ambient occlusion the way we do that is find your render properties within range of properties were

104
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:30,070
looking for ambient occlusion so open that up click on that to apply it and immediately it looks a little

105
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,170
bit different because we've got the hairs are providing some of that occlusion and it's making the light

106
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,210
more interesting what I'll do is just play around with this distance I think I need to put that up to

107
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,610
about one that it's looking good let's play around with a factor that just makes it darker or lighter

108
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,320
I like the darker effect.

109
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,900
OK so there you go that's feeling a lot more hairy I think the clumping makes it look a little bit not

110
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,980
exactly what I'm going for so I'm going to go back down to my particle properties scroll down scroll

111
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:04,720
down find let's see clumping gonna turn off clumping I think just turn it down well but clump noise

112
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,000
turn that off and there must be something going on here.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,550
Shape sorry for clumping in minus one not zero is what I want.

114
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,030
Okay now I don't have any clumping you can still see through the hair as I move back then it's starting

115
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,400
to look a little bit more like an animal mind I just wanted to do one more thing because it's too it's

116
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,270
too uniform there's not many rabbits out there that have exactly that sort of hairdo is there so I'm

117
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:32,320
gonna find roughness this again is under the children tab fine roughness and I'm going to have a look

118
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,860
around here get some randomness what happens if I increase the random value.

119
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,490
OK.

120
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,430
We do get it looking a little bit more squiggly.

121
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,740
Wow.

122
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,250
There we go.

123
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,880
So that definitely is looking a bit more like animal fur size is going to change the size the randomness

124
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,140
threshold so you can see is a lot of science to seeing what looks good is pretty much just twiddle the

125
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,150
roughness and see get it to the point where you're happy with it oh there we go.

126
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,940
I think uniforms giving me the sort of look I'm looking for.

127
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,140
Wonderful.

128
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,590
There we go.

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,950
There's a furball and you know as one last thing I'm going to find the display amount and just crank

130
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,390
that up to say one hundred so it's looking a little bit more lush and I'll put up the render amount

131
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,770
in case we need to render it just so we couldn't see those gaps that were going straight through into

132
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,880
the the skin of the object unless we're really close to it.

133
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,780
And it's good time for me to give you a challenge create something very add some hair to a simple objects

134
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,980
as I did was just to an echo sphere or you could do it to a cube or whatever you like.

135
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,080
Play around with that and be kind of cool color the hair and change its shape using clumping or kink

136
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,030
and to share your creation.

137
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,800
Just a quick note we're going to be doing some more hair in the next video or two so just do something

138
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,330
that's throw away something it's a bit of fun something Zeke's experimenting that will continue to work

139
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,460
on a different thing in the next video.

140
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,790
So jump in take on that challenge when you done please do share it and then I will see you in the next

141
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,180
lecture.
