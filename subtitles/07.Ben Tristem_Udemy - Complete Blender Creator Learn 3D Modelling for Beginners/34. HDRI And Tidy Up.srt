1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,710
In this lecture, we are going to be adding an HDR background and doing final polishing.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,270
Lights, camera and action to get our image looking the way we want to have it look.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,330
So let's get cracking on finishing our scene.

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,380
Okay.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,770
Let's make our background look good and make the light in our scene.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,910
Reflect the background, adding ourselves in HDR eye.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,650
If you wanna jump over to HDR, I haven dot com.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,970
That's a great place to find HDR eyes, which are images that can wrap around our entire scene.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,370
I'm looking for something that has trees and grass in the background and would suit what I've come up

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:36,640
with.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,470
So probably something like this with the autumn forest or something else with trees in the background.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,090
So I'm gonna play around the couple and find one that I think will work for my scene.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,450
I've decided to go for one called Noon Grass.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,600
So what we'll do here is, first of all, open up our shader editor and jump over into world within

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:55,960
here.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,820
If we scroll our libit, find what's going on, you can see that we have not much going on in our world.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,950
So I need to shift a and then add in a texture.

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,360
It'll be an environment.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,020
Texture had this in.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,870
Drop it next to our background.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
Connect color to color.

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,030
Open up where we have our HDR.

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,220
Mine is called noon grass.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,540
Click on our render tab.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,710
Now we should see a little bit of noon grass going on to do.

26
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,030
I think I want that shady area.

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,360
So at the moment, a little bit of an issue that if my camera is facing here, I can see all that sort

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,640
of stuff in background might not be exactly what I want.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,220
So we need to be at a rotate once again.

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,220
Make sure that you've got the node wrangler on.

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm gonna work on noon grass control tee that will add in our mapping, texture, coordinate and mapping

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,110
as we've done before.

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:52,030
Now, if I rotate around these, say these z., that should rotate my entire background, which has

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,900
gone super slow.

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,180
What can I turn off to make this quick?

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,980
And maybe the cat and maybe the.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,290
Ground plane.

38
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,820
See if this makes it go quicker, little bit quicker.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,880
Get to the point where I think it's the right sort of.

40
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,450
I think it's the trees, the dark, iconic trees behind.

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,190
Turn those things back on again.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,620
Do a little test render and see how this looks.

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,180
Okay.

44
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,300
That's more where I want to.

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,380
You can see a little bit of a snack between the background and the foreground.

46
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,380
Might be hard to solve that with little bit of depth of field on our camera.

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,990
Let's find our camera camera settings and then depth the field.

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,010
Turn that on focus object.

49
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,050
We want probably on the face of the cat or it's going to be on the entire cat.

50
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,060
It's also a click on that as our object aperture.

51
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,330
Now, the best aperture thing is that we drop this all the way down to very low settings, a point five

52
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,350
and see how that looks.

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,830
Give that another render.

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,640
It might be a little bit extreme, but at least it's showed some softness at the front, which also

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,360
helps explain the softness at the back.

56
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,700
So it's okay for the moment.

57
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,960
We can finesse that a little bit more.

58
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,490
You can look for a better edge between the grassy you've put in in the background.

59
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,170
You could look to have probably if I put some more objects over on the side there, maybe on the side

60
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,600
here as well, and had them a little bit blurry outside the depth of field that would have a better

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,020
look to it.

62
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,940
But this is heading in the right direction.

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,630
And what I'm going to do now is play around with my lights, my camera and do a little with tootling.

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,010
So you might want to do the same thing to around with your scene and I'll come back and let you know

65
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,840
what I've been up to when I had finished.

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,500
Okay.

67
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,850
I have to do with my lights.

68
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,210
I've made them a little bit less bright just so you can quickly see what they are set at the Phillies

69
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,910
point five.

70
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,250
The key is one point five in the room is point five.

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,020
Just wanted to drop them down a little bit.

72
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,820
You can do what you like with yours.

73
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,470
Move the camera a tiny bit.

74
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,270
One of the big things I did was I wasn't enjoying the fact that my cat didn't have a nose because we

75
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,940
haven't painted on the nose.

76
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,170
We haven't put a lot of detail when put painting detail on the.

77
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,050
The object.

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,980
I was trying to solve everything with particle systems in this particular section of the course.

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,420
And I thought, well, why not try to solve the nose with particle systems as well?

80
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,620
So I've gone and put a very simple little let me see if I can find my cat.

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,090
Very simple little particle system on the nose here as an extra.

82
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,450
Let's see, so a nose particle system, I created a nose material that I've just been tweaking and you

83
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,780
can see that I've gone and groomed a little bit of nose on my cat.

84
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,010
Just holds a bit silly, but it was really bugging me that there was no nose there.

85
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,350
There's a lot more we could do in the face to improve it.

86
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,330
But when we're just dealing with sculpting and with particle systems, I think this is kind of a fun

87
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,360
challenge to give ourselves to work within those constraints.

88
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,760
Oh, and I also changed the camera for the depth of field.

89
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,990
I put it up to to to get a little bit more of the detail at the front and at the back.

90
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,230
Suddenly I realized I hadn't been showing you a lot of because we've been doing on a lot throughout

91
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,820
the process, but I've been putting down new particles, reducing them in height or increasing them

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,300
in height.

93
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,830
So I'm getting the exact look that I want, having some long ones at the back, having some of the front

94
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,420
that are just the right height.

95
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,980
So they're a little bit in the way of the cap.

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,390
Not too in the way.

97
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,240
So make sure your raising and lowering your particles to get the look that you want to turn my samples

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,940
back up to 128, do a final render check to make sure that I haven't missed anything or forgotten anything.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,760
And then declare that I'm done so well, it's rendering.

100
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,140
I'll give you the final request in this whole process.

101
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,320
Please share your work.

102
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,080
Tidy up your scene at any last details.

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,140
Play around with the lights, the camera, create a final render.

104
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,280
Then please do share that with us so we can see what you've come up with, whether you think it's great

105
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,440
and amazing or whether you think it's ah needs a lot of work or whether like mine, you can see there's

106
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,520
some good bits and some bits that could be better.

107
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,680
Please do share and let us all enjoy the process.

108
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,970
So there's your challenge.

109
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,750
Let me see what I've come up with for mine.

110
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,020
It's rendering away nicely.

111
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,650
This is gonna be my final result.

112
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,330
Go ahead and create your final result.

113
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,870
And I look forward to seeing what you are sharing.

114
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,670
And I'll see you in an upcoming lecture.
