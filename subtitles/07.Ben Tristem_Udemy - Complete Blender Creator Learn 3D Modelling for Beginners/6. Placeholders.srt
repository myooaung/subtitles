00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,210
Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,030
In this lecture we are going to do a couple of things.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,110
The first thing is create a place holder for our image so we can scale our image appropriately.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:22,030
Once we've done that you can also see over on the side here we've made a note that we can refer to all

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,830
the time rather than having to hop in and out of blender to another place.

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,020
So let's go find out more.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,810
OK so this is where we left off before and what we need to do is make sure that we've got something

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,490
that says actually squash this reference image into.

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,260
So actually is the right size so we can start using it as proper reference material.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,080
Now arguably at this point in time you could just leave it as it is and then scale everything at the

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,810
very end.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,020
But I like doing things this way round.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,760
So that's the way we're doing it today.

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:03,480
So the first thing I'm going to do is use my cube and rename my cube to place holder and the whole point

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,570
of this is it's going to represent our pin in its simplest possible form if there's going to be a bounding

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,370
box to make sure that our pin ends up the right size.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,540
Now first of all this cube is two meters by two meters by two meters.

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,120
And that's the wrong size.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,420
We need the right size.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,300
And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to bring in my notes that I've got from elsewhere.

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,370
So I'm going to change my editor type in the outline.

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,720
It doesn't matter where you do this you could do it elsewhere you create a new window if you wanted

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,410
to.

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,490
In this case I'm just going to change it from the outline to a text editor.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,640
You can see the shortcut keys there shift F 11 if I wanted to and it will change it to a text editor.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,700
Now I'm going to scroll along here and click new.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,460
Now this is a good tip for you.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,770
If for some reason you are working in the text window or any other window and you can't see parts of

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,230
the header you can use your scroll wheels go backwards and forwards as well as of course making the

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,790
whole window larger and smaller.

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,090
I'm just going to scroll along hearing press knew it's going to create a new bit of text.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,670
I can name that text file like any other objects in blender.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,840
I can name its pin specs or something along those lines.

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,790
Now with my cursor in here I can start typing.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,440
If you move your cursor elsewhere it will stop typing in the text box.

36
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,970
Now I've already got in my pace buffer the actual specs of our pens.

37
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:37,050
Now what we can do is use this and go back and forwards to this whenever I need any reference material

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,720
either within blender.

39
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,170
Any text information.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,700
Now this is also useful if you need to make notes about your models you can store them within blender

41
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,610
themselves so you don't have to refer to external files all the time that can be very confusing.

42
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,030
One thing that you may have to do is if you have a look here there are a couple of different options

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,520
it's got formatting of numbers and text.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,360
That's good if you're doing some coding within blender as you can see here our text just keeps on going.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,190
So this middle one here will automatically wrap the text along which is pretty useful.

46
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,100
I'm just going to save my file as I am at the moment so I know that we're ready to work.

47
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,570
OK so we've got all of our information and we need to adjust this cube so it's the correct size.

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,290
And I'm going to do a couple of things here and this is hopefully going to show you can do things various

49
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,680
ways when it comes to these fields within blender so if this transform window is not here you need to

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,290
make sure you're over the 3-D Ed window and press the end key if you do that.

51
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:47,530
This properties window will come up and I've also got my cube selected not the empty but the cube itself.

52
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,730
You'll notice that these have different things with in them depending on what type of object is selected.

53
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,300
Most notably is dimensions when it comes to a mesh object.

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,500
So what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to go to these dimensions and actually type in what we need.

55
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,630
So it's going to be 380 millimeters to remember I'm working in metric.

56
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,670
If you're working in imperial units use the inches.

57
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:16,500
So I'm gonna go to my Z which is the vertical component of our model and type in 380 millimeters.

58
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,470
So even though that I'm working in meters I can still type millimeters in here and it will also formats

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:31,010
and we've got 121 whites some can go into here and go 1 2 1 millimeters and that's worked.

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,950
Now you may notice that the scale has changed so that's something that we will need to apply go control

61
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,360
at a and apply the scale.

62
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,150
Now the next thing that you may notice is that this is not sat on where z equals zero.

63
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,290
There are a couple of ways that we can go around sorting that out.

64
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:56,040
The easiest way at the moment is just thinking that the middle where the origin of our object is is

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,080
halfway up the total height and we've already got the total height over here.

66
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:09,080
So I'm going to copy that information highlighting it go control C go to its location and paste that

67
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:19,580
in but then go divided by two and if you do that you can do mathematical calculations inside these fields.

68
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,370
That is really useful.

69
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,670
So if you're not quite sure what one number take another actually is you don't have to go outside of

70
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:33,350
blender you can literally type the equation or the maths in any of these fields and it's not just simple

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,370
addition multiplication you can also use trigonometry etc. and we might get to that later on in the

72
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,230
course.

73
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:48,490
Okay so now we've got our a place holder object in the correct place and it's the correct scale.

74
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:57,920
It's just a matter of tweaking our outer objects in this case our pin to the appropriate size.

75
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,190
And yes that's going to be your challenge.

76
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,350
Okay see your challenge.

77
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,610
Pretty straightforward is the set your reference image to the right size at the moment is probably far

78
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,690
too large.

79
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,930
And remember you can use pivot points to help you with where things are scaling supposedly.

80
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,480
Now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

81
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,300
Let's go to our reference image to the correct size.

82
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,070
Okay so you'd like me might have a reference image is too small or in this case too large.

83
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm going to just scale this down to begin with to some sense of scale.

84
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,840
So it's roughly right.

85
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,300
Okay that's looking good.

86
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:42,400
Now the origin of this is going to be once everything's in the correct location at the same place as

87
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,710
the other one which was point one 9 I remember that.

88
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,320
So there we go.

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,860
So that's everything set there and then I'm just going to scale this down until hopefully it fits into

90
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,230
the right place.

91
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,110
Boom.

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,090
That's pretty much close together.

93
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,160
So that's one way of going about this.

94
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,370
Now I'm going to just undo everything I've done and just approach it in a different way.

95
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:10,090
So another way that you might approach this is setting your pivot points to the 3d cursor so we can

96
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,420
scale in towards it which is fine.

97
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:20,050
But as you start getting closer and closer what we then can do is go GZ lift this up so that it is sitting

98
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,150
roughly on the floor because we are dealing with roughly and to be quite honest if you've had to zoom

99
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:32,290
in this close to adjust something then you've probably gone over the top so class me as going in and

100
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,790
over the top.

101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,390
There we go.

102
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:41,530
So now that it's on the bottom that was scaling it so we can then just scale it back down and roughly

103
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,760
fits it into the right place.

104
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,270
Again you can come in and you can tweak it but to be quite honest that's pretty much spot on that's

105
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,670
exactly what I want.

106
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,220
Now you may notice here as you've done this and you're now aligning IT to a real world objects the center

107
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,000
of our objects is a bit off.

108
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:06,640
So perhaps we need to rotate its ever so slightly around as well because it's not center aligned you

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,170
can see that's at the top here is definitely leant over to one side often goes.

110
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,490
Okay.

111
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,690
So you can definitely align that much better than it was before.

112
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,650
And this is something you've got to bear in mind.

113
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,690
Sometimes your reference material will be slightly wonky.

114
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,770
Is that fine.

115
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,480
Yes of course it is.

116
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,640
Because it's just reference material we're not going to copy this exactly we're going to use it as a

117
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,740
basis for everything else that we're doing.

118
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,240
Okay.

119
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,910
So I'm going to save my work there Brian.

120
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,670
That's all aligned and ready to work with and we can start playing with curves and that will be over

121
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,630
in the next lecture.
