00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.180
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.010
In this lecture we're going to do profile modelling but using extrusion instead.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.450
Now what is a profile.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.580
Well if we look at something side on let's say this was a tunnel in fact this could be a good example

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.710
of a profile.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.760
And we can simply grab this end face here and extrude it out.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.920
And look we've managed to make a tunnel using the profile of the doorway.

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.940
So if we take that to an extreme we could do the same thing around our doorway.

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.720
In fact I think we're going to need a mirror modifier at this point.

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.020
Now I'm not going to do this in edit mode for the moment I'm going to do this in object mode.

11
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.540
I can not ruin my original mesh and since we're building something on top of our doorway we can combine

12
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.490
them later as one objects okay.

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.370
So we've got a default cube in our scene that we can work with.

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.070
I'm going to go into edit mode here and select a H and I'm going to Bevel the edge control and B and

15
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.670
there we go.

16
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.910
And to add some more detail.

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.860
Now this is your standard Bevel there but what I can do is go into the operator panel and change its

18
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.950
profile if I make it a lower profile.

19
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.450
It will come inwards like so.

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.430
Now whilst I've got this opportunity I'm going to align it with my door and scale it appropriately so

21
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.390
I can play about whether it's in a bet.

22
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.080
So I'd like to do here is turn on wireframe so I can see where our door happens to be and then we're

23
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.490
going to place it roughly on this edge here.

24
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.210
So that's the corner is in one place because then what else I can do is I can select the edge in edit

25
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.780
mode I can select the edge there and then I can scale based upon the active elements I can select all

26
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.360
the rest of my model with the key and then just scale that's in which is super super useful.

27
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.590
Okay.

28
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.020
This is going to look a bit odd as a profile but your challenge you can meet in this up.

29
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.230
Let's go ahead.

30
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.510
I'm going to shift that back in a little actually.

31
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.420
So it goes over half way so they merge together.

32
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.940
So that looks like a pretty good profile and then you can you can alter it's you know you can put a

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.260
loop cuts in here and perhaps make it not so harsh a transition.

34
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.510
Oh I've still got proportional editing turned on so I can make that not such a harsh transition into

35
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.820
the wall or in fact just play around with these bits here until I get to roughly the right place is

36
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.630
something along those lines.

37
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.850
Again this is INSIDE geometry for the moment you we can meet up later but there we go we've got a pretty

38
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.700
neat profile that we can then go ahead and extrude.

39
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.330
And I want to show you a really good tip with extruded you're all by now used to the fact that we can

40
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.760
select a face you do need a face and then just extrude it up.

41
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.120
Excellent job's fine.

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.420
However let me undo that to duplicate.

43
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.160
That's another good thing by the way of The View.

44
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.810
If you have it on vertex select you can very easily see if you've inadvertently here the face is nice

45
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.940
and Bob vertex as well really stands out though we've got two bits of geometry on top of one another.

46
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.760
Okay.

47
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.440
And digressing there.

48
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.030
So we've got our top here.

49
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.990
I'm just going to move that up announce the way lift up a what happens when we have to go round the

50
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.100
archway here.

51
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.210
How do we control that.

52
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.490
Well we could.

53
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.600
I wouldn't rotate it.

54
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.280
I want to show you a couple of tips here.

55
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.820
If you rotate it look it's gone all narrow and squished.

56
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.020
What we want to do is share it.

57
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.270
See.

58
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.510
OK.

59
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.670
So you can go ahead and press the F three key and type in sheer and you can see the shortcut there is

60
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.500
shift control.

61
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.870
Alton s so you gonna have to be quite dexterous to do all of those and the toolbar on the left hand

62
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.470
side here we can scroll down there's an option to share.

63
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.680
And the great thing about this is if we go ahead and share we've got some controls here why not if we

64
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.170
pull that down we get it at an angle pretty awesome hey look it hasn't gotten any narrower.

65
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.290
Let's see how this behaves because it doesn't always behave the same if you use the shortcut key so

66
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.770
control shift outs and s oh what's happening.

67
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.790
Well at the moment it's probably doing it around all axes will.

68
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.050
Oh here we go at the top.

69
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.270
Press X or Y for the shear axes.

70
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.260
So if I go X it's going to share it backwards and forwards.

71
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.020
However we want it on its side.

72
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.450
So there we go if we press Y we could then extrude but we don't want to go round and do that all the

73
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.690
time.

74
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:45.060
But what we can do and this is incredibly useful and I'm starting to doubt how big my door detailing

75
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.740
is here I am going to make this whole lot slightly smaller and then move it to there it's going to look

76
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.580
much better overall.

77
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.070
And again tweaking like this absolutely fine feel free to tweak to your heart's content.

78
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.750
Yeah that looks much better.

79
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.200
Okay.

80
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.180
So we still have the control nodes here for our share tool.

81
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.820
Let's go ahead and select the select tool instead what we can do instead of pressing E and extrude thing

82
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.080
and then trying to rotate it round is we can hold down control and right click and that will extrude

83
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.250
to a certain position.

84
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.280
Now this doesn't have to match the detail on the wall but as you can see here if we do it at intervals

85
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.410
that are good.

86
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:36.650
We also maintain the thickness as we go round it gets a bit wobbly and we can needs that up but that

87
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.660
is pretty good.

88
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.540
And we've got quite a bit of door detail there.

89
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.900
Now this is where I would go ahead and say we need ourselves a mirror.

90
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.900
So let's go ahead and do that.

91
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.760
Add a modifier a mirror modifier.

92
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.260
And there we go it's coming down.

93
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.000
I'm going to turn on clipping and that's it for the moment.

94
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.680
The reason why I want to turn on clipping is because if we have a look here we should be able to rotate

95
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.950
these things round so they actually clip into one another.

96
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.890
Now it looks like this loop cut here.

97
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.100
Let's go ahead and say this edge loop here.

98
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.540
That's already gone over the central point so that's a loss straight away.

99
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.750
So I'm going to need to turn clipping off first in order to move that back and out the way like so.

100
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.300
And then I can go ahead and grab this final edge loop where the faces then I can turn clipping back

101
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:38.180
on rotate it round or shear it round so let's go ahead and share looks vertical to me and then just

102
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.690
move it back until it snaps into the right place.

103
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.440
And there we go.

104
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.490
Perfect.

105
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.790
Now this is actually quite a bit of detail going on here and there is another issue.

106
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.230
We can see here that this is being mirrored around a funny place.

107
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.710
I don't think it's being mirrored around the middle of the door.

108
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.320
No it's not slightly out.

109
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.120
So everything that I've just done there is wrong because of our mirror point if I was so close to being

110
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.130
the right place.

111
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.580
I didn't notice a way around that I'm going to add an empty into the scene so come out I'm going to

112
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.450
add an empty empties of great things.

113
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.240
We've used them a lot when it came to the animated lamp being able to point things to the right place.

114
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.900
But if I sit in this empty here and call it the door mirror and holding down shift I'm going to set

115
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:36.180
the doorway as its parent so I can click and drag there rather than clicking and trying to select elsewhere.

116
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.310
Okay.

117
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.260
I do need to place it somewhere and I'm going to place it where X equals two.

118
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.920
There we go.

119
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.620
That is in the middle of the doorway.

120
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.030
Easy to get caught out with a mirror modifier.

121
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.650
But then I can set the mirror object to the door mirror.

122
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.200
That's what that's supposed to look like so there we go.

123
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.280
We can now come in and move and merge.

124
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.570
That looks pretty good.

125
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.330
I'm going to grab this little ledge loop here.

126
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.350
Press the G key twice.

127
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:13.390
Just do a tiny bit of sliding and then I can move that up as well and providing that you're on an awful

128
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:19.640
graphic projection none of this is going to slip and deviate from the plainer surface that you're placing

129
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.560
it's on.

130
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:26.370
Now finally here I would argue that we do need to go ahead and mirror on the y axis as well.

131
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:34.230
And this is where the problem happens because our mirror our door mirror here which is in two places.

132
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.300
Yep that's absolutely fine our door mirror here is to be under the building as well.

133
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.850
Good.

134
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.110
There we go we're referring to the proper door mirror.

135
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.680
And here we go.

136
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.890
The location is two meters.

137
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.610
That's fine but halfway through the door on the y axis is point two.

138
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.980
And there we go we're starting to build up a decent doorway here.

139
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.120
And at this point in time if you really wanted to we could go into edit mode select the face loop running

140
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.020
around.

141
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:06.250
Just press G because we don't want any extra geometry and because we have clipping turned on we can

142
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.160
press the wiki and there we go.

143
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.810
It's managed to merge those together.

144
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:12.690
Perfect.

145
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:19.850
Now in all honesty that's probably a little too much geometry but doors like this tend to be a focal

146
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.220
point they tend to be quite unique.

147
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:28.490
So even in a low polygon world you may still want a little bit of extra detail we can see here still

148
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.450
very low polygon and there we go.

149
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.490
That's my door done and dusted.

150
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.540
Of course you can go ahead and change the shading the viewport shading here.

151
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:43.360
I sometimes like going to a mach cap and playing with some of the material options in here.

152
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.420
When you do that it really does help you see the form and shape of your objects.

153
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.340
But there we go there are a couple of things here that I may want to improve like the fact that it goes

154
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.280
under the floor but that's not overly important at the moment.

155
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.310
Okay.

156
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.050
Now your challenge is to go off and create your own Arch Way or own doorway.

157
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.910
That does depend what type of building you're creating.

158
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.820
Now did you go for a different profile.

159
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.960
That's another way that you can make your model distinct.

160
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.800
And finally before you go off and do that challenge if you've done like I've done and you think well

161
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:22.730
hang on a minute you we can visually see here that there's quite a bit of extra geometry here.

162
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.940
And as we go round this bit here is full of geometry perhaps too much.

163
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.220
Well what we can do is hold down ALT and select that edge loop.

164
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.000
Press X and instead of deleting it just dissolve it look at that it's gone.

165
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.960
So let's go ahead and do that one.

166
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.540
Hold down shift select this one as well.

167
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.310
Do I want to say that.

168
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.100
Yep that's fine.

169
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.420
Go X and dissolve and look.

170
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.990
We've managed to lower the polygon count of our archway.

171
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.730
And at this point I can start to see some glaring problems.

172
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.200
So I'm going to make it a little bit more low polygon here as well.

173
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:06.360
So X dissolve edges and look about you can really see here that we do need to do a tiny bit tweaking

174
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.760
the approach G here and move it back slightly.

175
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.350
I'm going to press control shift Alton s and move around on the y axis.

176
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.790
Try and make it look just a little bit better as it goes round and what I know this is not going to

177
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:27.300
be perfect because it is never going to be at this low polygon but just grabbing things are moving them

178
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.380
around I think is enough there to make it flow just a little bit more smoothly.

179
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.580
This this first one here I'm not liking that it seems to go in and then out again.

180
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:43.230
So I'm just going to select the edge loop itself by holding down controlling clicking and rotate its

181
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.860
ever so slightly and then move it.

182
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:54.780
Now remember you can also press the G key twice the change where that actual edge loop exists as a very

183
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.800
useful tool as well.

184
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.240
So that looks a little bit better.

185
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.290
I'm liking that.

186
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:00.980
Perfect.

187
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.070
Okay.

188
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:08.790
I'm going to leave you to tweak your archways now please do share how you get on and I'll see you all

189
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.050
in the next lecture.
