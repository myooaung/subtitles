00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.580
Welcome to texture.

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.220
Painting in the viewport in this video.

3
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.150
You create a hand painted texture directly onto your model and will be creating a diffused map from

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.950
scratch.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.860
Of course we can create other maps as well but we'll leave that until later Ron.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.740
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.710
Okay so we're back over in blender on the default blend file.

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.650
I'm going to go ahead and we're going to play with this painting on something a bit more exciting than

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.030
the cube so someone go get rid of that cube and in a mesh that is Suzanne the monkey.

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.200
Now I'm going to add a bit more detail on Suzanne so I'm going to go to the modifiers tab open the properties

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.440
window add a subdivision surface modifier at level 2 and then click apply.

12
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.600
So we've got some extra geometry now to work with and turn on smooth shading So it is nice and smooth.

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.230
And I want to paint it.

14
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.590
Now usually what we would do is we'd create an unwrap of our model and then create an image to paint

15
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.980
on.

16
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.600
But there is an alternative way to do that and we'll go ahead and do that now.

17
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.820
So what we can do is we can go into paint mode on 3D Ed So here we go.

18
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.430
We've got textured panes at the very top.

19
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.800
But go ahead and click on that.

20
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.090
It won't do anything for the moment I'll just go there's bright white colour on the tool shelf itself

21
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.680
we can see that we can add simple uv's so got to go ahead and click that and then we can add a paint

22
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.380
slot.

23
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.540
Wow okay that's incredibly powerful.

24
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.080
So I'm going to go down here and pick diffuse colour and this will add a texture slot straightaway I'm

25
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.160
going to call this monkey bass because it's going to be the bass killer for our monkey.

26
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.600
Now that we've done that we can literally grab our brush and start painting straightaway on Suzanne

27
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.270
the monkey.

28
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.450
And that is as you can see incredibly powerful allows us to paint over our entire model regardless of

29
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.520
where the U.S. unwrap has decided to play scenes.

30
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.290
So that has it's a huge amount of benefits.

31
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.410
Now of course if we decide that we want to paint on the image itself we can do that.

32
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.190
I'm just going to open up a another window here of a frame and go into the u.b. image editor.

33
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.790
Now it doesn't seem like there's anything there at the moment we do need to select the image itself

34
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.480
and there we go we've got monkey base to see that's where we've drawn over.

35
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.130
Now of course if I wanted to paint the whole thing a base colour I would say we actually do over in

36
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.340
the UV image rather than on the monkey because as you can probably see already as we're painting it

37
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.210
it literally just is the bit that's facing us.

38
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.420
Anything that's not facing us stays unpainted whereas in the U.S. image ever we can pay everything very

39
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.740
quickly so I can change TV image editor to paint mode.

40
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.480
And I think I can just start painting Yes I'm just going to turn my brush strength up and unlit shirt

41
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.150
and go over the entire thing very quickly or indeed I can apply the entire colour to be image of I want

42
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.340
to.

43
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.040
But there we go back no time at all.

44
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.730
We've managed to paint the whole of Suzanne white lunch to minimize that's backed down so I just got

45
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.260
an idea of.

46
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.700
Incidentally have a look at the movie unwrap there that's a relatively clean unwrap in terms of I can

47
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.470
see all of the details.

48
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.100
What I can't see of course is how they all joined together I think that's probably the top of the head.

49
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.210
That's the bit around me.

50
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.530
Eyes may be I don't know.

51
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.240
There's there's lots of distortion happening here where I can't follow v.v. Map.

52
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.350
Now following the V map is only really important if you're going to be painting onto it rather than

53
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.660
painting on the model itself.

54
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.120
So there's pros and cons to working both ways.

55
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.130
Incidentally if we wanted to paint a pupil in here there's a couple of ways that we could do that so

56
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.470
we use a pupil as an example swap it around to a black colour come to here.

57
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.860
I've got to make sure my brushes right roughly the right size and click a couple of times.

58
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.370
And there we go we've generated a pupil.

59
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.040
Now another way we could do that with a bit more control is to turn on in the textured paint mode.

60
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.900
We can turn on face selection masking when we click that we can actually go in and right click and we

61
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.960
see that the display is changed ever so slightly we can right click a certain amount of faces.

62
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.230
We can also select the faces whilst we're in edit mode as well.

63
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.820
So I'm going to expand my selection here by going to select and select more or less and we can see the

64
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.200
short cut there is control a number pad plus or control number pad minus to actually select more and

65
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.610
we can see that expands the selection.

66
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.040
So let's try that again controller a plus.

67
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.530
And that's that's it.

68
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.210
That's all I'm going to do now then hop back in to texture paint.

69
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.460
And I can literally now whiz over it and it's masked off from the rest of our image.

70
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.240
So two different effects there see one soft and one's got this sharp edge around where the faces are.

71
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.640
But you can see how incredibly powerful that is.

72
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.040
Now of course we can use this to not only paint the diffuse smap so but to also paint a black and white

73
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.570
image as to where things are specular and where things are not.

74
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.210
Now of course you'll have to play with the images and set up a node system to do that.

75
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.840
But I think that's a good challenge for you.

76
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.550
Nice.

77
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.290
Okay so I'd like you to go ahead and paint on Suzanne.

78
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.890
So you will need to create a new image and apply that image to the model and various ways of doing that.

79
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.280
Do whichever way is easiest for yourself and remember you're probably going to be painting a value if

80
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.000
you're controlling something like a Closs shader.

81
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:48.050
So ultimately what I'd like you to do here is paint on Suzanne to define another shader So perhaps make

82
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.600
her eyes glossy or perhaps make another part of her glossy or even made of glass.

83
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.050
You know there's lots of options that you could do you can pick a shader of your choice.

84
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.300
I'm going to probably use the gloss shader.

85
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.260
So go ahead a video now and give it a go.

86
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.230
Okay guys.

87
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.050
Welcome back.

88
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.040
Let's go paint a controlled texture so we control another shader forces out.

89
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.790
Okay so I have saved my file there now I'm going to add a bit more detail to this before I rush ahead

90
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.620
and do anything else simply because it's not going to show up too well if I don't there's going to be

91
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.730
really rough and ready and we're going to need at an a Brownie colour for Suzanne it doesn't have to

92
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.150
be quite that.

93
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.580
There we go.

94
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.470
I like that one.

95
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.630
Winner wrap up the brush size here and quickly go over.

96
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.540
Make it all one colour.

97
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.350
Looking good.

98
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.920
Okay.

99
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.780
Now we just need to do the eyes.

100
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.230
So I'm going to go in to edit mode here.

101
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.020
And I'm gone just select everything that's to do with the now because the eye is actually a separate

102
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.620
mesh.

103
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.810
I can hit the L key and it selects everything that's linked and I'm going to hold down Shift and hover

104
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.170
the cursor over the next.

105
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.040
And also press l is that kind of work for me.

106
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.400
No just press L again.

107
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.800
Okay.

108
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.150
So now that we've got these two areas selected are going to hop back in so textured paint switch around

109
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.630
to the white and just colour in those eyes.

110
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.180
Now of course over on this side I can just have a very quick look.

111
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.990
Oh wow look it's actually separated out the eyes in two.

112
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.570
Wow.

113
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.520
Several areas you can see here how this isn't perhaps the best way of making sure you've got colour

114
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.430
all over the place because you do have to move around a model lots and there may be times when that's

115
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.960
not.

116
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.710
I'm not actually doing that entire model that you want.

117
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.390
Now I have done that.

118
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.270
I'm going to change that colour to black.

119
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:51.400
Let's make this window a bit larger and make this a tiny bit smaller so we can go in and add a rough

120
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.200
pupil obviously that's not the best people in the world but there we go.

121
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.800
In fact I could have added an iris in there as well but I'm not going to leave it kind of cartoony like

122
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.210
that.

123
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.900
So the next thing that I'm going to do is go ahead and make a nother image.

124
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:12.220
Well first of all let's see and make sure this one saved some monkey base we got a star next image so

125
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:12.790
it's not safe.

126
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.400
Let's go to savours image.

127
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.740
And I've already obviously been through here and I've called it monkey base.

128
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.740
I need another image called Monkey gloss something to go ahead and create that new image.

129
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:33.760
Call it monkey gloss and then you can use a shader of your own whatever you want.

130
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.320
And of course now we need to make sure that that is what we're painting on.

131
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.450
So I'm going to go into oh go see rendered mode.

132
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.320
What's that looking like.

133
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.110
And I don't think that's applied there so we're going to have to go over to the Textus tab.

134
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.990
I'm going to switch to textured mode here so we can see what's going on.

135
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.250
We're going to text the tab here and swap over monkey base or image texture here.

136
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.410
And that's what this over to monkey gloss.

137
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:06.450
And then we're painting on the gloss now because this is a Blackey calls no gloss and a white equals

138
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.750
full gloss.

139
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.370
The eyes are still selected So this is a great time where I can paint white.

140
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:18.320
Now this is a good question here whether I go fully white which you say 100 percent gloss when we use

141
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.450
the shaver or at 50 percent.

142
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:28.280
Now I want a bit more control so I'm going to use a maths node in a moment to control how much is applied.

143
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.430
But I'm just going to say where it's white.

144
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.160
I just wanted glossy and I'll control the amount of CLOs later on.

145
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.990
So just go around here.

146
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.470
There we go.

147
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:43.670
So the eyes now have 100 percent on them so we just need to make sure that we've saved that image as

148
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.960
well.

149
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.050
That is important.

150
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:51.320
If I close down a blender or it crashes at this point and those aren't saved that will cause me some

151
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.910
issues.

152
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.430
So now that I have these areas defined it's time to open up a node editor.

153
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.440
And I'm going to hop over into rended mode here so I can see what's going on underneath.

154
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.490
As always.

155
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.670
I'm going to make my scene a little brighter with a lamp in the scene at the moment.

156
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.450
And they use a sun lamp here.

157
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.420
I'm just going to rotate it round so the face is illuminated so you can see what's going on.

158
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.600
That's pretty good.

159
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.630
And I'm just going to move round here so I can see our model as well.

160
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.590
Okay.

161
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.290
That is good enough.

162
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.030
Enough of me faffing about here.

163
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.340
So I need to go into the node edit now and just control how that's looking.

164
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.340
So this is what the material looks like at the moment.

165
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.960
Have we got our material applied yessing on to make this a monkey material and we can see that that's

166
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.050
what we're working on.

167
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.010
So the first thing we need to do is make sure we've got the two textures loaded in someone to duplicate

168
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.090
the image texture node.

169
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.090
So we're going to have the monkey gloss and the monkey base of the top one I'm going to have the gloss

170
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.290
and the bottom one.

171
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.350
I'm going to have as the base the top one being a control texture.

172
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.770
It's not a colour it's not colour data.

173
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.510
Now those at the moment do not have any coordinates.

174
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.890
We've not told blender how to apply those.

175
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.600
We've got a U V map unwrap and that's what we've been painting with.

176
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:21.690
So I suggest we use that's going to go ahead and add an input of texture coordinate and I'm going to

177
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:29.430
go ahead here and take the U V output into the vector input so that defines how the image is mapped.

178
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.820
Now we're going to need to shaders here at these few shader.

179
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:41.230
And a gloss shade some going to go ahead and add in a gloss shader so shader loss.

180
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.740
There we go.

181
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:48.900
Glossy and I'm going to have to mix these two together so shader mix mix mix mix we go.

182
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.800
It's going to add those in.

183
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.330
Now I'm not sure which order I'm going to put them in at the moment but let use the colour to define

184
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.040
the factor of the kloss shader bass.

185
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.710
So in a plug the colour in.

186
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.960
Let's see how that comes out.

187
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.150
Okay that's actually the right way round.

188
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.290
In this particular case because we can see that the eye has gone glossy.

189
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.430
So let's change the colour output of the image itself the brown and the black.

190
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.740
There we go there.

191
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:21.670
So that's all very well and good but what is not happening here is this is just gone 100 percent glossy

192
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.450
which isn't necessarily what I want to do I want to control the amount of gloss.

193
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:36.760
So what we can do here is a mathematical operation and I'm going to multiply the colour out by a value

194
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.280
less than 1 so if I multiplied it by half it probably.

195
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.480
This allows us to control how much of a grey scale we're using there.

196
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.420
There are several other ways we could do that as well.

197
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:56.660
I'm going to try putting in a maths maths maths that will be under converter maths soon a pop that in

198
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.990
and we're not adding things together.

199
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:04.560
We are let's go down here multiplying we could divide I suppose a well.

200
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:12.400
Now if we changed this value here we can see that it's going between 100 percent obviously one a half

201
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.480
will make it's actually shine through.

202
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:20.350
The other thing we can do here of course is plug in the colour into the colour of wood gloss as well

203
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.240
to help it come across.

204
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.640
Now I've got control over how shiny The eye is.

205
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.260
The base colours obviously controlling the rest of it.

206
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.510
Now what else can we do here where we can change that to glass on it's going to change that now and

207
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:39.850
see what that looks like and with a move that out add a new shader in here in glass because and behind

208
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.340
I is kind of like a glass isn't it.

209
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.380
So let's pop that in and see how that comes across.

210
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.880
And what that doesn't come across quite as well as I was expecting someone to remove that again and

211
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:56.910
go back in and add in another shader that's go in and put the gorcey one back.

212
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.520
Pluck the colorin.

213
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.270
So there we go.

214
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.910
So now we can control the amount of glossiness is applied to the.

215
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.740
Itself with the base colour coming across there and that is looking pretty good.

216
00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.200
Now imagine the applications for all of this and there's no structure of course can get as complicated

217
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.620
or as simple as you'd like it to.

218
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:28.170
I think that looks pretty good and we've been able to control this gloss with some degree of accuracy.

219
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.880
How do you guys get on.

220
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.040
Did you decide to paint some other bits on Suzanne and change how they look as well.

221
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.240
Did you choose some different materials and different shade types.

222
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.610
Please share in the discussions and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
