Hello everybody and welcome to this quick tip about moving around in the viewport.
1

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
Now some of this we've covered already so be a great refresher and some of you may have forgotten it
2

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.700
so let's crack on straight away.
3

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.450
The first thing that you may already be experiencing in the viewport itself is when you press down the
4

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.830
middle mouse button you start trying to orbits around your model all you're using this symbol at the
5

6
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.770
top here.
6

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.880
It's all over the place and you're not really rotating around the thing you have selected.
7

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.140
Okay.
8

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.890
So if we go up to edit and then preferences.
9

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.050
Now if we have a look down here we can see that there are many many options and on the sidebar here
10

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.180
we're talking about how we're navigating around the 3D view.
11

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.900
I hope it's still under there under navigation.
12

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.350
Here we go.
13

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.140
We've got orbit around selection, auto perspective, auto depth etc..
14

15
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.980
So orbits around selection.
15

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.410
What does a tick in it but it's not doing what we think it is.
16

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.220
And that's because our selection is much larger than what we can see in the scene.
17

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.090
So when we just select the board it is doing so.
18

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.780
However when we select the board lights and camera Well the lights and camera are still miles and 
19

20
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.260
miles out over here.
20

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.970
So we're actually rotating around the central point of these three objects.
21

22
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.860
So that is something to watch out for.
22

23
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.560
But yes if we go back to edit preferences or if that doesn't come up after you've done that you may
23

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.590
have it open in another window still making sure orbits around selection is something that I really
24

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.860
love having turned on.
25

26
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.220
The other thing that can be incredibly useful is when you are zooming in and out you may prefer it zooming
26

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.620
to the mouse position.
27

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.580
Now this is something that some people find really annoying and others quite useful.
28

29
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.380
So zooming to the mouse position if that's turned on and we go back to our viewport we can use our mouse
29

30
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.850
to keep scrolling in.
30

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.550
And this is a great example of we run out of zoom, I literally cannot zoom in any further.
31

32
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.460
So we need to reset the zoom points at this point so I'm going to select my board.
32

33
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.120
I'm going to go to view and frame selected number pad full stop or number pad period.
33

34
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.400
So go ahead and do that.
34

35
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.550
Now the zoom is back and working and because we got it zooming based upon where the mouse cursor is
35

36
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.750
it does enable you to zoom in and out quite easily.
36

37
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.890
But as you can see that I can't easily get the rest of the board back in frame.
37

38
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.230
Personally I don't like it doing that.
38

39
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.780
I do prefer it to be off.
39

40
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.750
And then if I save my user preferences so it's the same all the time and every new blend file we see
40

41
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.310
that we zoom in and out based upon what's in the center of the screen so I will often place the thing
41

42
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.620
I need in the center of the screen first and then zoom in and adjust just that's just the way that I
42

43
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.920
work.
43

44
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.200
If you work differently that's absolutely fine.
44

45
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.880
We don't need to worry about that now being able to move around the scene.
45

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.020
Otherwise ahh still everything selected.
46

47
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.030
Make sure you've got the appropriate thing selects it being able to move around being able to walk or
47

48
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.440
fly around the scene if we go to view navigation once again same area, If scroll down we've got this
48

49
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.710
walk and fly navigation they're really really useful.
49

50
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.470
Personally I prefer the walk rather than the fly and you can access that by holding down the shift key
50

51
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.900
and the grave or tilde the key which is the one next to the number one on your keyboard if you press
51

52
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.190
that down it will enable walk or fly mode and then you can move around your scene if you're moving too quickly
52

53
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.920
we can use the scroll wheel slow down that movement and this is how you could also animate a camera
53

54
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.070
if you wanted to as well be a bit jerky unless you are really good sets but you use the controls W.A.
54

55
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.560
S & D which will be familiar to you if you've ever played a first person shooter or any first person game
55

56
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.330
W going forward.
56

57
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.020
S going back and then strafing left and right with A and D.
57

58
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.660
Q and E will go up and down if that's if you've been paying attention to the bottom of the screen you
58

59
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.600
can see a big old list of buttons you can press one of my favorites is either pressing down the middle
59

60
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.370
mouse button and I've missed it at that point there we go you can all press space you can jump and teleport
60

61
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.280
to certain locations which can be really really useful.
61

62
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.630
The other thing that you can do is turn gravity on so the moment gravity is turned off.
62

63
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.710
But if we press the tab key it will turn gravity on and I'm just gonna press escape and come out of
63

64
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.580
that for the moment.
64

65
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.490
Notice it resets the view.
65

66
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.610
I just wonder whether gravity is in fact turned on because of expected to fall right then.
66

67
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.510
So if we go to our scene properties gravity is turned on and it's set to minus nine point eight meters
67

68
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.150
per second let's just try that again.
68

69
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.560
It might not be functional yet or you can press the G key You know it seems to reset it's above our board
69

70
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.000
at the moment.
70

71
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.280
So with gravity on are there we go.
71

72
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.460
It's just tiny and we've fallen off of it and gone away.
72

73
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.970
So it's a bug caused by the size of our board rather than anything else.
73

74
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.140
And probably the same with the jumping to and the teleporting where it is just placing us on top remember
74

75
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.490
because is the number pad period key or if we don't have anything selected selected it first and then
75

76
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.860
go numpad period to zoom back in.
76

77
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.010
Okay.
77

78
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.510
And just a reminder that up here on the top right of the 3D viewport you do have the option of moving
78

79
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.920
things around.
79

80
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.080
Now with the camera set up it is incredibly useful if you're looking through the camera and then go
80

81
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.890
shift in the grave keep your Tilda you can then zoom in and adjust the camera position even if you're
81

82
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.760
not animating it.
82

83
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.600
So here we go.
83

84
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.660
I've moved the camera in a lot closer to our scene and what we can do for the moment is I can turn on
84

85
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.460
shaded mode so we can see the effects of a light.
85

86
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.000
And I'm going to move this light down a little and bring it closer into our scene.
86

87
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.110
In fact, the first thing I'm gonna do is just position it in the center of the scene so I'm going to highlight
87

88
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.420
all of those press zero, Oo its right in the center of the scene G Z and just lift it up and out of the
88

89
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.200
way and then move it across.
89

90
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.080
In this case on the X axis to give us a bit of light coming in and from that we've already made the
90

91
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.820
scene look a bit more atmospheric but I can also see we're going to have to tweak with some of the settings
91

92
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.670
because I know for a fact if we switch across to cycles we get our shadows perfectly.
92

93
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.230
But with eevee they're not there so we need to turn our shadows and we need to do a few other things
93

94
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.930
as well to get it working at this scale and fine, I'm going to switch back to lookdev for the moment so I can
94

95
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.760
see how everything's getting on.
95

96
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.420
I think we've got everything set up that I need and we select the chessboard frame everything back, There
96

97
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.270
we go perfect and we can see at the moment the camera does get in the way a little so again managing
97

98
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:52.990
the viewport itself what we can do is over in the outliner and just hide the camera out of view.
98

99
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.490
It's still there when we go to it but it's now not crossing over the rest of our models.
99

100
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.000
And the same is true of all of these relationship lines if we don't want them there we can go to overlays
100

101
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.580
and turn those off.
101

102
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.730
And in fact I'm going to leave mine like that because I know that these things are linked together as
102

103
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.860
I need them.
103

104
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.200
Okay.
104

105
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.650
Brilliant.
105

106
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.620
Well that's it for this quick tip on better viewport control.
106

107
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.270
I hope it helps you out massively if you've got any other tips you want to share with everybody.
107

108
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.550
Put them in the Q and A's or discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
