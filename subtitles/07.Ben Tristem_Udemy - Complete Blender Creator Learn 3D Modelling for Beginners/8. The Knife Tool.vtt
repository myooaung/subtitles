00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.560
Welcome to the knife tool.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.410
In this video you will learn how to use the knife tool.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.720
You'll see that it gives you many opportunities to craft and Marie craft your model and understand it

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.780
can both ruin if you're not careful and thick short apology.

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.050
So let's go explore the knife tour now and hop on over into a blender.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.350
Okay so we're over in the default blend farm because we certainly don't want to go hacking and slashing

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.760
at the moment to our human head that we're working on.

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.070
We can certainly go and do that once we've learned how to use the knife tool.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.490
So first of all where can you find the knife to when it's something that exists on a mesh object whilst

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.420
you're in edit mode.

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.490
So let's hop into edit mode.

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.160
I'm going to zoom in on our cube so you can see what's going on.

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.900
Now the knife tool can be found in the tool shelf under a knife under the Tools so we can click that.

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.130
Now if we look there we can see the shortcut key is k..

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.460
And if you use the space bar to try and find it it's called something slightly different it's called

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.420
Knife topology tool.

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.230
But again the shortcut is still k.

18
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.400
Now the knife tool can be a bit unintuitive.

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.310
The first time you use it I know I found myself deleting the cuts I was about to make accidentally all

20
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.520
the time.

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.710
So let's go ahead now and make a cut in the top of this cube and I'm going to left click to place the

22
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.070
first point and you can see a line join these together another left click left click left click.

23
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.480
Now the points snapped to one another which is very useful.

24
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.650
And if you cross a line that you've just made you can see that it adds an extra.

25
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.380
I'm going to call it a virtex here a point a knife cutting point in order to define where it's crossed

26
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.440
over how long to join it up to this end bit here.

27
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.420
Now if I were to right click at the moment I would lose all of that information.

28
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.530
Frustrating So you're probably going to do that a couple of times.

29
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.800
Don't worry we all go through it and repress the cakey again draw that's have or at least a similar

30
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.560
shape as I had before.

31
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.540
And I want to make sure that this time I don't lose that if we look at the very bottom where the header

32
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.950
by used to be we can see some controls one of which is enter or space to confirm.

33
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.460
I prefer the space keeks is easier for me to get to with this microphone in the way.

34
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.260
But otherwise the end key would also be fine.

35
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.940
And that goes if you've got a number panned as well the enter key there will also change.

36
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:42.480
Apply that now you'll notice here that blender has put in a couple of additional cuts so we just select

37
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.060
everything there and it's added this one here and the top edge.

38
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.540
Well at the top there.

39
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.750
So these have been defined by a blender.

40
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.280
It's worthwhile knowing that because you can take control.

41
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.410
There was just an equal chance that blender would have joined up different corners in order to preserve

42
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.330
an end gone.

43
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.770
Now the end on itself can't really have a hole in the middle but we see here there's a massive n gone

44
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.420
here with a one two three four five six sides but you can see its face dot is no where near the actual

45
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.330
face itself it's actually outside of it.

46
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.350
This one's got one then I'm not going to bother counting the edges there we've got a triangle there

47
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.070
and a quad in the middle.

48
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.870
Now of course we can go back and press K and go well if that's 1 to 3 I can just join a line up there

49
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.940
and that should be 1 2 3.

50
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.540
That would be for there.

51
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.950
So even though it looks like a trying on way in for it to go read so I know it's on that point there.

52
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.550
I'm going to press space to apply it now.

53
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.040
There are times where you'll want to keep cutting.

54
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.310
I tend to do one cut at a time or a series of cuts and then hit space rather than doing them all individually

55
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.900
or add big long chain just in case I glance the right mouse button or something along those lines.

56
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.900
But when I'm cutting with the work with the knife I can go one to this long range here so one to the

57
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.200
re.

58
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.140
For.

59
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.920
So I've defined another quad there.

60
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.480
Now I press the E key.

61
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.860
I can make another car and go one two 3.

62
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.430
That is actually force I'm not going to do anything there.

63
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.370
This one here.

64
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.760
So got one edge there one here one there.

65
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.530
So once again I can make that 4 by doing that and pressing SPACE.

66
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.370
I don't have to press space straight away though I can go ahead and make another cuts.

67
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.090
So one two three four.

68
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.660
Okay so that's not going to work.

69
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.900
Were just going along murcer.

70
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.690
But a cut here of a Wanted.

71
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.070
Now I'm not really paying attention to anything like edged flow or face flow at the moment.

72
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.280
I'm literally just trying to make quads.

73
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.810
This is a good exercise to practice making quads especially if you've got a triangle in the way so will

74
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.170
do that.

75
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.710
Now I'm going to hit the space bar just to define those.

76
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.610
Now here we have a triangle.

77
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.220
How do you make a triangle a quad where you add another vertex in one of its edges.

78
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.220
That's the easiest way to do it so I could go here 1 2 and just cut straight to the middle.

79
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.550
So let's give that a go now.

80
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.980
Go to there and that is one of the ways that you can to help define where you terminate.

81
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.690
Face loops seems compressed space there.

82
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.500
So if we had a facelift.

83
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.930
Running around here lets that she make one will crossover here.

84
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.360
I'm not gonna worry too much about.

85
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.310
I've made a triangle at the top here.

86
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.340
She's going to apply that same now we should find if I tried looping that face comes around to hear

87
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.960
it's not going to go down here because this is a five sided shape again so I'm with a cart just up here.

88
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.000
And that should be it.

89
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.590
One two three four that should define it so let's see where that flows so that flows up there at the

90
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.460
moment it doesn't flow around here.

91
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.420
And in order to make it to flow around here we'd have to change how it's structured.

92
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.450
Once again if you think about these it's very hard looking at this as a trying goal is very hard to

93
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.400
visualize it as a quad.

94
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.540
So if I actually grab fats you can see the way it flows naturally if I make these more quads like unarm

95
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.550
deforming the surface at the moment.

96
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.000
But I like it make them more Quand like we can see is flowing around there.

97
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.060
So that would mean I made the cut in the wrong place on that triangle for it to fly around.

98
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.930
So if I undo those steps I now have just moved a lot of things about so we've got this extra cut here

99
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.080
that we made well perhaps that's not where we want to serve.

100
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.520
I grab the knife tool go down there and apply that one well we wanted it to flow around here.

101
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.820
This is the edge that must continue.

102
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.930
This one here to this one here.

103
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.030
So does that mean we have to put cuts in this hedge to continue.

104
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.930
And again I'm going to make a couple of triangles here but in purposes of demonstrating that see how

105
00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.590
that works.

106
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:08.680
Yes it does so again because this doesn't really look like a triangle anymore it's difficult to visualize.

107
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:17.270
But if we make it look like a quad rather than that triangle we can see the flow is much more apparent.

108
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.270
And that can be a difficult and challenging thing when you first start trying to make edges flow where

109
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.180
you want them to flow but that's a nice tool.

110
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.640
In essence it's a very powerful tool.

111
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.800
But with that power comes a bit of responsibility but you go don't go ahead and wreck your model.

112
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.100
One of the things I do see people doing a lot is they end up cutting through parts of the model they

113
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.370
didn't intend to.

114
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:46.630
So what I would advise in general special is your beginning not holding down the mouse button and cutting

115
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.940
through lots of places because that's how mistakes are easily made are going to right click to cancel

116
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.270
that I'm going to press the caky again and go click find the next point that I want to cut through and

117
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:04.180
click with the left mouse button click with the left mouse button click with the left mouse button and

118
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.990
so forth.

119
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:11.590
And that way you can be sure that what you're actually cutting is only when you're clicking and I'm

120
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.670
going to apply that and then immediately check for the Edge loop or the face loop that I'm intending

121
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.530
to create is still actually working that is very important.

122
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.920
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

123
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:35.860
I'd like you to create your eye loops so use the knife tool to cut into your model creating new geometry.

124
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.580
Now I would also hint here using bevelling virtex and might be a great start.

125
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.330
Not necessary you can use the knife tool throughout.

126
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:52.510
Now keep in mind edge flows and face loops they'll help you check out which ones you've broken which

127
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:58.820
ones you need to redefine as you go and your creating the loops for the eyes.

128
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.540
Remember starting to define features were not working at a detail level at the moment.

129
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:11.380
We're literally saying this is where the eye is going to go and from there we can start modelling detail

130
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.830
later on.

131
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:19.060
I do remember of course that this may take a couple of attempts so make sure you've saved your work

132
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.010
as a separate file so you can reopen that.

133
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.810
If it's not it hasn't gone to plan.

134
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.000
Okay good luck with it.

135
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.910
Pause of the air now and give that a go.

136
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.530
Okay guys.

137
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.740
Welcome back.

138
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.930
Let's go create our loops and hop on over in a blender.

139
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.910
Okay so welcome back over into blender.

140
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.660
The first thing I'm going to do here is hop straight on in to edit mode.

141
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.680
I can see the underlying mesh.

142
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.230
I'm going to turn off my grease pencil for the moment and I can always turn it back on.

143
00:09:52.260 --> 00:10:00.680
If I find it important or necessary at the point and I'm also going to turn off the display of the modifier

144
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.250
the subsurface modifier whilst I'm in edit mode.

145
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.560
The reason for that is so I can see where all the vertices are.

146
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.970
As you can see we look directly at the eye.

147
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.110
Two of them are completely hidden at the moment and I don't want that for my own sanity.

148
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.160
So a couple of things that I need to do here to help me define the eye itself.

149
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:28.310
I'm going to have to put in an extra loop cut running down here to define the outer part of the eye.

150
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.030
Okay that's done.

151
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:35.470
There's a couple of options here with the I on what we do in how we do it.

152
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.280
I it's going to straighten these bits up here.

153
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:44.780
Got proportional editing turned on that can cause some headaches occasionally.

154
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:51.650
Now I could start cutting out our shape as we need it here starting off with a dime and I'm going to

155
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.250
use a little bit of a short cry here.

156
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:59.270
Don't worry if you didn't use the bevelling virtex talk give you a bit of hidden in there because we

157
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.830
haven't used it in anything so far in this course.

158
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.010
We've demonstrated it but not actually used it in anger.

159
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:13.650
So for instance this vertex in the middle here bevelling virtex if you cast your mind back it was control.

160
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.300
Shift them b.

161
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.590
Once we've done that we can generate a dime shape.

162
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:26.150
Once that's finished we can move it about and create are necessarily the necessary diamond shape that

163
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.310
we need for the eye itself.

164
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.900
Now one thing about bevelling vertex of course just remember the segments and is going to bevel another

165
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.390
one here.

166
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.440
Not going to keep it.

167
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.950
But if you've got the mouse wheel and you've scrolled it or you've had a higher level of segments was

168
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.260
playing with it before.

169
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.620
It may be still set a high level.

170
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.100
I have opted to Sister level one that which gives me a bit more control.

171
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:55.140
And again will be focussing on macro detail at the moment rather than micro detail.

172
00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:02.120
Okay so now we've done that let's check the status of our loops so absoute doubts are going to hold

173
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.850
down oltz and face loops.

174
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.420
Those are intact that's broken.

175
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.160
Those are intact.

176
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.110
Let's check vertical ones.

177
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.540
Okay.

178
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.070
Okay so I've broken some of my loops and what's going on here.

179
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.400
Well let's chase this horizontal one here around our models for a start.

180
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.050
Here we go.

181
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.870
Here we go here and then we get to a pole.

182
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.520
We've got one of two directions in which we can continue blender doesn't know which one we're going

183
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.110
to do so it's stuck.

184
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.600
It can't do anything and what we can do very quickly here in fact I'm just looking at the geometry and

185
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.260
trying to work it out.

186
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:52.820
We can hit the knife key and literally cut out a couple of trapezium shaped objects or faces and then

187
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.720
press space there.

188
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.040
How has that work.

189
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.810
Let's test horizontally.

190
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.640
Yep we're flowing around me.

191
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.430
I perfect vertically.

192
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.070
Okay.

193
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:10.920
Now what is happening here is what basically is one phase one continuous face loop that crosses over

194
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.720
in the middle.

195
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:17.010
So what is happening here if we start on the left hand side with this face it goes down goes to here

196
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:24.180
it crosses over the eye coast back to here and then follows on down it loops all the way round the back

197
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:31.830
of our model comes back down here and then crosses over again and goes back down until it reaches here

198
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.490
again and goes in a full circle again.

199
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.830
So occasionally you will get your model doing this.

200
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:44.610
If you've managed to make a crossover point it's almost like a cross roads for these face loops and

201
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.470
they just join back up again.

202
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:51.210
The other thing to check of course is where it's going because it's not going round the bottom because

203
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.360
there is no bottom at the moment we can see if we look here.

204
00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:01.100
He is following this loop around here around the back of a head back up all the way to the front again

205
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.930
but we are starting now to define the eyes.

206
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:10.710
In fact if we hop out into object mode we can see that the eyes themselves are starting to be defined

207
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.710
and that will help us define the brow as well.

208
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:20.640
So one one further thing we can do here is starting to put some more detail here to define the brow

209
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.840
itself.

210
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.580
I know we're not focussed purely on detail here but I just want to make sure that the overall shape

211
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.080
is right.

212
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:35.090
Of course if we go tramper face looping here we start to get some quite funky stuff going on.

213
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.180
I'm not going to do that for the moment.

214
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.170
I'm going to probably end up deleting In fact let's do it now let's get rid of that face and delete

215
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.810
faces.

216
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.450
Okay so that gives us a hole in our mesh which is fine.

217
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.800
Let's move round to the front.

218
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.480
We can see that it gives us a rough free the right shaped hole.

219
00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:02.250
It also enables us to start moving things about because what we don't have at the moment is any real

220
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.700
control over the shape of that heart.

221
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:11.370
So again let's switch it back on at this point and grab that with proportional editing turned on and

222
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:18.550
just modify the shape ever so slightly to help us define the I itself.

223
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.500
Again there's no right or wrong when it comes to this sort of thing.

224
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.280
Cavour is starting to look good.

225
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.820
They're going to have to be some extra geometry coming in here in fact.

226
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.240
Now we've not got any damage to the air.

227
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.070
We can do that one and we can do this one.

228
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:44.230
And that should give us the ability to let's say grab this and just make the I just a little bit better.

229
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:52.290
Our from restore that face at any point if I want to add further detail in the eye if I might have to

230
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.650
do that now I've deleted it.

231
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.160
No that's no biggie because we've got edge loops and if we've got edge loops it means we can select

232
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.270
our model with much more ease than if we don't have them.

233
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.130
So we've got this one here that does look a tiny bit odd.

234
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.960
Let's just have a look at that again in object mode.

235
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.780
That is starting to look very very good.

236
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:18.830
The eyes have a good shape and not that much detail at the moment which is the level we want.

237
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.780
I am going to fill that hole back in again because when it comes to detailing the inside of the inside

238
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:31.590
of VII it's going to be much easier to insets and you can inset a face that doesn't exist somewhere

239
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:38.190
of the Selecta that edge loops running around there and fill that in and that will enable us to insets

240
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:44.750
hits in the future to make more detail look feel that back in perfect.

241
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.570
How did you guys get on have you defined your eyes in your model.

242
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.860
How is it coming along.

243
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:56.150
I'd love to see it remember to show your work in discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
