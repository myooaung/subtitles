00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.410
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.650
By the end of this lecture we're going to combine our stairs with our pyramid objects so we end up with

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.890
one mesh objects in total and we can test that by going over into edit mode we see the stairs are now

4
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.310
part of the overall pyramid mesh.

5
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.780
Let's go find out some more.

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.660
Okay so we'll start off with a default cube and we shall add another default mesh object into there.

7
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.090
Let's add in AUV sphere and move along the y axis.

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.950
So now we've got a sphere mesh object and a cube mesh object.

9
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.910
If we shift select the cube again so the sphere itself has the dark orange border and the cube itself

10
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.160
has the light orange.

11
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.370
We know that this is the active selected item.

12
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.340
So then if we go ahead to the object menu and go down to join which we can see the shortcut key for

13
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.820
is controlling J.

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.220
We can join them together.

15
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.370
Now notice in the outline there is no longer the sphere object.

16
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.040
There's just the cube object.

17
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.160
Now the main takeaway here is that it doesn't matter how many other objects you have and what their

18
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.860
names happen to be.

19
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.120
If we go ahead and shift select them with the active object being the last thing that's been selected

20
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.710
when we join them together in this case I'll use the shortcut key controlling J.

21
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.900
They all inherits the name of whatever the active object was when you joined them.

22
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.670
Now that seems pretty straightforward and now all of this is editable under one object.

23
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.570
However one of the things and caveats that can catch you out is that if modifiers are applied to those

24
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.650
objects they will lose them as well.

25
00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.380
So this is one of those times where if you were joining to mesh objects together one had modifiers on

26
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.420
it you might want to apply those modifiers as you bring it together as one objects.

27
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.390
So let's do an example of that now let's get rid of everything in our scene and add in an eco sphere.

28
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.810
You could pick any other mesh objects you'd like.

29
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.510
Go to our modifiers tab and add an array under the space the mounts a little and have four in total.

30
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.400
Okay.

31
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.580
I'm going to add another objects into our scene.

32
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.960
I'm going to add a cylinder and just move it out of the way.

33
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.880
Now if I go ahead selecting this group here this array here and then shift selecting the cylinder.

34
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.450
Now we already know when we join this the sphere mesh data will become part of the cell and mesh objects

35
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.620
but watch will also happens to our array when we do that.

36
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.160
That's right.

37
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.950
It disappears and let's undo that for a second and let us select our cylinder with the cylinder selected.

38
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.690
We can do another array modifier but this time I'm going to have it go in the other direction and I'm

39
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.990
going to have it go one point five and for a count of two that's absolutely fine.

40
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.960
It's different now when we shift and select what will happen is not only will the sphere lose its modifier

41
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.770
but it will gain the modifier the one is joined.

42
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.650
So you not only have to be careful about losing information but also inheriting information in this

43
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.710
case modifiers that you don't necessarily want or need.

44
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.260
And this is one of the reasons perhaps keep them as separate mesh objects.

45
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.710
If you need them to maintain those modifiers because one of the things you might want to avoid is applying

46
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.220
lots of modifiers and then the only way of preserving these is to in fact keep the modifiers on them

47
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.170
and keep them as separate objects.

48
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.260
One of the other things that you can think about is are they truly separate objects or are they part

49
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.040
of one.

50
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.900
Now some of those questions will be answered by your use case.

51
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.950
So we were exporting this to a game engine.

52
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.680
You may actually be required to have as one object during your exports or you may find that you need

53
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.250
it as multiple objects especially if it's a dynamic thing that's going to fall apart.

54
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.990
There's lots of different options depending on what you need to achieve.

55
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.180
And it's worth being aware of the caveats when joining objects together because these are two different

56
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.970
things.

57
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.070
And in this case what I could do is apply the cylinder apply the IKO sphere.

58
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.030
Then when I go ahead and select and join them together they maintain their previous setup.

59
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.310
However with the disadvantage that we've lost those modifiers and with that in mind is time for your

60
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.200
challenge OK it's challenge time.

61
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.240
I'd like you to go ahead and join the stairs to the rest of the pyramid so that they are one mesh object

62
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.720
and there should only be one mesh object when you are finished.

63
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:09.130
When you've joined those stairs to the rest of the pyramid Paul's video now and give us a go Okay everybody

64
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.850
Welcome back.

65
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.970
Let's hop over into a blender and connect the stairs to our pyramid Okay everybody and welcome back.

66
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.120
So let's go ahead and just combine these two objects together we've got the stairs objects and the pyramid

67
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.740
object that we need to combine.

68
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.900
Of course we do need to make sure we apply our modifier first so let's go ahead and do that and then

69
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.600
we're going to go ahead and select tile pyramid and get control in J to join them together.

70
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.620
And then of course finally we can check that they're joined together if we go into edit mode we can

71
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.030
see that we can edit all of this mesh data together and if we check in the outline we can confirm there's

72
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.480
now only one mesh object called pyramid perfect set.

73
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.610
How are you guys getting on.

74
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.040
I hope you manage to join your stairs successfully to your pyramid and I'll see you all in the next

75
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.510
lecture.
