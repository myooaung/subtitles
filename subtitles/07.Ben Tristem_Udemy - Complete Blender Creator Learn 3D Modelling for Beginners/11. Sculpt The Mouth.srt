1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,910
In this video we're taking on the mouth and adding some details around the mouth full self disclosure.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,290
I'm really bad at doing the math.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,350
It's taken me a while to do this and I'm going to speed up a lot of this video where I play around try

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,450
a game player and try again but I'm going to let you know my technique and then we can both go through

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,530
it together and go through the process.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,510
So let's jump in and work on our mouth.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,880
Make sure you've got enough material so you might want to add down Clay strip if you don't have enough.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,920
This is a good spot to say oh that's roughly where the mouth is going to go.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,260
It's usually a third of the way down from nose to chin.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,000
So this is the nose we say that's around about a third.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,600
That's a third.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,200
That's a third.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,070
So I want to put my clay strip a little bit higher than that.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,620
Okay.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,940
That looks like I've got sticky tape over my mouth.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,110
Perfect.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,880
I'm going to speed up the video and tell you what I'm doing here.

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,580
I've laid down my clay strip using the crease tool to make some early lips and then the little bit of

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,530
the indent on the top lip from side on I can see that the mouth is not quite lined up in a straight

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,350
line but just continue in the process of lay down a clay strip smooth it down get more of an indent

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,180
using the crease told sort of going through that process and for me are kind of a lot of iteration put

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,260
it down trying and pull down try again and then I thought you know I'm going to Italy where the creasing

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,480
around the side of the face just getting the the crease tool just getting some of those lines of the

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,390
wrinkle type lines around the side of the face.

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,750
Just playing around the cheekbones so I can get a bit of a feel for it and then come back to the lips

26
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,970
in a moment.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,450
Okay.

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,330
Now that we've got the general flow for it I'm going to give you the challenge which is to sculpt the

29
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,870
mouth at the lips and Matthew ahead if you haven't done so already you're probably following along with

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,400
me and also add the other lines increases around the mouth the nose the chin and the whole jaw area.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,320
So pause the video jump in and take that on now.

32
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:41,870
Welcome back.

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,070
I've sped up the video again.

34
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,900
I wasn't happy with how the lips were looking so I've taken my clay strips and just stripped over the

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,390
top of my mouth and now just doing a little of shape shaping the the crease underneath the lips and

36
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,390
then trying again with the crease to increasing the resolution at the moment I've got it in the 30s

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,830
round the lifts your.

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,300
I found I needed to put it even higher maybe up to 50 or 60 just to get that crease nice and neatly

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,720
and to get the finer detail on the lips.

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,450
But for you play around with what resolution you think works for you whether it's 20 or 30 or 60.

41
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,900
Similarly with the creases underneath the chin had a few goes at that try to give myself a little bit

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,760
of a smile at some stage it looked like he'd like a little bit unnatural.

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,650
And generally when you're doing a sculptor pose you get a little bit of an unnatural Look it's often

44
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,590
just the resting face you do your best get the lines in there a little bit more of a crease in the lip

45
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,660
just continuing to finesse with it and it's around about here that I've increased the resolution up

46
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,090
to 70 and I'm getting a lot more of that nice crease in between the lifts and also around some of the

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,860
more delicate areas around the mouth the eyes to use that for the crease.

48
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,400
Just making sure that I smooth out any of the ups and downs along the lifts if I getting really closer

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,860
and have a look at it and just pulling and pushing.

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,960
Just getting the shape of it.

51
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,950
And you've seen my technique I tend to fiddle and diddle and move and play around with a little bit

52
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,730
up a little bit down.

53
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,110
You don't need to take quite such that amount of time if you're doing something that's more of a caricature

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,110
or a character that you're making up from scratch.

55
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,580
I'm trying to match a reference image something a little bit precious about it but I don't need to be

56
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,290
quite that precious about it.

57
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,020
And it's this stage I'm looking at my model and saying what else can I do to improve the positioning

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,560
of things to fine tune it just as a last pass.

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,430
So if you want.

60
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,720
Go ahead and add any last little features any wrinkles or creases that you might have missed throughout

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,900
the nose eyes ease mouth chin neck areas but otherwise we're ready to jump into the next lecture.

62
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,490
I'll see you then.
