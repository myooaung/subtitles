00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome to overlaying images.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.050
We need to consider what are our layers when we're sticking everything together.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.020
One of the obvious ones is the background image and that has to be visible.

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.860
In fact that is the base of our entire project.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.340
Now we got the object itself.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.140
This is the item we're using CGI were generating this on our computer and they were merging with the

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.860
real world image that also has to be visible.

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.070
Now the moment's whim blending the two things together.

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.170
And we're kind of getting all of the objects isn't isolated and we're getting this blend between the

10
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.530
two.

11
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.540
So we need to sort that out.

12
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.650
We're going to have a shadow eventually and that also needs to be visible.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.570
However the ground itself used for capturing the shabot needs to be hidden.

14
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.380
So let's have a look now at how we can isolate the object by itself and give that some thoughts and

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.840
also how we can go about isolating the shadow by itself or whether we need to do something else with

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.220
the shadow as well.

17
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.840
Before we go over into blender Let's grab a pen and paper and work out the layers of our image.

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.840
Let's go ahead and think about what we want.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.970
So at the end we want a composite image.

20
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.620
A composition that has our mountains or whatever your image is in the background an object and a shadow

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.670
that looks like it's being cast onto the actual surface.

22
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.470
And we've got a fake ground plane that we can use there which we don't want visible in the final scene.

23
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.590
How are we going to do about that.

24
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.460
Well let's have a look at our components what's making up this scene.

25
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.710
We've got a background and that's all pretty much goes all the way to the end and there's something

26
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.410
happening here before we render.

27
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.510
And that's going to be last or final combination node if you will.

28
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.610
And this is just conceptual at the moment we're trying to work out how to piece together our image.

29
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.750
Now we can render our entire scene at once which is a an object.

30
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.880
The ground plane it sits on and a shadow.

31
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.630
Okay so that's something else we can work with.

32
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.380
Now we could render the shadow by itself.

33
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.450
Now if we have a look at what would happen in in reality is there would be a shadow cast underneath

34
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.280
an object that's too close to the floor someone extend the shadow up to the top of the plane edge to

35
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.780
demonstrate that.

36
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.720
And then finally we can do the plane itself or the ground whatever we're doing and with with these We've

37
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.590
got pretty much every combination we can use to work things out.

38
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.170
Now the problem we have this one here is a circle in red for a moment problem with this one here it

39
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.220
is it would actually if we overlaid it unless we started doing something funky we would have a shadow

40
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.410
over the top of our object.

41
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.080
When we combine them so we don't want to do that.

42
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.450
So I'm just going to remove those bits there and we'll decide at this point that we do not want to use

43
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.130
that particular image.

44
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.490
Additionally we have to consider the render time implications itsay each one of these three images took

45
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.660
the same time to render.

46
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.500
I doubt they would.

47
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.520
But let's to save arguments sake.

48
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.900
They do then that middle one that we've decided to exclude potentially could save us 33 percent of our

49
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.320
render time which if it's an animation is going to be a lot of render time.

50
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.780
So when we can avoid rendering that is a good thing because it will save us a lot of time even if you

51
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.120
decided at the end to render your composite image at high resolution is still going to have to render

52
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.790
all of these out first.

53
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.230
So that's a good time saving tip there.

54
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.790
So that leaves us with these combinations and we need to do something with them.

55
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.360
We don't know quite what is at the moment but we need to what do we need to get.

56
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.460
We need to get the object by itself and we need to get the shadow by itself.

57
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.050
But and art just draw a harsh line there.

58
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.920
The shadow has to be occluded by the actual object.

59
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.330
So you've got the object by itself and I'll just do a dash here as if it was alferd out and an image

60
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.310
just by itself and once again here we would have an outfit out image.

61
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.390
So how do we get this well we can certainly just extract the objects from here.

62
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.580
So something will happen here which we'll get.

63
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.750
That's And then we can combine that.

64
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.270
Towards the end we to do a plus there.

65
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.310
I don't know whether it will be an addition or multiplication or something.

66
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.000
In fact what would be better of course would be an equals some sort of maths going on that would equal

67
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.350
that.

68
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.930
And again this question mark is really in equals what do we do here that equals that.

69
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.020
And then finally we've got the shadow all by itself but occluded by the object.

70
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.060
So we have the object up here and we have the plane just here and the difference between those will

71
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.590
be included shadow.

72
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.470
And so there's going to be something else happening when we combine these things together.

73
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.540
So there's three distinct groups here we've got this background group with something happening and I'm

74
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.170
just going to make that big big agree.

75
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.820
So something happens with this background group and then it gets passed onwards.

76
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.540
We've also got this group here.

77
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.550
And then something gets passed onwards.

78
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.610
And finally we've got a third group and just going to do it in a different colour so it stands out.

79
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.980
This group here.

80
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.150
So these things themselves I say group.

81
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.540
They can be compartmentalized and then reused if necessary.

82
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.030
Now will depend on the scenes you're doing but we can see here how putting them all together.

83
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.180
We've got three distinct groups so we've got three levels of what's known as abstraction that we've

84
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.280
got a lot of detail going in here but we can zoom out and make these modules much more easy to follow

85
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.430
and much easier to read as well.

86
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.460
Looking at this diagram in front of us we've pretty much done this first one if we just link in we get

87
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.770
the background image and we're kind of there with this one at the moment.

88
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.720
We're we've got the background the actual cube showing but it's affecting the entire image and not having

89
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.280
the cube itself isolated.

90
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.810
So let's go ahead now and look at that and hop on over in a blender.

91
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.440
Okay so I've gone ahead and opened up the scene.

92
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.780
We were working on before we're setting up the camera and the fake ground plane to cast the shadow one.

93
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.460
And I'm liking what I see so far and I even rename the file so I don't overwrite the old one.

94
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.070
Now I'm going to immediately append an object into my scene.

95
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.260
I've gone on to blend swap and I have modified a an F 22 like thing it's an aeroplane.

96
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.380
So let's go ahead and append it into our scenes and you can also use this if you're doing a runway and

97
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.750
following along.

98
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.260
F 22 lightning will just import that will go to object.

99
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:57.180
Or if I click happy go f 20 to append from library and under the move that now towards the camera and

100
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.160
there will do it's in the ground so that's just lift it up so it's not perfect.

101
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.250
Now because I've set everything up so is all level I can actually whiz round to the.

102
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.550
Front view and orthographic mode zoom in and make sure it's not actually in the ground so it would be

103
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.020
hovering about there.

104
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.930
This plane does not have wheels nevermind seats.

105
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.750
So let's go ahead now and with background for camera mode.

106
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.780
Make sure it's roughly in the right position and with shift across just a little.

107
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.570
OK we've got an object and we want to isolated from the background.

108
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.910
Let's render what we've got so far.

109
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.870
And again looking at this the lighting is not right and it's going to take too long so to scroll down

110
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.880
further sampling and turn the render down to one that will speed up that.

111
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.360
And finally let's sort out our lighting as well so I've got the lamp in the scene.

112
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.980
It's blatantly not a sunlamp at the moment so that's making some amp for argument's sake it doesn't

113
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.150
matter with the sunlamp but I'm going to move it so as over the sun.

114
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:06.460
And then the little line that comes out to show you the direction I can manipulate that so that it is

115
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.770
facing towards us.

116
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.850
So let's go ahead and open up the properties panel and we've still got our lamps selected and I'm going

117
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.940
to change the rotation to 0 0 0.

118
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.180
And I'm going to camp out for a moment.

119
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.710
And see that that is facing directly down now.

120
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.620
I don't want it face indirectly down I want it towards our plane which is over here.

121
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.830
And so I think I need to rotate it around the x-axis.

122
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.700
By the looks of it by minus 90 he hopes Yes that's right.

123
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.400
And now I just need to move it towards the camera as well so I can go back to this view and literally

124
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.060
by manipulating not the why these z axis has tried 10.

125
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.270
Yeah that's moving it toward.

126
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.790
So we need positive.

127
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.370
So now it's definitely towards us that is quite hard to see.

128
00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:01.710
But the little line if I exaggerate it moving away moving towards it because it was roughly towards

129
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:07.500
us to begin with I know it is moving towards not away from finally the rotation where the sun isn't

130
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.920
pointing directly over there.

131
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:16.610
I'm going to make it face down slightly may be 85 and let's just render that now and see what we get

132
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.250
at.

133
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.540
That's not the desired result.

134
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.090
The first thing I'm going to do is get rid of that back drop because we need to focus on one thing at

135
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.730
a time.

136
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.880
If you put too many things into your pot you you won't be able to.

137
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:34.650
We need to isolate the flavours so we need to isolate these two parts of our image someone to switch

138
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.880
immediately over to the compositing node and let's have a back drop turned on.

139
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:44.130
Oh no let's not have the backdrop there's just use of the window down here and also render turned on

140
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.920
let's render our image out perfect.

141
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.530
We're using nodes and you may get this happen to you occasionally where you're using nodes and no nodes

142
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.500
appear.

143
00:09:53.910 --> 00:10:01.350
Switch to the shader and switch back to your compositing node and it should all come back.

144
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.150
So as I was detailing earlier we need to isolate some of these components so they don't get in the way

145
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.560
and you can't go back and touch them over that's abroad.

146
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.670
You naughty naughty can't do that.

147
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.720
So I'm going to sell these two here make them into a group and by making them into a group and then

148
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.990
come out and it's called node group that's no good.

149
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.880
I'm going to call it background image.

150
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.130
We know that works are just background will be fine for the moment.

151
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.340
We know that works.

152
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.550
We don't need to play with it.

153
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.470
Let's get rid of it completely from our set up for the moment.

154
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.930
We've got this multiply here.

155
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.720
I'm going to leave that.

156
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.850
I think we're going to need multiply at the end.

157
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:36.920
I don't know.

158
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.890
So nothing plugged in with nothing plugged in we can't see what's going on.

159
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.610
Let's delete the multiply and well if we need it.

160
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.300
We'll pop it back.

161
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.660
I'm going to link up to the not the view of the composer.

162
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.550
There we go.

163
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.890
And I'm going to get rid of the viewer because I can always bring that back in with no Wrangler if I

164
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:56.880
need to.

165
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.590
Excellent.

166
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.990
So we have our friend play here.

167
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.060
I'm still not happy with that's the the lamp itself.

168
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.900
Have I actually set the lamp up.

169
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.520
I don't think I have moved it I made it into a sun.

170
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.120
I didn't use notes and I didn't turn up the strength to maybe five.

171
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.930
Let's switch to rended mode to see what's going on in the 3D view.

172
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.900
Gosh we've got a shadow there and it looks like it's facing the right direction.

173
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:29.330
And so I want the shadow to be a bit tighter and this size will make its basically diffuse the shadow

174
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.100
and set that to zero.

175
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.310
We get a really harsh shadow that's also not what I desire northpoint not one.

176
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.440
They go get a bit of fuzz there.

177
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.790
Let's try not point nought five.

178
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:42.650
Excellent.

179
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.180
I like how that is coming out.

180
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.710
Let's hop back over into the compositing layouts compositing.

181
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.620
There we go.

182
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.090
Now something is taking a while to render in the background let's just make sure everything set up sampling

183
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.970
renders one that's fine.

184
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.130
I'm happy with how this is here and we've got auto render Let's go ahead and work out how we can isolate

185
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.430
this.

186
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.190
In fact that doesn't look like it has rendered out.

187
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.870
There we go.

188
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.160
Now it has.

189
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.330
What's Have we got to do.

190
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.760
We need to isolate the object itself and because it's an object in our scene we can give that object

191
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:21.440
an idea and then isolate it via that idea.

192
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.800
Let's go back and open up what we've got a 3-d view here we don't need open anything else up.

193
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:36.260
I've got the F 22 selected and I can go into its object properties and here I can give a pass index

194
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:41.420
under the relations you can move it onto a different layer if you wanted to you can do that from here.

195
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.730
That's another way of doing that and you can see that a parent object and you can give it an identity.

196
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:51.920
I'm going to set that to one and just re render and see what happens.

197
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.270
Nothing looks any different.

198
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:57.730
Brilliant we haven't upset the rendering gods as it were.

199
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:02.600
So the next thing to do here is be able to pull that information from our render layer.

200
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.360
And it's not turned on at the moment.

201
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:11.570
So we need to go to our render layers and go down and underpasses there's a lot more options.

202
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.520
In this case we want the object index.

203
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:21.360
If we go ahead and select that we can see that we get index objects coming out.

204
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.310
Okay that's a good start.

205
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.820
Now how do we mask off this particular F 22.

206
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.100
Well we need to add in a node that's converter.

207
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:38.270
And then I see the mask so it's masking off a particular index number.

208
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:44.510
And here in highly value all we need to give it the entire scene data so that's plug in the on index

209
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.560
object.

210
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.760
And there we go.

211
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.870
Let's preview this.

212
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.790
I'm going to use noad Wrangler again.

213
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.600
I could plug it into the vehicle which I've deleted but I'm going to use controlling shift and click

214
00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.500
on that and we should see if I turn back up on what's happening and we get a white image.

215
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.430
We've not got it set to one so let's go ahead and set it to one.

216
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.470
Oh now we get a black image.

217
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:11.790
What is going on here now because we didn't have this set up on the render layers yet it hasn't actually

218
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.770
been included.

219
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.240
The node has it all set up but it has not been output yet.

220
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.520
It's not stored that data so it's null at the moment or nothing.

221
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.160
So let's go ahead and re render our scene.

222
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.360
And there we go.

223
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.830
We have a mask isolating just the object.

224
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.200
Brilliant.

225
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.880
And of course that leads us nicely on to a challenge.

226
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.390
I would like you to go ahead and render the background and the objects together.

227
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:44.480
So finish off the node set up to show the background with the object placed upon it.

228
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.420
You'll need to use the idae mask to show parts of the rendered image.

229
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.830
You'll want to see pause the video now and give that again.

230
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.220
Okay guys.

231
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.240
Welcome back.

232
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:04.530
Let's go set up the nose now and hop on over in the blender right so we have a mask set up here that

233
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.860
we can use.

234
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.350
Let's bring back in our background.

235
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.110
Did I delete it.

236
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.830
No I just had it out of the way.

237
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.870
You probably won't be able to see this.

238
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.460
Zoom back in.

239
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:15.930
There we go.

240
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.680
Now I found that background low.

241
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.500
And we've got a viewer here.

242
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.850
I don't need the viewer it's just going to get in the way of this backdrop so I'm going to remove that

243
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.210
entirely.

244
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:33.810
And I also want the render to automatically update so what do we have before we had a mix colour mix

245
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.400
knows we need to mix these two images together.

246
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.400
We know that in which order.

247
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.650
Oh interesting.

248
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.350
Well if we just mix them 50/50 that's not going to work but we're going to have to do something with

249
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.620
the idae mask here.

250
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:53.770
I think it is mix we need because we need again this waiting here is an average of the two.

251
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.940
However if we control the weighting.

252
00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.360
So let's just bring that back in.

253
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.310
If we bring the weighting it of 100 percent of only this image.

254
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:10.250
So I'll be the factor of the bottom one so I think that's the right order.

255
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.740
Yeah I think so.

256
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.820
This will be a factor of 100 percent thus showing us all of what's under this image.

257
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.730
And then the black will be nothing of this image and therefore show all of the background.

258
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.230
Let's plug it in and see what happens.

259
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.290
All excellent.

260
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.860
How about vides all come together rather nicely halimi.

261
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.710
Just get rid of my back drop again so we can see the node set up.

262
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:35.820
Let's see what we've got.

263
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.210
Let's see if we can group things together into their compartments.

264
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:45.840
So this is like an end mix node at the moment and we have the composite at the end so that's fine that's

265
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.930
are that's our End Point.

266
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.870
We've got a viewer here I can just get rid of that.

267
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.090
So we have our I.D. mask and our render layers.

268
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.750
Now I would like to group these two together.

269
00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.360
And sometimes it's a bad idea to group inputs together.

270
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:06.720
But if you do try and group these together if we go node and make a group a blender will complain we

271
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.970
can't shove a render layer into a group.

272
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.680
And I'm not going to go about.

273
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.900
And this is mask.

274
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.500
I'm going to shove that into a group just yet.

275
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.910
But this is isolated are object.

276
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:25.550
The issue I've got with this of course is it's a different layer to this background so this is all one

277
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.700
particular group.

278
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.460
So we could visualize that in a different way if we want to we could put a little frame around it.

279
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.920
So let's go and do that now at select both of these and add a frame.

280
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.590
So I'm going to select those two as done and shift them.

281
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.470
P Ill pop a frame around it.

282
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.630
I'm happy with it left as the fall colours it just demonstrates that that is its own entity and also

283
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.250
means we can move them both around together.

284
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.130
Excellent.

285
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.640
How did you guys get on.

286
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.570
I hope you've managed to render your objects over the top of your photo your scene.

287
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.190
Of course we can get to making that look a bit better.

288
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.770
Later on we just need to get the components right first.

289
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.450
Now I did sad in one nain this for I did want to colour in this frame but I will name it so with it

290
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.880
selected I'm going to go over the label here and call it object isolation.

291
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.810
I so relate to or isolation.

292
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:22.160
That's called at isolators but the verb at the front ice or up spell that completely wrong I say relates

293
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:27.500
object and I'm going to use kamil case which is where you just capitalize with no spaces.

294
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:32.700
Isolate objects and then R has in that brillion THIS turn up the label size so we can read it.

295
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.110
There we go.

296
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.420
Isolate objects.

297
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.760
Perfect.

298
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.080
How did you guys get on.

299
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:42.270
Remember to show your work over in the discussions on the forum and I will see you guys in the next

300
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.010
lecture.
