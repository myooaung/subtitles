00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.640
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.740
In this lecture we're going to add a bit more detailing to our Bob.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.900
And basically finish off the armature itself so we can rig the rest of the lamp and it's coming along

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.920
really nicely.

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.620
So let's just hop out and show you around if I go into Poe's mode if I turn on my overlays we've got

6
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.130
a bone here now that's controlling not only the shade itself which we didn't have before but also the

7
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.570
bulb inside and the ball joints as well.

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.090
So now we're gonna hop on over straight into a challenge.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.550
Okay.

10
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.580
So what is it we need to do.

11
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.700
Well we need to add the final bone we've got nothing to control the lamp shade at the moment and then

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.430
create a simple ball joint connecting the shade to the upper arm.

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.880
And then finally parent that lampshade and the ball joint to the new bone.

14
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.490
Of course if you've also made a bulb you'll want to parent that to the bone as well because of the air

15
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.450
now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.820
Let's go ahead now hop on over into blender and completes our lamp.

17
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.200
Okay everybody and welcome back.

18
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.090
So we need to put ourselves something here.

19
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.030
And it's going to be something quite simple I'm gonna go for a sphere in that place.

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.450
Nice and easy to do and also then we've got our bulb.

21
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.960
And I believe how is still hidden somewhere in this list here.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.310
There we go.

23
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080
Our bulbs completely in the wrong place.

24
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.980
So let's go ahead.

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320
First of all and shift that up.

26
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.540
So it's roughly in the right place.

27
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.390
Now you see it's locals at Axis is down there so let's make it the global by pressing Z again.

28
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.790
And yeah let's look at it from the front and make sure it is lined up.

29
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.110
So it looks like it's slightly off center at the moment and we can just be precise with it at the moment

30
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.240
and move it on the x axis across.

31
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.690
And that looks good enough that's that that's the key here does need to just look good enough.

32
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.760
It doesn't need to be precise.

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.230
We aren't engineering this.

34
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.910
If it was an engineering thing that we were doing then yes we'd have to work a bit closer.

35
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.990
So the next thing that I need to do is add this u v sphere and I'm going to make a little indent for

36
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.970
this bulb to sit in as well.

37
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.170
So I'm going to create it where the bulb is at the moment by going shift and s cursor to selected and

38
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.960
then adding in AUV sphere.

39
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.880
Now that you V3 is obviously going to be massive.

40
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.260
I'm going to hop into edit mode so I don't have to apply any transforms Skelley down to point one.

41
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.100
Yeah that looks good for the moment and rotates it on its x axis.

42
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.060
Oh no it looks like it's going to be it's why it's global.

43
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.780
There we go.

44
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.000
So you do have to watch out for that Global X axis by 90.

45
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.150
And now I can cut some rings out to make the shape I want.

46
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.520
So let's move this back slightly and the global y axis.

47
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.960
There we go to round there.

48
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.440
Now we can scale up to fit the whole and let's see.

49
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.590
Yes it also fits in here quite well.

50
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.590
So that is looking good.

51
00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.700
Now at this point it might be a good idea to align everything so that the lamp the ball joint or the

52
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.230
upper arm the ball joint the bulb and this lamp head itself are all in line with one another.

53
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.400
That's something that would make this whole process a lot easier.

54
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.710
We know the rule at 45 degrees it's not too difficult to go ahead and do that.

55
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.810
So I'm going to come out of edit mode on r u v sphere.

56
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.570
I'm going to set that a shade smooth as well and let's go ahead and reveal our armature.

57
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.700
We don't actually have our bone in place yet so I'm going to put my bone in place and then move it up

58
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.260
and set that as a working rest pose for the moment.

59
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.710
So let's go ahead grab our armature grab this bone points here look at it exactly from the side and

60
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.100
extrude out.

61
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.140
Now I'm only going to extrude it on the bones.

62
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.050
Local y axis I think yeah.

63
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.150
Why.

64
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.510
Here we go.

65
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.580
Perfect.

66
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.570
Now I need to do some parenting.

67
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:05.840
So I'm going to parent the lampshade the ball joints and the bulb all to this bone.

68
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.220
So we go control open select that last.

69
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.910
There we go.

70
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.510
Control pay parent to the bone.

71
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.560
And now hopefully what we can do is impose mode.

72
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.180
Grab this.

73
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.340
Rotate it round.

74
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.190
Excellent.

75
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.050
And we can have everything in line.

76
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.770
So let's look at it from the side rotates by 45.

77
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.430
Perfect.

78
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.450
So now everything is in a line it's going to make modelling a lot lot easier.

79
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.910
Of course when we come out back into object mode it will retain that sort of thing.

80
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.350
We need to set any rest poses for the moment.

81
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.790
If we go into edit mode on our sphere here it should also be in the right orientation.

82
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.650
Yes perfect.

83
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.410
Everything's nicely aligned.

84
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.840
Let's come into here and make ourselves the bulb itself the higher my armature again.

85
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.630
Did I say the bold.

86
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.450
We've already got that.

87
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.790
I mean the bulb holder so to speak.

88
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.150
So when I switched to wireframe mode so I can see what's going on underneath and see if I can select

89
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.460
yes I've managed to select the vertex that I want.

90
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:08.230
I'm just going to deletes that and come back out from wireframe mode Z key back into solid shading case

91
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.720
and now we can start thinking about these edge loops probably there and there but from I've selected

92
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.210
the wrong age loop.

93
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.730
There we go.

94
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.410
It's gonna delete those vertices as well so we get this nice hollow here.

95
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.530
Then I can grab this and extrude backwards and fill in that face and that'll give me something for this

96
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.380
to hold on to.

97
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.210
I can then inset and extrude outwards again into the bulb.

98
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.240
That's that's a tiny bit of detailing but it's going to make a big bit of difference in the bulb itself

99
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.160
is also shade Smooth.

100
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.410
Let's have a look at how that looks excellent.

101
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.780
So it's just a matter of adding material to this.

102
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.010
I'm going to use the same material the rest of the lamp is made from for the moment just to keep things

103
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.840
consistent.

104
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.650
So I'm going to go to a material slot and add lamps them to it's perfect.

105
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.230
Now this obviously reflects more of the world around it because it is a spherical object whereas these

106
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.870
themselves do not.

107
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.970
So it's worth while bearing in mind there's a bit of inconsistency there between one part of our model

108
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.790
and the other.

109
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.410
But then when we look at it in rendered mode it's not that different.

110
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.070
So I'm quite happy with the fact that this is just how the Look Dev is making this nice smooth rounded

111
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.470
surface look.

112
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:30.650
Finally I do want to make sure if we go back to our armature and go to pose mode and then start moving

113
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.680
around this ball joint then it looks natural when it intersects with this top part.

114
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.530
And I think that looks absolutely fine.

115
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.560
Yes it's a bit unrealistic.

116
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.380
If you were to focus on that but realism isn't my goal at this point and that is exactly what I wanted

117
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.020
to do.

118
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.630
I wanted to link together quite smoothly.

119
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.930
So there we go.

120
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.710
That's really awesome.

121
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.140
How did you guys get on.

122
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.610
Did you make a little lamp holder like I've done here.

123
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.250
I've got the bulb in place it didn't need to do anything extra there.

124
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.650
I think that's coming along really nicely.

125
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.110
Please share the work you've done over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
