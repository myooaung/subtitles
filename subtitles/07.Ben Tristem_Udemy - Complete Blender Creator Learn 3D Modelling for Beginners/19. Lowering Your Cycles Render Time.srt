00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,390
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,550
In this lecture we can specifically look at lowering your cycles render time.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,990
We're getting to the point now where I'm asking you to share your work and it would be great if you

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,680
weren't waiting for ages in order to render things out.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,800
So the first thing we need to do is make sure that we are using cycles.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,160
The second thing is is your CPSU or your GP quicker.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,900
I cannot tell you straight away because there's not necessarily a right answer.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,550
Couple of things that we can do in order to work for our is make sure that we're doing tests that are

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,910
appropriate.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,620
So for instance when I go ahead and press have 12 at the moment you may notice that I don't have lots

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,520
of little squares going round.

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:01,530
I have one big square going round and that's because I'm using one GP you in order to do my rendering

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,210
and you can see as it goes round it gives us a time in the top left.

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,530
The last one I did was 20 seconds this was probably going to be around the same time.

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:20,430
Okay brilliant 20 seconds but with cycles there are a couple of things that affect the actual outcome.

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:28,590
The first one is samples and I have seen people do samples at 3000.

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,440
And of course they are wondering why it took so long to do.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,950
Very rarely will you ever need to go that high.

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,920
I very rarely go over 500 even in complex scenes.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,190
There is a case in point that you need really high sample rates if you're doing volume metrics and things

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:53,820
like smoke if you want that to look realistic then you're probably going to have to render it out for

22
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,280
a very long time.

23
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:02,650
However for the general models that we're doing it's just not necessary and 128 is absolutely fine if

24
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,820
we scroll down a little bit further.

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:14,740
This is area code performance this is really important with a GP you your tile size is typically set

26
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:23,790
higher than it would be for a CPO I can demonstrate this really quickly at 5 12 and 5 12 for my particular

27
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,620
graphics card.

28
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,890
It takes about 20 seconds to render if I lower this down to 16 so I've highlighted them both types in

29
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,460
16 and then I go ahead and press F 12 to render.

30
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,430
Yes it looks like it's going very very quickly because it's got that small space but I can tell you

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,570
straightaway that this is going to take longer by the time it starts up and stops each little segment

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,490
that time it's taking is much longer so that switching time is too much of an overhead and this is how

33
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:02,830
you basically work out what it is for your seeing that you're currently doing is going to be quicker.

34
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:11,370
So having it set at 16 is obviously too slow and this is a relatively simple scene as well so it's not

35
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,870
going to have a big impact.

36
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,630
Okay.

37
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,480
So this took 31 seconds to do that.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,600
Okay I'm going to move into Slot 2 here and close down that render window and I'm going to change the

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,590
next big thing that changes things so let's set this back to 512.

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,820
Let's change the resolution.

41
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,070
So on the output tab let's set it to 50 percent of 10 ATP.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,910
So this is just standard high definition 50 percent.

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,600
If I go ahead and press render we can see that it's done much more quickly than all four times more

44
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,500
quickly.

45
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,550
How about that.

46
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,800
Will this four times less information.

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,960
So that's not that surprising.

48
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,150
Evey does not suffer the same thing though.

49
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,390
If we change the resolution of EUV it doesn't scale quite as well.

50
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:10,920
And I'm guessing here that if we set this to 200 percent of 10 ATP which would be a four K resolution

51
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,920
and press render is going to take a bit longer I expect it to take four times longer.

52
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,210
So instead of it taking around 20 seconds I'm expecting this one here to take four times that so around

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,960
80 seconds or a minute in 20.

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,650
Now it will not scale exactly but it is likely that that will be the case.

55
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay so there we go.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,240
It actually took a minute 30 in the end as I say this is not an exact science.

57
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,570
It would depend on what your computer's also doing at the same time and because before it was 10 ATP

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,250
and this is at 4 k they will be different size images.

59
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,720
Okay so say we did want to render something out of 4 k what else can we do to speed this up.

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,340
So our resolution sets we have to use that.

61
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,450
This is a false constraint if you were showing off or testing your work please just render it a lower

62
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,150
resolution and save yourself the time waiting.

63
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:17,230
Only worry about rendering things out a higher sample rates and higher resolutions when it comes to

64
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,560
near final work or just one render remember we're animating this.

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,600
So if it takes a minute for one frame in this case a minute and a half but let's say one minute for

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,480
easy calculation if it takes one minute for one frame and you're at 30 frames per second you're talking

67
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,550
about 30 minutes per second of render eek.

68
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,140
That's a long time to wait for your render to come out and obviously if we lower the resolution that

69
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,860
works.

70
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,330
So what else can we do.

71
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,020
What if we go back to our rendering options and set the samples back down lower.

72
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,450
But before we do that I'm going to go to the rendering tab.

73
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,330
There it is and change this to slot 3 so we can have a direct comparison because every time we change

74
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,840
one of these parameters it will affect the quality.

75
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:15,860
So I'm going to try and be a bit brave here I suppose we're going to lower the render down to 32 samples.

76
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,530
Let's see how that looks Okay brilliant.

77
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,420
We're down to 25 26 seconds.

78
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,400
That's a huge difference.

79
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,920
Let's see the quality difference between the two.

80
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:36,690
So it was slot so compared to slot 3 not compress the keys on my keyboard as well to change this slot

81
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,590
so Slot Three.

82
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,880
Now at first glance you may not see too much difference but if you look in the highlights it's a bit

83
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,090
more sparkly and around the back.

84
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,680
Here in the shadows this is where it definitely starts to impact anywhere where the shadows your lower

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
samples often end up grainy.

86
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,010
So we zoom in there and have a look.

87
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,680
We can see this is not as clean.

88
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,620
It's a much much cleaner image when we've got 120 samples but it's taken significantly longer three

89
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,930
times longer.

90
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,700
Let's see if the dinos feature sorts that's out.

91
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Well they the noise feature does is it adds a kind of a blur to the image which can get rid of detail

92
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,520
if you're not careful but it can also make things look much better at a lower cost.

93
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,820
So let's close that.

94
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:33,600
Well let's switch the slot for first close that down and this particular setting is hidden under the

95
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,190
view layer.

96
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,180
So we go to that we have to scroll down and we've got the noisy at the bottom.

97
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,020
We open the drop down we could see there's a load of options.

98
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,270
I'm just going to put a tick in the box for now and let's render that out.

99
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:54,330
Now what you will find is that as your rendering it then goes back over once it's got a group of four

100
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,610
and Dean noises and we can see here is the noise.

101
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:04,170
Two of our tiles three of our tiles so far and if we have a look we can already see this problematic

102
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,410
area doesn't look so bad anymore but it does look a bit more blurred so if we go back to slot three

103
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,490
we can see that it looked like this before.

104
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,870
And if we go to slot four it's much much smoother.

105
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:28,500
How ever saying that it is blurrier so perhaps we don't need to be so forceful with it.

106
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
That's the other thing that we can do here.

107
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,170
We don't have to have the setting quite as high.

108
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,920
So when it comes to rendering out anti noises it doesn't blur it quite as much.

109
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,100
But this is one way that you can speed up your renders and of course as you can see has added additional

110
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,270
time.

111
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:53,930
But the question is at a normal full screen distance can you tell the difference between this and slot

112
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:03,990
to well actually looking backwards and forwards slot 2 now looks not quite as good because it's been

113
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,910
blurred out with slot four.

114
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:14,310
So I would say that instead of waiting one minute 30 we can probably get away with this one only one

115
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,380
minute that saves us a huge chunk of our time over a third of our time.

116
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,410
And if you're talking about hours say this is a 10 hour render you've just saved yourself over three

117
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,200
hours.

118
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,830
Big big difference there now this is with the GPO.

119
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,370
Your CPSU favors smaller titles.

120
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,580
So we've played around for a bit there.

121
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,840
And what I'd advise that you go and do when it comes to a particular scene especially if you're animating

122
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,910
it is when your rendering you try different settings.

123
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:56,190
So if we come here to our cycles rendering engine with GP you compute we want these tiles to be quite

124
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,260
large.

125
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:06,640
However when it comes to the CPO and the video might get a bit jerky here if I start taxing my CPA but

126
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,270
generally you'll want this a lot lower and you'll see because I've got those four calls and eight threads

127
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,880
that we talked about earlier on when we were talking about setting up cycles.

128
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,630
If I set this around 16 I believe that's right for my processor and render out.

129
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,220
You'll see that you end up with eight blocks whizzing around and they're also de noisy.

130
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,730
Now the interesting thing in here is you can compare directly between one type of system and another

131
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:43,270
and we can see here as these are whizzing round at their optimal size it estimates that this renders

132
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,630
going to take over three minutes and doing some sort of rough calculation here as it comes to the areas

133
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,100
where there is no model it's going to go much much quicker.

134
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,020
But because it's taking over three minutes you can see why I was mentioning in the previous lecture

135
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:08,860
that combining the GPO and CPA on my particular system isn't ideal because the GPA requires much larger

136
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,960
sizes.

137
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,530
The CPA requires much smaller putting them together.

138
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,430
It really doesn't make much sense.

139
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,550
However if your system was a bit more balanced in that regard where perhaps you didn't have quite as

140
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:29,880
powerful graphics card or you had a more powerful CPO then you could put the two together.

141
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:36,640
And of course as we'll discover later on when it comes to rendering on multiple machines or with multiple

142
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:45,070
instances a blender because it looks like my CPSU is roughly one third of the speed my GP can be when

143
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:51,790
it comes to rounding out all these different frames we can give my GP to two thirds of the frames to

144
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,370
render and the CPSU to render the other.

145
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,040
Now this type of rendering does puts a lot of pressure on your system.

146
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,490
So it's really really important that you make sure that your system has adequate cooling so if you're

147
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:14,170
working on a bed or a soft furnished area the moment on a laptop potentially blocking some of the vents

148
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,810
do be careful because it may overheat.

149
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,350
Of course different computers act differently when you put them under stress but this is one of the

150
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,310
most stressful things you can in fact puts a computer through.

151
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,680
And if you think about Disney Pixar when they're rendering out some of their individual frames for their

152
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,910
movies take several hours to render not just the whole animation but one single frame and that's not

153
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:48,370
using our lowly equipment that's using very very high end equipment so whilst it's quite mesmerizing

154
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:55,210
watching these little squares go round and complete a four K render that's it for me in this section

155
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,690
please do render out your models as you progress.

156
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:08,800
I hope these tips have helped you out remember your tyre size for you ideally smaller try 8 16 and 32

157
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:16,270
with a graphics card it's typically larger starts around 128 if you've got an older graphics card and

158
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:22,810
if you've got a relatively modern one you can pretty much go up to 512 but again if you go to large

159
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:30,640
it will slow back down again you can find your own graphics cards niche by just practising and trying

160
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:37,960
different settings out and then we go that took four minutes to do vs. one minute to do so we can allocate

161
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:46,960
the CPO one quarter of the workload if we were using it for rendering out multiple renders and that's

162
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,650
it for this lecture I'll see you in the next one.
