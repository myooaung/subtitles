00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.870
Welcome to a file structure and naming in this video.

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.070
You'll understand that there is no one way of setting up your filing system.

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.790
That's certainly true and it will often depend on the project itself.

4
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.260
Now if you have a personal style of filing and you don't like mine use yours.

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.890
That's absolutely fine.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.030
And of course remember to talk with your team.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.640
You will form guidelines based from your own needs and experience moving forward.

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.430
Now there is some rigidity in a team environment.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.220
You will have guidelines so you can discuss with colleagues what you actually need for the particular

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.400
project you're working on.

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.510
It can change from project to project as some software might expect certain things to be stored and

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.080
named in a certain way.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.190
So if you got those constraints it's best set up from the very start to match what other software might

14
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.870
be expecting.

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.980
Now moving on to naming.

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.870
Very important in a team or review just working yourself with a large project is very critical that

17
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.310
you can find your assets.

18
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.610
Materials textures are whatever you've been creating.

19
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.930
So naming files well will help you and others find them and know what they are by just reading the name.

20
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.060
There are some naming conventions that we will use in this section and will get to those when we need

21
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.800
to.

22
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.370
So int in app blender itself in the actual program not the file system.

23
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.960
We're going to be making a much more complex scenes than we've previously made.

24
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.630
Organize it as you go not afterwards when it's complete mess.

25
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.360
Organize it as you go so it never becomes a complete mess and use descriptive names.

26
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.040
Q And Kubes 0 0 1 etc. is not helpful to anyone especially not yourself.

27
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.230
It's really easy to get in a pickle when you're focussed on the modelling.

28
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.240
You look over at your outliner and you just hang your head in shame and despair because there's no way

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.700
you can work out what anything is anymore.

30
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.100
So lets us have a quick look how I've got my system set up.

31
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:17.120
So I am of course on a Mac here and I have my home directory Michael bridges and within that itself

32
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.970
I have a folder called repo's.

33
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.550
Now the reason why I have a folder called repose is that's where the repository is going to be so we

34
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.130
can actually start using sorcery.

35
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.590
Got it all set up now but there's no point in what we can't do anything in it yet until we have made

36
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.240
our file system.

37
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.370
So let's go ahead and as you can see here in the repo's I've got the various sections of the course

38
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.010
because I use the VCR s to manage the actual lectures themselves and mine will end up looking slightly

39
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.830
different from yours as we hop in and out of source tree.

40
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.320
But don't worry about that.

41
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.450
In fact everybody's going to look completely different depending on how you set things up.

42
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.280
So if I go into the game asset PAC now we can see I've got a read me far in there that's just a description

43
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.700
the DOT m.d. means mark down it could just as easily be a text file and I've created two folders here

44
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.460
an example one sound for instance if you will working by adding sound into your scene as well.

45
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.180
But the main one here for us is an assets folder and inside there I've got meshes and textures those

46
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.720
are the two main ones that we're going to need to move forward and I've created a just a short cut here

47
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.810
and we'll go into more details of what all those hieroglyphics there mean in terms of the texture naming

48
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.510
conventions and then the meshes themselves what that is going to mean as well.

49
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.000
So there's lots of things that you can do in terms of filing.

50
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.790
You could store all of your stuff in one particular folder for one particular model and group everything

51
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.690
by that particular model itself.

52
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.490
I am going to go for a more of a flatter approach.

53
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.410
I would recommend not going more than three levels deep because then it becomes a bit unwieldy.

54
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.390
And if you've got to go three level just for one item that's going to be time consuming.

55
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.550
And again if you've named your files appropriately You should also be able to use your built in search

56
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.250
function in order to find items especially once it gets a much much busier in our file system.

57
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.760
It's Challenge time.

58
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.330
I'd like you to set up your working Directorate.

59
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.410
So place your reference material that you've gathered here create your necessary folders that you require.

60
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.130
Remember there isn't a right way of doing this.

61
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.550
And of course be prepared to reorganize later.

62
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.530
If you find it isn't quite working out.

63
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.140
Just bear in mind when you start moving things you break links.

64
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.610
So is important that we don't break too many links.

65
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.820
If you need to reorganize later.

66
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.690
I'd love to see how you guys have set up your working Directorate.

67
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.800
Are you going for a similar method of I am or have you got for a completely different method.

68
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.130
Please share your work in the discussions.

69
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.730
This will be the end of this lecture and what can I ask you to pause and go away.

70
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.680
Just go ahead and go do that and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
