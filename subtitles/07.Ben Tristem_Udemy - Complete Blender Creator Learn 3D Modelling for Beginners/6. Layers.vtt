00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.020
Welcome to Lakers.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.750
In this video you will know how to turn layers on and off.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.300
Turn on the lay a management tool.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.830
Understand layers are useful for working on separate parts of a scene or even model.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.070
Realize if a layer is off the final render will not contain anything that was on that layer.

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.990
So let's go have some fun with layers over in blender.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.150
Okay so now we're over in blender.

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.710
Take a look at the 3D Ed had a tall bar so down here we have 20 squares.

9
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.520
How cool is that.

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.780
That will actually turn on and off certain layers.

11
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.720
And if he use the number keys across the top of the keyboard providing you don't have no pad emulation

12
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.540
turned on.

13
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.260
You'll also notice if we if He glanced down at the bottom of the screen here when you press one that

14
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.470
is on there one two three four five etc. etc. and it goes all the way to zero.

15
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.860
Now if we want to play something on a particular player we simply select that layer and let's just add.

16
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.480
I don't know a Taurus so that we've got a doughnut floating in the sky on Layer 3.

17
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.120
You can also see it has a little orange blob on it when it's got a mesh object on it.

18
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.540
So if I add I don't know a plane here and just scale that up.

19
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.740
And we've got two separate layers now.

20
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.510
Layer 1 and 3.

21
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.990
Now that one makes sense so if we so went over to lay a three and selected object we can move it to

22
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.500
another layer so you can move any object to another layer simply by going to object.

23
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.000
And at the top of this drop down or drop up in this case we have moved the layer and we can see the

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.110
short cut keys.

25
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.280
And that is it when you're an object mode.

26
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.150
So when we click on that we get the same thing that we can see down the bottom here so when we press

27
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.030
em moved to layer and I'm going to move that to Layer 2.

28
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.700
There we go.

29
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.870
If we click on there too we shall see our doughnuts again.

30
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.000
Brilliant.

31
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.660
Now if you want more than one player turned on at once you simply hold down Shift as you click on those

32
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.570
layers.

33
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.530
You can also just drag across the layers and it will also enable all disable those particular layers.

34
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.620
Now just to demonstrate.

35
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.900
If I select Layer 3 and go and render the image it renders absolutely nothing.

36
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.550
If I hop back to the 3D view and turn on our Taurus and render that we end up with the Taurus in the

37
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.930
scene.

38
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.070
But no ground plane.

39
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.520
But if I have both turned on.

40
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.460
And go to render render image.

41
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.820
It will render both of them so is very important that what you want to appear in your final render or

42
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.340
animation the layers are actually turned on.

43
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.420
Now that has a great benefit of course that things that were working on or other other bits and bobs

44
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.600
that are used to create our scene can be shelved to a different layer.

45
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.530
That's not going to be visible all of the time with the main scene.

46
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.590
So one final thing I would be really nice to name these layers and we can do that with the layer management

47
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.330
tool which is not on by default so apology's we're going to go back.

48
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.800
I forgot about this add on.

49
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.400
We need to go back to file and go to the user preferences and turn on one called Layer management is

50
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.740
actually quite high up the list class under the 3D view.

51
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.120
Layer management.

52
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.660
If I put a tick in that box it's an I'm going to save my user settings.

53
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.210
It's gonna be in the tool shelf.

54
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.970
It used to exist over in the properties panel but it doesn't any more it lives in the talk shop.

55
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.130
I'm going to bring this tool shelf out so it takes up a third of my screen and further down.

56
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.350
We've got the layers tab and we have to drop down layer management.

57
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.250
And labour groups and obviously labour groups is how you group players together.

58
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.070
Okay so on here we've got layer's 0 0 1 out we can call that one the for the moment I'm going to call

59
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.310
it plain and I'm going to call this one.

60
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.300
Doughnuts.

61
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.310
Why not.

62
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.360
So we've got plain and doughnuts.

63
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.800
Now we can lock the layers over on the left here we've got a couple of options.

64
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.760
This padlock you'd think would lock the.

65
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.040
But it doesn't what it does is it prevents you selecting the objects on that layer so it locks the objects

66
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.080
on that layer.

67
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.190
And we can see that the symbol the little arrow symbol here has gone greyed out.

68
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:48.760
And if you cast your eyes over to the outliner it's also made them unselect Tibble over here to every

69
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.380
click vose off we see they all come back again.

70
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.810
You can also do a bit of moving if you want to move things between layers in here.

71
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.030
So with the Taurus selected we can click on this little dots here on the plane one.

72
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.180
And it all actually move the Taurus to the plane.

73
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.100
Now it's not obvious that it's happened until you actually turn off the first layer and you see all

74
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.670
the Tauruses disappeared.

75
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.990
So is the Taurus still selected.

76
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.720
We can click this next one down.

77
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.290
And there we go.

78
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.490
It's gone orange.

79
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.070
And that simply shows you when you've got an object selected this little orange blob shows you which

80
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.130
layer that active object is on.

81
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.930
So we can see down here the orange blob.

82
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.890
And here in the lay a management tool that's we've got the plane selected and therefore it's the orange

83
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.830
blob in the first layer because that's where the plane lives.

84
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:48.220
If we right click on Taurus here or a doughnut we get the second orange if we select the lamp in our

85
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.410
scene will that exists as an object on the first there.

86
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.570
That's a good a good way.

87
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.570
When you've got lots of things displayed simply eyeballing which layer it's actually on.

88
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.150
So a couple of ideas for you with lasers you could put all your lighting on a certain layer.

89
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.250
You could put all of certain things so in this instance I think we're going to have a rabbit on one

90
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.530
layer.

91
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.630
We're going to have grass on another layer and a tree on another.

92
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:20.950
And perhaps if you guys decide to make your scene a little more involved a little more detailed then

93
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.350
you can use multiple layers in order to do that.

94
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.540
Okay guys it's challenge time.

95
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.180
I'd like you to set up three layers.

96
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.500
Now named the layers.

97
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.930
Rabbit grass and tree respectively.

98
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.940
And put some place holders on each layer representing the rabbits the grass and tree.

99
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.880
Just use some primitives for the moment.

100
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.970
Don't go overboard.

101
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.530
These are just place holders so that I know that you understand how the legs are working.

102
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.620
So then try switching between the layers and finally leaving all three on.

103
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.610
So balls are video now and give that a go.

104
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.750
Okay guys.

105
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.900
Welcome back.

106
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.050
Let's get three layers named rabbit grass and tree set up and the couple a place holders set on them

107
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.670
so straight back over into blender.

108
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.580
Well I don't like a doughnut some.

109
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.970
I get rid of that.

110
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.970
OK.

111
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.580
Now the doughnuts has gone.

112
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.670
Let's name our first layer rabbits.

113
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.680
Oh.

114
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.780
I have not spelt rabbit correctly that's a great start.

115
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:34.290
And then we've got grass and then the final air here will be tree.

116
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.810
And we may need more layers later depending on what we get up to but for the moment those three are

117
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.710
great.

118
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.270
So let's all are rabbits.

119
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.670
So we've got the first layer here.

120
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.680
Well I'm actually going to do a camera and lighting.

121
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.540
I'm going to pop that on lighting.

122
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.000
They will get a pop.

123
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.900
My camera.

124
00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.840
I'm going to click on my camera over here and I'm going to move it to the fourth layer.

125
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.630
There are also select the lamp and move that to the fourth layer.

126
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.730
So that's those items moved off of Layer 1 and then we need.

127
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:19.130
So we've got this ground plane here and we'll call it grass for the moment so we can set that up there.

128
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.570
And we want that on the grass plain.

129
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:26.010
So with that selected you can click this little circle here Rabbit.

130
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.540
Okay.

131
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.110
So turn everything else off.

132
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.810
Are rabbits to begin with.

133
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.390
Well we just put a cube in the scene to represent the rabbits.

134
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.260
Okay.

135
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.860
And finally free world trees kind of cylindrical.

136
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.750
So we will make a cylinder.

137
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.970
Now how about a cone it can be a Christmas tree.

138
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.820
How about that.

139
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.750
Okay so let's just undo that I want it moved.

140
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.710
In the Z axis by just one.

141
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.330
There again.

142
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.580
And let's place that over here.

143
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.720
Let's go and just test the render see how that looks.

144
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.910
I think the camera is facing in a completely separate direction.

145
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.990
Let's turn on all of the layers so we can see what's going on.

146
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.540
In fact the camera's looking that way so I'll move it over.

147
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.240
So that's render that image see what it looks like we've got our rabbit and tree behind it that looks

148
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.990
great.

149
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.290
And we've got all of our layers enabled.

150
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.710
So let's go back to the 3-d view.

151
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.830
Spin round here we've got all of our legs enabled.

152
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.770
Let's just play turning them off so we can work on the grass.

153
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.550
We can work on the rabbits we can work on the lighting if we wanted to do that and we can work on the

154
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.050
tree.

155
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.540
Brilliant.

156
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.550
So we've got all of those things that are going to turn them all back on and that's brilliant.

157
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.260
How did you guys get on.

158
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.780
Did you manage to set up your scene with all of the various components.

159
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:52.440
If you've got any extra ideas about how you're going to use layers please share them in the discussions

160
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.420
and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
