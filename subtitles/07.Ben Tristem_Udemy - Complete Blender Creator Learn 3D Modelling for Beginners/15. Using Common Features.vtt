00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.320
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we're going to have a look at the common features
1

2
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.190
that's our pawn and bishop share and see which ones we can use to accelerate our workflow so we don't
2

3
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.450
end up modelling the same thing over and over.
3

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.970
First of all let's go ahead and turn back our image.
4

5
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.990
I'm going to hide away the pawn for the moment and then go going to set my 3D cursor to the center
5

6
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.000
of the scene I'm going to shift an S cursor to world origin so to set it at 0 0 0.
6

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.030
I could have done that as well down here could have changed the 3D cursor location over in the properties panel
7

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.910
to 0 0 0 as well.
8

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.550
Now that we've got it set there and before I do anything else I'm going to go file save as and I'm going
9

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.050
to call this bishop because I'm going to start to change the pawn file away from how I originally wanted
10

11
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.020
to use it.
11

12
00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:02.660
Then I'm going to go to file import images as planes you could also go shift and A, image, image as planes
12

13
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.480
and let's go find our bishop.
13

14
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.580
So we're gonna go to our reference material and whilst we're in here we can change the view type itself.
14

15
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.160
At the top just on this header by here where we've got the view we can go along and change it so we can
15

16
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.270
see the thumbnails.
16

17
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.000
Now this is really useful if you've got several images that the name doesn't really give a great idea
17

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.990
as to what it might be.
18

19
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.430
So if you've got Brick  0 0 1 in Brick 0 0 2 and brick 0 0 3 Sometimes it's good to actually see what
19

20
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.370
you're looking at rather than just guessing by the name.
20

21
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.190
So we can see there are several similarities all the way up the neck piece to this top area here and
21

22
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.660
that's true of the King.
22

23
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.170
The bishop has a bit more ornate at the top.
23

24
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.540
I'd argue that the rook is completely different and the queen again follows the standard look.
24

25
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.630
So we have a look at the queen, the bishop, the king and the pawn they all share more features other than
25

26
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.840
just the base that we picked out earlier.
26

27
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.660
It's going to load in my bishop image and it's going to come in massive of course.
27

28
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.520
There we go.
28

29
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.920
Want to switch over to lookdev mode so we can see it rotates around on the Z axis by 90 and then on
29

30
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.450
the Y axis as well so rotate Y 90.
30

31
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.020
There we go.
31

32
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.220
And then I'm going to scale that down by I think it's about a factor of 10 to large.
32

33
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.330
And look at it from the right and then come down how could we look at it from the front.
33

34
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.560
But that's the orientation my pawn is currently and so on to go G Z and lift it up.
34

35
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.670
Now if you remember back to the sizes and shapes that we were talking about earlier the pawn itself
35

36
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.720
was three wide and this was going to be four wide.
36

37
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.660
So what we can do here is I can scroll up we can see it's four point seventy six over here and I will
37

38
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.480
not just be able to change that it will just stretch it one way.
38

39
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.340
But what we can do is hit the S key for scaling and we can go and hold down shift to move it slowly as
39

40
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.690
we get close and I can scale it down.
40

41
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.440
So it's approximately right.
41

42
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.960
And then just use the shift key to make it accurate.
42

43
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.980
We can also scale exactly against a real object in the scene in a real mesh object.
43

44
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.050
That is the right size but that's fine for the moment I'm going to apply that scale and let's just go
44

45
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:19.190
G Z and move it down to approximately the right location so there we go we got our image in the right
45

46
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.990
place.
46

47
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.030
And now if I just go G Y and just move over here for a moment we can see what they look like when they
47

48
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.470
are literally stacked next to each other.
48

49
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.430
So we can see here there are a lot of similarities.
49

50
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.820
We need to scale the pawn up obviously before we can actually use it but otherwise I think we can start
50

51
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.910
using this base model here.
51

52
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.170
Just add a few more details where it's necessary and we'll have our bishop and we can pretty much model
52

53
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.410
everything we need to apart from the notch or the hole in the bishop's hat which we can do later on
53

54
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.600
in a separate lecture and that leads us nicely onto our challenge.
54

55
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.740
Okay see your challenge.
55

56
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.390
Import the bishop reference image if you've not done already.
56

57
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.150
Make sure you working in a new blend file and adjust the pawn to fit the bishop itself.
57

58
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.770
Now don't attempt the notch in the hat just yets.
58

59
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.060
Well I say don't if you already have some blender experience how would you go ahead and make that notch.
59

60
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.030
Of course we'll do that bit in a bit and make sure you have named everything appropriately so make sure
60

61
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.230
your outliner has everything you'd expect to see in it but nothing more in your new blend file.
61

62
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.410
Pause video now and give that a go
62

63
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.780
Okay everybody, Welcome back.
63

64
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.090
Let's hop on over into blender and stretch out our pawn to make our bishop.
64

65
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.490
OK.
65

66
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.990
So obviously here I already have everything in the right place.
66

67
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.680
I'm going to get rid of my pawn reference image.
67

68
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.610
There we go.
68

69
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.620
I'm going to select this and move it into the appropriate place which is where Y equals zero.
69

70
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.960
I'm going to also rename this from pawn to Bishop so B.I.S.H.O.P.
70

71
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.770
There we go.
71

72
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:07.460
I think I've got everything sorted that I'm going to change my display as from display as textured to
72

73
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.040
wire so I can see through my model as I'm stretching it.
73

74
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.930
Now the first thing I need to do is probably adjust this image a little bit.
74

75
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.180
I'm not sure if it comes all the way down to the base.
75

76
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.580
I'm just going to lower it down so I get roughly the right height.
76

77
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.050
Now selecting the mesh object again we need to scale it now.
77

78
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.580
I could just go scale and hold down shift and move it out to approximately four centimeters like so
78

79
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.880
I could also scale it by one point three three.
79

80
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.360
That gets it into the right location almost the right location.
80

81
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.870
I'm going to make that exactly four and four here.
81

82
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.320
So we squish that.
82

83
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.320
Now can I just scale it on the Z and get it to fit.
83

84
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.870
Well you know what.
84

85
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.760
Almost.
85

86
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.670
But what I'm going to do instead is I'm going to do a tiny bit of work here because this circle on top
86

87
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.140
of the sphere sorry on top is pretty much what we want it to be.
87

88
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.960
All I need to do here is separate this top bit of geometry from the bottom bit.
88

89
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.030
So if I go ahead and go into edit mode making sure I have the right objects selected we can go ahead
89

90
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.550
and chop this off right here.
90

91
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.870
So I'm going to hold down alt and select the edge loop and just delete it for the moment.
91

92
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.660
Now that leave us with disconnected geometry.
92

93
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.770
You'll be loose from one another but that does give us now the ability.
93

94
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.740
I'm going to switch back into lookdev mode of lifting this area up here to press the L key to select
94

95
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:38.180
all of the linked mesh data i'm going to go G Z and lift it up to approximately the middle and then just stretch
95

96
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:46.820
it out only on the Z axis to get that kind of shape that I wanted before but no more.
96

97
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.580
And of course I'm gonna have to tweak some of these because it is an overall different shape.
97

98
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.970
Okay now we've got that there.
98

99
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.370
I'm also need to do the same with some of this bottom areas here.
99

100
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.790
Because I'm in wireframe I should be able to box select areas and move them around.
100

101
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.150
But you see here we're not selecting everything behind.
101

102
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.210
That's something that can easily catch you out if you're not careful.
102

103
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.120
Even though this looks like it's in wireframe mode we've discussed this before and I will probably discuss
103

104
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.040
it in more detail later as well.
104

105
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.400
But if we go Z and switch everything over into wireframe then we can select everything through our model
105

106
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.790
when we highlight it like that again, Okay then switch our view back round to lookdev
106

107
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.420
So we can see what we're working on under the press G here and Z and lift it up to approximately the
107

108
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.690
right location and then it's just a matter of scaling some of these to be accurate.
108

109
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.940
It's not important to get it 100 percent correct.
109

110
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.680
I'm going to select both of these edge loops.
110

111
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.230
Now should have held down shift to begin with and then bridge them.
111

112
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:52.600
So I'm going to search for bridging edge loops with F3 and I type in bridge because it's a keyword
112

113
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.160
there.
113

114
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:59.480
And then I'm going to add some loop cuts and scale in accordingly and out where's necessary.
114

115
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.270
Now this doesn't look like it's.
115

116
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:07.660
It looks like it's centered in most of the places but in others especially at the top here it doesn't
116

117
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:13.630
seem to be quite the shape that I was hoping that it would be because I'm going to tweak these.
117

118
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.850
So it's right for me.
118

119
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:23.130
Let's come back round this one here can come all the way in and then we've got this one on the top.
119

120
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.640
Now this is going to be very similar to how we made the ball originally so I'm going to delete that
120

121
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:35.200
vertex on the top put the 3D cursor roughly in the right place and let's make sure it is in the right
121

122
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:42.040
place with X and Y both being zero and I'm going to add in a UV sphere and it's going to have to be
122

123
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.670
tiny isn't it.
123

124
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.850
So the radius here I'm going to go for one centimeter to begin with and it's going to have to be eight
124

125
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.210
segments to match the piece.
125

126
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.240
And I'm just gonna go for four this time round and move it up first.
126

127
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.860
I'm going to grab that bottom vertex and delete it.
127

128
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.340
There we go.
128

129
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.820
So we've got almost everything I need.
129

130
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.100
They're going to grab this area here and scale it in even further and lift it up.
130

131
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.150
And now I'm starting to I'm conscious that I'm starting to tweak and tried to get things almost perfect
131

132
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.390
and that is something you need to watch out for yourself.
132

133
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:22.180
It's very easy to fall into the trap of starting to work on something and before you know it you've
133

134
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.770
spent hours on something that you didn't need to.
134

135
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:32.800
So don't try and get things perfect just get them to the right level that you need to scale that in
135

136
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.810
ever so slightly select the next edge loop up and then bridge them once more.
136

137
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.820
So I'm happy with the overall shape at the top there that we've got these extra bits here.
137

138
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:49.230
So I'm going to add in a loop cuts and scale out now I'm not sure whether I'm going to do anything extra
138

139
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.700
just here.
139

140
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:56.070
I might grab this face loop running round and scale it in, give the hat a bit more prominence.
140

141
00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.860
Let's go into solid shading with the Z key and just see how it's looking.
141

142
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.510
Yeah I like that.
142

143
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.980
I just want to tweak the base because I know it doesn't follow the reference material very well at the
143

144
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.340
moment.
144

145
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.030
So let's go back down to here and we can grab this area.
145

146
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.400
Here we go.
146

147
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:20.490
G and Z shows you just the difference in selecting whether you're selecting edges faces or vertices
147

148
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.070
if we're selecting faces and I did that selection I select too much.
148

149
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.910
So the switch over to vertex select and select the area that I wanted and I'm also just going to whizz
149

150
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.120
round here and show you what happens.
150

151
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.940
So here is a mistake that you will easily fall into if you're not careful because we weren't in wireframe
151

152
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.660
mode.
152

153
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.780
I didn't select the area behind everything else at the top is okay.
153

154
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.910
Because we were creating it as we go.
154

155
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.580
But now I'm selecting a moving.
155

156
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:53.610
This is what happens if you don't select all of your model at once when you're trying to manipulate
156

157
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:53.700
it.
157

158
00:10:53.730 --> 00:11:02.340
So we will obviously undo that focused on selecting switch over to wireframe and then select the area
158

159
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.490
that we want to move.
159

160
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.150
Make sure it's selected if you're unsure.
160

161
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.180
Hop back in to lookdev mode, whizz round and I'm just going to move that back up again and scale it inwards.
161

162
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.700
Okay I'm happy with the overall look of that I think my bishop is coming along really nicely.
162

163
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:25.490
Let's go back into solid shade so we can just see, oh it's not solid shade is it switching between things
163

164
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.930
and I can't remember, So switch that over to texture mode and that looks pretty decent.
164

165
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.940
Awesome.
165

166
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.090
I'm going to make sure I save my work.
166

167
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:38.780
Going to come out into object mode and just hide my reference material.
167

168
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.640
Awesome.
168

169
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.520
And there we go.
169

170
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.800
The bishop is all done.
170

171
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.160
Perfect right.
171

172
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.240
How did you get on.
172

173
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:50.420
Did you use as much of the pawn as I did or did you delete more of the pawn and just build it up from
173

174
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:50.900
there.
174

175
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.080
Now with this very simple object it's almost as quick to do it either way in which case there's no problem.
175

176
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:03.560
But with more complex models being able to recognize repeated features and parts that you can use over
176

177
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.830
and over again will save you countless hours in the future so do watch out for them if you can reuse
177

178
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.240
something.
178

179
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.520
It's not cheating it's just efficient and good workflow.
179

180
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.530
So there we go.
180

181
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.240
That's my bishop.
181

182
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.860
Done.
182

183
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.300
Looking forward to seeing yours please share them over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the
183

184
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:20.960
next lecture.
