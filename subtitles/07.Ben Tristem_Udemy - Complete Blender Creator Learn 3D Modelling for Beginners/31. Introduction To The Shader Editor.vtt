00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.600
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.120
In this case you're going to have a look at the shader Ed.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.100
Now this may look familiar.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.320
If you have a look over at the materials tab this is exactly the same as what we've been playing with

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.310
before.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.490
However this time round we're going to have far more control over what is actually going on.

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.210
As you can see there are all these dots on the side.

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.220
There aren't those here.

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.830
That's just a series of values.

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.100
So what does that mean.

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.350
Well let's go find out more Hello everybody and welcome.

12
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.100
So in this lecture we're going to play with the shader Ed..

13
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.590
Now the shader it is very similar to our materials properties that we've had before.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.640
So let's go and explore that first and then we'll start setting up and playing with it as well.

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.730
Some of the switch over into object mode and select one of my objects that has a material applied to

16
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.480
it.

17
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.220
Now at the very top we've got a series of predefined layouts and one of them is shading.

18
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.100
If we click on that it will take us to a presets up shader setup.

19
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.940
And this is really really useful.

20
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.580
However I struggle with screen space when it comes to this and it doesn't have my little area down in

21
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.680
the bottom here to show you keystrokes all the time.

22
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.440
But we'll have a quick overview then we'll sort out this workspace and then we'll play with the nodes

23
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.590
themselves.

24
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.080
So in front of us here we've got some windows we've got our 3D Ed windows so we can see what's really

25
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.460
going on when we change our materials around.

26
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.310
We've got this image editor on the left hand side and a file explorer as well.

27
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.240
Now I want to alter this sets up so it's suitable for me but I don't want to have it overwrite what

28
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.250
we currently got at the top so I'm going to right click on the shading tab and duplicate it on a double

29
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.380
click at the top there and rename it full call it shading smaller for the moment because I'm going to

30
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.510
make a smaller workspace for me to handle and then I'm gonna go ahead down to one of the corners of

31
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.270
these windows and start making the area smaller.

32
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.070
I don't want the file explorer.

33
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.890
I don't want the movie editor at the moment and also these are really the wrong way around our particular

34
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.300
model that we're working on is very vertical.

35
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.940
So let's play with our workspace a little further I'm going to make the shader Ed disappear completely

36
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.790
and then drag in from the side.

37
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.480
And here we go.

38
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.340
Our lamp is a vertical object that's about right it fills up a good portion of my screen.

39
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.870
And this area here that's currently got the lamp in it's what we can do there is go up to the editor

40
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.900
type and switch it to the shader editor.

41
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.300
And here we go we're back there.

42
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.110
Now I want a bit more space I'm not going to play with the properties panel for the moment so I'll press

43
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.760
the Anki and make that disappear and zoom in a little more brilliant.

44
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.330
That's a much better workspace to work with.

45
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.230
And don't be afraid of doing this yourself.

46
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.920
Being able to make the workspace comfortable for you is very very important.

47
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.320
There is one final thing I need to do one of the things that I want to do here is make this area on

48
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.030
the side suitable for keystrokes.

49
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.420
So I'm just gonna come in.

50
00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.520
Change the edit to type text editor and hide the header.

51
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.210
Okay perfect.

52
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.830
So that's how I need it set up for me of course you don't need a little text editor in the bottom but

53
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.460
that's the important thing being able to manipulate your environment to work for you.

54
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.100
Let's have a look at the materials properties as we have been playing with them you'll see here that

55
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.890
many things match one another at the top here we've got a little checkbox on Joy eye to it because if

56
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.980
for some reason use nodes doesn't have a tick in it you won't be able to actually see anything happen.

57
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.940
We are going to use nodes to control our material you'll notice the next thing along is slot 1 in our

58
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.810
material at the moment we only have one material defined so there is only one slot occupied and we have

59
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.570
lamp paint which is the name here if we go at the top here we can put lamp and paint together you can

60
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.180
see updates and if we updated over here of course updates back over there as well and we can see there

61
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.700
are two users and that we can see down here as well there are two users the lamp shade and the lamp

62
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.290
base of this material which is great it means if we change one of the properties of this material it

63
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.200
affects everything that that material is applied.

64
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.770
Now let's have a look at the nodes themselves.

65
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.090
So we have this big one here.

66
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.810
The principle would be SDF.

67
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.170
This is a node that's a shader No.

68
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.610
There are a few other shader nodes you may want to pick and it's not always cut and dry which one you

69
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.880
might want to use since the principal BSD f shader has come out it's been incredibly useful it's enabled

70
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.720
us to make physically accurate materials.

71
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.940
However sometimes that's not actually what we want.

72
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.250
So it's important to realize that you can use other nodes as well and in some cases noticed down at

73
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.270
the bottom here we've got a mission that means it's going to emit something.

74
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.140
So this is very useful for our light bulb as we'll see in the future lecture coming up.

75
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.180
This is not very controllable.

76
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.340
It's better to use an emission node so let's have a look at nodes themselves.

77
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.690
We can move these around at the moment they're both selected some in the press the A key twice to these

78
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.360
select and then we can place these where we want and later on it will become apparent as our materials

79
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.580
get more complex that organizing these and making sure they're laid out in a useful manner is very important.

80
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.620
Otherwise it's very much like coding you'll end up with a big spaghetti mess.

81
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.250
And often these things are joked about being spaghetti because you end up with lines like this one go

82
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.900
between these two green sockets absolutely everywhere sustaining organized is really really important.

83
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.550
Well let's zoom in here and have a look at what's going on.

84
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.970
So we've got an output here that's green and we've got an input that is also green we can drag that

85
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.330
out and notice that our material goes black.

86
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.180
And that's because nothing is controlling the surface properties of this material anymore.

87
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.350
If I plug that back in it'll go red again because that's what we've got this set up to do.

88
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.920
In general you will want to link together green sockets purple sockets together grey sockets and yellow

89
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.340
sockets.

90
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.120
That's not always the rule but it's a good one to start with.

91
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.870
Occasionally you will end up plugging grey sockets into yellow sockets or yellow sockets into grey sockets.

92
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.780
But in general the colors will match.

93
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.550
So let's go ahead and play with this a little and see why.

94
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.590
Why do we want to do this.

95
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.810
We've got a simple material anyway.

96
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.050
Well it's about control at the moment in order to change the base color we have to click into here and

97
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.920
start changing.

98
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.810
So if we wanted it green or blue we could do that.

99
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.600
However if we wanted a bit more control or wanted to apply a text to it later on.

100
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.740
So that something else is controlling the color.

101
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.820
We will have to add something further to the left in order to plug into this yellow socket.

102
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.430
And this yellow socket dictates a color it's three values red green and blue.

103
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.870
And if you've got an image or something like that with an alpha texture you would have to separate that

104
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.600
out separately.

105
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.950
So this has three values coming into it red green and blue the gray one underneath is literally just

106
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.140
the value between 0 and 1 is often the case.

107
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.410
So let's go ahead and plug something into the base color.

108
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:09.530
Let's go and add another node so we can go to the ad menu at the top or just like on the 3d ed. We can

109
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.420
go shift in a.

110
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.910
That will also work and we can add in what's called an RG G.B. node and we can see as we go down here

111
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.410
we've got lots of different options.

112
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:24.050
We've got different shader types like this green one here and in the challenge coming up I'm going to

113
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.210
tell you to explore that and see what you come up with.

114
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.030
We've got texture we've got color does that sound right.

115
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.270
Was close.

116
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.970
It's got something called mixology be in it where you would mix colors together.

117
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.990
So what do we need here.

118
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:42.620
Well aren't you being the type of impulse so we can go ahead and pull that in and it's an input because

119
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.380
look it takes nothing on the left hand side all of the sockets that are on the left hand side are inputs

120
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.510
all of the ones on the right hand side are outputs.

121
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.130
This one doesn't have anything on the left hand side.

122
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.550
So it's just outputting.

123
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.750
So it's a type of node that's a raw bits of information.

124
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.790
And if we grab by left clicking the yellow socket and plug it into the base color you'll notice that

125
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:10.900
now we've got a very quick and easy way of exploring colors for our lamp.

126
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.640
Now let's do a test here of plugging something else in.

127
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.500
Now say we wanted to keep the principal just there but try something else.

128
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.700
How can we do that.

129
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.790
Well if we click on this little dropdown it makes the principal be SDF much much smaller.

130
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.690
That's great.

131
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:32.940
Now let's go ahead and add in a different node types a shift in eight at I'm gonna go down to Shada

132
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:40.370
and this time I'm gonna add in just a few speed SDF there's a much more simple node as you can see here.

133
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:47.340
Now let's plug the color in here and the output to the surface outputs and then now it's diffused.

134
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.650
So it's got no reflection at all.

135
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.760
We can change the roughness here but that's not gonna make that much difference to something that's

136
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.220
already diffused.

137
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:01.530
Which means that as the light hits its it gets scattered so there's not going to be many or if any reflections

138
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.570
on the surface.

139
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.900
And then we rate the roughness 100 percent this is definitely not going to have any shiny reflections.

140
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.410
Now that's not the type of material that we are going for.

141
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:17.720
So perhaps if we delete that and add in a gloss CBS the F now latch sounds more like it.

142
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:24.010
Go ahead plug the yellow into the yellow the green into the surface outputs Hey look at that.

143
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.530
That's got a nice sheen to it.

144
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.800
It looks completely different from what we've been playing with so far.

145
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.680
And of course we can adjust the roughness here and change how it looks.

146
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.050
This gives us a completely different aesthetic.

147
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.210
It looks completely different if it reminds me on the inside here as I'm moving around much much like

148
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.230
some of the Christmas decorations I've got for some reason.

149
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.800
Anyway as you can see here there are lots of different options in order to create your material and

150
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.380
we're really at the tip of a very very big and powerful iceberg.

151
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.750
But we're not going to delve into too much detail right at this moment in time.

152
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.620
And it's time for your challenge.

153
00:09:59.330 --> 00:09:59.680
Okay.

154
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.220
Your challenge is the play with the materials in the node Ed..

155
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.690
This is really to just get you familiar with what's going on there we're gonna be playing with it a

156
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.790
little more in the next lecture and adding a bit more interest to our lamp.

157
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:17.680
But otherwise it's just a playground for you and I what I'd like you to do is create at least two different

158
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.560
materials.

159
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:24.790
Now remember that you can take your material and still store it there so that it's still applied to

160
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.300
your model.

161
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.040
That's that's absolutely fine.

162
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.820
But what I'd like to do is just explore and create two different materials.

163
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.880
Try some of the other options there and see what you come up with.

164
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.290
Remember that some of these nodes are more complex than others.

165
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:43.840
So for instance if you picked the glass shader you'd end up creating a wonderful glass type object but

166
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:49.360
it will take a lot more rendering time then a simple diffuse shader.

167
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.870
So go ahead create two different materials and experiment with those different shader nodes as well.

168
00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:01.030
Now remember you can have a material on the backdrop too and the little stage or the platform that we've

169
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.250
got that we're going to have the lamp jumped onto.

170
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:09.340
That's entirely up to you how you decide to layout your scene and assign those new materials to the

171
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.140
rest of your lamp.

172
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.110
If you haven't done that yet you may have just been following along and just have the material on the

173
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.690
base and haven't added any other metals yet.

174
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.980
This is a prime opportunity to do that supports the video and give that a go

175
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.570
Okay everybody Welcome back.

176
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:31.160
Let's go ahead now and add two different materials to our model using the note Ed Okay.

177
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.060
Everybody welcome back.

178
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.480
The materials I want to focus on here are not the lampshade.

179
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:41.400
I'm quite happy with what we had there before so I'm gonna revert my file back to where it was previously

180
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.730
which is very useful and I'm going to go and create my new shading workspace.

181
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.660
It's not gonna take me too long to do that.

182
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.030
There we go.

183
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.560
So we're back with the lamp paints here.

184
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.060
I am going to add in an RG be no.

185
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.530
There is this search function at the top.

186
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:02.190
I highly encourage you once you know the name of the thing you're looking for searching for it is gonna

187
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.510
be a lot quicker.

188
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.630
And of course later on you can start storing what you've made and that's going to make finding it much

189
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.200
much quicker.

190
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.820
Again you can actually store materials that you've made in a default blend file and that's incredibly

191
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.700
useful if they're materials that you find yourself making or using a lot of the time.

192
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:25.280
In fact a lot of the the material packs that you can buy online simply are someone who's done that they've

193
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:30.890
packaged everything together and premade them and just stored them in a file that you can apply any

194
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.890
points and you can do that yourself as well but I'm digressing.

195
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.080
I've got this set up again that read isn't quite right.

196
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.500
I think I'm gonna have to play with it.

197
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.720
There we go it's a bit more orange.

198
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.370
There we go.

199
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.730
So that's that's looking good there.

200
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.110
But the ones I really want to look at.

201
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.610
Are they the stem itself.

202
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:54.290
So the moment we've got this kind of set up here and I don't think the stem is perhaps dark enough or

203
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.960
whether I wanted this raw metal color I am going to hide my armature though it really is blocking the

204
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.360
rest of the model.

205
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.880
So let's have a look at some other options that we can do.

206
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:09.080
So I'm going to go ahead and inputs and RG B notes I can change things around when we get rid of the

207
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.710
principal B.S. the f the moment and just try some of the other options that we've got here.

208
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:19.010
So we'll go to shader there must be a shader at this point if you have played around with some of the

209
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:25.640
other options you will notice that they just don't work this output node or rather this input node will

210
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.680
only accept a shader output node.

211
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.580
It just won't work otherwise.

212
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.770
Let's go back to shader.

213
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:37.220
There are lots of things to pick from now and it's a true pick is something that looks really cool on

214
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.110
things that are metallic.

215
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.130
So I'm going to try that here especially things like saucepans I don't know what it's going to look

216
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.000
like at this point in time it might look really cool.

217
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.860
In fact it's already starting to look a bit brighter which is kind of why I wanted it to look like in

218
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:57.130
the first place and if I make it less rough so it's a bit more reflective.

219
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.590
It's starting to look actually really nice I'm liking how this is turning out.

220
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.830
And let's just try twisting this around slightly I don't think that's going to make too much difference

221
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.440
to how our current model is looking though.

222
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:15.010
So again playing with these figures and seeing what you end up creating with them obviously 100 percent

223
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.390
shining as there there's not going to work is more chrome.

224
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:24.020
So yes playing with all of these settings and just seeing what you come up with is a great way of exploring

225
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.160
such a powerful setup without really worrying about what you're doing.

226
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.600
I know that sounds a bit haphazard but seriously you can come up with something that you wouldn't have

227
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.190
done if you just being methodical about it.

228
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.030
This really is a playground for materials.

229
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.320
I'm liking how that's come out so I'm going to leave that's like that.

230
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:46.940
But before I do anything else we are looking at this and look Dev mode it's very important that we check

231
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:52.910
it occasionally in rendered mode as well to make sure that what we think it looks like is what it actually

232
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:58.440
looks like and our scene we've turned off the lamps that's out there so I'm going to turn on the the

233
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.200
lights that are in the scene itself and turn on the backdrop as well.

234
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.880
Now you can see it's actually a much darker material than it made it look in the first place but I'm

235
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.830
still quite happy with the shading and how it's looking here how it's playing with the reflections.

236
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:19.340
Now I can start changing these up and I do think I want a slightly higher roughness and then remember

237
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.800
you can press control and B draw a render border that will certainly speed things up and what you can

238
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.280
also do at that point is go to your render properties and come down to your sampling rates and on your

239
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.280
viewport turn that up much higher.

240
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.100
So if I set this to 64 I'm going to get a much higher quality render or even higher it does depend on

241
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.880
the strength of your computer.

242
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:47.570
So if I went to 256 and I tried that on my old laptop I'd be waiting a while but because I got this

243
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:54.050
small area we can see in detail what's going on and I'm really liking the effect that the answer tropic

244
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.780
shader here is giving us in rendered mode.

245
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.910
I'm going to come out of that now with control alt some vague and we see that this the actual rendering

246
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:08.230
itself is taking a significant amount of time longer it's going to knock the viewport back down to 32.

247
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.720
That's from my system.

248
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.750
You'll probably have different settings yourself.

249
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.030
Okay.

250
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:18.590
So that's one material done this backdrop I'm not liking it being super shiny it's great for showing

251
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:25.220
off reflections and things like that but I think it needs to be a bit of a lighter environment perhaps

252
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.530
different colour than grey as well so I'm going to bring the color up I'm going to lower the amount

253
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:36.020
of reflections by increasing the roughness against it's a bit more of a matte floor and the base colour.

254
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.120
Yeah I'm going to take that out as well.

255
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.480
Search for an Archie B note it's right at the top we can plug that in.

256
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:48.080
Now we might want this to look more orange to make it look a warm environment or because it's a lamp

257
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:53.030
we might want it's a a colder environment perhaps a blue a darker blue.

258
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:59.030
Now this points of course we might wants to expand our windows and just have a look at the scene overall.

259
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.660
Yeah I'm liking the new color that we've got fat.

260
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.500
So I'm liking the lampshade itself.

261
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:11.030
I'm liking the new material that we've applied to this part of our model the stand the arm the business

262
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.260
moving around.

263
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.800
I think that's really important because that's that needs to be distinct from the rest of the model.

264
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.770
It's a nice simple set up here.

265
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.120
And of course the background itself.

266
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.940
The only thing we've not got is the bit that we're jumping on now.

267
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:23.890
Do I have that there.

268
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.670
Yes I've called it a bench.

269
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.530
So you've got this object that we're jumping on and I think it should have its own material.

270
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.140
I don't think it does at the moment.

271
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.630
So I'm a bit cramped with my window so let's move this back again.

272
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.190
Yes Currently it's set to reflection in fact the floor is also reflection so let's call this back drop

273
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.300
and be explicit about that.

274
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:51.930
I think I missed naming something else earlier on but never mind I'm going to remove the material from

275
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:57.960
this model entirely and I'm going to click new notice we're not going into the material properties on

276
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.250
the left hand side anymore.

277
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.070
And once we've done that you know I haven't done I do apologize.

278
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.420
I haven't got a little area down here for my key strokes.

279
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.120
So hopefully if you have been relying on them it hasn't covered up too many.

280
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.690
There we go.

281
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.220
So now we're in this area we've got this object here.

282
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:26.520
I think I'm going to leave it as a light source of yellowy orange color something like that as it's

283
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.750
a focal point of the scene it's something we're going to try and get our lamp jumping on but I'm not

284
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:37.080
going to add anything else to it other than perhaps an argy B notes so we can control the color a bit

285
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:43.010
more explicitly and what we can do here is I want the exact color we currently have here.

286
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.670
I'm going to click on the preview box at the bottom which is going to bring up the same options as we

287
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:48.460
have here.

288
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.550
And once I've done that I can fit a little eyedropper icon and come over that existing color.

289
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.840
There we go and then plug it in.

290
00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:02.070
So we starting off where we want to Cape really and how are you guys getting on how your scene's coming

291
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:07.290
along as well now that they are starting to get coloured in and have materials on them things to start

292
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.120
looking much much better.

293
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.190
Do remember that at this point if you're in Look Dev mode as I am at the moment let's make this full

294
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:22.800
screen then you're going to have something that looks a lot brighter than your then if you were in rendered

295
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.520
married so it's important to hop in and out of both and make sure what you think you're getting is what

296
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.500
you think you getting.

297
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:37.020
Yeah and make sure what you think you're going to get is actually what's happening in the background

298
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.640
and that's going to become especially important in a couple of lectures time because we're not going

299
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:47.250
to be able to properly preview what's going on here in terms of what the materials and the lighting

300
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.430
is going to be doing.

301
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.560
So we're gonna have to hop into cycles quite a bit to make sure that things are behaving themselves.

302
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.720
So that's it for this lecture please share how you're getting on so far.

303
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.910
I'd love to see what type of materials you've decided to settle on your model.

304
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.840
And remember you don't have to settle on them.

305
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.990
You can always go back later and tweak them to your heart's content.

306
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.160
Show your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
