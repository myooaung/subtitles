00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.330
Welcome to exporting and particle systems.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.350
In this video you will see how particle systems export from Blender.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.780
You'll learn how to convert them.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.370
I understand that this can break your modelling flow and realize that you may be better off using the

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.890
particle system in the other program.

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.720
You are exporting too.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.390
If it exists.

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.090
So let's hop straight on over into blender right.

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.500
So to make this nice and straight forward I suggest if you are following along and do make a new save

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.730
So go file save as and save it perhaps as fluffy bunny exports.

11
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.990
This is very good to be very useful erm.

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.610
Even if you don't have a game engine or something else to import it to as it will increase your understanding

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.430
of how blender and other programs can interact.

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.050
So first of all I'm going to make my scene nice and simple and I'm going to delete everything but the

15
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.670
rabbit including the eyes.

16
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.880
In this case.

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.140
So I've already saved my file as fluffy bunny exports and that she going to select everything here.

18
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.210
And X.

19
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.060
Delete.

20
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.500
So we just left with the fluffy bunny in the scene.

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:24.130
Now if I go ahead and go file exports and export that as an FBI X an I'm going to export this as fluffy

22
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.860
bunny exports and click the export button.

23
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.510
Brilliant.

24
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.460
So that's all done.

25
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.090
Let's go see how that opens up in two very popular game engines.

26
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.890
Right so in the unreel four engine we can see that our bunny has some what's missing some fur.

27
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.400
So that's no good.

28
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.920
That's nice.

29
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.220
She come across how we want it to come across.

30
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.170
Now in this case I would thoroughly recommend using the particle system built into unreel for rather

31
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.490
than trying to get it across.

32
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.420
But I'll show you how to get across any way.

33
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.900
If you wanted a more static appearance or if you were making a more cartoony of hairstyle let's say

34
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.450
or any other particle system so this will apply to any.

35
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.260
I repeat again any particle system.

36
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.100
Obviously if we got rocks or trees or flowers or grass scattered around that's fine.

37
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.820
We can export those across but here's there's so many of them.

38
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.150
If it's not being managed in the actual engine itself you're going to have a few problems.

39
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.770
When I was trying it earlier I ended up with one point six million triangles on our bunny and that was

40
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.760
just a bit high for my liking.

41
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.340
Let's see how it looks over in unity.

42
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.730
So just for confirmation over annuity engine were also missing hair on our bunny so that's no good at

43
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.080
all.

44
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.740
So again if you are using unity you'd use the unity Hess system here particle system so that is the

45
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.520
general rule.

46
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.350
However if you do if you have kreda hairstyling you wanted to solidify into a into something you can

47
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.990
import into with these game engines.

48
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.850
Well go ahead and show you how to do that right now.

49
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.070
So taking our bunny here to make things simple.

50
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.740
What I'm gonna do is I'm only going to do one of these hair particle systems that we've got I think

51
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:28.810
we've got five intact something to go across to the rabbits itself and under the modifiers tap which

52
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.680
is currently open which is useful and is going to lift the SO who can see what's going on.

53
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.510
We've got five particle systems so let's just turn them off.

54
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.200
They're not named which is not very useful.

55
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.930
Tut tut.

56
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.910
So let's keep the particle system one I think up here and we can get rid of all the other.

57
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.910
So I'm going to keep the body particle system so can we go across here and we can see that I'm literally

58
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.940
just going to.

59
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.600
Oh I just deleted the body can I do it.

60
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.410
Excellent.

61
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.570
Love being able to undo skerryvore is and get rid of the chest.

62
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.180
So now we've just got this hair system here.

63
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.880
The reason one of them is just to emphasize the point that this can be incredibly slow with this many

64
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.800
hairs that we've got on here.

65
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.010
So now we've got that there.

66
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.460
We can go back into the modified tab and there's this convert button and you just click that.

67
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.190
It's as simple as that.

68
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.500
We have now converted our heads up particle system to a mesh object.

69
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.530
But it's not done yet if we try and import that in to any other program or not any other program but

70
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.230
certain programs I know in real would fall over because it would complain that there's actually no geometry

71
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.800
here there's no triangles.

72
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.000
All it is is a series of edges says converted those hairs into a series of edges so we need to make

73
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.310
them a bit thicker.

74
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.660
Now a lot of ways of doing that but a really straightforward way would be to hop in over into edit mode

75
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.130
select all of those hairs and extrude them ever so slightly in any direction.

76
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:13.730
Some of them extrude democracies slightly in the said direction by almost to extrude and arm not extruding.

77
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.060
Let's make sure we have everything selected.

78
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.910
We're extruding in that direction.

79
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.870
Silly me I'm trying to extrude a face.

80
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.240
Okay.

81
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.130
So selecting edge select and then trying to extrude does result in a lot of geometry trying to be made.

82
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.190
So we're going to extruding the z direction by nought point nought one something really really small.

83
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.860
Okay.

84
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:45.270
Now if we go and export that's an I'm going to call this exports.

85
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.000
We body I'm just going to spend it with body so I know there's a different one an export that.

86
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.850
And then in the game engines we'll see what that looks like.

87
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.680
Here we are in the unreal four engine and we can see we've got some hare we've got a hairy chest on

88
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.980
the rabbits but the rest of the hairs haven't really come through quite as intended or that might just

89
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.330
be how it's drawing it.

90
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.090
By the looks of things yeah I think it is how it's drawing if I move round here.

91
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.560
It seems that certainly seems to be more here on this site.

92
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.440
The dark side of the rabbits there appears to be on here.

93
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.070
So we need to play about with the particle system to get this actually coming across how we want.

94
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.830
Let's have a look at the Unity and suspected we'll see exactly the same thing here with more hair on

95
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.980
the other side.

96
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.500
Yes so we've got a lot of playing about to get this how we want it.

97
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.150
It's a good start it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.

98
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.190
Now of course you probably wouldn't want to do this you would probably use the built in hare generators

99
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.960
on both of these platforms or another application if you had it if you didn't have the option of course

100
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.400
this is your only option of making sure your model comes out complete.

101
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.680
Now of course it is very difficult to go ahead and edit this anymore we cant comb it any way we can

102
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.800
in blender we can comb it move its about the particle systems themselves still exist in there.

103
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.970
Weve just converted them to a mesh.

104
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.040
So if we did do that it over in blender mestas go across.

105
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.830
Now wed have to remember to turn off this mesh object over in blender.

106
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.250
We'd need to turn it off when rendering and probably in the viewport as well.

107
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:42.780
If we come into object mode so that we dont get a double amount of hairs if we turn it back on as you

108
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.100
can see it somewhat confuses the viewport.

109
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.650
So theres lots of things to experiment with with that.

110
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:57.480
In general as I say I would recommend using built in particle system generators in game engine certainly

111
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.730
and other 3D applications.

112
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:04.540
So other things that use particles and we move on to this later on in the course as well.

113
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.150
You can use the particle system to just distribute objects around your scene.

114
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:16.500
In that case you probably do want to do what weve just done with these hairs and apply it in your scene

115
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.220
itself.

116
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:26.520
However things like hairs smoke fire water etc. trying to move those across is very difficult as weve

117
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.770
seen here it hasn't come across smoothly.

118
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.290
And of course if it's moving you it's animated at all.

119
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.140
It's a real downer because it's just going to be static not gonna look very good at all.

120
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.170
So there we go.

121
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.150
Any questions of course ask in the discussions.

122
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:48.860
Hope this helps you with moving assets from Blender into game engines and other packages as well.

123
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.420
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
