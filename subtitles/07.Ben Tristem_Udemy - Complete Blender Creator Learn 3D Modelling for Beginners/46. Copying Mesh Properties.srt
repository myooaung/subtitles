1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,840
Welcome to copying meche properties in this video you will learn how to copy attributes of a mesh object.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,700
See that this is actually really useful when you have lots of components for example that need the same

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,050
material apply to them and understand that it is a destructive operation that is copying materials from

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,360
one mess to another will overwrite a meshes current materials.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,150
So let's go explore this now and hop straight on over into blender.

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,190
Hey welcome back over into blender so I've noticed as I open this up that's I've got a warning and that

7
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,480
warnings just disappear.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,840
But what I can do is expose the window associated with the info header and we can see what's going on.

9
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,940
So not much has happened here we can see that it's brought in its red library for the meche data and

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,910
loads of other things.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,810
Oh got this red line here so we got a warning.

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:02,740
That was the box that appeared a moment ago that the wall is missing from this particular file and I

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,040
think I've read rename that and it's ended up being bald 0 0 1 now.

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:13,150
It doesn't seem to have any impact on my 3D view so let's just have a look.

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,220
Quick Rick look around our model and see if we can work out where this has gone wrong.

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,740
So a wall pace for instance.

17
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,530
And while all these blank areas here are war pieces Incidentally I have noticed that the wall pieces

18
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,340
I've not applied the texture to both sides so it looks good here.

19
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,040
But if that piece is flipped round it's still rather plain and I can see that on the inside of the church

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,320
as well.

21
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,450
Okay so I suspect that it's this roof area here that prehaps causing the problem.

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,320
I remember that having a texture on it and it doesn't anymore and I can't remember removing that and

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,790
it does say wall in the materials properties here.

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,030
So in order to select linked materials i.e. other objects that may use the same material way as you

25
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,030
probably already guess it's in the select menu.

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,000
If we go down to the select menu and go to linked at the very top there we can see we can select anything

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,270
that's got the same object data material data texture data et cetera.

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,660
So if I go ahead and click on material we should find that that selects everything else that uses the

29
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,520
same material.

30
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,920
Now that it's done that I can go ahead and change the material for all of those so I can use the dropdown

31
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,550
here and just change it.

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,060
Let's say two linked wall.

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,270
One that does work.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,580
One that's enough.

35
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,080
Just going to save the file before I do any rendering and let's render that out.

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,820
Now it's got a similar colour to the rest of the world in fact probably got a text on it.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,940
Yes it has.

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,550
Okay so that's one way we can go about selecting everything that has the same linked property everything

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,150
that shares something similar.

40
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,200
But what about the ones that we want to make the same.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,980
So what we can do here is I can select.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,630
And then we go out of rendered mode against That's a bit quicker.

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:10,260
I'm going to go ahead and select this roofline here and then go ahead and select the new roofline.

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,830
Just here this silver arch way into the into the model itself.

45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,160
So then what I can do once I've selected them both holding down the SHIFT key there.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,710
There we go.

47
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,380
Got them both selected.

48
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,930
I can go ahead and go to object and make links so I can make links to the materials.

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,600
Okay now all of this overwrites what they were using before so let's go and see what's just happened.

50
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,610
So it's gone the other way round.

51
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,080
It has taken the last selected items of the active selected and applied that to all the other selected

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,330
objects.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:58,710
Everything that did have it has now gone backwards on both sides there so need to be careful about which

54
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,390
way we select things.

55
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:09,540
So if I wanted this material the top to share the same material as the wall for instance I would need

56
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,260
to select the wall last.

57
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,860
So could I go ahead and select the roof and the do it so I can see one selecting and must select these

58
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,130
areas here.

59
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,230
The little bits sticking out still don't know the name for that.

60
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,100
And then finally I'm going to select a wall piece.

61
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,790
Now I'm going to use a shortcut key which was control in L and select materials.

62
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,370
Now when we go into rendered mode or material mode we can see that it's now using the same material

63
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,500
as the wall piece.

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,890
We can also see areas that are not using that so this area here for instance is a little triangle in

65
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,150
the top corner here.

66
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,580
We can go ahead select that select the wall pace and again control an L and select materials and now

67
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,930
it will share the same material as before.

68
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:00,690
So it's the last one that you're selecting the active selection that is going to be the source for the

69
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,700
material to be copied to the other selected items.

70
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,570
And that is incredibly powerful especially when working with a large object like this where otherwise

71
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,120
I'd have to go round and select each one individually and that would be a real pain in the backside

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,830
to do.

73
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,420
So this is coming along really nicely now.

74
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,700
I'm still not too sure on the roof pieces here and I certainly need to change the colour of that.

75
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,310
But this is just a demonstration of how you can move those about.

76
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,870
I think the roof does need to be a different colour than the set of the walls Otherwise it does look

77
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,450
a bit odd.

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,620
But of course now we have explored linking these objects.

79
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,930
I've got a challenge for you.

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,950
I would like you to explore different material choices.

81
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:50,930
So just as a reminder here make sure you save your farm before exploring with any thing you do in blender

82
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,820
that's potentially high or highly destructive such as changing materials about willy nilly.

83
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,160
You may want to make a backup of your file or even you save as and progressed from there and give your

84
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,230
file a version number.

85
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,210
Explore different material options for your models in the scene see if you can come up with anything

86
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,610
that's slightly different See how that affects your scene and remember to use the linking to quickly

87
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,330
change a large number of objects at once.

88
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,820
Pause the video now and give that a go.

89
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,740
Okay guys.

90
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,550
Welcome back.

91
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,100
Let's hop back on over in a blender.

92
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,000
So the first thing I'm going to do here is actually heed my own advice not divisive to save my work

93
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:40,010
and I'm with a save as and I'm going to add staddon material.

94
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,900
Exploration on the end.

95
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:50,130
And then when we save as we find that we're working on that brand new file which is very powerful we'd

96
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,920
say and don't want to make up our original far in list now opens up the realm for exploration and I'm

97
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,830
going to change to material mode here so I can see a bit clearer what's going on as I move around the

98
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,010
model without having to wait for it to render all the time.

99
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,830
So one of the things that I can do here is literally select absolutely everything.

100
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,690
Now when you do that it's the last selected object that becomes the active object.

101
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,320
So if you had selected let's say one of these volts on the top or whatever you're working on and then

102
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,020
pressed a twice it's still the active object.

103
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,250
The original one that you selected and then it has everything on it.

104
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,910
Now of course because of selected everything.

105
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:37,860
If I go and apply the materials everything has that one material applied to it and that is interesting

106
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,650
seeing that brick texture over the entire world itself.

107
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,520
Now the question is Have we lost all of the properties all together.

108
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,140
So these are sort of the explorations that you can do.

109
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,490
So the answer there is yes we have.

110
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,920
So even though we've not lost things like the displacement modifier and items like that we have actually

111
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:06,480
lost the fact that it sets the material to use another texture to Alpher it out around the edge here.

112
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,940
So it became more and more transparent my sky texture obviously hasn't changed at all that still the

113
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:18,330
default sky if I go off to my world to hear you see I've picked sky texture and I've just left these

114
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,720
as the faults here.

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,970
So that is looking a bit more grey scale than it was previously.

116
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,880
Obviously this doesn't change the geometry.

117
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,410
However we can use this to change the geometry as well which is incredibly powerful.

118
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,490
So let's undo that and our own blender has crashed.

119
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,920
Now I didn't plan this but this is a warning that when you start mucking about with things it's very

120
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,110
easy to crash blender.

121
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,590
Someone's going to click reopen then see where we were before.

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,600
Some will open up material exploration it's probably just where the save was before which was where

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,250
I was going back to anyway.

124
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:02,940
So let's say for instance I select this wall piece in the middle and then go ahead shift and select

125
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,740
the window on top.

126
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,390
I can go control in L and link object data and there we go I've got another window in place very powerful

127
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,540
for swapping things in and out as well as changing materials.

128
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,250
Brilliant.

129
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:24,050
How did you guys get on did you do any modifications to your model after exploring different materials.

130
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,540
If you have make sure you share your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
