00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.140
Welcome to copying physics properties.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.500
So where is the physics data actually stored.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.030
Well see in a few moments.

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.580
Physics properties are not linked to the objects or data.

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.980
Data block.

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.460
As you might think they are like the materials are when you set those up.

7
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.430
Now they are part of the scene data block and this means that unfortunately when you append an object

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.450
that you've set physics up.

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.780
Well the actual data itself is not going to come across for the physics set up you'd actually have to

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.980
import or sorry in append the scene itself into a new blender far because that's where all the properties

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.080
are stored.

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.300
Now you cannot make links to the physics either.

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.180
So when you used to use and control an L to steal the material data from another area there's no option

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.870
for physics.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.460
Perhaps that will change in the future that will be very useful but it's not possible at the moment

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.090
simply because we're stored in the scene data block.

17
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.160
Again it's not stored as part of it objects or the object data day to block.

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.000
You can however still copy from an active mesh object and will it go explore that now and hop on over

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.450
into a blender.

20
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.270
Okay so were over in blender here we have aged the standard cubes we would do normally that sets some

21
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.500
physics up on it's us.

22
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.180
Go ahead and just add it.

23
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.920
A rigid body like we've done before and let's go ahead and play that.

24
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.720
So one of the ways that you can get data from one object to another is of course copying or duplicating

25
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.310
the object itself.

26
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.460
So let's go ahead and stop that from playing that's go back to frayne's ZERO again and using shift and

27
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.670
D we can duplicate our cube and both of them now have physics properties apply to them because it's

28
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.190
derived from the original.

29
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.400
Now if we change it with let's say we go in use all the and make a linked duplicate and just to remind

30
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.530
you that means that they are linked.

31
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.690
If we scale them in edit mode they will scale on both of them scale because they are actually the same

32
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.560
mesh data.

33
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.430
Now.

34
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.700
They will all have the same ply But of course if we set this one having a mass of 5 If we go to this

35
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.260
one it will have a mass of one and this one will have a mass of 1 as well.

36
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.720
And of course that in itself you would think would be a little bit problematic.

37
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.060
It is if you don't know how to handle it.

38
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.300
So first of all before we go any further Where is all of this data stored.

39
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.150
Well it's actually in the scene itself.

40
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.370
And if we scroll down so in the Properties window there is the scene tab it looks like a ball in the

41
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.410
cylinder and a.

42
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.840
I suppose it's a lamp next to it as well.

43
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.330
I can't quite make all of that out but we've got a series of options.

44
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.840
We've got gravity in here now that does affect our scene so if we changed to where the gravity was coming

45
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.760
from at the moment it's set to nine point eight one which is meters per second in this case.

46
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.120
And if we end up just playing it by default.

47
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.940
There we go.

48
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.290
The others just disappeared.

49
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.150
So that basically means that after one second these queues will be travelling as they've accelerated

50
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.670
at nine point eight 1 meters per second.

51
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.650
They'll be travelling at nine point eight one meets per second so after a second if you want to know

52
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.530
the full equation you can go hop over onto Wikipedia but they will have travelled around 5 meters or

53
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.400
so after a second or in this case blender units B because one blend the unit and one meter are pretty

54
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.980
interchangeable when it comes to the default scene that we have.

55
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.650
Now these are falling away.

56
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.530
That's absolutely fine.

57
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.390
If I Antec rigid body world well the physics just stops working because that's where this data is stored.

58
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.620
Now we've got some other options down here the useful ones down here.

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.640
And these are some of the trip ups that you'll come across the gotcha's.

60
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.820
We can change the steps per second we can change the solver iteration the higher these numbers the slower

61
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.640
your calculations are going to be but the more accurate they should become.

62
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.330
Don't go too high though other ways you can also give some very undesirable results where things just

63
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.300
go flying off into the aether to stop these things falling.

64
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.860
Okay.

65
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.480
The one that usually gets people is this rigid body cache.

66
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.480
Now if we open that up we can see it starts at 1:00 and goes to 250.

67
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.420
And it says we got 50 frames in memory and it's taking up 12 killer bytes.

68
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.140
That's fine.

69
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.480
That makes sense if we change any of the settings to do with the physics that's go over here and make

70
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.360
the maths two and go back here.

71
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.490
We should see that it says outdated.

72
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.310
No it doesn't.

73
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.000
Let's just change something else the friction and go back here.

74
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.410
Perhaps it needs to be running to be outdated.

75
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.670
There we go.

76
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.810
Cash is out.

77
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.920
And if I pull this open he says outdated.

78
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.540
There we go.

79
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.060
So the cash is outdated now.

80
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.840
The important thing here is the start frame and the end frame.

81
00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.670
Now if you were doing quite a long simulation at the moment it would literally stop after 250 frames.

82
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:09.300
It doesn't matter if you've changed the setting down on the time line to be 300 400 500 It doesn't matter

83
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.480
2000.

84
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.140
It will still stop the simulation after 250 frames and that is something that will catch you out.

85
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.590
If you all do less doing a Domino's scene for instance where one block is hitting another and there

86
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.490
cascading down well after 250 frames or 10 just over 10 seconds at 24 frames per second.

87
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.000
Its just going to stop and if you wonder why go and check out this setting here the rigid body cache

88
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.360
is literally storing the information.

89
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.830
Now what we don't see with these simple cubes falling Let's go back over here is it's kind of locked

90
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.720
24 frames per second.

91
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.230
If it was a more complicated simulation we would see it drop down perhaps even less to one frame per

92
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.860
second.

93
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.940
But once it's run that it's actually stored those 50 frames in this case into cash.

94
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.550
So it doesn't have to recalculate the movements every time.

95
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.810
However everything that you change will actually make the whole cache out of date.

96
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.260
And that's that's the case sometimes you'll do something whilst the animation is running and things

97
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.050
just explode or fly over the place and you just wonder what's going on.

98
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.850
Well if that does happen just reset the simulation or let it loop round any way especially if it's a

99
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.960
short simulation like 50 frames.

100
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.360
So now we've got all of these cubes all set up what we can do is copy the physics from one to another.

101
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.280
Now this is available in the tool shelf under the physics pane and every year.

102
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.110
That's the fifth one down here.

103
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.290
Now we've got a button that says copy from active.

104
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.350
So the easiest way of doing this is well there are a couple of ways of doing it.

105
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.940
But the easiest I've often found is to move all of your objects that you're working with to a separate

106
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.390
layer.

107
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.900
That's one way or in the outline a D select the selection for things you don't want or that you're not

108
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.920
working with at the moment so we've got these three cubes.

109
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.570
Now if I select everything with the aiki is only those three being selected and I can also move them

110
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:15.160
to another layer like layer 2 and then when I'm looking at that I can simply just hit a and select everything

111
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.960
that's on that layer.

112
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.290
Now I select the one hour and want to copy the information from first it will go that light orange colour

113
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.640
on the origin.

114
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.260
Now because they got physics applied.

115
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.650
Unfortunately we can't look at the actual outline because that's just gone green.

116
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.940
Now let's have a look and see the settings.

117
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:40.330
Let's give it a friction of one a bounciness of point five and a mass of 10 which we definitely can't

118
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.480
see and let's change it from convects hole to mesh just for this instance.

119
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:51.610
Now now we've got all that set up we can hit the A key twice and you see that the other origins for

120
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:59.530
these particular cubes are a dark orange in now if we hit copy from active it's copied the physics data

121
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:05.260
from this cube to the other two and if we can go and click on them we can see that that is in fact the

122
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.600
case.

123
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.800
They're now all contain the same physical properties.

124
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.530
Now this can be a great way of let's say setting up a scene with multiple lights and you just all set

125
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.590
them up with the same physical properties and then go in to tweak them.

126
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:24.400
Or indeed if you've got lots of duplicate objects that are actually the same that do need the same physical

127
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.580
properties you can apply across the board.

128
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.500
So now just to practice this I've got a small challenge for you.

129
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.370
I'd like you to go ahead and copy some properties.

130
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:42.250
So go ahead and set up a scene with five falling primitives and a slightly sloped ground plane so it's

131
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.190
a bit more interesting when they hit it make all of these mesh objects saying that they share the same

132
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.610
physical data.

133
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.510
So they're all going away the same have the same bounciness et cetera.

134
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.950
Now remember to make the ground plain passive.

135
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.840
Otherwise it's going to disappear with all the others and nothing will hit one another which wouldn't

136
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.990
be that exciting.

137
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:03.670
So go ahead.

138
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.200
Pause video now and give that a go.

139
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.960
Okay guys welcome back.

140
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.670
Let's get set up a scene and hop on over into a blender.

141
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.150
Okay welcome back sir.

142
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.730
We have three cubes here.

143
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.440
I'm going to get rid of two of them.

144
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.960
That's fine.

145
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.400
Okay.

146
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:27.440
I'm going to add in a plane and just scale that up massively So we've got something there and I'm going

147
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.250
to save my file as well and call it 5 falling objects.

148
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:40.370
I cannot see my microphone so hopefully that's I can't see through my microphone five falling objects

149
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.110
just got capital in the wrong place.

150
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.730
Anyway enough of my keyboard wizardry.

151
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:51.740
Let's just play Well let's set all let's add are other objects him first so what else can we have.

152
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.970
Let's have a cone.

153
00:09:53.210 --> 00:10:00.520
And for excitement's Let's actually have the cone rotated X by one eighty six pointing down.

154
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.730
Who knows which way it will actually fall.

155
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.430
Let's hear.

156
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.430
Add in a nother meche let's add in Suzanne the monkey she's always useful to have in a scene keeping

157
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.630
an eye on us and our antics.

158
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:17.150
There we go there's Suzanne a schifter over here so she's not getting a cone falling right on top of

159
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.600
her.

160
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.540
And then of course that's three so let's go in.

161
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.110
Now I've got three extra things added in so let's see.

162
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:31.460
That's all teapots are that's going to come in pretty large that's shrink it down just a little and

163
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.570
move over here.

164
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.500
And what else have we got.

165
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.450
We got one more object.

166
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.460
What shall we have.

167
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.770
Choices choices choices.

168
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:42.410
Let's go for a cylinder and let's tilt it on its side.

169
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.380
So I'm going to rotate it round the y axis by 90.

170
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:45.950
There we go.

171
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.410
So that's a great starting point.

172
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.610
And now I'm going to.

173
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.800
This one's already got physics properties enabled so I'm going to select everything from that go over

174
00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:01.730
to the physics tab and copy from active and then remembering to set this to passive.

175
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.190
In fact I can just hear and passive over here.

176
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:09.370
That should work it's not rotated yet so that's were it's hates it ever so slightly.

177
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.930
And let's see what happens when we go ahead and play.

178
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:17.520
Now we've only got 50 frames so I'm going to up this now to 200 just to see what happens.

179
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.880
It turns out yes.

180
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.320
There we go.

181
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.410
The cone does indeed fall over.

182
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:27.270
Now of course we could make things a bit more interesting we could make the floor a little bit more

183
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:27.990
bouncy.

184
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.580
And let's go to this cuber make that very bouncy in the friction a little low.

185
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:33.910
There we go.

186
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:39.310
So the cubes bouncing about was probably a bit too much bouncing this bouncing.

187
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.150
This a new word.

188
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:47.350
Never mind let's select these other objects and then copy from active which will be this first one again

189
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.480
copy from active.

190
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.180
Let's see what happens.

191
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.880
Now they're a bit Pouncy Yeah.

192
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.910
Excellent.

193
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.960
Lots of fun.

194
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.010
How did you guys get on.

195
00:11:54.010 --> 00:12:00.250
I hope you're getting the hang now of the physics engine as you can see it's got quite a bit of potential

196
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.750
and quite a bit of confusing settings over here.

197
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.950
But rest assured we'll get to the bottom of most of it and we'll have lots of fun whilst doing it.

198
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:15.220
Please share your five falling objects in the discussions on the forum and I will see you guys in the

199
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.280
next lecture.
