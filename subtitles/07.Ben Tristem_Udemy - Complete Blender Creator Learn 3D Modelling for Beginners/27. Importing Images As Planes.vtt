00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.350
Welcome to importing images as planes.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.280
In this video you will set up an add on that enables you to import images as planes be able to import

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:18.210
an image into a scene and realize this can be another way of importing reference material.

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.500
So let's go hop on over in a blender.

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.160
Okay so back over in blender our rabbit is coming along really well.

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.090
So let's hop over to the 3-d view here.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.470
And well we just got a pair of highs for the moment.

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.000
A lot of counter views come out of there.

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.520
Excellent.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.900
That's unhide some of the other stuff that's in the scene.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.170
So with this rabbit coming along quite nicely we're going to start to want to give it some environment

12
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.860
and we're going to do some grass for that.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.600
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add grass.

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.890
This plane here but I'm going to choose this new layer over here.

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.630
Lay a five.

16
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.190
If you wanted three four five.

17
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.190
Pretty sure if you hit number five on the key pad it would take you there as well or five yeah.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.010
Brilliant.

19
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.380
So now that we're on this layer I'm going to respond to the cursor with shift and see down to here.

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.070
And I want to add an image as a plane.

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.760
Now what you will need to do is go to file user preferences and go to your add ons tab at the top.

22
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.660
Now you can search through this entire one here.

23
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.380
If we go to the search menu on the top left and type in plane we will have the option to import export

24
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.040
import images as planes.

25
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.980
If he makes sure on the rights of the user preferences there's a little tick in the tick box on check

26
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.290
box and then save your user settings.

27
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.700
Then when you exit the user preferences when you go shift in a under meche you you'll have images as

28
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.090
planes as one of your options.

29
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.580
So go ahead and click on that now.

30
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.890
Now what I'd like you to do is go ahead to your asset pack right now and go ahead and open up the nature's

31
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.670
texture folder.

32
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.440
And I'm going to just toggle the thumbnail view so I can see my images.

33
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.870
As you can see I've taken a few images.

34
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.220
Some of these are from photos I've taken in the past and I've altered them to fit into our system here

35
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.770
quite well.

36
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.850
Now you would notice all the images themselves are square.

37
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.680
Now that is important.

38
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.420
I won't go into the details about that just at the moment but suffice to say there is important that

39
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.920
there are all powers of two and that makes them square right.

40
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.920
I'm going to go ahead and pick grass blade.

41
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.170
They all notice that of all the grass blades one of them is white and will be dealing with that in a

42
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.210
future lecture.

43
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.570
But not this one.

44
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.520
So open up a grass blade toe.

45
00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.390
And we can see that it's pots a plane into us now going to view it's from the top.

46
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.140
It's just literally that it's a plane with that bit of grass on it.

47
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.120
Now obviously we can't see that at the moment so how do we go about doing that.

48
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.360
Well if we change the view mode the viewport shading here from solid to texture we will see it.

49
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.220
Now everything that was transparent on that image has gone black and everything that's got the image

50
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.560
on it itself has gone well is the image is the blade of grass.

51
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.680
Now we can also see that in material mode and of course in the rendered mode as well.

52
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.040
So that's how you will see that on there.

53
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.430
Now this is an incredibly powerful way of bringing in reference material as well because it's not limited

54
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.630
to the x y and z plane.

55
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.870
So you can use it if necessary to bring in a reference image in a very specific location.

56
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.340
Armed with that knowledge.

57
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.170
I think it's time for a challenge.

58
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.850
OK.

59
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.890
I would like you to practice importing images as planes.

60
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.510
So go ahead and import to other grass blade images not the one with the white background.

61
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.050
Oh to the origins to be at the bottom of the grass image so where it comes where it would come up out

62
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.520
of the ground and just make sure that all the origins are at the Z equals zero and leave a space between

63
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.930
the images see if they're all coming in in one place they're going to be on top of one another.

64
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.560
So they aren't on top of one another.

65
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.110
Then finally make sure that the origins are all at Z equals zero.

66
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.970
And leave a space between the images so they're not on top of one another.

67
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.520
Suppose a video now and give that a go.

68
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.390
Okay guys.

69
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.580
Welcome back.

70
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.970
Let's see how we can import to more grass images over in blender.

71
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.780
Right so we've got the one image over into our system we're going to come out of rendered mode and hop

72
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.980
back into solid mode for the moment.

73
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.270
No.

74
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.680
I'm going to hop into texture mode.

75
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.250
Why not.

76
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.890
And I'm just going to move that to one side.

77
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.550
Going to imports all of my images first before doing anything else of course you can do all of the options

78
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.010
you want.

79
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.920
Let's have a look.

80
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.090
Let's imports all.

81
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.120
I quite like the look of this one here Number 10 looks quite interesting and I'm going to move that

82
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.380
to the side here using the manipulator.

83
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.390
And one final.

84
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.190
Let me to this go and add that shift day images as planes and I'm going to pick this tall grass seed

85
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.880
one that's a nice and nice difference there.

86
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.630
There are left or right.

87
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:33.750
Doesn't matter.

88
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.420
Okay so we've got those there and what have we got to do we've got to make the origins.

89
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.140
Now the great thing about the three curses you've realized in past lectures is it sticks to the thing

90
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.170
you're clicking on.

91
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.650
So what we can do here is are I've run out of zoom so I've not got a number pad with me so I'm going

92
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.300
to use the View menu and go to have you selected.

93
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.800
It's going to zoom right in and allow me to zoom in a little further.

94
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.290
We've got the clipping there of the camera going on so I can actually change that.

95
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.080
But I don't need to get much closer than this anyway.

96
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.730
And I'm going to select about there with it's now final Lakers were in object mode I can go to set origin

97
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.490
to the 3D cursor.

98
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.360
Let's go ahead and go over here and do the same.

99
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.090
Select this object select where it had come out of the ground which is probably about there and set

100
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.790
origin to the 3D cursor.

101
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.970
And we've got one final image to do.

102
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.390
Which is this one here that select it and click down there.

103
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.500
Is that right in the right place.

104
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.940
Let's have a look.

105
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.610
Excellent set the origin to the 3-d cursor.

106
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.270
Brilliant.

107
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.520
So that's our three images ready to go.

108
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.280
How did you guys get on.

109
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.770
Please share in the discussions your three images that you've chosen and I will see you in the next

110
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.410
lecture.
