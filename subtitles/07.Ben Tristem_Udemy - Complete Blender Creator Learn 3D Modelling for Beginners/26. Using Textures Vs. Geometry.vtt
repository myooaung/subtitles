00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome to using texture's versus geometry.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.830
So this video you will understand that you will need both.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.890
The texture has to exist on something.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.230
You'll see that geometry is full detail and textures are full.

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:24.820
The illusion of detail and realize that the appropriate combination of both is used to create models.

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.110
So what do we mean by that so we have two images here.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.920
I use the texture which is on the right to create the polygon model that's on the left.

8
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.240
Now looking at these two photos you can see that one is a plain green and one has a bit of colour to

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.510
it etc..

10
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.870
But essentially they're both now the same.

11
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.940
I could have gone in and made a bit more detail but I thought that was good enough for this demonstration

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.050
of course.

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.930
Can you guess how many polygons are on these.

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.210
Probably not.

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.310
Here we go.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.970
There are 400 odd polygons on the one on the left and the one on the right.

17
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.690
Is just the texture is full polygons So there's a performance boost to be had there.

18
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.930
Now having a look at a rabbit scene will be getting to this in a moment.

19
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.710
This is me using a mesh for the grass and this is me using the texture for the grass.

20
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.030
As you can see there's a huge difference straight away.

21
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.940
Now what I did do after seeing this and this was I went Well hang on a minute my blades of grass here

22
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.620
are far too short and fat to make a direct comparison to here and also their luminous green which doesn't

23
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.760
help at all.

24
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.990
So I put together this particular one which uses a different colour set and as you can see not only

25
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.870
has the cone disappeared then the lighting change ever so slightly but it's much much better.

26
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.900
Quite close to this one but still not quite there because of all the different colour variants and of

27
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.970
course you can spend a bit more time modelling to get that grass much better.

28
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.840
Now a warning to those that are using their graphics card to render in windows especially there.

29
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.790
Basically if anything takes more than two seconds you'll get a r has been detected.

30
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.420
Application must close which is very very annoying.

31
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.250
Now I'm not going to show you directly how to fix this because it's mucking about with your registry.

32
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.600
All the alternative is to use a p you to do your rendering Now if you're s.p. was really really slow

33
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.920
compared to your graphics card you'll want to go in and make the changes and I'll show you how to do

34
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.160
that in a few moments or tell you where to go and they've got really detailed instructions for that.

35
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.450
So in summary if you get the tedi are error when you're using your GP for rendering I think it only

36
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.730
applies to end video.

37
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.400
But it might also apply to a T.

38
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.800
But I don't know if the solution is the same but you either use your cpq or try the fix that's listed

39
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.990
on the screen now.

40
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.190
And certainly if you've got the lecture notes you can click on that link as well.

41
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.740
Or you can go ahead and type in now.

42
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.970
Lots of texture on top of one another does work well as you can see the same basically the same scene.

43
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.950
The set up time was a lot less with the texture than it was with the rendering itself.

44
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.790
The rendering took significantly longer.

45
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.870
When I was using textures rather than geometry so just a reminder of the scene that we're talking about

46
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.560
here.

47
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.190
This one here.

48
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.160
Guess how long this portion of it took when I was rendering at 10 ATP.

49
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.490
So not this resolution misses half of 720.

50
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.050
So is tiny.

51
00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.420
For these demonstrations by are four I'd go out I'd leave this one going and the 10 ATP.

52
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.890
Well I came back after being out of the house for a while.

53
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.170
This took eight hours the total time estimate it was two hundred hours.

54
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.970
So as you can probably imagine I gave up rendering that one in the end to just just to bear in mind

55
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.260
if rendered time's not important to you and you can leave something rendering on a machine or it's just

56
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.330
the one scene and not an animation.

57
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.470
Sure if it takes 200 hours to do your final scene that's great.

58
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.940
But for the rest of us that need to work on our computers and might need to turn them off to save energy.

59
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.000
That's another big consideration here.

60
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.720
If you're running a computer flatout for 200 hours it's going to cost you a little bit in electricity

61
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.990
as well.

62
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.190
So bearing that all in mind what you do now is move on to the next lecture and start importing some

63
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.470
textures.

64
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.390
See you soon.
