00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.800
In this video, we're going to fix our whiskers and I'm going to show you how to delete particles,

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.650
and you might have come across this in your creation that when you go and manipulate the mesh, it's

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.840
going to make a bit of a mess of particle systems.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.820
And I do apologize if this has happened to you.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.860
It's one of those things that we try to get our mesh as perfect as we can before we start adding these

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.790
details onto it.

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.490
But sometimes we do need to make those those fine tuning changes that we can only really do once we've

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.480
got everything in place.

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.520
In this instance.

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.180
My mistake was that I forgot to do the detail around the eyeballs.

11
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.340
That was totally my mistake.

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.650
I do apologize for that.

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.940
Something we can learn together and at least remember to two together.

14
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.850
Don't forget the eyes that for what I want to do for now is to delete these random stray whiskers and

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.200
just place them back in again.

16
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.700
And I haven't shown you how to do this.

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.760
And I've just been cutting the whiskers because that's been good enough for out as quick cut blimp.

18
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.290
Done.

19
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.960
But does a very, very easy way for us to hit see on the keyboard and then highlight any of the points

20
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.950
for our particle.

21
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.830
Just get at least get one of them per particle.

22
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.480
And then I'm going to Right.

23
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.890
Click to get out of selection.

24
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.300
Make sure there's none at the top.

25
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.470
It is one of the top C selected again.

26
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.780
I'm going to probably do read all these ones over on the right hand side.

27
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.030
As annoying as that is, I'm little bit frustrated.

28
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.810
I have to do them again.

29
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.390
But that is such as the way of the particle system.

30
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.120
Sometimes we do with it what we can.

31
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.290
And then right.

32
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.570
Click to get out of selection X on the keyboard and delete the particle that will get rid of all of

33
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.290
those particles.

34
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.950
So if you've got any of those little didley ones sticking around that you want to get rid of, that's

35
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.460
how you do it.

36
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.010
You just highlight them and then delete them.

37
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.110
So I was going to go and quickly replace these back.

38
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.230
It should be pretty straightforward because we've done this a couple of times already.

39
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.070
I'll just be as quick and speed it up.

40
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.210
But that is how we fix up any of our random particles that we want to delete completely.

41
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.720
And this process should be pretty quick, just placing down a particle, pushing it over to the side

42
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.740
or combing it over to the side and then adding a few more with Interpolate on.

43
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.530
So there mostly the right position right from the get go.

44
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.880
Just brushing them down a little bit, trying to make them as as smooth as you can with the curve.

45
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.010
So they're not jaggedly.

46
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.210
And then we're adding in the eyebrows as well, putting in four or five per.

47
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.270
And just doing a render to make sure it all looks pretty good.

48
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.310
There we go.

49
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.210
Whiskers and eyebrows added back in.

50
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.480
Looks pretty good when we're in the right view object mode.

51
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.110
We can see that.

52
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.590
We have our whiskers returned.

53
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.400
There we go.

54
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.720
We have whiskers back on our cat.

55
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.500
No worries.

56
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.180
And we've also had a little reminder on how to delete individual strands of hair.

57
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.410
See you in the next lecture.
