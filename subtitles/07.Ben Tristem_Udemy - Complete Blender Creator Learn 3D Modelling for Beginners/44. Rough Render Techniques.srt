00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,190
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,780
In front of us we have our lamp laying on the floor.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,800
We go ahead and hit F twelve.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,450
We can start the rendering using cycles.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,960
Now I know that this is going to take a few moments to do but critically we've got 300 frames doing

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,680
this.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,880
So what we can do is a rough calculation if we look at the time taken.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,770
It says 14 seconds Unger rounded up to 15 seconds just to make sure we've got everything covered.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,770
And times it by 300.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,840
So I can tell you roughly if I was to render this out in the same quality you can see right here it's

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,270
going to take 4500 seconds or seventy five minutes.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,680
Now we're at the prototyping stage at the moment that's just too long.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,230
Now I know some of you out there really want your renders when you're showing off things to look spot

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,680
on every time we're not focused on that the moment we are focused on making sure when we're rendering

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,890
out we capture the movement the lighting and everything else can come later.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,380
And so there are plenty of ways of doing this.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,720
So I just want to run through a few options for you to make sure that when you're rendering out we can

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,410
render things nice and quickly so you get a feel of the scene both on movement and lighting.

19
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:28,500
We'll start off with the movement OK so the elephant in the room here is Evey render engine.

20
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,120
So the first thing I would always recommend is that you switch over to using eevee for the movement.

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,180
And then when we go ahead and render that's out it takes less than a second with car render time down

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,620
significantly.

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,180
But of course our lighting isn't correct.

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,480
So that's one of the things to bear in mind.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,670
The other thing that you can do perhaps your computer is in a fast as easy or the scene you're using

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,900
is quite heavy and eevee still takes some time to do we really want to test out our animation we don't

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,460
want to worry about things.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,110
So the other thing that we can do here is switch this over to a workbench.

29
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,790
Then when we go ahead and render we get something that's a lot like the viewport in solid shape mode

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,940
and it's taken even less time orders of magnitude less.

31
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,700
And this does mean that if we wanted to we've got our animation there let's just go ahead and click

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:25,260
render animation and you will see here that it's counting up very very quickly which is a great way

33
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,810
of being able to preview your animation.

34
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,060
The other thing that does make a difference occasionally is the resolution that you're trying to output

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,720
as.

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,320
Now we've not set any of the options yet when it comes to rendering will go to that's in a in a future

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:48,070
lecture but as it is at the moment this is going to take well no time at all essentially just looks

38
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,140
like a jerky animation and one of the great things about previewing it at this speed is I can see that's

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,240
gone off a frame.

40
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,370
Of course I knew that already that's something I've got to fix in a bit but we've already got ourselves

41
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:08,170
to a point here where we've got an animation rendering incredibly quickly but it doesn't have any of

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,320
that important lighting information.

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,500
So we'll let this animation render out and what we can then do is have a closer look at including lighting

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,340
information as well okay.

45
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,440
So the majority of the movement is done that want to press escape we we escape out of the rendering.

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,180
But what we can then do is preview that really quickly by going to view animation or control and therefore

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,660

48
11:00 and we'll see what we've got so far.

49
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,660
So we're jumping up landing and we're off again.

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,900
So a couple of minutes we've got a preview and it's looping around quite happily.

51
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,140
So that's a great start but what about lighting how can we get lighting information out.

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,660
Well there's going to have to be some sacrifice of quality in order to do that.

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,980
So we're going to go back to cycles because that's where our lighting information is.

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,500
And of course it's going to take a while to compute.

55
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,150
Now one of the things that you can really really do to help speed things up.

56
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,000
We've already had a look at light paths before.

57
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,110
So we could lower the light paths.

58
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,400
Let's do the retina the render if I remember was about 14 15 seconds if we'd set the total number of

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,090
light bounces down to one.

60
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,550
It's going to look really odd it's going to look different.

61
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,800
Let's switch it.

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,960
We can see that it renders out very quickly and very rough.

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,200
Now let's go ahead and render it the last one was around 14 seconds.

64
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,830
Let's see what that change has made to our models and see round there it's doing some dinner poising

65
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,810
as well remember we've had the option turned on so we can have a much smoother image.

66
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,330
We're down to 12 seconds so that has made a difference to the render not significant enough.

67
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,430
I want to see a lot lot quicker if I'm going to have the lighting information.

68
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,470
So we've got a way of having the movement information the lighting information what we can then do as

69
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,170
I'm going to put that up to maybe four or so so we're not losing too much.

70
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,550
The first thing I'm going to do is go back to our day noisy scroll down to the bottom here.

71
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm going to turn that off.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,620
We turn off the noise zing.

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,520
Yes the image will look worse but it will be quicker.

74
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,290
Let's just see what that looks like.

75
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,380
Now we've played with those settings we can see it's whizzing around.

76
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,570
And of course your computer is going to be different.

77
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,570
I must emphasize the fact that you're going to have to play of the settings yourself to see how quickly

78
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,290
your computers can render animations out.

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,340
Now this is down to seven.

80
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,420
So if half the time.

81
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,250
That's a great start.

82
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,240
I don't care if it looks ropey.

83
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,250
This is 10 ATP.

84
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,300
One thing that will impact your render time is the resolution of your final image.

85
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,850
So let's come out again go back to our render tab.

86
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,150
Oh I did mean the output tab but whilst we're here I'll render samples.

87
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,900
We've talked about this before as well.

88
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,080
We set that down to one sample and render it out.

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,870
It's very quick but we will lose quite a bit of information in the process if we set this up.

90
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,900
Maybe let's have it 16 or eights let's do eight.

91
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,300
Let's see how quick is that.

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,210
It's going to be slightly longer.

93
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,110
So we're down to two seconds.

94
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,540
Now let's do the final thing that I wanted to do which is lower the resolution I with the quality that

95
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:18,980
it is.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,760
Anyway I don't need to render out at 10 ATP so this is full high definition.

97
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,640
Then if you wanted four K you could bump that up 200 percent or type in the pixel count.

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,210
I'm just gonna set this at 50 percent for the moment.

99
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,770
That is that's less than 720 P and we've rendered it very very quickly.

100
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,490
That's nice.

101
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,660
How about if we set it down at 20 percent.

102
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,910
There is a point at which it just becomes silly.

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,110
I think that's enough as well if you was showing that or with someone on their phone that's that's about

104
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,570
right for the size of a phone screen.

105
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,580
Obviously I know some of you want real quality outputs.

106
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,490
I want to set this down to 1 percent just to show you a certain point.

107
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,800
You just get a junk load of pixels.

108
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,930
So I'm going to set this I think at 25 percent and go ahead and render the animation again.

109
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,690
Now you can see it's going through.

110
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,750
I think there might even be a tiny bit quicker zoom out here.

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,130
Now we're not going to get to see the render output.

112
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,870
So this is going through incredibly quickly and then leave it to go through and we'll review the animation

113
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,470
in a few moments on the floor for quite some time.

114
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,770
I think I do need to adjust the render length of my animation.

115
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,980
I can then close down the preview and we can simply go to render render animation.

116
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,600
Ah then want to do that.

117
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,840
It doesn't matter because it's the same information as we have before I'm going to view the animation

118
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,150
and there we go.

119
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,290
That's the animation as is I can make it full screen is going to be ropey because it's low quality but

120
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,420
we can see here the light itself.

121
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:55,050
Now I'm not sure if that lamp is bright enough because I can only really see it lower down or whether

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,660
the light samples coming from it are too little to get the impact.

123
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,620
And I think that entire scene can be slightly darker as well but this is what I mean by testing the

124
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,120
lighting information.

125
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,670
We can test out the overall scene by doing one single frame render which is just an image like we would

126
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:17,820
normally do but when it comes to animation and changing view Well we've really got to render out the

127
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,240
entire animation to make sure it's behaving as we would expect it to.

128
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:22,780
Okay.

129
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,910
So in summary we can tweak our settings when it comes to rendering out remember you have to turn them

130
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,630
back against and make a note if you're unsure in order to get the lighting information coming across

131
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,870
and into our scene.

132
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:42,490
The other thing that we can do is we can render out either with eevee or workbench on much more complicated

133
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,110
scenes in order so we can see the movement much more clearly.

134
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,170
So that's it for this lecture your challenged to take away from this is to test your individual setup

135
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,050
and see what's working best for you.

136
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,670
You don't have to share that with everybody else but if you do choose to it will help others as well

137
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,070
decide how to set up their system.

138
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:12,520
So I'm running as we can see here I'm running a Intel Core I 770 700 K at four point two gigahertz energy

139
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,440
force GTA x 10 80.

140
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:21,880
So I would expect anybody with a similar system to mine to have a similar setup to me.

141
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,430
However if your settings vary from this if you've got a more powerful processor or more powerful graphics

142
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:33,090
card or a less powerful processor or graphics card your settings will vary.

143
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,350
And it's up to you to test that.

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,750
But as you do please do let us know over on the forums so that people can cherry pick solutions that

145
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,720
have already been made just to speed up the workflow for everyone.

146
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,360
So there we go your challenge for this lecture is to test your settings.
