00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.030
Welcome to the geometry node in this video.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.390
We're going to use this note.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.280
Take control of an object's Normal's you'll see that the vector coordinates or the direction the normals

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.730
are facing in we will observe are represented as a world space normals.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.110
So before we've been dealing with tangential or even objects space these are going to be represented

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.140
in world space although looks similar but slightly different to what we've seen in the past.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.960
And we shall use this node to control the amount of four.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.000
Now based upon the amount of roughness that surface has.

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.120
So before we go and hop on over into blender let's just go through a quick reminder of normals I'm sure

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.210
you've all got this by now.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.440
Here we have a very simple ice sphere with the face Normal's projected out.

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.550
And let's just see what we're aiming to do with the node itself.

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.610
And I'm gonna to grab a pen and digital bits of paper to show you what's going to go on.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.940
Okay so we're going to have the camera in the scene itself.

15
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.460
That's in here and here we have a circle for instance with its Normal's coming out and a money going

16
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.500
to draw a few of them.

17
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.440
Obviously there's a lot of Normal's when it comes out of the circle.

18
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.780
And this is a true representation of course.

19
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.520
We're going to really deal with a sphere now these normals here are not going to be seen by the camera

20
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.990
itself.

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So we can ignore those completely in this example.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.450
But what we can do with the geometry node is tell blender instead of the normal going out in its normal

23
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.800
direction.

24
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.180
Every single normal faces the camera obviously they're going to look odd but we can use that to our

25
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.750
advantage when using it to control other nodes.

26
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.880
And we'll do that now as we hop on over into a blender.

27
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.880
So let's go play about with our node now and or our with our nodes and see what we can come up with.

28
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.570
And again I'm going to construct a simple scene or in this case I'm actually going to go to my scene

29
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.760
at the very back and we use control to turn everything on.

30
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:14.170
And I'm going to once again use a simple sphere to work with some and I open up my scene here and turn

31
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.800
everything off apart from fireball.

32
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.280
Parve fireballs he turns everything else off.

33
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.150
They're there and they're okay.

34
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.150
So we've got a very interesting shade a setup here a bit bely before we've got a bump node and the other

35
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.360
bits running around it with the wave texture.

36
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.220
Our believe I've applied the part of this to an admission shader So actually glows and lights up his

37
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.670
surroundings as well.

38
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.370
Hence its name fireball.

39
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.370
Anyway enough of this particular texture or this particular material wasn't going to do is actually

40
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.450
apply a PBR plastic to it.

41
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.330
So we can work with simple material.

42
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.630
Okay so what we need to do is first of all Add in a geometry node so we can work with that and then

43
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.840
go through and see how that actually affects the rest of our model.

44
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.720
So let's go into the node set up here and just have a look.

45
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.430
Okay so we need to add a geometry.

46
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.820
So go ahead and find that it's under input geometry and it gives us a series of options are run through

47
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.250
them really quickly but not in great detail.

48
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.530
The position is it's position in the world.

49
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.470
So if I literally move that about's you can see it changes colour depending on it's X Y Z location okay

50
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.670
are not moving up and down.

51
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.330
It's just easier not to do that's normal.

52
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.150
Well unsurprisingly that is the world Normal's and that is the standard normal coming off of this particular

53
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.650
object.

54
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.650
This sphere itself has hundreds of normal spread out across its surface in the direction or the vector

55
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.310
coordinates of those normals relate directly to the colour mix in between all the shades.

56
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.660
Tangent is it's tangential coordinates based upon the real world True normal.

57
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.080
Now we're going to have a little bit of a hard time seeing this on this particular object.

58
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.370
Yeah.

59
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.590
There we go.

60
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.260
This is how it looks without the smoothing applied.

61
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.300
So even if your model is smooth you can use the true Normal's rather than the interpolated ones between

62
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.590
when you've got smooth shading turned on incoming.

63
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.740
Now that has made all.

64
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.090
Obviously if we zoom in really closely on that submit this bigger it will change the normal slightly

65
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.630
depending on the angle to the camera.

66
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.280
But as we zoom out we end up with all the normals pretty much facing the same direction towards the

67
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.160
camera or in this case the viewport parametric is interesting.

68
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.250
It's generally used to make lattices or grids if you want to go round that way back facing.

69
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.940
Now this is one that you can use to your advantage if you want one material on one side and one material

70
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.690
on another.

71
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.490
Because if the normals are facing outwards is coloured black and if they're facing inwards it's coloured

72
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.250
white.

73
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.940
The only way of doing that is to go inside and there we go.

74
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:25.090
That's the inside of our sphere going white pointy ness is something that's hard to show on this particular

75
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:33.310
model but it basically goes from black to white depending on convex or contÃ© or how concave something

76
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.730
is.

77
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.520
Now the surface of this sphere is continuously convex as it's uniform convexity.

78
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.070
I don't know if that's a word but it's great.

79
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.820
Unger's Stick with it it's uniform convect So is all one colour as it goes round.

80
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.660
Now if we were to make it a dimple or have a sharp ridge you could then see the effect.

81
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.670
So if it's incredibly sharp coming out.

82
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.130
Out of your model being concave.

83
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:09.080
It will be almost white and if it's going into your model and is equally as sharp had deep groove that

84
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.030
will be coloured close to black and you can use a figure like a colour ramp or a brightness and contrast

85
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.540
node in order to exaggerate that.

86
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.870
And then perhaps set up a mic shader with two different outputs and depending on those outputs you can

87
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.900
use the pointedness to basically colour anything that has a sharp output or perhaps a rust material

88
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.440
or a more worn material.

89
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.290
You often find that painted surfaces that have sharp edges.

90
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.460
The paint wears off of the sharp edges rather than the flat face.

91
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.240
So you can use that type of control.

92
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:51.640
Now we need to basically see what's the effect of this on our friend nele node.

93
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.940
Now the issue with having a node group like this is I can't just see what the French l.a. looks like.

94
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.720
I can't pull it like I can normally.

95
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.250
So in this particular case there's a couple of options we could rearrange the group in order to work

96
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.480
out what's going on a move the fanelle outside and that's a bit a faff.

97
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.290
So in this particular case I'm going to tab out and I'm going to go to the node menu and ungroup or

98
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.950
Altern G and then I'll just break everything out of that group again.

99
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.770
Okay so let's now have a look at what's going on and leave enough space here and zoom in.

100
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.240
So we've got our standard set up that we've played with plenty of times.

101
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.260
Okay I'm happy with everything here.

102
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:43.790
So what we want here are we don't have a value node coming in here to control it so let's add a value

103
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.890
node.

104
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.700
So here we go.

105
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.140
Value node then we can control this top value by the power of 2.5.

106
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.710
And that's going to control our roughness.

107
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.730
Let's just make sure everything's working.

108
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.930
So obviously a value of one is going to be totally rough.

109
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.600
Valid point five is going to be slightly shiny.

110
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.380
And point one has some gloss.

111
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.960
We can see the area around it.

112
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:10.130
Now I'm going to colour in the surface a darker colour just so we can see the reflections a little more

113
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.920
clearly.

114
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.250
There we go.

115
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:13.700
Perfect.

116
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.180
I can actually see the reflections really well.

117
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.380
So let's have a look at the final l.a. and see what's going on here.

118
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.500
The case of this is the fanelle fall off as standard now as standard.

119
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.260
Is this normal here.

120
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.950
So let's go ahead and plug that in and make sure it's still working.

121
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.460
Excellent.

122
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.780
Now what happens if we try some of these off of once.

123
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.850
That's not giving us the desired results.

124
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.830
That's not given a desired result true normal.

125
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.600
Well that's going to be the same as normal just a bit more faceted incoming.

126
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.520
Ah okay.

127
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.550
That's just unplug that.

128
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.080
If we look at the very centre of this particular for a nail.

129
00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.460
If we plug in incoming The normals are all facing us.

130
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.350
So there's no more for an l effect.

131
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:10.850
So if we were to mix between these two we should be able to control the an l.a. Based upon this value

132
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.900
down here.

133
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.930
So this is one of the ways we can actually change this for an L around.

134
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.530
And that leads me onto a challenge.

135
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.320
Okay I'd like to go ahead and set up your notes.

136
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:33.310
So finish off the set up of our own notes so that as the roughness increases you'll want the friend

137
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.760
nail effect to decrease.

138
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.540
Give it some thought.

139
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.310
Pause the video now and give that a go.

140
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.520
Okay guys welcome back.

141
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.620
Let's go finish off the set up of our notes and control the roughness.

142
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.330
And for now with only one slider.

143
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.730
Okay so we are almost here at the moment.

144
00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.790
Now we've got a geometry node here and we need to blend between.

145
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.080
I think we need to blend between normal and incoming.

146
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:12.040
Now there are a couple of ways of blending but because these values here are vector values we can actually

147
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.590
use the karbalaa mix.

148
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.040
RG B node we were using in the last section.

149
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.820
So let's just add these two together.

150
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:27.100
Incoming on the bottom and normal on the top of a pole the output here see what happens as we go from

151
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.570
one at the other.

152
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.460
Okay.

153
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:35.680
Let's plug the colour output here into the normal input here.

154
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:43.390
Now hopefully that won't need any anything else doing to it because obviously where we've got normal

155
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:49.630
values coming in and normal values coming out now obviously we can change the ratio of mixes through

156
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.350
here because the mix node here will be assuming is a colour going through.

157
00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.140
So it may actually change the well colour correct it basically.

158
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.410
So if you have to be a little bit careful when we use the r.g. node like this but let's let's move this

159
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.910
down and hopefully we see the fanelle effect come back into full effect.

160
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.640
Perfect.

161
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:16.090
So now let's just make sure we've got vs the right way around.

162
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.820
I think we have the best thing to do is plug this in.

163
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:27.250
So when it's glossy or a value of zero here we want it to be fully normal so the top one.

164
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.030
Excellent.

165
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:33.550
And as we move across as we increase the roughness we want the frontal effect to go down.

166
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.230
Now it's only ever going to go up to one.

167
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:42.460
So one should be completely uniformly not black but it's going to be about 20 percent grey or something

168
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.380
on those lines.

169
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.960
Okay that looks like it's working really well.

170
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:52.570
So let's go out and poll the mix shader And let's see what happens so I'm going to hold down Shift so

171
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.590
I can wear my scanner click this and go between them.

172
00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:03.160
Okay so this is almost 100 percent reflective in this case and we've got a nice reflection going around

173
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.310
our model and let's make it slightly rougher.

174
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.640
And as it's getting rougher the frontal effects should start falling off.

175
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.450
And of course we can add other things in here to change the fall off rate.

176
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.000
Perfect.

177
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:22.360
So this is getting quite rough now and there's still a little bit of reflection is not very clear anymore

178
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.070
but it's starting to work really really well.

179
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.210
This is very close to how the real world works.

180
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.350
So we've got a value node here that's controlling all of this.

181
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.850
Now what we can do is pop this all back in.

182
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:45.710
To our mix or sorry into our group says Go ahead here and you'd make a group.

183
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.640
Okay so we've got a group impot What do we want to control.

184
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.730
Well we want to control the this value here now.

185
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.830
There's no input to this value.

186
00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:05.440
So what we can do here is literally drag a value across to the input here and then link it up.

187
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:12.110
Individually there we get through it it's called value here that a value is no good it doesn't explain

188
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.610
what is going to be roughness.

189
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.900
Okay perfect.

190
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:22.440
What else do we need to make sure we've got on this input so we can control it well if it's got texture

191
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.910
we're going to want to control the Normal's of everything here.

192
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.730
So let's go ahead and do that now.

193
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.100
So I'm just literally going to link them one by one in here.

194
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.800
So normal.

195
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.370
I just pulled that out saw some wound going to have to plug it back in a moment.

196
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.970
So what makes the colour coming out of here.

197
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.230
This was the rough nurse.

198
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:55.660
The facts of the colour comes out into that normal sense that normal there needs to be controlled by

199
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.200
here.

200
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:03.100
So here we've got an issue where if we want the normal to affect the free now we can't have it coming

201
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:10.750
in so we'll have to mix those or even add them together if we want to control the for now with a normal

202
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.660
map as well.

203
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.680
I don't think that's necessary in this particular case.

204
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.890
I'm going to leave it out.

205
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:21.380
Now I do want the base colour coming out so I'm going to plug this in and I'm not leave as colour.

206
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.780
I'm going to call it diffuse or bass or whatever you're working with.

207
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.970
How bideau Map is another name it's used to diffuse colour.

208
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.140
Of course that could be a texture.

209
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.280
There could be no end of things.

210
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.870
Is anything else that I want to expose to the outside of this node.

211
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.460
I don't think there is colour.

212
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.700
No the colour of the reflections.

213
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.510
I'm going to leave as they are.

214
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.290
The power.

215
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.600
Do I want to be able to control that rate.

216
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.760
No that's fine.

217
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.300
So I got this loose end entity here I'm going to get rid of that.

218
00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:58.490
Okay.

219
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:04.290
And Tab outside I've now got this noad group that has a roughness slider that I can control.

220
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:11.010
Obviously it only controls it between 0 and 1 anything greater than that is just a 100 percent smoother

221
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.750
100 percent rough.

222
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.160
Now most things in the real world are not rough.

223
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.990
Of course it can go up.

224
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:23.880
Sorry not the entirely rough or entirely smooth slightly polished in certain places.

225
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:30.390
So again going back to using textures to control things I could put in a wave texture here and plug

226
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.830
it into roughness and you can see here.

227
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.660
Well it almost has a ripple effect in this case.

228
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:42.330
But if I scale that down just a little perhaps to 1 so we have got so much we can see as glossy and

229
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:48.260
places and matine Others as if it's been slightly polished somewhere and not in other places.

230
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:54.060
And again when we link this together we can see that the black band itself as to go back to our node

231
00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:02.510
group black band is indicating where it's going to be most glossy and the white band is where it's going

232
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:07.560
to be most Matt and we can use that to our advantage obviously wheezing a texture here so it's not going

233
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.180
to have quite the effect that I'd like to demonstrate.

234
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:15.470
But if you had if you had mapped your particular sphere here that we were working on.

235
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.580
There was a particular area of it that was handled often so hed naturally polished.

236
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.340
Again that can help with the realism of your models were some bits are going to be naturally more polished

237
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.100
or glossy than others so I'm just going to clear that out there.

238
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:36.300
The final thing that I haven't done here I am going to change that back to a red because I do like that

239
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:44.550
read and I'm going to make it a little bit lighter again is actually save this particular material.

240
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:52.530
Otherwise it's going to get lost so I've only played with my default settings here so all I need to

241
00:16:52.530 --> 00:17:00.450
do is literally save the start-up file but before I do that I do want to make sure I'm back in a kind

242
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.850
of a default position so I usually look from this angle.

243
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.230
It doesn't matter whether you are in rendered mode or not automatically will open like this.

244
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:17.160
So you got a stage there and a good flip back round to lael one about open this back up again so that's

245
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.340
how I want it.

246
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.820
Next time I start.

247
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.280
And of course you can adjust yours to how ever you like.

248
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.600
I'm going to hide the rest of my examples.

249
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.460
Close down the hierarchy here.

250
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.560
I like that that all looks good.

251
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:38.070
So I'm going to save my start-up file and that's now save that new PBR plastic material we've improved

252
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:45.020
upon it because now we're able to change the roughness and the final effect on the same time.

253
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.470
How did you guys get on.

254
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.910
Are you starting to get the hang of modifying your original blend files every time you open it up.

255
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.360
You're not having to start afresh anymore.

256
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.350
It's incredibly useful being able to do that.

257
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:03.320
As always make sure you show your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
