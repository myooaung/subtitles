00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,910
Hey guys so welcome to the section on VFX.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,040
Lots to cover in here.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,890
We're going to start with a still image and actually put CGI into a real photo.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,280
And then there's a bonus we're going to have video and put the CGI applying in this case into that in

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,520
the posh strip along with lots of fun.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,720
But what's this section all about then.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,780
So where bonus section again because we started all of this with a Kickstarter.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,140
We made some promises and we plan on delivering our promises.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,180
So you're getting this content for free.

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,680
That's why it's called a bonus section.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,170
It's smaller than some of the others because we focus tightly on the fact you already know how to use

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,270
Blender and now you putting the icing on the cake and bringing it into video.

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,800
So lots of skills to learn.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,080
Why why start their first lecture.
