00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,810
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,360
In this lecture we're going to talk about our first materials.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,020
Now you may have something like this more complex or even simpler.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,880
It doesn't really matter which model we've got at the moment.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,240
It's a bit plain and boring.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,970
How about if we change it slightly.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,350
So we have some colors much much better straight away.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,660
Let's hop over into blender and find out some more.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,710
OK so over in the default blender file at the moment and we've got a cube in front of us.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,860
Now the first thing we're going to have to do is make sure that we can see any of the material changes

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,570
we make at the moment.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,820
Our view is in what's called Solid mode which means that we're not really going to be able to see any

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,980
colors that we applied to our model.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,800
So how do we go and change that so we can see what's going on.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,700
Well at the very top of the 3D view we have our toolbar and we've got these three spheres to the right

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,620
hand side.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,930
We've got wireframe mode solid mode which means it's going to not have any color.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,430
Look Dev and rendered we want to be looked dev for the moment which is the third one along.

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,900
Once that's set we're ready to make our first material on a wide in this area to the right.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,910
So with our cube selected and we know it's selected because it's got this light orange border around

21
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,120
it I'm going to go to the materials properties.

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,620
So going to go over to our properties window and if you can't see everything here I'm just going to

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,510
condense this as if you're on a smaller screen or maybe you've move these around you can use the scroll

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,790
wheel to go up and down on this tab system on the left hand side.

25
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,390
To make that launcher again and if we go down nearly at the bottom we've got this sphere.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,030
If we go ahead hover over it says material click on it.

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,290
It takes us to our material properties.

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,120
So at the moment this cube has a material called material assigned to it.

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,320
Now you can have more than one material assigned to an object but we're just going to stay with one

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,070
for the moment.

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,500
Now I can rename that material by even double clicking as the hover over actually showed all going down

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,320
here and I'm going to type in red here and you can see it's updated at the top here.

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,110
Now if you've got more than one material in your scene what you can do is use this dropdown to select

34
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,750
a different material that's very useful if you've built up a repertoire of materials that you've stored

35
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,120
or you've already set the material up and you want so apply it to a new object.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,450
Right.

37
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,460
Let's go down a little further.

38
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:38,080
If your use nodes is not blue it will be turned off for this section and most sections we're going to

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,580
have to make sure use nodes is turned on you will then see we're using the Surface shader principled

40
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,030
B SDF.

41
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,070
Don't worry about that.

42
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,410
We'll cover that in much more detail later on.

43
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,370
But that's essentially what's producing all of this detail down here.

44
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:03,260
Now this is the setup of how the light is interacting with the surface of our cube and it can get quite

45
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,920
complex.

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,070
And again don't worry we'll break this down later on in the course.

47
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,090
You have a much deeper understanding for the moment though.

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,130
We just want to focus on the base color.

49
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,600
So go ahead and click the colored area to the right of base color and we can pick a different color

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,550
in this case is going to be a red color because that's what we selected.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,880
So on the color well I've selected a hue.

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,980
That's kind of ready now going to drag the slider down on the side here.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
So it's a darker red.

54
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:37,590
Now you can select them in this way which is B were either with hue saturation and value as well so

55
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,930
we can change the hue with this slider here.

56
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:47,240
The saturation is how much color there is and the value is light and dark and that's roughly in the

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,720
middle for the moment not 50 percent but we'll cover that later as well.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,470
Okay.

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,570
So that's our material assigned.

60
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:01,370
So let's go and add another objects to our scene shift in a adding an object in a mesh object u v sphere

61
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,130
and I'm going to press the GK and just move over here now because the materials properties were selected

62
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,230
before we see the our sphere has been added but it doesn't have a default property like the default

63
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,290
cube did.

64
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,350
So that's something to bear in mind that things that you add don't necessarily come with the material

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,900
already assigned to them.

66
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,560
So what we can do is go to the dropdown and pick red pretty cool.

67
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,740
Hey let's say we didn't one red what can we do.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,260
Well if we go ahead and rename it let's say yellow and then go and change the base color down here to

69
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,860
a yellow 0.

70
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,340
Both of them have changed and that's because both of them are sharing the same material which is really

71
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,360
really useful.

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,930
But you can get caught out like this.

73
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,050
So what's I'm going to do is I'm no go controlling Z and undo both of those steps.

74
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:56,600
Now notice that the moment we gave this the red material and number two appeared this number two shows

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,300
us that two objects in our entire scene share that material.

76
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,020
Now we duplicated these objects.

77
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,410
Let's do it.

78
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,600
Now let's draw a box around them duplicate them yes I know you've created the lamp as well but we can

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,500
see that the numbers now for items in our scene noticed that we've now got two objects selected we've

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,730
got one with a light orange border and one with a dark orange border.

81
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,900
When you're looking at the properties of something you're looking at the properties of the wall the

82
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,540
lighter orange border around it.

83
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,600
So if we were to go ahead and click on this for it will make a single user copy so it's taken all of

84
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,080
the settings that we already had with that red and made a new material in this case called Red 0 0 1.

85
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:48,240
Now I can call it yellow and switch out the color to something else independently of everything on here.

86
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,360
The other thing that we can do is just create a new material so I select this other cube I can delete

87
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,720
the red material or delete the red slot and then it will go back to the defaults or plain white color

88
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:06,020
and create a new material and call it blue whatever you want here and come to our base color and make

89
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,390
it black.

90
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,890
So there's a couple of different ways of changing around materials.

91
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,780
Now I do want to show you one final thing before I crack onto your challenge and that's with something

92
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,500
a bit more complex.

93
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,350
Let's call it complex for the moment.

94
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,450
So I'm going to go and open up my well that I had before.

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,820
Okay.

96
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,590
So with the well opened up here I produced in the last lecture.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,330
This is quite a complex objects.

98
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,160
And I want to show you one of the ways that you could deal with having a mistake made.

99
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,490
Obviously are going to learn from this as we go.

100
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,160
But I didn't rename or give any of these materials as I was going they're all individual objects.

101
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,310
So it's gonna be a real pain if I have to go through whole down shift and select multiple ones of these.

102
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:56,970
So selecting multiple ones and going new material calling it's going to make a pink roof tile here to

103
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:05,480
really highlights and make sure and look Dev mode but only one of those tiles is actually selected and

104
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,450
only one of them has been changed to pink all of the others as they were before.

105
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,980
Is there a quick way of transferring the material on one object to many others.

106
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,220
Well yes there is.

107
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,580
So I'm going to box select everything because these tiles are the most numerous and it'll be the most

108
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,190
tricky things to pick with perhaps the exception that the slats holding up the roof.

109
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,410
OK.

110
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,760
So with everything selected what we can do is we can have everything else inherits the properties of

111
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:42,900
that one selected item by holding down control and pressing the L key so we're going to make links to

112
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,890
all of the other selected objects to the active selected.

113
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,230
So if I go materials or.

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,730
Okay the whole thing's gone pink I'm going to change that to something a little less offensive to my

115
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,360
eyes because that was really bright and now we've got everything.

116
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,900
Sharing one material and we can do the same if we came down to let's say these bricks down here and

117
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,930
then I will show you one final thing so I'm going to highlight all of these bricks.

118
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,670
And notice that the ground has also been selected but nothing else has got a hold down shift and clicked

119
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:20,870
the ground twice twice because I needed to select it once to make it the actors selected and then click

120
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,340
it again to D select it I'm going to select with the shift key held down.

121
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,350
One other brick and we can see that's become the active item now from this what I can do is I'm going

122
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:38,820
to delete that pink slots and I'm going to introduce a new material called brick and I'm going to immediately

123
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:45,960
inherits I'm going to go control an L so all of these dark orange ones are going to inherits the active

124
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,210
selected material I control an L materials.

125
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,200
Now they all share the brick I can change them to any color I want.

126
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,190
Hey guys.

127
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,310
Mark here with just a little update for you I want to come in here and give you a little bit of insight

128
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,560
into collections here because they can't be used and be really really helpful when you're selecting

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,750
things in things like these what you've got here is my scene I've got a little bit of a difference where

130
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,130
my train being a bit bumpy Why do I like you to do it's cauterized the right my screen and the outline

131
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,730
here where you can see I've got my well in a collection and what I've done differently to Mikey is I've

132
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:31,110
got my tiles my brakes and all of my framework in separate collections underneath the collection now

133
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,690
I'd like to show you is it say we want to select all of the tiles in my thing this is going to take

134
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:44,320
a while doing it this way what you can do is you can go to your tiles right click and you can select

135
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:52,570
objects on this will select everything underneath that collection and then we have all our tile selected

136
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,330
and you can do the same for the bricks.

137
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,820
Make sure you have the breaks selected right click and then select objects.

138
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,830
And it will add to the selection as well so you can add the bricks to the selection you already had

139
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,390
with the tiles.

140
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,350
Hope this helps.

141
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,580
And now back to my key.

142
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:17,860
One final thing if I wanted to select all of these that share the same material I can simply go shift

143
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,850
and L and select material.

144
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,400
So there we go.

145
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,790
There's a really quick way that you can go ahead and select anything that shares the same material.

146
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,720
And now as a matter of going around the rest of your model and sorting that out which is a perfect time

147
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,730
for your challenge.

148
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,110
Okay.

149
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,520
So your challenge a nice straightforward one.

150
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:43,060
I'd like you to coloring your model and make at least three materials and apply them to your model so

151
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,220
it's not just one color.

152
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,210
It's gonna be at least three if you have more on your model.

153
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,870
That's absolutely fine as well.

154
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,070
Pause a video and give that's a go okay.

155
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,890
Everybody welcome back.

156
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,900
Let's hop over now and color in our model.

157
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,600
Okay everybody Welcome back.

158
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay so we're we're pretty far on at the moment.

159
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,610
Couple of other things that I need to do I need to do the tiles at some point and these wooden beams

160
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:14,560
so often it's easier to get this going from the word go with the correct materials so that as I duplicated

161
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,570
them they would have the materials attached to them.

162
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,860
So that's a learning point from us moving on.

163
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,040
So I've got the tiles here.

164
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:27,390
I think I'm going to call this pink tiles so I know that the tiles are now all sorted and I can go in

165
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,360
and make them dark or lights or different color later on.

166
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,090
It doesn't matter.

167
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,940
Well let's set it.

168
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,670
Now let's set to maybe a slight to light color.

169
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:44,190
Okay let's select the ground delete the material slot that says tiles new material and it's gonna be

170
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:53,240
called ground I'm going to make it a green for the moment a darker green Okay so the next thing are

171
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,330
these wooden beams I'm going to go in and I should if we look at it from the right angle be able to

172
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,300
just select the main beams.

173
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,860
Excellent.

174
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,170
So I'm gonna delete and add in a new material.

175
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,060
What shall we call it.

176
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,010
Let's call this beams and then we'll call the other ones slats.

177
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,660
I don't know what the technical term is.

178
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,740
So this is gonna be a oh not a pink a brown.

179
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,480
So we're gonna go out there and I'm gonna have its inherits all of these other ones.

180
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,330
Now I've missed a couple of extra ones.

181
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm going to select those making sure that this top one is the last one that's selected go control L

182
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,400
and link in those materials.

183
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,500
Perfect.

184
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,380
Now the next one are these here.

185
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,510
Now do these share the same.

186
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,910
No.

187
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,610
They're not linked duplicates.

188
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,890
Okay it's going to look at the straights on and then go up this way I think that's gonna be the easiest

189
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,570
way of doing this.

190
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:57,630
Now one thing to bear in mind is whenever you're doing a big selection like this I keep accidentally

191
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:03,700
selecting this big one so I'm just gonna ignore it and remove it at the very end so there's that.

192
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,050
No I'm not going to attempt to do the other side at the moment.

193
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,190
It's so easy for me to inadvertently select the other end.

194
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,940
Oh here we go.

195
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,730
I've accidentally selected one there straightaway but it's very easy for me to accidentally select something

196
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,750
and ruin my selection overall.

197
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,630
Something to keep it as it is there.

198
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm going to go into my material slots.

199
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,280
I don't have an active one selected at the moment.

200
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,560
Let's make one of these active.

201
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,610
There we go.

202
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,900
Materials delete that add in the new material.

203
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm going to call it a slot.

204
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,810
I'm not even sure how you spell slats.

205
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,780
I think it's like that.

206
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,320
Anyway I'm sure one of you will correct me if I'm wrong and I'm going to make this sort of a lighter

207
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,660
yellow just so I can see the difference and then control an l I'm going to inherit those material properties

208
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,600
and then if you wanted to you could go down each one of these individually as well and add in slats

209
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,480
but I can't be bothered to do it like that so I'm going to select all the these other ones.

210
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,580
Plus it's a really inefficient way of doing it and control l materials.

211
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,750
Okay.

212
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,350
So we've got all of our materials separated out.

213
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,280
Hey I'm pretty happy with it apart from this kind of Pinkie brick color.

214
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,590
So let's come in make it a darker orange.

215
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,070
It's almost like it's Harry Potter Well at this point.

216
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,190
Sure we have terracotta tiles.

217
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,820
Instead let's call these terror terror tiles

218
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:38,710
and then what we should be able to do is select all of these with the same materials to shift an L material.

219
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,220
There we go.

220
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,520
I'm going to select one of these bricks down here.

221
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,080
Control an L and inherit the materials.

222
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,410
There we go.

223
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:51,090
So we've got a terracotta tile and then I should be able to just switch this over to tiles.

224
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,610
That's what I want to highlight everything.

225
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,170
These select the ground select this brick and control and l think materials.

226
00:14:59,170 --> 00:14:59,630
Okay.

227
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:05,950
So that looks to me a little bit better and I can make this terracotta style tile a little bit redder

228
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,780
and a little bit darker.

229
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,310
Anyway I could faffing around now for the rest of the day just tweaking this but it's not worth investing

230
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,120
that much more time in this particular model.

231
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,250
We've got a very basic well here.

232
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,010
Does it work.

233
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,550
Does it stand as it is.

234
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,900
I'm happy with it.

235
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,720
I wouldn't want to start adding more detail to it because it's just not necessary at this point in time.

236
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,130
And that is something that you'll have to hold yourself back from it's just going to file with your

237
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,380
models sometimes by all means.

238
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,140
I'm not saying don't but just be aware of the time you're investing in a single model where you could

239
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,110
produce five or six different models and learn a lot more in the process.

240
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,710
So there we go.

241
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,600
There's my colored in Well I'm looking forward to seeing what Ali you've made all coloured in and if

242
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,390
yours hasn't been as complex as this one.

243
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,220
That's okay.

244
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:59,650
I probably have gone a bit overboard with the amount of objects in this scene so I'm really happy with

245
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,170
how minds worked out here if I had wanted to criticisms I'd probably say that I've perhaps gotten a

246
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,330
bit carried away with making mine but if you've done that as well you know that's absolutely fine if

247
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,180
you're enjoying the process just go with the flow.

248
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,980
Now we're not quite there yet but we're almost to the point where we can start sharing our models but

249
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,290
we need to learn to render and we need to learn to light task seen a little bit as well.

250
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,250
And those will be in the next lectures.

251
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,890
See you soon.
