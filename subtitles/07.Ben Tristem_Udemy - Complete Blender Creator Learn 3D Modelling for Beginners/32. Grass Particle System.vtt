00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.850
And this show is creating some very simple grass using our hair particle system.

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.570
Quick note to start off is I've just organized my collections a little bit.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.410
It's been a real mess.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.660
Apologies if you're the sort of person who has been yelling at the computers saying, Rick, organize

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.070
your collection, why don't ya?

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.240
So I've just got lights reference cat and we're about to create some ground.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.860
So let's do that.

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.620
Let's shift a mesh plane at ourselves.

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.240
A plane s to scale it up, up, up, up, around about dead on it.

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.920
Two huge rolls.

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.620
My computer's gonna go a little bit crazy, but I need it big enough so that if my camera is back,

12
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.300
a little bit more things fit on there.

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.250
So they'll be a little bit of fine tuning.

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.170
But as we've learned, it's better to try to get these things as close as possible from the get go and

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.860
not to be editing geometry or scaling things at the end.

16
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.290
I'm just going to control a and set the or apply all the transforms just out of habit.

17
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.420
So we apply our scaling that we just did.

18
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.740
I'm trying to replicate my image in the background there where I've just got the cat walking through

19
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.280
a fairly flat ground plain of the grass.

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.850
I'll turn the other couple of images off.

21
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.530
Actually, these two over here, you know, does rename plane to be a ground.

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.110
I'm on a little bit of a naming Sprey here at the moment.

23
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.780
Put that into that ground folder or collection.

24
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.750
Sorry, I start by clicking on my material properties.

25
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.860
Add new.

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.380
Changed the name of this double click, change it to ground grass.

27
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.450
I think I'll call this.

28
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.590
Now you can see that I've got my shader ed open and we've already got things starting to come to life

29
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.150
over in the shade.

30
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.860
Ed, give ourselves a little bit more space.

31
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.600
I'm going to shift a texture and image texture, pop that next door to our principal, connect color

32
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.140
to color.

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.930
I'm going to open and I've gone and downloaded myself.

34
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.050
Let me show you an image from texture's dot com.

35
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.450
So I just went and typed in a grass.

36
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.070
There's a bunch of cool things we get here.

37
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.220
I'm just looking for sort of grass ground that I could use to put underneath all of the grass particles.

38
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.510
So grab yourself a texture, download that, navigate to where it's hiding mine.

39
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.680
What did I call it in the end?

40
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.870
Grass, ground texture.

41
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.410
Wonderful.

42
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.010
You can see that's brought that in.

43
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.360
Nothing's appearing at the moment.

44
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.970
That's because I'm not in one of my views that can view it.

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.540
There we go.

46
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.280
Now it's a little bit scaled up.

47
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.130
So the way we go about giving ourselves control of the scaling makes sure under edit preferences that

48
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.200
you've got node wrangler turned on.

49
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.690
So search for node wrangler.

50
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.460
Mine is indeed turned on.

51
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.120
That will allow us to mouseover our image that we just brought in our grass, ground texture and control

52
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.590
t that will add.

53
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.540
Next door we've got mapping and texture coordinate plugged into the appropriate places.

54
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.910
Now we can find scale just shift and drag from X, Y and Z.

55
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.420
And I'm gonna make mine five on the scale that scales it all up nicely.

56
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.370
Now, Slavitt white and shiny.

57
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.010
That is because if you look at our principal best, D.F., I need to put the specular all the way down

58
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.580
to zero and we don't have that shininess on our grass ground plane.

59
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.210
Now, doesn't matter if it looks a little bit crummy because we're going to be putting grass over the

60
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.630
top of it.

61
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.740
I was want to make sure we're not looking down below and seeing, say, a white ground plane.

62
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.230
Okay.

63
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.320
At this point, I've got a challenge for you, which is to add some grass just using our regular old

64
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.170
particle system with no imported image and no other magic, just the techniques that we've been using

65
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.360
to put hair and fur on various things.

66
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.710
We can do the same thing with grass.

67
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.130
The bonus points add some colour variation for your grass.

68
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.870
So there's a challenge for you.

69
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.920
See if you can figure that out.

70
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.980
And when you come back, I'll go through adding some simple grass into my scene.

71
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.290
Okey dokey, now, with any particle system, there's a lot of fiddling and playing around and seeing

72
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.930
what numbers you like best.

73
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.050
So I'm going to do the best to not do too much fiddling around on screen.

74
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.400
I'll see if I can figure it out straight away or in a click on my particle properties.

75
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.060
Plus, rename this to be simple grass.

76
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.060
I think I'll call this make it hair, decrease the haling down to, I think point eight.

77
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.310
Leave the number a thousand for the moment.

78
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.390
I think that's fine.

79
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.820
I'm going to pop into my rended view.

80
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.420
It's going to slow things up considerably, but at least they'll start to get a little bit of a feel

81
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.000
for what's happening in my scene and a bit of randomness through roughness.

82
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.470
So scrolling down down actually will add on some children.

83
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.590
For now, I'm just gonna put this at, say, three.

84
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.700
But the render amount.

85
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.050
I'm going to have y hired, say, 50, so I'm not going to see the density that I'm looking for.

86
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.700
But hopefully that will have our spin out to look at things a lot more quickly without having all of

87
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.710
that on the screen now under roughness.

88
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.420
I'm going to try to adding in a little bit of point three into the random and you can see it's looking

89
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.250
very angular.

90
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.690
That to me says that somewhere we don't have enough strands on the viewport display.

91
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.910
I'll increase that to four.

92
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.480
And what do we have under our render?

93
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.930
We've got steps in our path is three will increase that to four as well.

94
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.820
See how we go, the hair shape.

95
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.810
I'm going to change the diameter to make diameter to make it a little bit bigger.

96
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.770
One point five.

97
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.680
And the strange shape, if we go in the negative direction, we're going to have a taller, skinnier

98
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.780
type of grass.

99
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.710
If we go in the positive, it's gonna be fatter down the bottom and then just pointy at the ends.

100
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.180
I'm going to try.

101
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.030
Point four and see how that looks.

102
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.460
And at this point, I'll do a little test render.

103
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.460
I'd much rather be working in Eevee because Eevee we can do things way quicker, but the particle system

104
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.970
just looks so different in Eevee compared to how it looks in cycles.

105
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.370
So I want to end up in cycles.

106
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.110
Icona need to be looking at it in cycles.

107
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.840
As you can see here, my camera is in totally the wrong spot.

108
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.430
So let's go ahead and put our camera in a place where we're actually going to be out to see what's going

109
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.880
on.

110
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.450
Turn our camera on.

111
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.150
Whereas it at the moment it's in nice and close underground.

112
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.890
That would be it.

113
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.620
GZ, move it up.

114
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.410
Now I can see it.

115
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.150
And on my keyboard I'm going to find view change lock camera to view.

116
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.690
Excellent.

117
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.250
I'll get in again.

118
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.750
I'll get roughly the spot that I want.

119
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.850
It gets can be a little bit higher than I would have preferred.

120
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.390
I want to get too much of this foreground grass right in the face of the camera.

121
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:03.160
So I'm going to hit control all zero and we will position the camera position position.

122
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.990
You can see a little bit of the extra grass plain exposed the edge of it here.

123
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.310
We'll deal with that a little bit later on.

124
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.270
I'm just going to get a few things set up and see outlooks do a render while it's rendering.

125
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.310
I'm going to jump back to Blender.

126
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.010
Just hit an on lock camera to view it.

127
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.460
You can see we've got some starting point for our grass already.

128
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.960
I don't think it's got enough kind of variance variation and way Venus in it.

129
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.690
So let's do a little bit of twiddling with that.

130
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.920
One other thing we could be doing in here, I could have mentioned this about 50 videos ago, but we

131
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.420
can jump over into render.

132
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.840
And in terms of the number of samples we're taking, we could pump this down and change it to thirty

133
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.920
to see if that's good enough.

134
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.390
Okay, that's a good starting point.

135
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.610
What I'll do next is I think I'll add some colour variation into our particles.

136
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.880
So click on the plane, come down to our materials.

137
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.920
I'm going to click on Plus to add a new one.

138
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.090
Or I could have clicked on new.

139
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.380
That would've been the smart thing to do.

140
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.630
Click on new does plus add new at the same time.

141
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.950
Double click on material.

142
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.830
We will call this basic grass and we so we can see our results.

143
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.930
I'll jump over to particle properties.

144
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.340
We will find rindo.

145
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.370
Where are you Rindo.

146
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.400
There we go.

147
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.630
No, that was there we go.

148
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.100
Render material.

149
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.400
I'll change the basic grass.

150
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.350
It should all go white.

151
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.010
Yes it does.

152
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.080
Over into our shader.

153
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.630
Ed, we've been through this before.

154
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.130
Little mini challenge for you.

155
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.540
If you didn't take this on in the big challenge, how do you go about adding some colour variation to

156
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.380
our particles?

157
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.200
Well, shift a I'm going to search for color ramp.

158
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.990
Put that in there and then shift again.

159
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.470
I'm going to search for hair to say this is hair info.

160
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.150
Click out random Two-Factor, and then color to color.

161
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.370
Let's just do a little test.

162
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.450
Click on Black.

163
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.840
Change it to something that's super going to pop.

164
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.230
Yes.

165
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.410
And you can see in here we've got a mixture of that.

166
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:58.790
Whatever.

167
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.360
Pink color and white.

168
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.660
Great.

169
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.310
Now I'm going to.

170
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.440
Physical changes from pink back to more of a green cross turns to green and not pink.

171
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.380
I think I'll click.

172
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.840
Plus, plus, plus.

173
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.360
So now we've got five different colors.

174
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.550
So we go about the process of making a five colored lawn right at the top here.

175
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.580
I will give it a maybe a bit more of a yellowy kind of hue to it.

176
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.250
Not quite so bright.

177
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.870
And then we'll give it more of a brighter greeny type color.

178
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.910
Then a couple of darker ones.

179
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:36.860
I think a darker kind of green, maybe a little bit of a little bit of brownness in there as well.

180
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.590
We'll see if we can get a bit of that in there as the same before.

181
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.420
I think we need a little bit more randomness in what we've got.

182
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:48.540
One way we can do that is by clicking on advanced and finding the physics and adding a little bit of

183
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.350
a force to it.

184
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.060
So under Brownian, let's add point oh five, nice and gentle at the start to see what happens.

185
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.310
I'm a little bit of squiggly nose in it, kind of sometimes it makes you strands go unnatural.

186
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.930
It doesn't just push them to the side.

187
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.070
It actually kind of makes them go jaggedly.

188
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.110
But we'll add a little bit of that and see what happens.

189
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.010
And also, I think a bit more of randomness.

190
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:14.610
So scrolling down, down, down to the roughness will increase the randomness to point six.

191
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.180
Maybe change a few these other variables, the end point.

192
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.110
Point one.

193
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.750
See if that does anything interesting.

194
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.510
Do another render.

195
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.970
I'm liking the unevenness a little bit more.

196
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.990
That's fine.

197
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.370
They haven't played around with these.

198
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.230
They're clumping.

199
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:27.990
So let's have a look.

200
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.800
If we clump just a little bit, increase the clumping.

201
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:32.790
We'll say.

202
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.200
Point three five.

203
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.610
See how that looks for us.

204
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.870
And give it a little bit of shape.

205
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.540
Maybe a point one eight seven.

206
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.990
Just experimenting here.

207
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.940
Grass naturally does clump.

208
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.430
It's not like one strand.

209
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.370
It grows on its own.

210
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.660
Grass tends to grow as little bowls of of grass, little clumps of grass.

211
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.120
So not seeing a lot of impact here from doing the clumping, but it does.

212
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.520
It's looking grass ish at the moment.

213
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.040
My goal here is just to get an underlying layer that we can then go and scatter some other little interesting

214
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.150
bits of grass throughout it.

215
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.190
So this is just the foundation, if you will.

216
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:05.830
Okay.

217
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.200
I've just been doing some fiddling off camera, and when I look at my reference image, the grass is

218
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.820
pretty consistent in terms of height.

219
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.440
It's as if it's been mown recently.

220
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.490
But I want some variation in mind to get the height variation in our particles.

221
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.030
We scroll down to timing and we see.

222
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.270
So this is under render.

223
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.300
And then under render, we have timing.

224
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.530
You can see random.

225
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.790
If you turn the random up, you'll have more of that random height for your particles.

226
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.240
And for me, I needed a little bit more depth when I did that.

227
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.510
So increased the render amount of my children to 100.

228
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.580
Now, when I do a render, it looks like this.

229
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.230
So that we have it, we still need a few other bits and pieces in the grass to make it look a bit more

230
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.620
natural.

231
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.510
But that's a very quick way of creating grass and also a safe way if you're having issues with other

232
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.900
ways of creating grass, such as having issues with transparency.

233
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.920
This is a nice, clean, safe way of creating some quick, simple grass.

234
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.270
I will see you in the next lecture.
