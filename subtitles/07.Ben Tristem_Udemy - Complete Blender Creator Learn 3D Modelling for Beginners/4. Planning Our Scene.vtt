00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:09.240
Welcome to planning our project in this video you get familiar with rabbits you will look at the desired

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.940
outcome and plan our modelling journey towards that goal.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.750
So what do I mean by that.

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.770
Well the section brief this section is actually going to have a self-contained brief so we stay on point.

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.270
It also allows you guys a bit of freedom if you want to experiment.

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.680
So simply put the rabbit is sat in grass and is still is going to be a summer's day with a light breeze.

7
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.000
There should be additional foliage around the rabbits perhaps a bush or a tree or something like that

8
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.120
and the rabbit does not have to be realistic so it could be out of proportion if you'd like.

9
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.170
Or more cartoony if you want.

10
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.700
So with that in mind and I'm going to leave it on the screen for a few moments start imagining the scene

11
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.920
itself.

12
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.210
So there's a rabbit sat in the grass and it's still well that means we're not going to have to animates

13
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.560
this particular rabbits.

14
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.340
It's a summer's day with the light breeze so there's gonna be probably some wind involved at some point.

15
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.080
There should be additional foliage around the rabbits so we're going to have to construct an environment

16
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.840
for the rabbit to be in and the rabbit does not have to be realistic so we can accentuate certain parts

17
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.180
and of course a rabbit is well known for its large is.

18
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.530
Perhaps we can go a little over the top with those and have a bit of fun.

19
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.360
Now of course in terms of reference material there's a good search engine out there called Google.

20
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.340
You can google pitches rabbits on that.

21
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:48.020
I've also included some reference material in the section assets the three different pictures of rabbits.

22
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.610
Just so that can get you started.

23
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.090
So do feel free to go and download those photos.

24
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.630
They'll be the ones that be using in the course ahead.

25
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.190
So with that I'd like you to pause a video and plan your own scene so design your rabbits.

26
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.690
Grab a pen and paper if necessary.

27
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.730
And don't worry you don't have to be an artist.

28
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.440
It doesn't have to be great.

29
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.680
Now focus on outlines rather than detail at this moment in time.

30
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.800
We're not we're not I'm not asking you to draw a picture of what we're about to do.

31
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.740
All I'm asking you to do is get the outline so you understand how the whole scene's going to come together.

32
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.530
The whole composition of the scene now design a scene that has a rabbit in a medium length grass.

33
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.050
And think about what's around the rabbits.

34
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.430
So design question so what is around the rabbit that's very important where are you going to position

35
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.940
your trees etc. or bushes or shrubs or long grass or think about all the things that you could put around

36
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.370
them and are there any parts of the rabbit we cannot see.

37
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.720
And if we can't see a rabbits or if we do I hope we can see the rabbit.

38
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.330
We can't see past the rabbit.

39
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.240
If we think why would we need to model that particular part of the rabbit.

40
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.690
Give that some thought.

41
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.460
Pulls the video now and give it a go.

42
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.000
Okay guys.

43
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.050
Welcome back.

44
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.800
Now it's time to see my drawing skills.

45
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.680
So I'm going to quickly hop over and design my scene.

46
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.480
Okay guys so I'm just using a program here called sketchbook and I've got a little graphic tablet.

47
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.610
It's just so you guys can see what's going on now in terms of this.

48
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.730
I am literally going to do as I've asked you to do a very rough outline so I'm going to have a head

49
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.690
of a rabbit with two ears.

50
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.540
Now I don't care if this looks like a child's drawing because essentially it is just an outline.

51
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.300
And of course it has a body.

52
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.860
And so gay and Jewely have legs etc..

53
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.600
But we're going to be placing our bunny in grass.

54
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.270
So I'm going to give it some rough grass around there.

55
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.500
Now it's going to be eating some grass around here etc. So we've got our bunny in grass so this area

56
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.970
of the bunny the base of the bunny itself is not going to have to be modelled in great detail.

57
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.930
In fact the focal point and are not undertaken to highlight this but here the focal points are going

58
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.510
to be the head of the bunny.

59
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.210
And of course if that is the case we don't want to spend too much time modelling feat that really can't

60
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.760
be seen obviously of the specification for our model.

61
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.350
Did say that the rabbit was hopping through the field.

62
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.430
Then we'd have to focus on some other bits and bobs aswell.

63
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.230
But since the rabbit is actually in tool or medium brass We don't need to worry about that.

64
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.320
So what else can we put in our scene.

65
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.460
Well to help frame our rabbits.

66
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.550
So if you think of a picture hanging on a wall it has a frame around it.

67
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.150
And sometimes when you look at the scene it's framed by things on the side so we could have some bushes

68
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.660
perhaps here or some bushes even on this side as well don't want anything in front of the rabbit because

69
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.350
that helps frame our rabbits into the centre of the scene.

70
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.570
So move this toolbar up way.

71
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.160
So is there anything else.

72
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.810
Well the sky's going to be blue so I'm just going to quickly go over here and go blue okay.

73
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.600
I could have probably picked a different tool I'm still learning in set up.

74
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.360
So we're going to have a blue sky.

75
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:38.690
It might be quite nice to have a herbology for the poor drawing here as probably said already but maybe

76
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.580
a tree or something like that in the background.

77
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.010
Now that looks like a five year old story but it really doesn't matter.

78
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.070
Guys it's all about experimentation.

79
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.300
You know that's taken me.

80
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.800
I don't know.

81
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.070
Two minutes to knock that up and see what we're going to get.

82
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.310
And that's that's the important thing here.

83
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.760
I'd rather spend a couple of minutes fleshing out this scene and going.

84
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.380
Well actually I think it would be better if X Y and Z swapped round spent another two minutes doing

85
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.130
it rather than trying to get your bunny looking like a bunny at this stage.

86
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.020
We can do that.

87
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.790
Back in blender.

88
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.680
So how did you guys get on.

89
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.010
I'd love to see your compositions what your going to be aiming for throughout this section.

90
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.800
Please share them in the discussions.

91
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.830
Take a picture of them with your phone or digital camera or if you've got some software like this doodle

92
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.500
in that mess paint whatever you've got.

93
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.930
Show me what you're going to do.

94
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.390
And well let's get on and make it.

95
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.820
See you guys in the next lecture.
