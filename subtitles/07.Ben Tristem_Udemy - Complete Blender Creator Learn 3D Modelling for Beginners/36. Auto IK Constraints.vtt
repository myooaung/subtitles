00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.710
In this lecture we are going to learn about using our control bones that we've placed there and actually

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.990
using an inverse charismatic constraints so that we can move around our model.

4
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.130
The reason why we want to do this is because if we have a look at the bone itself and open up our properties

5
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.020
panel looking at the item you'll see that location is grayed out.

6
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.370
In fact everything to do with our lamp.

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.720
Apart from this one at the very bottom here everything is grayed out which basically means we cannot

8
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.700
keep frame in and we'll learn about that very shortly.

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.340
The position of this bone we cannot just move it around and expect it to work.

10
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.120
But what we can do is get it to follow a new bone this control bone that we've made by adding constraints

11
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.780
to it.

12
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.160
Let's go find out more okay everybody welcome back.

13
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.640
So let's go ahead and start setting up our constraints.

14
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.680
The first thing we need to understand is why are we setting up these constraints.

15
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.030
Well as I alluded to in the introduction these bones themselves all of these have no way of adjusting

16
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.650
the transform apart from the one at the bottom.

17
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.840
Who is the parents of all of this now that is a problem because when it comes to key framing these bones

18
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.770
and their location it just won't work.

19
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.800
You'll end up with it snapping back and not being able to set its position.

20
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.860
And that will just ruin our animation.

21
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.780
You'll basically make the animation impossible.

22
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.830
But what we can do is link it together and use this control bone to control where this top bone is pointing

23
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.200
and because we're using inverse cinematics the rest of the bones will follow.

24
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.780
And that's a great deal of control that we can do with that.

25
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.960
First of all in order to set up a constraint we used to at the moment going down that say selecting

26
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.780
the bone we want to constrain going down to the constraints the bone constraints specifically and then

27
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.300
go into add a bone constraint.

28
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.200
Now you can do it this way we can go down to inverse Kana Mattox set the targets as the armature as

29
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.000
the bone to the look bone.

30
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.330
And there we go.

31
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.430
That's how we can set this up in a very manual way.

32
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.160
Now I'm going to clear that off for the moment what we can also do is select tail control bone select

33
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.530
the bone that we want to control whilst holding down shift and then go control shift and see whilst

34
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.260
our cursors over the 3-D view and that same menu will pop up again.

35
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.760
That's really useful because now we can go straight to invest in a Mattox and we get the same result

36
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.800
much much quicker.

37
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.380
The one thing to look at in this for the moment we're not using a poll targets but you can see we've

38
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.540
got the target being the armature and then the look bone.

39
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.120
We've got iterations maximum number of solver solving iterations.

40
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.600
I'm going to leave as 500 at the moment with the type of animation we're doing.

41
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.400
We don't need to muck around or adjust that's now the chain length.

42
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.010
This is how many of these bones are being affected when we're controlling it with this controlled bone.

43
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.560
So if we go back and you notice that the bone has changed color to yellow that means it has a constraint

44
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.770
on it more specifically an inverse can somatic constraints it will increase the chain length.

45
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.740
Suddenly we're only talking about the top of the lamp moving because we're talking about one bone being

46
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.500
affected every increase that's two three four.

47
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.200
Let's do that two three four.

48
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.370
Now we're moving the entire thing.

49
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.230
Now that's pretty cool and very useful but we still do have a problem.

50
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.240
We'll discuss that later on because currently you can still manage to push the model through itself

51
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.610
but there is a problem at the moment.

52
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.060
If we would scrap this base control and start moving it's along it's not actually moving anything.

53
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.600
So we need to do some parenting not only to this bottom one but to the top one as well.

54
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.980
I'm going to leave that.

55
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.100
Your challenge and your challenge sets up the parenting.

56
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:13.150
So what we need to do here is the base control bone moves the entire lamp but we don't want that other

57
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.490
control bone being left behind the one that controls the looking of the lamp.

58
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.450
So the look controlled bone follows along as well.

59
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.630
Video now play with parenting and get that all working

60
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.410
okay everybody welcome back.

61
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.350
Let's hop on over into blender and sort out our parenting

62
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.790
Hello everybody and welcome back.

63
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.390
Okay.

64
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.070
So the first thing that I want to do is actually just get used to not resetting it at the moment.

65
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.720
We've gone in and we've selected all and we've cleared with either Alton R. and Alton g to make sure

66
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.480
that it's back at is rest pose but that's the whole point of the rest pose.

67
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.230
And having it.

68
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.410
So let's go to our armature and set it in its rest position.

69
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.850
There we go.

70
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.050
Now when we go to edit mode everything's where it needs to be.

71
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.190
If you don't do that you end up with this horrible mismatch when you're imposed mode and you switch

72
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.380
to edit mode where things reset but the model doesn't move along with it setting it to the rest position

73
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.510
and going backwards and forwards again.

74
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.060
There we go.

75
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.360
We'll solve that issue.

76
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.640
So we need some parenting now this base bone at the bottom this is the one that we're going to move

77
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.850
in.

78
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.110
Everything comes along.

79
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.190
So when you select this first bone and parents it's that one.

80
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.030
Now we have an option of connected or keep offset.

81
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.810
Now if you've been playing along you will notice that connected.

82
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.610
We don't want to do that.

83
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.740
Okay.

84
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.880
Easy enough to do it that way and cause a bit of a problem.

85
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.140
But again control and P once we've done control and pay we can keep the offsets.

86
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.450
The next thing we want to do is parent this one at the top so that base bone as well.

87
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.560
This is gonna be like our root bone it's going to move everything along with it.

88
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.270
Otherwise what will happen.

89
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.470
We can hop into Poe's mode now and show that is as we move along or rest position here we go as we move

90
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.270
along this other bone this other controlled bone gets left behind.

91
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.360
Now that is very useful if you want it to be stuck to a particular surface but that's not what we're

92
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.950
aiming for in this particular case.

93
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.440
So let's go ahead grab this one here and parents it to the base bone as well.

94
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.850
We need to be an edit mode to do that very easy to fall foul of that and we need to keep the offsets

95
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.270
as well.

96
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.410
Now what we should find is that the whole lump moves along.

97
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.960
Perfect.

98
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.910
So we've got everything set up how I think we want it set up let's go ahead and move some of these around

99
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.320
now.

100
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.770
I think that this is perhaps the wrong shape to have.

101
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:53.750
We've got a cone that's now facing completely the wrong way it's not it is not having its intended purpose

102
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.840
anymore.

103
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.450
I think we need something like a sphere.

104
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.080
Now we can go ahead and delete the cone and reactive and yada yada but what's going to be easy to do

105
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.250
is take over that mesh object and change the mesh data.

106
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.640
So it's no longer a cone but a sphere.

107
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.580
So let's search for cone.

108
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.440
I think I left it called cone.

109
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.550
I'm not sure.

110
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.230
Let's see if I did leave it called cone.

111
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.370
Unfortunately I didn't.

112
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.310
So this was the look Byron wasn't it.

113
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.670
Here we go.

114
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.030
Look bone shape Look that's the one we wanted.

115
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:32.360
I'm going to come out into object mode select this and into edit mode and just press access delete everything

116
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.070
there.

117
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.880
Then I can add in a U V sphere.

118
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.340
There we go.

119
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.280
And I can lower the segments here.

120
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.310
I want to go to eight and four I've played with this lots that's going to be about right.

121
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.590
And the radius needn't be that large.

122
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.130
Here we go point to point three point to five smack bang in the middle.

123
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.120
OK.

124
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.650
That is good I'm liking that we can see it's updated live for us.

125
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.820
That's the other really good thing about doing it this way.

126
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:04.250
So I can go ahead back in supposed mode now a sphere is a much better object to move around it's got

127
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:12.800
no inherent direction and it gives us a lot of control I think the final thing I think to look at here

128
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.250
is if we select the yellow bone and look at the chain length what we don't want is it sets too far.

129
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.330
So now we've got that extra bone and we've got one two three four.

130
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.370
And the fifth bone at the bottom is now part of this chain because it's now the parents of everything

131
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.840
else here if we increase that to five we start getting twisting.

132
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.670
Now that's interesting because that results in doing this really jerky motion so we don't really want

133
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.330
it doing that.

134
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:47.410
So let's go ahead and select this bone again and lower that down to four.

135
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.270
Now let's make sure we can move everything along as we'd expect.

136
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:55.450
There we go our laps just jumps up there and we can look around as well.

137
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.010
Perfect.

138
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.540
I'm just gonna grab this and move it out the way.

139
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.320
We've still got the bone shape look that.

140
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.600
Let's move that back.

141
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.650
Now this is a great example where Ultima G just places it back at the start point.

142
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.680
Let's turn on look there for the moment so we can have a look.

143
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.420
I'm going to select my bone my control bone hide or everything else from my scene pop my lamp in an

144
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.910
interesting or inquisitive position en route.

145
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.810
I'm loving this.

146
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.060
You know we've spent so long now modelling it and rigging it together.

147
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.750
Even though we're not animating it at the moment this is brilliant because we're able to move it around

148
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.870
and it looks like it's searching for something and this is this is key here we're starting to play with

149
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.560
our models and I hope yours are coming along really well.

150
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.010
I'm liking how this is looking I'm going to do a quick rendered view as well.

151
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.950
Sweets I'm really looking forward to seeing how yours are coming along.

152
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.220
Please show your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
