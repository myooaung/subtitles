1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,170
Welcome to your first particle system.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:09,980
In this video you will create a particle system understand children and how they relate to their parents

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,970
and hopefully avoid crashing your computer or waiting a very long time.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,050
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,280
Okay.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,800
So we're back over in blender and we have our rabbits in front of us.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,710
So the first thing I'm going to do is open up a brand new blender fine because what I don't want to

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,160
do is start playing about with our model just at this moment.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,970
I want to learn the technique of the particle system.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,950
So make sure your file is saved.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,630
I'll do that now for mine.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,170
And we're going to open up a brand new blender file.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,780
Great.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,220
So we've got the default cube in front of us and we need to add our first particle system.

15
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:56,030
So if I pull out this area here on the left hand side we will see that we have these things that look

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,830
like stars are just bring down the outline as well.

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,890
And that is a particles as we go over it.

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,600
We can see that so when we click on that we get a blank screen because there is no particle system at

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,160
the moment.

20
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,710
So go ahead.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,610
Going to go ahead and create a new particle system and I'm going to call it Hey 3q.

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,110
Excellent.

23
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:24,500
And I'm going to here on the settings also call it hairy cubes so I know that what I'm setting up here

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,920
and we can use this as a base to generate more particle systems from once we've got it roughly right.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,160
So type Well we're not going to do an emission at the moment we're going to do a hair.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,280
So we're going to switch that across to here and lo and behold we've got ourselves some hairs coming

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,210
out of our cube quite long hairs.

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:52,790
And if we go out and render that it will look quite dim at the moment so let's go to the lamp and make

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,820
the lamp properties give it a sun so it's nice and bright.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,240
There we go.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,190
So you get a better idea of what it's going to look like and there are a thousand hairs in this scene.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,280
Now there is a fine balance to be struck so let's go back to the cube and the oh just whilst we're hearing

33
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,430
you've got a spanner against there and not a sparkly icon.

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,170
Well the particle system is a modifier.

35
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,700
But as you can see here the settings are done over here rather than in the usual way that you manage

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,440
modifiers.

37
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,490
So if we click on the particle properties we can carry on going down here.

38
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,750
Now advance does give you further options and we're not going to deal with that at the moment and segments

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,940
tells us how many kinks in this hair will actually be the more segments you have the more smooth you

40
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,420
can comb hair have it deform etcetera.

41
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,670
But I would suggest you leave out five more segments you have the more computationally heavy.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,280
It's going to be to calculate that here.

43
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,590
Now the emission down here tells us the number of hairs and we can see that there are 1000 hairs and

44
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,500
the hair length pretty self-explanatory is the length of a hair.

45
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,900
I'm going to go back to solid view here and the hair length.

46
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,210
If we pull that down we get a hairy cube still but not quite as hairy.

47
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:20,330
And depending on what you're modelling you will want a certain length of hair of course.

48
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,750
Now if we go down we're going to ignore hair dynamics for the moment how we're going to ignore the random

49
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,320
stuff we'll go back to that in a bit.

50
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,230
And as we come down we can see children.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,380
So if we go to children and we've got two options for the type of children now the best way of demonstrating

52
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,840
interpolated is not on a cube.

53
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,750
So I will create another object in a moment and we're have a closer look at that.

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,550
But simple and elated are going to look pretty similar.

55
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,930
Oh actually that's quite nice around the edge of the cubes.

56
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:02,510
So it does give us an idea of what impeller interpolated does rather than just being simple.

57
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,700
So the way that the simple hairs are generated is they are created around the parents.

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,200
So in this case on the display setting you can see we've got 10 children for each individual parent

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,400
or for each individual emission no at the top here so that's taken our total up to 10000 hairs on the

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,760
screen.

61
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,010
In fact I'm just going to move these up so I can see in fact you can grab bees by the way and move them

62
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,570
about so I'm going to lift that up.

63
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,940
So they're right next to one another so you can see what's going on on both of these.

64
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,640
So the number of children when it's simple it's they're produced within a radius around our our primary

65
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,470
hair are mission hair.

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,420
And that can lead to things like this where the hairs are being generated a way from the skin or the

67
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,190
surface of your model.

68
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,980
And that's generally okay if you've got a large flat area and no one's going to notice.

69
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,170
But if you start having hairs coming out there's blatantly no skin.

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,510
With the case of our rabbit is going to look a bit odd.

71
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,860
So you'll actually want to use interpolated.

72
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:15,050
And this does do a good job at showing it as the hairs come round this corner.

73
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:21,230
You can see that they're still stuck to the surface of our model and they follow the corner as it goes

74
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,850
round rather than just leaving it with a 90 degree cross-section there.

75
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,430
So that's a very powerful way in the same as they come around this corner all these three edges where

76
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,150
they meet.

77
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,310
It's nice and divided as it goes.

78
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,200
Now do be warned the multiplication of this emission number and the display.

79
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,870
No.

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,620
If it gets too high will either crash your computer or take ages to calculate.

81
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,530
So I went and put a thousand in here and I hope it doesn't muck up whilst doing a live video.

82
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,020
I get my spinning wheel.

83
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,520
I've done this before I know it's going to work but I may have to pause a video or at least speed it

84
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,080
up whilst that goes through.

85
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,440
But that's now going to have a million hairs in it a thousand times.

86
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:14,590
So each one of those original admissions the parents will have a thousand hairs associated with it.

87
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,220
So that is quite a lot of hairs.

88
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,740
Now the other thing that makes a difference is the scale of our object.

89
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,800
Now it sounds a bit odd that it would make a difference but if you think about it if you've got a thousand

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,070
hairs on something the size of a marble compared to a 1000 hairs on something the size of a football

91
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,140
they're going to be less dense on the football because it's got a large area to cover.

92
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,940
So in general the larger your object is the more hairs you're going to need or the not more particle

93
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,850
you're going to need to cover that with the same density as you would if it was a smaller object.

94
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,490
And I think I've done a wonderful job here in showing you not the numbers to type in specially when

95
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,310
doing a video for you guys but you can see here that the program hasn't crashed.

96
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,520
It's simply taking a very long time to calculate 1 million hairs and that's what you don't want to happen

97
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,370
especially when youre mucking around with a blender.

98
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:18,070
Now this generally happens to me when Im playing with the number and I go back and I change the admission

99
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,840
no forgetting I have left the children high or the mission numbers already high and I add a large number

100
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,950
of the children so do be careful whenever you do that and I'm probably going to force quick blender

101
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,070
here and be right back with you.

102
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,930
In fact I can see here in my activity monitor you can use your task manager that it's actually it's

103
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,820
actually using 100 percent of the s.p. you at the moment.

104
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:51,240
Now this is one of those things that it's not multi core compatible unlike rendering which is the actual

105
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,400
generation of the hairs.

106
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,020
It's only done on one core of your s.p. you so it's not going to be as fast as some of the other things

107
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,510
you've been doing.

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,400
Glenn and I can see here it's actually still working all of that out.

109
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,790
But to be quite honest I don't care.

110
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,810
I want to carry on teaching you guys so I'm going to quit that and build up my cube again for you.

111
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:14,670
So here I am just recreating where we were before but without the one million hairs and I'm just going

112
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,090
to click this little handle here and pull it up so it's next to.

113
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,040
This area here and of course if we add some simple children there were only 10 that gets a bit thicker

114
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:32,670
that's dragged the hair length back down to about here change it interpolated and we get a much better

115
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,380
idea of what's going on now in terms of numbers.

116
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,020
In general you will have to play with it.

117
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:48,660
If I now scale this cube outward so it's 15 times larger than it was before the hairs are now ridiculously

118
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,750
short for this style of model so we'd have to increase them.

119
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,510
So it looks roughly the same but now they're far less dense and the same is true.

120
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,960
If I were to scale that right in oh dear that's I don't know how small of actually made that.

121
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,790
Let's bring those all in.

122
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,910
All right we've got a tiny cube So let's zoom in.

123
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,720
Now the hairs are much more dense.

124
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,500
And you'll notice that we've got a display number and a random number.

125
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:21,510
So at the moment if we were to not hear if we go into random mode here that is still the same number

126
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,730
that's on this display here.

127
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:31,380
But if we go to render and render out the image it will do a lot of calculations and then it will render

128
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,460
with the cube at once with 100 hairs on it.

129
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,710
And you can probably see that's very pixellated carcillo rest.

130
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,390
But there are many more hairs in there than there are otherwise.

131
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,210
So in general your wants the children set to interpolated.

132
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,030
And the number of emissions where you going to have to play with that.

133
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,150
But do be careful that you do not crash your system.

134
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,180
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

135
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,060
I'd like you to create hair for your bunny.

136
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,910
So give our bunny some fur apply a hair particle system to the rabbit mash.

137
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,960
Don't worry about the detail of it just yet.

138
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,800
And your bunny will look funny at this stage.

139
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,700
Don't worry.

140
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,130
We'll be sorting that out soon.

141
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,110
So pause the video now and create hair for your bunny.

142
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,240
Okay guys.

143
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,160
Welcome back.

144
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,450
Let's hop over into blender and create some bunny fur.

145
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,290
Okay so we're back in blender Let's go ahead and open up if you've not done already your fluffy bunny

146
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,890
and it's not that fluffy at the moment so let's make it a fluffy bunny.

147
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:47,120
So I need to pull this out so I can see what's going on at a particle system and I'm going to call mine

148
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,590
a body hair.

149
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm going to call this body hair as well.

150
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,210
Cain changed the type to hair.

151
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,080
And that's really long hair.

152
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,750
So let's lower that back down to.

153
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:09,190
We do point to for the moment that looks a decent length okay.

154
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,320
But it's pretty sparse at the moment.

155
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:17,520
We'll turn on the other layers that we have because otherwise when I render they won't appear to just

156
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,620
render that image and see how it comes out of the camera isn't position.

157
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,330
But we can see there that the hairs unno good at all.

158
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,700
So let's give it some thicker fur without crashing the computer.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,400
So let's head back over to the 3-d view and let's try 10000 hairs right that's starting to look a bit

160
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,700
better.

161
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:45,510
That's a good you kind of get a feeling after a while of what is a good overall hair density.

162
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,340
Before you start adding children in so let's go down to children.

163
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:58,110
And were you notice that this is in a different position to where it was before in the last example

164
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,550
video.

165
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,200
And that's simply because the positions of all of these are saved in the actual blend file itself.

166
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,490
I'm not going to move this one up.

167
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,050
I'm going to set it to interpolated.

168
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,850
And we end up with a much thicker mesh and blenders just ever so slightly jerky for me at this point

169
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,130
in time which is okay.

170
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,540
I'm not bothered with that but I do want to just orientate the camera.

171
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,460
So let's go to camera view.

172
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,210
So when I do do any rendering so let's move it up a little.

173
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,980
And probably just rotate it around a little as well so rotates well.

174
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,270
That way would be fine.

175
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,680
In fact the way I keep looking at it from would be even better.

176
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,300
Move it down to about there and then move it again this time away from the camera.

177
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,450
So let's see how that looks when we render it again.

178
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,640
Being as lean as possible to try and get a good idea about how the end result is going to look.

179
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,990
It's going to look pretty disastrous of course at the moment because we have not styled the hair colour

180
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,130
the hair or anything else we'll get to that in a bit.

181
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,450
And let's just see how this is coming out.

182
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,640
Okay so that looks like a good level of fluff.

183
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,050
What is important is that I can't see the skin underneath.

184
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,180
So there we go we've got a good start for a fluffy bunny.

185
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,380
The ears are certainly far too fluffy at the moment because they're not like that on a normal bunny.

186
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,480
There's good space around the eyes.

187
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,570
Head hair is not usually this long but we can deal with that as well.

188
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,620
Let's skip around to my 3-d view and see in rendered form with 10 samples.

189
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,750
That's skewed round to the light side.

190
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,910
In fact I'm going to change the lamp type to a Hemi.

191
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:52,580
Rather than anything else because then it's going to have a direction but it's also to brighten up our

192
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,580
scene really well so we can see there we've got oh it looks like I'm missing the other I.

193
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,350
Yes I am missing the other.

194
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:10,300
So in this case I'm going to quickly go to where we've got sphere and call them eyes.

195
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:17,990
I'm going to add a mirror modifier should have done this before and make the mirror object the rabbit.

196
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,600
And we should end up with an eye on the other side.

197
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,820
Perfect.

198
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,820
Okay so this is looking good.

199
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,100
We've got our rough rabbits formed not not quite there yet.

200
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,760
We've got plenty of work to do left on are a bit going to go back to solid view and in certain places

201
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
of course it does look like you're seeing through it but that's fine.

202
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,780
That's because all the hairs are currently standing up on end.

203
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,980
Now I think that is a good starting point.

204
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,470
Most of these hairs in a bit will be transferred to here so we're going to do some more adjusting anyway.

205
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,530
That is a great start.

206
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,140
How do you guys get on how fluffy has your bunny ended up pretty sheraton's discussions.

207
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,680
I will see you guys in the next lecture.
