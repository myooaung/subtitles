00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,660
Welcome to the colour ramp node in this video.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,700
Well first of all what is the colour ramp node.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:14,760
Well the colour ramp node is generally used for mapping values to colours with the use of a gradient.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,690
Now become more apparent very shortly.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,320
It can be customized to produce very interesting results.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,250
We will be using it to control a single value.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,630
In the example coming up so we can just stick with the greyscale.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,850
But because colour is three separate channels.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:39,210
RG And B you can potentially control three separate values with this one node.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,540
And if you're a graphically minded person well its used to graphically control values so you can visually

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,440
see what's going on.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,490
So let's go play with the colour ramp mode now and hop on over in a blender.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,580
Okay so we're back over in blender and to speed things along.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm going to open up the save from The Last Lecture.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,380
So we've got something we can work with.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,200
So here we go this is what we were working on before.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,530
I'm asked to turn on the rendered view up and the top found one and make that whole area a little bit

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,170
bigger so we can see what's going on.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,430
I'm going to get rid of this properties panel on the right hand side of the node editor.

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,680
I want to keep value that's going to be useful and I'm going to get rid of power because that's what

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,910
we're going to use instead of a map node we're going to use this colour RAM.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,340
So again it's a type of converter.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,040
And let's pop that in a bit wider than expected.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,430
There we go.

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,990
Let's pop that in here and link these up.

26
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,760
Okay.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:48,120
So what we've said she's done here oh let's plug into the right node input roughness.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,770
OK.

29
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,580
So what we've essentially done here is nothing so far because of the value being passed through or that's

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,110
just undo this for the moment.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,270
This value here is literally just moving along this gradient from one side to the other.

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,420
And so looking at it it makes absolutely no difference.

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,820
You plug this in here.

34
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,700
Point two is going to be point two.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,410
And because of the gradient is linear across from one colour stop to another.

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,900
These land soon in a little bit these little things that look like houses because it's uniform moving

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,280
across then it will just be a one to one relationship.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,010
Now we can move these colour stops by left clicking on them and moving them to the left or right.

39
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,100
Now what that will do is it will mean anything up and remember that black is zero black is always a

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,740
value of zero anything up to position three because that's the selected one.

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,570
Or point three will be Black.

42
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,350
You'll be zero so any value that comes in will be made to be zero.

43
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,090
Now this does help us move it along.

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,240
But it's really just offset the beginning and squash the other side.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,380
So that means from this point here point three to 1 it's going to be a more exaggerated version of the

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,680
problem we've already got.

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,110
So that's not what we want to do in this case.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,500
Watts would be a particular solution here is to add another one of these colour stops and make this

49
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,410
dark grey area last longer.

50
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,780
Now there's a couple of ways you can do this which has hit the plus button here and that will put a

51
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,140
colour stop smack bang in the middle.

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,620
And we then can select that colour stopping is selective at the moment.

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,960
We can tell that a number of ways who've got this dotted line coming out the top of it which shows its

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,840
position and we can also see this number here is the active colour stop number one.

55
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,110
And it goes 0 1 2.

56
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,480
So it always starts at zero.

57
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,940
It can be a bit confusing.

58
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,230
Now this colour bar on the bottom enables us to change this.

59
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,110
Now we're only going to deal with the grey scale at the moment so that means that's on huge saturation

60
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,040
of value.

61
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,150
The only thing we really need to move is the value controller.

62
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:14,240
And if I lower that down to maybe point three we can see it stays darker for longer if it stays darker

63
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,430
for longer.

64
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,470
We should find that when we move the value along.

65
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,490
It's much better than it was before and of course we can compare what it was before by just muting the

66
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,040
colour ramps if I select that a Muta and come off again I can see that's made a difference.

67
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:38,700
Now of course I can stretch that out further to make a have a more of an impact or indeed I can add

68
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,950
another colour stop and make the gradient gradually change.

69
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,490
So another way of adding a colour stop is to hold down control and left click and then you can place

70
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,180
it where you want to place it.

71
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,370
And again I can then go into here and change the value of that.

72
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,500
Now this also gives us the ability to have black come back later on.

73
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,480
So for instance at this wouldn't it be particularly used.

74
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,960
Well I can't think of an application for it with the roughness input that we're trying to control at

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,490
the moment.

76
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,500
But it is kind of useful with other things if you wanted to take control of them.

77
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:25,110
So sometimes it can be a little well tricky basically to select that ball going to pick this up and

78
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,420
move it over here.

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,080
So it's dark again and again to change it so it's a value of zero.

80
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:38,130
And here we go we've now got black further along what we should find them I'm going to accurately position

81
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,760
it by typing something in there or we should find is now it's shiny stars getting rougher and rougher

82
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,840
and then suddenly gets shiny again before going completely Matt.

83
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,990
So a value of point one all that some muter otherwise you don't see what's going on.

84
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,040
Point to Point three point four.

85
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,890
And we can see it's getting more and more blurring then as we approach point A.

86
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,640
And there we go.

87
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,590
It goes clear again of course if we were holden downshift and dragging it we'd see that a bit more gradual

88
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,500
and then that final stage between point eight and a one just happens really really really quickly and

89
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,420
that's it for probably only a couple of hundredths to move it along.

90
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,700
So that is one of the ways we can use the colour ramp.

91
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,280
Now one of the things to bear in mind with the colour ramp is in fact we've got four values we can play

92
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,190
with so we can add another node in here to extract some of these values.

93
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,720
So the colour there are three.

94
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,710
Colours basically coming out of here red green and blue.

95
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,050
So there are three values and there's a fourth value from the Alpha channel and we can use the hatz

96
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,690
to control other things as well.

97
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:56,880
So for instance if we go ahead and let's duplicate this glossy shader and then let's mix them together

98
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,650
and I'm going to use that shortcut control in zero to do the mixing.

99
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:09,150
I'm not going to worry about tidying it up and then I'm going to switch this out to a diffuse texture.

100
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,010
And I get that error message I still haven't got to the bottom of it I think I just need to turn it

101
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,710
on and off again but I'll look at that later.

102
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,050
Doesn't seem to be breaking anything or may even be a bug in the program.

103
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,930
OK so I've got all of this set up here.

104
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,280
Now we've got the colour output coming out from this colour ramp.

105
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,180
And what we can do is we can separate it into its individual channels and we can do that with another

106
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:41,570
converter so we go an ad converter and we can see here separate R G B have we pop that in there.

107
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:48,860
We can see that the image comes in so it doesn't have to be a plain old colour it is here.

108
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,390
So every pixels the same.

109
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,790
And I can say that with the red channel is going to control the colour over here.

110
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,170
Now because it is a red channel controlling the colour.

111
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,960
What we'll find is that everything that's one on the red obviously everything's just the same value

112
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,840
at the moment but anything is cut coloured one on the red channel will be white because it'll bring

113
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,560
across one one and one is single value here will be repeated three times.

114
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:24,840
If we wanted it to break down basically to bring it back in to RG territory and control the colours

115
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,990
we'd have to input all three of those into here.

116
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,380
And as you can see you can't just drag and drop all three.

117
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,010
So we have to combine them back together.

118
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,070
And guess what.

119
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,040
There is a node for that so we can go and add a converter and combine r.g. B.

120
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,000
So then you've got red green and blue.

121
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,080
So we can use that control colour.

122
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,030
I can remove one of those we actually get a coloured ball.

123
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,270
And here we can start playing with the values.

124
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,430
So let's use blue to control the roughness setting.

125
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,770
Let's use green and red to control so we're going to get a either a green red or yellow tinge coming

126
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,680
out of here.

127
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,620
Okay so now we've got this snow sets up we can play with the colours here.

128
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,440
So what we don't want while I do want to whiz through it quickly and make sure that at no point does

129
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,340
it go or horrible or it goes a bright yellow.

130
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,020
That's the worst it gets.

131
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,890
By the looks of things.

132
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,980
By the time it reaches one.

133
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,940
So what else can we do to control that so can we have it read at the beginning so how do we get it just

134
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,390
read.

135
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,620
We make sure that green is zero says go to this first.

136
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,030
I need to zoom in a little on to here.

137
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,240
Let's go to this first colour node.

138
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
There we go and change this.

139
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,010
So the RG be value of green.

140
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,380
So let's go back there.

141
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,010
Green is zero and red is one.

142
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,650
So now it's slightly red at the beginning and it will turn.

143
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,340
Well neutral here and slightly darker before going yellow.

144
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:12,500
At the end because the value of one and one in red and green will produce that yellow.

145
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,810
So there we go that's turning around.

146
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,750
Perfect.

147
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,630
Now there's another way of blending the colours this RG be input here.

148
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,050
We'll do some mixing then you've got huge saturation in value and seat changes slightly how it mixes

149
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:34,240
them together how we got HDL as well and they're all different types of how to blend those colours together.

150
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:42,930
And incidentally you also get a different set of interpolations depending on which one you selected.

151
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:52,800
So HSV and h s l they blend the colours first by converting it to those types of mixing and then combining

152
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,450
them back together again and this has the advantage in maintaining the colour saturation between the

153
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,580
different colours the difference hues.

154
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,500
Whereas r.g. B itself would indeed saturate.

155
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,880
And so for you you would lose.

156
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,110
And we can see here you would lose the rich colour change as we go through now.

157
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,900
RG just blends colours by mixing the colour channel and combining it all together.

158
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,630
So we've got lots of different options here and of course you can play with them they give different

159
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,470
results as we go near we can go clockwise.

160
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,070
I don't think with this particular set up we are actually going to see much difference depending on

161
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,680
which one here we select.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,250
Maybe as we move through we might be able to see at different rates of change between them.

163
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,430
But you can see that we've got four channels to play with and we can actually control a lots of different

164
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:44,880
things.

165
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,480
Now this is a kind of a forced set up but you can see the power of the colour ramp over something like

166
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,640
the MAF node is that you can be a bit where you can be graphical about a you can say when things are

167
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,750
going to happen either have to be so linear about it so we can as demonstrated here have the gloss suddenly

168
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,940
come back and disappear again later on as I say they're not sure of that's going to help us with this

169
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:17,100
particular making the go or shade a roughness more accurate but it certainly can be applied in other

170
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,380
methods as well.

171
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,020
So one final thing to consider was the colour ramp is its inputs.

172
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:31,330
So at the moment we have a value being imported which means that the whole object in one lump is just

173
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,950
getting the one value wherever it happens to be on this gradient.

174
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:43,960
Now what happens if we put in something else along here that can pick different points depending on

175
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,660
what we what we want to do.

176
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,280
So let's try this try that with a basic texture.

177
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:55,420
So I'm going to go ahead and switch this out I'm going to you shift in S to do so and I'm going to go

178
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,300
into texture and what have we got here.

179
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,480
I do like the or annoy the grealy might be a bit let's try voron Oi.

180
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,530
And here we've got areas now.

181
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,220
Look at that.

182
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,830
We've got areas where it's glossy well where it's red and somewhere it's yellow.

183
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,130
This is quite cool.

184
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,400
Of course we got intensity in cells that's changed four out in these discrete chunks.

185
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,850
So let's go back to intensity and make these bigger which will make the value bigger which will make

186
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,920
them smaller.

187
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,260
And we started to get a slightly different texture across the surface of our Grobe.

188
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,050
Let's try a different texture.

189
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,360
Again I'm going to switch the outgoing texture.

190
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,610
Let's try this gradient texture.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,360
Okay so look about we've got it what we on linnea so that's e is.

192
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,850
Well it looks like it's gonna be red one side in yellow V over by the time we've mixed it with some

193
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,680
glossiness in the middle.

194
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah there we go.

195
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,910
There's that rothesay bit in the middle that's this black band here so we can have different effects

196
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,530
applied across our model.

197
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,300
And of course we can actually just do colour ramp literally a colour ramp we could make it bread one

198
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,160
side in yellow the other without having all this extra plumbed in.

199
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,010
So you could apply with that with something like grass where grass tends to be a deep green by the roots

200
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:24,370
and maybe a yellow a dirty sort of date yellow over time it gets to the tip and you control that with

201
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
a colour ramp.

202
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,640
Now do bear in mind if you do need a bit more control over your colour ramp you can make it wider.

203
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,910
It only goes so wide of course but you can make it wider so you can see the gradient across it's a little

204
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,150
bit more clearly.

205
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,930
Something else that you could potentially do is let's get rid of this gradient texture and add in a

206
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,990
layer weights.

207
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,840
So now we can change this.

208
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,510
The factor here depending on the angle of which we're viewing the object from.

209
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:03,210
So there we are work we've got a very reflective band just round the very outside.

210
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,350
So let's move this black finger move the reflection bit closer to the 90 degree if we call that here

211
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,500
and there we go.

212
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,390
Got reflection very close.

213
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,910
And it gets more diffuse.

214
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,630
But that's the wrong way round.

215
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,810
So of course we can flip this and we can flip it very quickly.

216
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,610
There's this double headed arrow so that will invert that.

217
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:29,760
So now it's glossier around the very edge and I can push that very close together and actually have

218
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,680
a very very glossy edge and a more or more rough centre.

219
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,010
Perfect.

220
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,930
And how about sums it up what you can do with the colour ampara Certainly an introduction to what you

221
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,240
could do with the colour ramp.

222
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,860
Bear in mind it's awesome for controlling things.

223
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:56,190
We could plug in a in image texture in here which would map colours or controls depending on the actual

224
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,030
map itself.

225
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:04,290
So the possibilities with the kalorama are pretty much limitless and I will see you guys in the next

226
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:04,990
lecture.
