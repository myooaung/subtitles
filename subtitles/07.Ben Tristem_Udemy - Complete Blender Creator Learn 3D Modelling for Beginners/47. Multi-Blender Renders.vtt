00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.180
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.280
The first thing I'm going to do before I do anything else is I'm just going to tidy up our export folders

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.010
for the moment and what I tend to do when I'm working with these sorts of projects I make sure that

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.780
things like the folder structure are set up before I start rendering so I'm going to call this test

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.040
one and to lamp them off first test that we were doing.

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.440
I'll go in there and dump the stuff in.

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.020
Now the next one I'm going to use is lamp multi blend.

8
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.230
So what we're going to do in this particular lecture is make sure that we can render out using multiple

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.740
blender instances.

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.530
Now if this was a shared folder that was in a dropbox file or a shared Nass on a network this would

11
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.450
be brilliant because then you could use every computer on that particular network to help you render

12
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.740
out but there were a few key steps.

13
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.950
Let's go through them now.

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.350
So let's go ahead and launch blender once we've done that.

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.440
We can open up our animated lamp.

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.950
Now the first thing I'm going to do because otherwise we're going to end up in a bit of a pickle is

17
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.930
delete this time line.

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.640
All of this actually show you what happens.

19
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.370
So we've done everything here we come in we say yes this time we want to attend ATP render we can go

20
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.040
ahead and render look quite right.

21
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.140
Why doesn't it look right.

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.310
Well we don't actually have the rendering of this coming out.

23
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.030
We've got the rendering of this lots and because I've just moved all of those images it's coming out

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.870
blank.

25
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.420
So let's go ahead and delete those strips with the X key and then come back into layout.

26
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.500
Now when we press F 12 it should take a few seconds to render out.

27
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.580
There we go.

28
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.500
So this is taking about two and a half seconds to render.

29
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.550
If I use my CPO I know it's going to take about eight seconds to render I've done some tests.

30
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.600
I'm going to bore you with rendering those out.

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.490
So roughly speaking there are a couple of ways that I could manage this.

32
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.510
The first one is to set explicitly how many frames I want.

33
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:15.630
Each computer to render so I could set frame one to forty being on my CPO and then 41 to 200 being on

34
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.190
the GP.

35
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.430
That would be one way of managing that the easier way of managing it.

36
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.770
Certainly if you've got connections between multiple computers is to have place holders in place.

37
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.330
So we have a look at the outputs happened scroll down a little further.

38
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.630
Let's go ahead and find the right folder.

39
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.040
So lamp multi blender except it's important that we get all of these right before we set up anything

40
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.140
else.

41
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.510
Now the FFA MPEG video are coming back now to PSG.

42
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.960
It is important that when you render out using this method that it is in images.

43
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.710
Otherwise it won't really work as we want it to.

44
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.580
But what is really important is that place holders are there.

45
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.520
And what that means is before even finishes off the render it puts a place holder a file there so that

46
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.700
when the next version of blender or the next instance a blender starts looking for the next thing to

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.060
write.

48
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.140
So it's going to skip that one.

49
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.150
Otherwise you would just be repeating yourself over and over.

50
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.070
And the important thing here is to unseal act or these select the overwrite.

51
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.110
Otherwise it would just overwrite everything.

52
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.490
Those two really need to be over toggle on and off with each other.

53
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.130
But anyway let's go ahead and save.

54
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.760
It's important that we save at this point because this is going to be the GP you sets up.

55
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.980
So we have a look we use in cycles GP you and we know from that it's going to take about two minutes

56
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.770
55.

57
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.690
That's the first one rented out.

58
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.690
And of course that frame is going to be in there.

59
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.570
Now if we go ahead and start the render the computer will get bogged down and it won't really work as

60
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.280
we want it to.

61
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.050
But what I can do before we do this is once again I'm going to save when all I'm going to do is I'm

62
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.200
going to change how we're rendering out.

63
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.790
So there are a couple of things to go through I'll show you that now when it's on one system of course

64
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.120
if it was on multiple systems then you would pretty much just do the same thing on multiple setups.

65
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.570
So she have if you had computers that were exactly the same or incredibly similar.

66
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.080
So if I go ahead now and reopen up animated lamp think of this one as a read only that's important because

67
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.530
we don't want to save anything here or reopen or change anything apart from how we're rendering it.

68
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:44.330
So we're going to render it using the CPO instead of the GPO and we do need to change if we come down

69
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.500
here the tiles because that's clicking and dragging there to alter multiple cells if we don't change

70
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.150
this it will be incredibly slow and a complete waste of our time.

71
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.840
So I know on this CPO about 16 is the right sort of time that will take and if I render this out to

72
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.080
give you an idea of times now you cannot extrapolate this to everything.

73
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.420
If there's more going on in the scene it's going to take longer to render but you could see there all

74
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.150
those under seven seconds the last time I did it it was over.

75
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.400
So it does vary as well depending on what your computer's doing.

76
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.480
Great.

77
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.360
So everything now technically is all set up.

78
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.180
We've got this image coming out into the appropriate folder.

79
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.990
Let's go to make sure multi lamp blender doesn't have anything in it at the moment.

80
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.930
Let's go and check and make sure our file paths are correct before we start going so let's look back

81
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:36.950
in Blender.

82
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.590
This is something that is very important do these sorts of tests first before you go ahead and start

83
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.420
mucking around with something.

84
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.240
Otherwise it's very easy to suddenly find ah I can't do anything so I'm just going to call this lamp

85
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.650
actually and one of the reasons why I was saying that you should try to avoid making multiple changes

86
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.940
is exactly this.

87
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.030
If we didn't have exactly the same file name if there was a space or something on there then you're

88
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.950
not going to be able to make sure for certain when you open this one up that it's the right one in fact

89
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.540
it's very easy to get confused they're both called the same thing they both now need saving.

90
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.060
So there's nothing to distinguish the two from each other.

91
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.620
So lamp multi blender lamp.

92
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.660
Okay let's go ahead and start rendering so let's render out animation.

93
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.970
This is the CPA.

94
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.670
I'm going to move out of the way and I'm going to hide that as well so I know that one is out of the

95
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:41.270
way and now things will get slightly chunky so perhaps I should have used my GP you to start with but

96
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.230
there we go.

97
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.640
Render render animation now.

98
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:52.130
All being well look at the top here it started on frame four frame six so it's doing both of them at

99
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.140
the same time which is fantastic.

100
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.660
Let me see if I can go ahead and find where we're doing so here we can see it's a place holder in it

101
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.420
it's not ready yet then all of a sudden it writes the file down creates a new one and then the next

102
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.090
thing goes across.

103
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:15.250
Now if you scaled this across something that synchronize is over the web like one drive drop box etc

104
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:21.770
you may find occasionally you end up with duplicates not duplicates in the sense that you will have

105
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:28.220
to number 15s a copy of but you will end up with one computer and another computer actually doing the

106
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.760
same work at the same time.

107
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.810
I've never really seen it corrupt an image but I could imagine it might do if if you're not careful

108
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.530
but I can imagine it might do under certain circumstances.

109
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.650
But what we've got now is this image being rendered out pretty much as fast as my computer can physically

110
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.320
do it.

111
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:53.030
So let's have a look at what's going on so this one here as we can see with the big tile sizes is definitely

112
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:59.150
the GPO and it's still going between two seconds and three seconds.

113
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:06.690
So that seems pretty consistent with our first run but let's also have a look briefly at how the CPI

114
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:13.400
version is doing as well which is this one here and that's also actually taking around the seven seconds

115
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.520
seven to eight seconds that I thought it was going to take.

116
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.320
So that's really good.

117
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.730
That means that everything's working everything's working pretty much how I expected it to and what

118
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:33.560
we will end up with is basically 40 of the framed in total being rendered by the CPA and another 160

119
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.660
on the jeep here just shows you how powerful Jeep views are.

120
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:44.920
Now if I were also you was using another computer I could basically be doing four images at a time and

121
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.200
that problem I was talking to you about where you could potentially end up with one computer rendering

122
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.030
the same frame as another.

123
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.640
The longer your renders take the less likely that is to happen when they're only taking less than 10

124
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.410
seconds per frame.

125
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:05.200
It's more likely that you will end up with a computer rendering a frame that's already been rendered

126
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.730
but this is the way that you would manage it.

127
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:13.540
If this was in Dropbox one drive or any other file synchronization service it would work absolutely

128
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.230
fine.

129
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:20.190
And of course the other thing you can do is have a shared drive and render directly to that.

130
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.120
So this would work absolutely fine as well with a Nass.

131
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:29.620
That's really good because that means that there's definitely none of this waiting for files to synchronize

132
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:36.480
because you're writing directly to the drive rather than waiting for something like one drive or Dropbox

133
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.210
to synchronize.

134
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:43.120
Those are only of course two of the many many choices you've got synchronize your files but if you've

135
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.840
got a NASS That would be even better you can guarantee that once the place holder is created it's going

136
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.540
to be instantly viewable.

137
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.350
Everything else on the network itself.

138
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:58.610
But if you've got computers that are remote like I often have my laptop I'm out of a house.

139
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:04.780
I will send the render all the way over to the desktop and let that do the big heavy lifting whilst

140
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:10.630
I'm still working on other things or if I've just got a tight deadline I'll often employs many computers

141
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:17.370
as I can get my hands on which is often a bone of contention in my household when they're all busy rendering.

142
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.070
But anyway that's it for this lecture.

143
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.280
We can see this really increases our render speed.

144
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.950
You can do this with multiple computers with no particular issues.

145
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.460
Now blended does have a network render option.

146
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.240
We're not going to go into details in this course about that.

147
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.370
I've had ropey experience with it and often find it's much easier to do it this way.

148
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.690
However with the network rendering there is a benefits to it if you can get it working.

149
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:52.900
They either have to worry about changing your settings for the machine slash whether it's using CPR.

150
00:10:53.140 --> 00:11:00.460
Of course if I was just rendering out on GP use that were all roughly the same type.

151
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:06.300
Then there wouldn't have been any faffing to go around and the same if I was using CPS of a various

152
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.100
type.

153
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:13.260
I really hope that this helps you out when it comes to rendering larger animations not just larger in

154
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:19.890
length but larger in quality so if you if you've got a higher number of samples if it's larger in its

155
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:27.270
resolution these are all potential things that can slow down you get in your content out there and I

156
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.870
must impress upon you.

157
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.850
Don't crank the samples up to 2000 unless you've done at least one frame test at 2000 so make sure that

158
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.560
is as high as you need to go.

159
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.910
I very rarely need to go above to 300.

160
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.260
It has to be a very specific scene to need that many samples.

161
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:51.510
You've really done is waste energy to be quite honest in many many cases.

162
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:57.390
There are some things that do require that high but most of the stuff not so I really hope you're enjoying

163
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:03.060
being able to use multiple computers now in multiple instances a blender on one computer and I look

164
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.190
forward to seeing your work being produced and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
