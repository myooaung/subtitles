00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,480
Welcome to good meche topology.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,670
Now first of all what is meche topology.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:14,110
Will two objects can have the same shape themselves yet have a different mesh construction a different

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:21,730
arrangement of polygons making those up topology can determine how easy it is to edit or animates an

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,530
object.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,220
If you've made something out of triangles it's going to be a lot harder to edit if you've made something

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,750
out of quads and we'll go through why in a bit.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,390
Now in general you said this before used quads wherever possible end ons and triangles would typically

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,650
cause pinching.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,580
In your model.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,340
Now that's fine if it's hidden out of the way or on something that doesn't move or indeed where pinching

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,980
is desired but often it's not desired we want to avoid it whenever possible.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,650
So let's go have a quick look at different apology's with the same shape and hop on over into a blender.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,790
So here we are in blender and I've got three layers all with three spheres on it.

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,360
This is this simple example as I could possibly think of to demonstrate this.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:18,760
I've got Layer 1 2 and 3 as you can see the ball changes slightly in its shading etc. There may be a

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,300
scaling issue there but they all look the same and you can't tell their construction by just looking

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,740
at the shape.

19
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,850
Now if I were to go into edit mode on this you see that this one is made up of quads all the way around

20
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:41,810
it and what that means is if we're in face select mode I can start selecting rings around it very easily.

21
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:49,710
These face loops going round without any problem whatsoever and that has a great impact when editing

22
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,760
because you can edit a lot at once.

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,430
If we have a look at perhaps one of the other spheres we have here the same on the second layer.

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,070
By hop into edit mode.

25
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,010
On this you'll see that it's a uv's Sphere.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,050
It comes to a pole at the top so similar to the last sphere.

27
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,350
I can still select some rings going round.

28
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,810
I can select the all these face loops going around here and the face loops going up and down but you'll

29
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:24,460
notice that I can't reach the top or go all the way around so that one is almost as useful as the previous

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,970
one.

31
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,840
However you will notice that the squares themselves the quads aren't particularly.

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:36,370
Even they change in size quite dramatically from these small narrow ones at the top to pretty square

33
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:44,350
ones in the middle and if we hop over to the previous one you'll see that pretty much all of these quads

34
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,470
are the same size across the entire model.

35
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,710
And that also makes it nice and easy to model with.

36
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,720
To work with.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,400
Especially if you're sharing files with other people.

38
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,930
It's very important that we get topology right so someone else can pick it up and work with it.

39
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,700
The final example I have here is a nother spear and you probably already guessing it is sent IKO sphere.

40
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,200
Now this would be an absolute pain in the backside to try and work with.

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:20,440
Because if we try and select any loops there aren't any because every single join is a pole and if we

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,160
remember going back a pole is basically where edges joined together and we can see here there are 1

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,650
2 3 4 5 6 joining this particular vertex here in the middle and Ideally we just want quads so the flow

44
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,920
of edges goes round one way and round another.

45
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,470
Now occasionally we can have five or three joining together will discuss that further along in this

46
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,560
section.

47
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,540
Now it's not all about quads now.

48
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:55,840
Quads are very important but it's topology that defines a Faces key shape or any objects shapes the

49
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,500
edges.

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,060
In face loops will follow the general features around one's face or any particular object that your

51
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,350
modelling loops will help with the editing and we'll see that in great detail coming soon and loops

52
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:17,800
will help with defamation an animation so if you wanted to make your character smile or frown if you

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,950
were trying to do it it was a triangular mesh.

54
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,900
It would be a lot more difficult to do.

55
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,200
Now I've got a couple of examples here all made with quads.

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:34,670
Now on the left we have bad even though it's all made up with quads in general.

57
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,870
None of these air edge loops or face loops follow the actual features of the face.

58
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:46,630
If we have a look over on the right hand side we can see that the eyes are defined with a loop going

59
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,410
round them.

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,670
So is the mouth.

61
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,800
In so is the whole face itself.

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,090
And there's one on the ear as well.

63
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,050
If we have a look at going a bit further from this so we're going as a very low poly model there.

64
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,900
If we then go to the next step up you can see that these features are defined even more.

65
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,240
There's a ring running round the nose.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,880
You can definitely see that in this second example here you can see the ones going Rammy eyes.

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,290
There's one big one going around the cheeks and round the face.

68
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,500
And of course the mouth is as a well is well defined by these rings or loops going round.

69
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,910
And that is what's really important now can be quite challenging to do that and will go through the

70
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,300
construction of each part of the face in detail and giving you some tools as we go but it's very important

71
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,920
to realize that it's not all about quads.

72
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,200
It's also how you arrange them.

73
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,090
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

74
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,140
I'd like you to go ahead and plan your topology.

75
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,050
Now knowing how you're going to create your model is very important.

76
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,200
So that's what this challenge is all about.

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:00,400
I'd like to go and get your reference material and mark out the key features and draw on the main face

78
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,680
loops running around your model balls a video now and give that a go.

79
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,520
Okay guys.

80
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,380
Welcome back.

81
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:18,130
Let's go have a look at my reference material and let's have a look at where the facelifts will be.

82
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,080
Okay so in front of us we have a photo of me.

83
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,450
Now one of the key areas will be around the mouth.

84
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,030
So let's go ahead and draw a loop around the mouth.

85
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,720
Now there also be a loop around each eye.

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,500
Now those are pretty well-defined and easy to spot.

87
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,260
So there we go we've got the loops running around there.

88
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,020
Now of course we've got another loop that defines the entire face itself.

89
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,430
So we go all the way around.

90
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:55,280
And we're mainly focussed on the front of our face at the moment so we've got one that runs around that

91
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,900
area.

92
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,010
There now because of planning these things it helps us work out how we're going to construct our model.

93
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,290
Now the is we can't really see from this angle so I'm going to focus on those.

94
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,320
There are a couple of loops that run around because it's in intertwining loop and the is quite complicated

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,520
and will go home for that in more detail.

96
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:22,190
Now the nose itself is going to be a loop that runs around the bottom around there around that sort

97
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,920
of area.

98
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:30,710
And there's one more loop as it runs along the top of the bridge of the nose around there and then runs

99
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,980
down to the chin and back up again.

100
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,600
And that helps us control our model because that encompasses all the areas where the muscles would be

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,720
moving the skin underneath.

102
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,990
Now this is our only one way of doing this if you weren't moving certain parts you wouldn't have to

103
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,850
do all of this in the amount of detail you include.

104
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,530
Again it will vary depending on the model you're doing going to make it quite a basic model to begin

105
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:00,920
with.

106
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:07,990
So then we can develop past skills without getting too deep and complicated and time consuming.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,250
Remember from the last section the more detail you need to do the longer it's going to take.

108
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,590
And I would rather go through six or seven models and it take me a day or two to do than do one model

109
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:27,260
it take me a week and I haven't learnt all of the skills by the repetition going through making these

110
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,880
models.

111
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,220
So don't be afraid to make more than one.

112
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,770
So those are my loops that I'm going to concentrate on when I start making my model.

113
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,860
How did you define your loops.

114
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,330
Did you get all of these in here.

115
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,140
Did you miss a couple.

116
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,820
Were you surprised about the one that goes across the bridge or around the tip of the nose.

117
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,090
Please share.

118
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,540
As always in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
