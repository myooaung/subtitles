00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.920
Welcome to using objects with particle systems.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.100
In this video you will learn how you can place hundreds of objects easily and fluidly using the particle

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.050
system.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.030
We're going to control the distribution of particles using the weight painting and virtex groups and

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.310
turn off outlines when they start to clutter the view.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.440
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.290
Okay so we'll start off with the outlines in fact since we've got some good examples in front.

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.050
Now if you followed through on the last challenge you'll notice I turn them on and off.

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.500
So this is where I officially after the event of course tell you about the outline so when you start

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.430
to have hundreds of these in our scene it's going to be quite difficult to actually see what's going

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.910
on.

12
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.950
If I get very cluttered very quickly now in the propertys pain the nke on the 3D view when you scroll

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.810
down there will be an option for display and sometimes it's toggled in or out but there's simply a checkbox

14
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.850
here that you can use outlines selected or not and you can see straightaway that it's great to be able

15
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.170
to see what's actually going on and how it looks.

16
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.990
Now the other thing that I noticed as I was working on this is that this model itself is quite high

17
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.230
in its polygon count.

18
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.250
So let's see if we can sort that out before we start putting hundreds of them into our scene.

19
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.130
So let's have a look at the modifiers here and I'm going to use the decimate modifier similar to how

20
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.760
we made our low poly porn over in the chest section.

21
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.400
Now when we use unsub divide for this one and we can see I've got 259 faces and if I turn on the outline

22
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.900
again we can see that most of them are on these small blades of grass crisscrossing one another.

23
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.840
Some I'm going to increase these iterations and it looks like the lowest number of faces I can get is

24
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.710
around five iterations.

25
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.040
Yeah.

26
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.040
And 23 faces interestingly.

27
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.370
You get less number four.

28
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.080
Okay.

29
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.710
So let's see what it looks like number four.

30
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.490
Again I'm going to have to turn the outlying isolated off.

31
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.970
Now if I was really close to the grass would I notice that.

32
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.880
Maybe not.

33
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.970
Now it gets a bit funny here it goes a bit wobbly.

34
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.100
Let's see how it looks at three and it's a tiny bit smoother.

35
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.770
I think we can actually get away with it at four houses were very rarely going to be this close to the

36
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.260
grass and if we are going to be lots of other grass around as well that's going to disguise any of these

37
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.880
nooks and crannies and kinks in the blades of grass.

38
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.650
So I'm going to do that and apply my decimate so I've dropped this massively down from the number of

39
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.150
faces it had and obviously the number of triangles it had as well.

40
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.900
Much much neater.

41
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.000
So let's play about with adding objects into a scene.

42
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.120
Now in order to do that I'm first going to save my file and I'm going to demonstrate the whole object

43
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.480
putting into a scene not in our bunny scene at the moment so I'm going to go ahead and open up a new

44
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.150
file and reload the start up file.

45
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.090
So let's go ahead and play with our cube here.

46
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.940
I'm going to move it to one side and I'm going to create a cone so we're going to have a cone and Cube

47
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.640
as our two objects that we're going to play with and use the particle system on.

48
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.530
Now I'm going to select both of them and put them on Lay five let's say So they're just out of the way.

49
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.590
Whoops I've just moved to layer five rather than moved them to layer 5.

50
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.780
But let's work on left.

51
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.690
Anyway.

52
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.130
And that's what you'll probably want to do with most of the objects that you want to use with any particle

53
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.840
system move them to their own separate layer so they're just out of the way and you can turn them on

54
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.860
and off really quickly.

55
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.320
Right.

56
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.570
I'm going to add a ground plane.

57
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.140
That were going to work with.

58
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.780
I'm just going to scale it up and probably just subdivide it a couple of times or hop into edit mode

59
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.350
and subdivide and I'll just make it a little bit uneven as well that's probably a bit too much geometry

60
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.050
but it will do for this example them.

61
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.400
Paul that's up there.

62
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.900
Spread it out and make a big hill there so we can watch things go over and I'm going to make a less

63
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.660
of a big hill though.

64
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.100
I'm just going to play about and you can obviously make your touraine how you want to make it so that

65
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.900
looks pretty good for the moment.

66
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.810
For our example I don't wanna hate.

67
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.870
Wrong one Swan and move it down.

68
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.650
No we get so lots of lots of geometry going on there a lovely smooth train.

69
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.740
In fact it only will be smooth if I turn on smooth shading.

70
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.060
So there we go we've got a basic train that now we can start putting our mesh objects on.

71
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.750
So let's start by adding a particle effect to this ground plane.

72
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.460
So I'm going to click on the particle's option here and create a new particle system.

73
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.080
I am going to start with the cones because it is important that I show you something that happens with

74
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.970
objects.

75
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:14.850
It may not happen with your textures since textures have y as facing up the particle systems also have.

76
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.410
Why is facing up.

77
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.500
So let's go ahead and create cones.

78
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.040
I'm going to call this one Cone's as well so we know when we can borrow it in a bit to apply it to our

79
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.220
cubes as well but we're going to set up one first of all it's going to be of type hairs and we can see

80
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.510
the hairs now growing out now.

81
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.740
We can replace those hairs with objects.

82
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.540
Now I know with the size of Cuban probably going to have to turn down the number that we have some just

83
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.250
going to turn it down to maybe 50.

84
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.850
For the moment.

85
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.410
And that also keeps our viewport nice and quick.

86
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.620
We can always change this later.

87
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:56.360
Now the hair length when dealing with objects you'll probably want to set the hair length to one and

88
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.640
then scrolling down under.

89
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.970
All Where is it hidden under objects so we select objects and the size here set that as one.

90
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.890
Now when that's one and this hair length here is one.

91
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:18.710
Your object will be the size that you created it rather than some random size in between.

92
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.300
That's always very useful for making sure that the scene is laid out as you were expecting it.

93
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.230
It's caught me out no end when I've not set these two to one obviously.

94
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.000
Feel free to change them afterwards to your heart's content but that's a very good starting point.

95
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.010
So now the object is selected.

96
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.470
We can go in cool actually going collect or go and pick the cone.

97
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.030
So it was pointing up on this layer here and on layer 5.

98
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.380
It's not it's O K or it looks like I haven't moved my justice.

99
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.320
I went to layer 5 a month press m and then moved to there 5.

100
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.530
Never mind.

101
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.220
But here we have a problem.

102
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.370
They're all laying on their side and we don't want that.

103
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.720
And that's because why is up as far as the particle system is concerned.

104
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:15.100
So we all we simply need to do is rotate our original cube around so we can enable both of the layers.

105
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.130
Now I've got to find that original Cuban I'm going to do that in the rather than playing hunt.

106
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.250
Kubic keep saying cube cone.

107
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.790
Rather than playing hump the cone.

108
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.680
I'm just going to select it in the outliner.

109
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.580
And I'm going to rotate it and let's rotate it around the y axis.

110
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.460
I'm sorry to have problems rotating it's rigour is rotating.

111
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.850
Ah yes of course this has caught me out no end of times.

112
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.150
On the plane itself we need to inherit the rotation.

113
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.110
So let's turn them both back on and see what happens when we click on rotation.

114
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.640
They rotate round brilliant.

115
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.330
So let's just undo what we've just done with the rotation.

116
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.230
There we go.

117
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.750
So back to here.

118
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.370
Back to plane back to rotation.

119
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:09.370
Make sure that's turned on over to the cone and let's rotate it in the y axis and see what happens.

120
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:18.280
So that looks like 90 90 degrees in the y axis sorts that out and makes it right obviously because we've

121
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.900
got some hills here some of them will bit a slight angle because they follow the curvature of the ground

122
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.230
that you place them on.

123
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.900
So now that we've done that those look quite small.

124
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.540
And you're thinking oh Mike I think you said if I set both to one they'll be full size.

125
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.100
Well they are full size.

126
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.800
It's just that half the cube is underneath.

127
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.870
And that's to do with its origin.

128
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:45.130
So if we go to the cone itself I keep saying cube if we go to the cone itself and the actual cone rather

129
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.140
than anything else.

130
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.230
Let's hop over to this player here.

131
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.510
Click anywhere on the base with the left mouse button and that'll set the 3-d cursor and then we can

132
00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:02.170
just simply set the origin to the three cursor and see how that looks when we go back to this layer.

133
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.100
Excellent.

134
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.300
Now they're all on top of the surface.

135
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:12.040
Now you can play with all the particle stuff that you've done before so you can go in an ADD children

136
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:18.310
and if you do add children I would suggest they were interpolated So let's go to the children's section

137
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:24.460
here and do interpolated and they will follow the curvature of the ground that's a very spiky ground.

138
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.770
Now you won't want to stand on that.

139
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.630
And of course you can play with the uniform and loads of other things to your heart's content so you

140
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.180
could build up grass like this if you wanted to.

141
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.010
Well that's another way of generating the geometry.

142
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:45.280
Now one final thing let's turn off children for this moment in time so we can see what's going on.

143
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.580
Let's go and add another particle system so I would always recommend if you're using one particle system

144
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.100
and you've got loads more that are going to be similar that you get one of them right.

145
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.070
To begin with.

146
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:03.760
Because we can borrow those settings with a new one so that sets up a new particle system and called

147
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.520
it kubes.

148
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:11.860
And if we go here and we are talking about cubes this time we can borrow the currents.

149
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.200
Now we need to make it unique by clicking on this number.

150
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.440
Otherwise anything we change down here will change both of these particle effects.

151
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.520
So let's go down here and press the number two.

152
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.640
It changes to cone 0 0 1 and I'm going to rename that immediately kubes.

153
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.120
Now it looks no different at the moment because we do need to scroll down to the object and change it

154
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.000
to cube.

155
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.010
And you can see here that we've still got the same problem with it being half half.

156
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.300
I'm not going to sort that out at the moment but you can see that all of these objects are placed in

157
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.660
exactly the same location.

158
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:51.640
Now the way you change that scroll up and change the seed and the seed will change its placement.

159
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.100
Now that's great for randomizing things and making sure they don't all appear in the same place especially

160
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.130
if they've got the same number of admissions.

161
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.620
Another way of changing it is to change the number of emissions that are going on.

162
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.230
And eventually that will shuffle.

163
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.320
But it does still have some on top of one another.

164
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:17.260
So again changing the seeds will be the easiest way to make sure that they dont overlap right on top

165
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.050
of one another.

166
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.860
So the one final thing just like with the bunny you can use weight painting as well.

167
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.640
So say we wanted only these.

168
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:33.910
I will get my teeth back in the cones to be on the hilly parts of our of our mesh where we would make

169
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.410
sure the mesh is selected.

170
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:42.250
We go to the object data properties over here and let's scroll down with adverts group and I'm going

171
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.390
to call it kones on Hill.

172
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:52.500
It's always good to name it round this way and then immediately switch into white painting.

173
00:11:53.340 --> 00:12:00.070
I'm going to turn off our particle system so I can see what's going on with the eyes there.

174
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.750
And so we've got these two hills so I can paint on that hill.

175
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:09.560
I can paint on that hill and I probably have to spin round and paint the other side of the hill as well.

176
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:19.860
And then I'm going to reduce or increase the size of the brush and reduce it strength down to 25 percent

177
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.670
or thereabouts.

178
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.850
Yeah that's fine.

179
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.460
And I'm just going to go over there.

180
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.850
Over here over there.

181
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.640
There once more.

182
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.660
There we go.

183
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:40.130
So that should help control the distribution of our of our cones and limited to only these areas leaving

184
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.610
the blue area clear.

185
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.040
So let's turn them back on and the first thing you say is all the Keeps haven't moved.

186
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:50.720
But remember the particle effect which is and this scroll down and changed the density setting under

187
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.130
virtex groups the density here to kones on Hill.

188
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.510
Oh that's great.

189
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.560
I didn't check what I was doing.

190
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.060
I have cues on health.

191
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:06.200
I was right when I said Dubes the first phone round I'm going to do remember which one you're selecting

192
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.200
when you're moving things about.

193
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:13.500
Of course I can scroll down and this cones on here I can just remove that.

194
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.890
Go to the cones themselves scroll down and click on gowns on Hill.

195
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.370
There we go.

196
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.440
So now the cones have moved to the Hill.

197
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:30.020
And if I turn off the cubes themselves to here we can see that they're distributed more in the red areas

198
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.740
than they are in the green and light blue areas.

199
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.660
Perfect.

200
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.820
Now armed with that knowledge I've got a challenge for you guys.

201
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:45.680
I would like you to plant some grass create a particle system for each grass mesh object and see your

202
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.780
landscape with grass.

203
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.850
Use low quantities at this stage.

204
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:56.390
Now might not look great but you don't want to slow yourself down when prototyping and use your texture.

205
00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:05.060
Plants that we've made spidering Lee through out the environment set the ground colour to create a ground

206
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.050
material.

207
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:14.600
I suggest a diffuse brown colour and reiterate your scene lots and keep your samples low ash you go

208
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:22.770
and remember control and B to set a render border in the camera view to limit where your rendering said

209
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.470
to give you some more suggestions.

210
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:32.270
Turn off each particle system as you go for speed and seeing how each individual particle system looks

211
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.720
and then finally when you render the scene there is a good chance they will take a long time.

212
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:45.530
So keep those samples and resolution low intil you are happy to turn them up for fine or renders.

213
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:53.660
So to give you an idea of what I mean when I was prototyping I have grass that looks like this and you're

214
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.230
going well.

215
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.990
That looks horrible and grainy.

216
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:01.490
It's supposed to it's a prototype that took about 45 seconds or something along those lines to throw

217
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.800
out.

218
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.870
And I believe my samples were set to 5.

219
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.760
I didn't want to wait ages I just want to get an overview.

220
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.820
I keep iterating that and again I then mucked around with the grass and got it looking a bit more natural

221
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.350
and I ended up with this.

222
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:23.030
And again it's at five samples and when I looked at my rabbit's eyes when oh hang on a minute I have

223
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:23.900
I can see.

224
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.610
I can see the bit is supposed to be covered up.

225
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.710
You know we didn't model the lakes to keep it nice and simple but that looks like a levitating magical

226
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.870
bunny at the moment wishes certainly isn't.

227
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:39.170
So I then set a render border up so I could focus on that small area and make sure it comes out correctly

228
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:45.590
during the render and then and only then when I was happy with everything and set everything up did

229
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:53.540
I hit the render button at a higher sample rethink I picked 75 for my samples here and as you can see

230
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.330
it looks pretty good.

231
00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:03.070
So go ahead and pause a video and go and plant some grass across our landscape.

232
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:09.680
Now I'm not going to be able to show you my solution in this video so that will be in the next lecture.

233
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:15.030
So once you've done remember to share in the discussions your solution to this.

234
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.710
I'd love to see them and I will see you in the next lecture.
