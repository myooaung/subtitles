00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.790
In this video we're talking about the shape of the hair strand.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.750
Not something that we need to mess around with a lot but just wanted you to know that we've been looking

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.180
at these hair strands look very thin and consistent.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.640
But in reality when we render them they look different.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.270
So I to switch over from the Eevee engine to the cycles rendering engine when I do that you can see

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.750
this is what we're actually working with each strand of hair has a root at right at the base of it and

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.620
then a tip.

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.150
And it goes from one width until another width.

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.740
So if we expand if we jump into our particle properties scroll on down and let's find our hair shape

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.670
opening that up you can see we have diameter root and we have tip.

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.200
If I change the tip to one you can see that we have now more of a solid pencil looking approach and

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.330
we have the point at the end.

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.710
If I unclip close tip then you can see it's hard to see on my screen here but you can see that it's

14
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.110
a flat and we don't have that kind of pencil tip at the end of it.

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.260
If I click it back home we do.

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.280
So you can play around with the numbers you can play around with the diameter root and that will make

17
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.140
the base fatter.

18
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.110
You can play around with the tip that will make the tip fatter or wider.

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.000
And this is really good to know why am I telling you this so it's good to know if you want to create

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.860
a different look for different sort of character maybe it's hair like here I've made the diameter Route

21
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.530
10.

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120
You might want to be out to see it has probably a little bit too big.

23
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.360
Make the tip huge as well.

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.450
Five.

25
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.970
It's something that when you zoom out you'll be out to see the hair a lot differently.

26
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.170
So it's good if you make a video game character that doesn't need to be super realistic just going to

27
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.510
turn the number of children down a little bit so we can see see 10 might try to.

28
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.050
There we go.

29
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.630
So you might be creating a different sort of character an ogre or a or a human.

30
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.820
That's for a video game where you want to be out to see these just solid chunks of hair strands is a

31
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.150
lot more of a stylized look.

32
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.040
For me it makes me look a little bit like an alien in here but it's really useful for us to play around

33
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.330
with this to illustrate the point.

34
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.700
So now is a good time.

35
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.030
If you're not following me as I go now is a good time just play around with your model.

36
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.290
Remember you need to be in cycles rendering which is making my computer not have a good time at all

37
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.740
it's really starting to chug.

38
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.450
And of course you can get as I'm doing here you can get some pretty extreme looks if you want to just

39
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.210
play around with things and see how they how they look.

40
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.260
Turn the number of children down or the number children up change the diamond route change a shape so

41
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.010
that tip.

42
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.170
So if you haven't done so already just pause a video and have a little bit of a play with that okay

43
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.490
I'm gonna just return things back to normal a little bit because we're at the stage now where I want

44
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.950
to move on from playing around with the strands of hair and actually style the hair so it looks half

45
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.080
decent so it's going to turn the children display and rendering amount back to 30.

46
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.490
Oh and before we move on add a camera back into our scene if you're crazy like me and you deleted it

47
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.570
shift a and then find Camera click to add I'm going to hop into material view so I can still see with

48
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.830
my camera but my computer's not handling screen recording and blender and all the other things going

49
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.870
on at the same time so I've just hopped into material view now while I've got the view lined up that

50
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.460
I want I'm gonna hit control old and the zero on the number pad that will line the camera up with where

51
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:21.230
the view currently is and then hit it on my keyboard to open up our side panel I'm going to look for

52
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.500
the view tab and in here look camera to view that means as I scroll around move around the camera then

53
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.710
we can get a good view.

54
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.960
It's getting nice and close.

55
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.400
The important thing here is just to be out to see the hair so you can render it and see oh how's my

56
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.570
hand looking at the moment.

57
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.710
We don't need to see the rest of the head just for the moment.

58
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.840
So uncheck hit end to close that up again.

59
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.010
Oh and of course before we progressed let's go into the render and particle properties turn off the

60
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.040
show emitter in our render area so that we can hit F twelve and know that we will only get the hair

61
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.390
and not the emitter as well.

62
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.820
Okay.

63
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.960
That's looking fine I can see what I want to see.

64
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.190
It's not perfect but we need to style our hair first before we decide.

65
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.620
I think what the final hair strand looks like.

66
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.720
So I'm just gonna leave it fairly default for now and I think it's time for us actually style our hair

67
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.230
so it looks the shape that we want it to look so.

68
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.200
Time for challenge.

69
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.330
So Graham your hair.

70
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.450
Take a limited time now.

71
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.640
We've done this a few times so I'm not going to go through it step by step.

72
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.610
I'll just show you my final result but I want you to get the size the shape the direction the thickness

73
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.730
of the hair to the point you are happy with it using the particle edit tools and then after that we

74
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.410
will work on adding some colour randomness so to give you a lot of flexibility in terms of how you would

75
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.190
like to colour the hair on your models so pose a video take that on.

76
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.580
I'll see you back here when you done so if you're interested.

77
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.230
I have a speed run through of what I'm doing I'm just reducing the length using shrink so you can either

78
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.360
have clicked on grow and hold down shift or you can click on shrink which is up in the top middle of

79
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.380
our menu.

80
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.000
One other thing that we haven't talked about before is I can click on a button interpolate so you see

81
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.680
right about now I clicked on interpolate.

82
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.230
That's while we're in the ad mode that allows you to add headers that have the same direction and shape

83
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.550
and size as the heads around it pretty handy to use going to grow a little bit more on the top here.

84
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.120
I wish I could do that that easily.

85
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.540
I'm just using the comb changing the pivot.

86
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.890
So a change in the point that I'm manipulating starting off with the tip to get it in the right direction

87
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.350
and then using some other settings up there in terms of whether it's the entire path or the entire vertices.

88
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.910
Okay now just playing around with some different types of look to it.

89
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.060
None of those really do what I wanted to.

90
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.950
Let's have a look in random mode to see how the fatness or the thickness of the hair is looking I think

91
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.480
for mine it needs to be a little bit thinner again mirroring real life a little bit here.

92
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.540
Having my hair a little bit the strands not quite so thick and then just a little bit more styling left

93
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.300
and right pushing it around around the back here.

94
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.720
Looks like they're a little bit too short.

95
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.040
You can see the skin showing through so just playing around with the growing and shrinking properties

96
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.600
and also a little bit of puff just have it sit away from the head a little bit if you want these strains

97
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.940
to stand to attention and you can use the puff tool looking around looking around making sure it looks

98
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.930
the way I want it to look and a little bit more at the front.

99
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.880
I think just growing moving and you can see as I move them they've got a little bit of a bend a bit

100
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.770
of a kink to it's something that we'll talk about.

101
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.350
I think we'll talk about this in the next video is it we can have a little bit more detail to the strands

102
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.960
to have them had the shape a little bit smoother at this point I didn't like there are a couple of strands

103
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.090
sticking out of the front so I was just looking to see what I could do could I move some vertices around

104
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.500
to have that a cleaner edge could I do some white painting to have it look a little bit nicer at the

105
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.360
front there and in the end I decided just to tighten it up with the White painting so that we had more

106
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.010
of a straight line to get rid of some of those random hairs that were kind of flying around so you can

107
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:55.740
either move your vertices on the mesh itself on the object or you can do the white painting you can

108
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.540
reduce the number of children so a lot of levers to pull on here but for me I'm pretty happy that I

109
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.820
got a nice consistent hairline at the front.

110
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.470
Okay I'm really ready to do something with the color of his hair so that's what we'll be doing in the

111
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.910
next video and so let's jump into the next lecture and work on the hair color.
