Hello everybody and welcome to this section.
1

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,960
Now in this section we're going to make a low poly chess set.
2

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,610
Now the great thing about the low poly Chester is it's going to enable us to focus on the modelling
3

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,390
skills we're learning rather than making a high detailed model.
4

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,730
Now if you've got the skills to make a high detailed model high poly model then please go ahead.
5

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,470
I'd love to see where you come up with but for the rest of us we'll follow along we'll have a low poly
6

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,660
chess set by the end of it.
7

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,380
And we will have a little look at making 3D models as well.
8

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,020
If you've got a 3D printer we can't dive into the details too much but I have lots of fun printing mine
9

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,330
out at the very end.
10

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,060
Now we're also going to texture our models for the first time.
11

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,820
So we have applied materials to our models reports give them color and make them glossy or matte and
12

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,390
this time we're going to start using a texture as well.
13

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,460
So this is a way of controlling how that surface looks whether it's color or its reflectivity.
14

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,860
There's loads and loads of options.
15

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,720
So we'll touch upon texturing your models for the very first time.
16

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:08,950
Now after we've done that of course it is time to wrap it all up and make the scene look awesome.
17

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,350
So going to talk about how we can set the camera up orbiting around and we're also going to give it a
18

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,260
background and environment to your scene as well.
19

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,660
So it just looks so much better than just sitting in a void like a lot of models end up doing, So without
20

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,110
any further ado let's crack on and hop on over in the blender.
