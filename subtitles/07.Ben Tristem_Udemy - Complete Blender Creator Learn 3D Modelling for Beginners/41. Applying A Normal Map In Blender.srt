00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,180
Welcome to applying a normal map in blender.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,490
So this is going to be the continuation from the challenge in the last lecture where we create a normal

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,950
map just to remind you of that challenge we're going to take.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,290
One of the models up to at least 10 levels say Now I've already done that because it takes quite a while

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,560
to do some modelling.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,040
And we're going to create a normal map of that and apply it to a lower polygon model and then finally

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,840
are share the two side by side so we can see which is which.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,620
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,620
Okay so I've opened up my window and this is the file that I have been working on.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:44,760
I've got my elodie B and I've also been working on an L O D C so let's enable that and this is what

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,610
it looks like he's got a few quirks here in there but overall I'm happy with the outcome.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,720
It looks much more higgledy piggledy than another one would.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,930
So there is a couple of things that we need to think about before I go forward and the first one is

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,260
this material now in a moment I'm about to build up a new material based upon my original wall but it

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,870
is going to be unique to this particular model.

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,530
So in that case I don't think I need it linked anymore because as soon as we apply the normal map there

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,540
is specifically for this model simply because it's got a hole in the middle.

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,750
We are well we can't link it anymore so we can actually break that link completely.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,530
And I've clicked the little icon there so it's now local to this particular model.

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,830
Okay so now that we've done that I'm broken that's a wall link.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,040
We can now start working on the model a little further.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,780
The first well I'm not sure what order to do this in that it doesn't really matter in many ways but

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,410
I'm trying to go through it in a logical manner.

24
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,450
I think I need to deal with the multiple you v maps.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,570
I know we with an image so let's create a new image and call it window normal 44.

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,240
Oh that's badly spelt normal.

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,040
There you go.

28
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,360
And if we now have a look at the U V map if we try and bake to this image it's going to cause a problem

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,250
and show you that.

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,950
Now let's see if we can bake straight away Sir elodie see to elodie B.

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,930
That's fine.

32
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,860
Is selected Let's scroll down here.

33
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,380
Go to break.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,790
And we want normal selected to active.

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,710
And the race distance I'm going to go for points.

36
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,540
Not sure of it's going to be OK.

37
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,260
No active image found in material wall.

38
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,430
Okay so we run the risk here of overwriting an image.

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,200
If we're not careful so let's proceed with caution.

40
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,770
Okay.

41
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,290
It's currently assigned.

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,130
We've got the wall texture here and that possibly the wall material and the texture that we're trying

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,990
to write to is a generated texture.

44
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,360
So we need an image texture.

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,960
And here is the church block work.

46
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,390
We don't want that we want the window normal.

47
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,120
So I've swapped over to that that's now our active image and I'm going to hit bake.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,810
Excellent.

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,060
So that's done exactly what I thought it was going to do.

50
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,110
It's updated the.

51
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,220
Wow that looks absolutely out of the sky but anyway so you can see here that the UV map is too big for

52
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,160
the image so we can go and sort that out.

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,340
That's not a problem at all.

54
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,130
We need to basically scale that image in.

55
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,750
So I'm going to go ahead or scale not the image sorry the movie map in but we need a new you v map first

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,020
so I'm going to go to you v maps in the data properties and then add a new You've come out and I'm going

57
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,220
to call it normal map instead.

58
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Now that I've got a normal map there we can go ahead and just bring this up so I can see what's going

59
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,910
on.

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,920
I can hide elodie see from my scene for the moment so I can see what's going on and what I can do here

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,150
is stop in the edit mode real quick.

62
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,090
Bring this back down so I can see what's going on.

63
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,600
And I actually only need one of these on.

64
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,520
On this particular image here.

65
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,380
So I'm going to scale that in is snappin turned on no it's not a scale that down and move it.

66
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,870
So I don't need the whole image on because I actually only care about the front.

67
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,980
So let's move down to there.

68
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:34,530
Now when we're actually mapping I do care about these two being on top of one another so this bit here

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,990
and this one here being on top the front of the back on top of one another because they'll be projecting

70
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,570
different Normal's onto one another.

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,710
And now that I've rearranged that we can make no valid cited options there too there.

72
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,500
Make sure we can see it.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,640
Okay.

74
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,260
That is exactly what I wanted.

75
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:04,750
Now that I've done that if I so wish I can go back to the U V here and move this area on top of the

76
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,390
other one.

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,540
So they share the same data and I'm going to do that right away.

78
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:18,640
So the select this with snapping turned on was snapping snapping to vertex a move that sits right on

79
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,650
top of the other one.

80
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,800
And that should mean that both sides now share the same normal map.

81
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,770
Hopefully we will see if that works.

82
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,850
So I think I'm done in the image editor for the moment.

83
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,650
Wow that does look interesting that's been mapped funnily but that's absolutely fine because that's

84
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,180
how the other image was mapped.

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,030
Not this one.

86
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,850
So that's coming along well.

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,200
And what we can do here is go to are you the image editor.

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,110
No I want the node editor.

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,730
Let's have a look at how it's set up so far.

90
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,300
So we've got the material outputs and the diffuse shader.

91
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,330
Now the diffuse shader has an image defining it which at the moment is this really wacky one and we

92
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,770
want to change it back to the blockwork image in a moment.

93
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,980
And that is being that while it's mapped according to the texture corner of a U V.

94
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:14,650
Now because we have more than one u v in our scene at the moment I want to make sure that this is more

95
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,560
explicit because at the moment just u v is not enough.

96
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,660
So I'm going to clear and remove it from our scene completely or removed from the node editor completely

97
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:30,840
and add in an input and if we scroll down we had texture cornet right down at the bottom is you've Emap.

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,740
So I'm going to select the movie map.

99
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,210
Um.

100
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,780
To duplicate that because we're going to have one for the normal map and we're going to have one for

101
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,050
the V map.

102
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,050
I'm also going to duplicate the image texture.

103
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,040
So we've got Windows normal here and the chop church block works.

104
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,280
There we go we've got the blockwork back again and I'm going to turn off hello DC for the moment.

105
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:59,470
I don't need to see it anymore so I'm going to add this movie map to these two here.

106
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,640
Perfect that's exactly what I want see this image.

107
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,070
Texture is being controlled by the normal map so we're going to plug that in.

108
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,910
Won't see anything yet.

109
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,290
It's very tempting of course it has.

110
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,220
Plug them in like vats.

111
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,050
That's going to give us an effect but not the right one.

112
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:25,270
We need to explicitly convert this into a normal map so let's go to vector and normal map.

113
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,040
And we can plug the colour in to the colour.

114
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,670
And normal in normal.

115
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,380
And there we go it's starting to look much better and we can see there are a few little things that

116
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,580
need tidying up here.

117
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,780
This is horrible.

118
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,410
This line here that doesn't gel with me at all.

119
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,080
Have you got anything else like that.

120
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,890
Not particularly.

121
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,380
Okay so this line here now the question is do we fix it and remake our normal map or can we fix it in

122
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,920
the image editor so let's give a go to the image editor that's zoom in here.

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,430
I think we can fix that so I'm going to go right in as close as possible.

124
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,710
And change this to paint mode.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,780
Make that a bit smaller to work with.

126
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:25,190
Open up the tool shelf and using the colours there the primary colour Im going to pick something purple

127
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:32,480
and then literally start painting over what we've got here and and make this even smaller go turn accumulate

128
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,310
on so you can go backwards and forwards really quickly.

129
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,470
And as you can see here I am a bit clueless as to how this is going to turn out.

130
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,520
I'm going to assume it's going to come out okay.

131
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:51,010
I'm going to use the smear now Gia make these bits blend in so it's not so sharp.

132
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,910
Because I'm being careful here not to go over the lines.

133
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,800
I remember as a child shawn's Colour within the lines that they want to break that and the question

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,240
is after I save that save it as a window normal that's absolutely fine.

135
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,100
After I save this or I might as well go over that one as well.

136
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,460
So Image save image.

137
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,720
Okay.

138
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,790
The question is does it make a decent impact on here.

139
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,920
The answer is yes it does.

140
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,410
Brilliant.

141
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,230
That looks much much better.

142
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,200
So I'm really happy with that and how that's turned out.

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,610
Oh I haven't checked the other side of course.

144
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,460
How does the other side look.

145
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,280
I can't really see the others in the sun.

146
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,530
I'm going to duplicate the sun in this case.

147
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,020
And it doesn't actually matter where it's facing kind of irritates it.

148
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,040
Why 90 right 180.

149
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,490
I'm just going to move this around until you get extra lights.

150
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
Let's lock it to the x-axis.

151
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,700
Can we get it on this side as well.

152
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,770
Almost.

153
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,280
So let's see what this looks like on the other side.

154
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,010
Okay.

155
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,200
Yeah that's worked pretty well as well we've got the normal mat being applied across the other side

156
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,790
as well.

157
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,960
It looks a bit odd down here but I will forgive that.

158
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,870
I'm going to make sure that safety.

159
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,340
And of course once I've done that I can hop over into the gothic church and actually see how it's looking

160
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,580
in situ so into the gothic church.

161
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,760
And we've got a couple of windows here.

162
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:37,080
In fact I think the camera of the last camera of your had yet the switch in rendered mode.

163
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,190
Okay we have a series of them here around the side and I'm going to render that out and see how that

164
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:48,450
looks.

165
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,400
It's going to take a few moments to do but a rendering is often the best way of seeing how things are

166
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,390
looking.

167
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,530
Okay so this is rendering out one of the first things I can see is a seam joining these together.

168
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,840
It's not that pronounced.

169
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,890
I'm surprised at the I've I've actually given it no consideration.

170
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:20,970
However some of the more powerful features are standing out quite a lot and that is this area to the

171
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,200
lower left of the window it stands out like a sore thumb and this dark patch here.

172
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,800
It really does stink of repetition essentially now.

173
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,530
I thought this line going down here would be the worst thing completely.

174
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,610
But it turns out that isn't actually the giveaway.

175
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:48,170
My eye is drawn to this light spots again and again and again and again so that's something I can work

176
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,570
on.

177
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,250
And let's go take a look now and see how it's looking over in a game engine.

178
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,020
Okay so here I am I've not misapplied a texture.

179
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,410
So here I am just walking around in unity.

180
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,620
And we can see that the normal map has applied really well.

181
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:15,030
Now I did have a few issues trying to get it to actually adhere because it's on the second duvy channel

182
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,860
it doesn't look right.

183
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,880
Unity supports a third TV channel.

184
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,550
I'm open for correction on that.

185
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,220
I'm not a unity expert but here we go.

186
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,690
We've got it a plied to our model and it's looking pretty good considering that is absolutely flat.

187
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,270
That looks like there is detail in the wall.

188
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,130
And again we can see that bright area to the lower left really standing out.

189
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,030
Whether or not we need to do something about that at the moment I'd say no but maybe later on.

190
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,030
How are you guys getting on with your bump maps.

191
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,280
Have you decided that some of your model should be left as just geometry.

192
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,030
Post your results in the discussions.

193
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,480
And as always I will see you in the next lecture.
