00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,460
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we are going to get on making our lower arm.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,260
And as you can see here it's repeated on one side and another.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:20,620
So we're going to revisit the mirror modifier and learn how to use it when we start moving objects around.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,060
Okay everybody Welcome to over to the default blend file.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,480
The reason why we're starting here is because we need to make ourselves some arms coming off of this

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,580
cube and then we'll see what effect it has when we move the cube around and then we'll go apply that

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,000
over on our lamp as well.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,490
Now I want to go to the 3d cursor and plonk it on the edge of the cube.

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,430
Once I've done that I'm just going to add in you probably guessed it another cube scale it's on the

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:52,240
x axis by a little and just move it manually out and I'm going to leave a little gap there and rotate

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:01,060
this around 45 degrees on the x axis and then I can go into edit mode and because this is rotated if

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:08,560
we go and extrude or move this edge along its local y axis There we go because it's been move around

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,150
we can make it have an arm going up and then we can just scale that down accordingly probably to maybe

14
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,690
there.

15
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,870
And then of course we can stretch it out again.

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,270
Okay.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:25,720
So there we go everything's almost sorted there let's go g x and move in a little closer.

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm happy with how that's looking.

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,130
So if we wanted another arm like this over the other side because the whole scene is built around the

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,770
origin we could quite easily go to the mirror modifier and just add it in.

21
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,450
So where is Mira modifier.

22
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,540
There it is.

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:47,470
Now at the moment we're going to need to reflect about an object because otherwise we're just reflecting

24
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,040
about the objects own origin.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,100
So we can put the origin in the center of the scene if we wanted to.

26
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,100
Let's say we had done that let's go g x and move that roughly to the center of the scene and then we

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,750
move the geometry out you can see how that would work.

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,850
But then if we go ahead parent these things together and we move it around you can see here that it

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:16,180
follows along if we move rotates or even scale it which is kind of the desired effect.

30
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,180
But what would be better at this point rather than just having its origin all the way over here meaning

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,180
that this object cannot be independent is if enough undo levels Yep.

32
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,350
There we go back to this stage is having it mirror around another object.

33
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,150
Now at the moment in time this object is in the center of the scene.

34
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,560
So we could go ahead and select the cube as that mirror object.

35
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,930
And once again when we move things around although it's not parenting together we do need to bear in

36
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,460
mind some sort of parenting or linking two together is required to move things around.

37
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,430
We get a similar result which is perfect that's exactly what we want.

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,030
The other thing that can be much better and not relying on other objects in the scene that make up the

39
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,600
match just in case you add it or move things around and you don't want these to follow is use some sort

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,120
of intermediate objects and an empty is great for this.

41
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,960
We've explored empties before.

42
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,790
There they are these null objects that you can put into your scene use them as control you can use them

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,420
as organization.

44
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,960
I've managed to put this one in a very odd location so let's put it back at the center of the scene

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,320
where we go and then when we're talking about the mirror modifier we can link back to the empty and

46
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,070
if I go ahead and grab the empty it's another way of controlling where the mirror point actually is

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,890
and if we rotate this you see that it's separate from everything else which can also be really really

48
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:57,320
useful both linking to the object that these are parts of or linking to an empty if perhaps the object

49
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:04,280
isn't centered over a particular place or linking it to an object which is really useful if the origin

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,750
might change position or you're working on it and you're moving things around and you want it to be

51
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:16,760
static and linked in a different way we can then parent the empty to the cube.

52
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,980
Now it seems like it's jumping through a couple of hoops but what it does mean is that now if I move

53
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,500
the cube everything else will follow suit.

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,250
However the arms themselves are one step decoupled from the cube.

55
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,980
So with this knowledge it's time for your challenge okay.

56
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,700
So I'd like you to create the rest of your stem at the base and then create your lower arm or arms using

57
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,780
the mirror modifier now and use another object to control the mirror points.

58
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,750
I would recommend an empty it's entirely up to you whether you use it and I'd recommend pairing thing

59
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,840
them together.

60
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,440
So at the moment if you move things around as we experienced in the last lecture they actually stay

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,550
together.

62
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,320
Pause video now and give us a go.

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,310
Okay everybody Welcome back.

64
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,270
Let's go ahead and hop on over into blender and start creating our lower arm okay.

65
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,990
So this is where we left off before.

66
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,930
Just let me spend a few moments tweaking the layout here to give me a bit more working space.

67
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,720
Okay so we're focusing on the stem at the moment.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,760
So let's select the stem.

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,530
Have a look at it.

70
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,270
Now I could start manipulating this geometry but I think what I'm going to do is I'm gonna create a

71
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,960
nother bits of mesh data in here that's separate from that STEM.

72
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,570
Just to keep it all together and progress quickly.

73
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,600
Now remember when you're doing this especially for the first time don't focus too much on the modeling

74
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,260
aspects.

75
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,130
We're really focused on this adding armchairs and doing some animation.

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,760
By all means if this is your second run through or you're a bit more competent then by all means make

77
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,230
a more polished model.

78
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,360
But in this case what I'm gonna do is I'm going to move my curse it's a selective sits at the top and

79
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,280
in a cube.

80
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,840
Oh that's not a cube that's a plane.

81
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,500
Add in a cube.

82
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,460
Scale that down and you'll notice that we've got a few weird things going on here.

83
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,890
And that's because the subdivisions surface modifier is turned on.

84
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm going to ignore that for the moment because I can see what I'm working with my zoom levels here

85
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,410
are a bit crazy.

86
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,050
I can't really focus properly on the modelling.

87
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,000
So with that selected I'm going to press the period or full stop on the number pad which is going to

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
allow me to focus and zoom without those very very large steps.

89
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,810
If you don't have a numb pad you can get that under view and frame selected.

90
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,270
There we go.

91
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,400
That's the shortcut for that.

92
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,530
Okay.

93
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,550
We're gonna need a couple of loop cuts in here.

94
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm only going to do them one way so I'm going to need two in there.

95
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,940
Looks good to me.

96
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,620
And then I can wrap these edges here.

97
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,650
I could do a couple of things I could go GZ and lift them up but that's not really going to do what

98
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,370
I want it to.

99
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,210
I think that sort of tuning fork look is pretty good.

100
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,930
Now I am just going to turn off the subdivision surface modifier for the moment.

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,550
It's not going to do me any good.

102
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,890
And we can come back in and remodel things later on.

103
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,650
Now I've got an option here of starting to need to add up maybe put some devils around the edges here

104
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,820
to make it look a bit neater.

105
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,610
But again we can come back to that later on now in order to place the first.

106
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,230
Amen.

107
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,510
I'm just gonna go round to one of the sides and I'm going to select one of those faces and I want it

108
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,500
to appear right bang in the middle of that.

109
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:38,440
So with that face selected oh I'm going to go control is to save my work and I'm gonna go shift s and

110
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,990
cursor to selected because now when I add in another it's a mesh data we'll be able to work from that

111
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,750
but I don't want to add it as part of this object.

112
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,810
Otherwise when we use the mirror modifier we're going to have an issue actually doing our work so we're

113
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,540
going to come out and make this as a separate objects.

114
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,870
Now I can add in a cube.

115
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:04,570
So very standard basic object scale it down to point 1 and then we can start tweaking and messing around

116
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,180
with things.

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,690
Now I'm struggling to see some of my scene when I was round from one side to the other.

118
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,920
So I'm just going to hide everything else that I don't need in my scene looks good.

119
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,520
And then we're whizzing round to here.

120
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,700
Okay.

121
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,940
Now this object itself I'm going to go into edit mode and start manipulating it.

122
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,410
I want it roughly there and I'm going to grab this face and just push it in.

123
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,230
Now at this point in time I could turn on snapping that would work really well in terms of where to

124
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,300
place it's going to turn on snapping and just pull it across.

125
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,070
I'm going to leave a little bit of a gap there is going to add to the look of the lamp and later on

126
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:50,380
I can even puts some sort of joining material between the two pivot points as well only come and grab

127
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,520
this and rotate it around by 45.

128
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,650
Again I'm doing a lot of this in edit mode at the moment and let's extend this out.

129
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,770
So let's go look about I rotated it by forty five.

130
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,240
I didn't specify any particular angle access to do that round.

131
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,300
So that's where it sits on the x axis by forty five.

132
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,130
That's better okay.

133
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,580
Brilliant.

134
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,540
Now it's rotated at 45 degrees with this top face selected.

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,590
I'm going to switch my transform orientation to normal.

136
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:29,430
Which means that when I look at this from the side and extrude my new piece it goes where I want it

137
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,610
to.

138
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,950
That's probably too far.

139
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,740
That's fresh DG so I can just move along the existing edge is probably about there.

140
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,760
Okay so that's the first part sorted I'm going to come out and I am going to use shall I use the stem

141
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,570
or an empty.

142
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,010
I'm going to use an empty.

143
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,580
I'm going to move the 3d cursor to the middle here.

144
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,740
So with the property side bar open I'm going to go to view.

145
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,510
And here we go.

146
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,830
So X to zero and then I can add in my empty there.

147
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,880
Am I still in edit mode.

148
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,530
No I'm not.

149
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:00,970
Okay.

150
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,670
Empty plane access and I'm going to call this lower.

151
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,250
Mira I'm talking about naming how I actually got things named that's lamp stem.

152
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,300
That one's not so let's call this lower arm looking good.

153
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,550
Now we've got a bit of parenting to do here.

154
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,130
I'm just gonna parent those things together and then in a bit we'll be parenting to bones for control

155
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:26,980
as well.

156
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,260
So that looks good there.

157
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,680
Let's go ahead select this arm go to our modifiers mirror modifier.

158
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,630
I'm going to use and I'm going to type in here Mira and the great thing is with the search box there

159
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,060
because I've named something we can just hop in and do it like that.

160
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,400
That's looking pretty good.

161
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,460
Yes I'm liking that lots.

162
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:54,600
Now one thing I can start to say straight away is perhaps this mechanism here is far too big perhaps

163
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,750
I can have one single stem here coming up in the middle and needs to be closer in who.

164
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,210
Now there's an idea I'm going to modify my design immediately to do that.

165
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,100
So let's grab this go in and I'm just gonna select these two tops.

166
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,410
Press X and delete the vertices.

167
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,720
Use this one here and extrude upwards looks good.

168
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,950
And then we've just got these faces around at the bottom which I can do a loop select for and press

169
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,220
F to fill.

170
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,570
Of course you can't really do that unless there is not a face there.

171
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,150
And that looks good.

172
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:36,850
And then finally we just need to grab this object here and move it in closer once again we can look

173
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:44,260
at their square g x and move it in and I'm just going to eyeball it at this point rather than faffing

174
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,090
around with anything else.

175
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,970
Now I can see an immediate problem here when it rotates it's going to bump in here but we can sort all

176
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,900
of those details out later okay.

177
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,950
That looks much much better.

178
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,080
Well this is one of the great things about reviewing your model as you're going making decisions.

179
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,330
Even though this is rough and ready we've come across a couple of problems having it how I thought I

180
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,370
was going to have it made it look really odd and super wide on the stem looks much better now.

181
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,830
And we've come into the problem that as this rotates and because the origin is there this is the other

182
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,180
reason why put the origin there.

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,980
We can fake it rotating it's actually impacting slightly here.

184
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,870
Now there are ways of getting rid of the easiest way once we're in edit mode to select that edge that

185
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,710
edge that edge and that edge I could use selected the two faces at this point and just go GZ and pull

186
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,660
that down ever so slightly and that's given us the clearance we need.

187
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,180
Awesome.

188
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,190
Let's save our work.

189
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,020
We don't want to lose anything that's very important.

190
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,510
I haven't had a look at this in rendered mode looks pretty good so far.

191
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,590
Excellent.

192
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,930
I want to switch it to look death mode and look far prettier and turn off my overlays.

193
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,910
Yes that's coming along really well.

194
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,600
Brilliant.

195
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,890
How are you guys getting on.

196
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,900
I'm super excited that this is now coming together really really well.

197
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,710
Please share your working designs over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
