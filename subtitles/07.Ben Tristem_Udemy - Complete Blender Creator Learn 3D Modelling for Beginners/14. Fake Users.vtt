00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.210
Welcome to fake users in this video.

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.880
You'll learn how to give your hair or fur colour.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.030
Understand about fake users and how to use them.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.700
And finally realize what the zero before anything in blender whether it's a brush whether it's immaterial

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.300
etc etc. or a particle system what that means.

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.550
So let's hop straight on over into a blender.

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.010
Okay so at the moment as you've seen when we render are lovely rabbits we dont get anything.

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.670
We just get this grey based material.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.250
So on the particle system itself we're not seeing anything that's because we've got the eyes selected

10
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.620
we can see that in the outline.

11
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.520
So if I select the rabbit itself we'll get our settings back.

12
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.630
I'm going to drag this up so I can see what's going on further down.

13
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.540
Now here we have default material which is what it's set to at the moment.

14
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.180
But there are no other materials assigned to our rabbit.

15
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.700
So in order to make sure that we have hair on our rabbit we need to.

16
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.090
Whilst the rabbit object is selected give it a material in here so we could go here and as we can see

17
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.840
now we've created a material and we call this mat one.

18
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.960
And we can create as many materials against an object as we like solve.

19
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.650
Just click the plus there to duplicate that and do Mat too.

20
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.340
And we should see this dropdown we've got zero Matt 1 and 0 and just match to now the Zero means it's

21
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.210
not assigned to anything.

22
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:43.210
And if we decide at any point to save the file and shut it down whilst it's not assigned to anything

23
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.080
it means that it will actually just vanish completely So if you spent ages setting up a material then

24
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.500
you want to make sure that it's either assigned to something or assigned a fake user.

25
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.890
Now we looked at this a few lectures back in the material brush.

26
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.300
In the sculpting brushes we all had F's next to one another.

27
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.950
So for the moment if we want to have two materials there and make sure that we keep material one we

28
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.110
need to give it's a fake user how we've always done that is we've switched it across.

29
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.610
But if you hit the F key we see that there are now two users.

30
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.420
That's what this number 2 does.

31
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.740
It means there are two users that use material one which is confusing but not.

32
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.710
We've got the fake user and we've got the rabbit itself because it's assigned and if we go across here

33
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.080
and switch over to material to when we have a look at the materials again we can see material to is

34
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.690
actually assigned to this rabbit itself and the F material one is just assigned to a fake user so we

35
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.190
don't lose it.

36
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.670
Now the important thing is if you close blender sorry it only happens when you close blender so you

37
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.740
saved your file and close it down when you open up anything with a zero next to it will disappear.

38
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.320
Right so we've got two materials there and have we got two materials here.

39
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.790
No.

40
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.880
So there are not two materials on our rabbitte yet there are just two materials sat in the background.

41
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.980
So if I press plus and we can go to this dropdown and I know it's the other one material.

42
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.170
So we've got two materials in our on our object.

43
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.300
So now it's there when we hop over to our ball.

44
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.610
Let's just give them different colours that's give it green so we know what's going on and give it blue.

45
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.560
Okay so we've got a green material and the blue material.

46
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.240
Now when we go to our particle system and come up we can now see material one material two sitting there

47
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.490
and these particle systems are associated with that mesh as well.

48
00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:00.750
So that's why these two materials have appeared on the material slots because both the material and

49
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.490
the particle system are both assigned to the rabbit.

50
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.120
So if we selected one of them and just switched over to rended mode we would see that we have a green

51
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.730
bunny.

52
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.160
Excellent.

53
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.910
So that's how we go about making sure that we have materials science so we've got two different materials

54
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.620
and of course you can have as many materials as you like and build them up in layers and we'll deal

55
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.820
with that later on with the node system.

56
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.410
But for now you can have as many materials as you like assigned against a particular object and then

57
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.620
actually use them.

58
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.200
And as you can see here we've still got f against our material one.

59
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.240
So it is there and it's stored.

60
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.300
Now if I click the cross here and get rid of it and go ahead and click on material once again you can

61
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.330
see it automatically reassigned and remembers.

62
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.490
Now if I hit the number two.

63
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.130
It duplicates that material.

64
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.750
Very very useful very powerful.

65
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.270
And of course when we're on material once again if I just hit F again it's unassigned.

66
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.100
That fake user that it had before.

67
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.450
Oh click here we see that we've got material one the duplicate of material one and material to and then

68
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.650
duplicate the material one actually has a zira against it.

69
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.280
So if I was to shut down blender and reopen it that material would not exist anymore or just disappear

70
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.190
as if it was never created.

71
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.740
And that is of course the primary reason why you would use a fake user if you did not want that material

72
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.110
to just evaporate into thin air.

73
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.560
The next time you opened up your blender file.

74
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.330
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

75
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:47.960
I'd like you to give the bunny coloured hair so give your bunny a skin colour and a hair colour.

76
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.780
You will need two different materials to do this and if you've been following along you'll actually

77
00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:01.510
have the base ones to work with then sets the skin material as a diffuse the f type material and set

78
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.810
the hair material.

79
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.930
So there is actually a shade a specifically for hair in cycles hair b s the f.

80
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.030
So go ahead pause a video now and give that a go.

81
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.970
Okay guys.

82
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.800
Welcome back.

83
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.390
Let's hop back over into blender.

84
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.580
Okay so with our funky bunny here we're almost halfway there but I'm just going to run through it as

85
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.620
if we hadn't done that so we'd have our basic bunny here I'm just going to switch over the solids so

86
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.520
it's not so slow loading up.

87
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.520
So first of all we know we want to give this a bunny itself some materials.

88
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.140
So making sure that the object is selected we go to the materials tab in the properties window and we're

89
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.110
going to need two materials some skin to hit the plus twice.

90
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.000
We don't have any materials here so let's go ahead and create a new material.

91
00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:02.140
And I'm going to call this material skin and that's going to represent the actual rabbit's skin.

92
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.400
Now we're not going to see this at first but if we ever parted the hair or perhaps some wind was blowing

93
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.320
I'd want to make sure it was a reasonable colour that I didn't actually know what colour rabbitskin

94
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.810
is.

95
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.760
So I'm going to go for a light pinky colour.

96
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:25.880
Now a good way of working out actually whether your hair is thick enough is actually to have completely

97
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:32.380
really wild colours so if I set this pink all the way down to this bright magenta.

98
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.610
If the hair wasn't thick enough I'll be able to see the magenta through it.

99
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.730
And I have no idea how to make it slightly thicker but I think the hair is going to be thick enough

100
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.590
in this case I'll just make it a lighter pink.

101
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.150
And it is diffuse be STF.

102
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.690
Now we can go in later and use the node editor to make this much more rich in terms of its materials.

103
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.570
But since it's not going to be seen I'm happy would leaving it like that.

104
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:06.290
So let's go ahead and this other material creates a new material and I'm going to call it fur for the

105
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.920
moment.

106
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.020
In fact I'm going to give it a name.

107
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.480
Brown fur.

108
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.940
Okay brilliant.

109
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.060
So now we have brown fur here.

110
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.370
I'm going to as you probably guess create some brown fur.

111
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.490
So Brown obviously is not on this colour well so the next question is where do I get the brown from

112
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.320
there.

113
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.740
Well there's a couple of ways you can do it.

114
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.780
I'm just going to do it by.

115
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.060
I am.

116
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.560
Hens themselves are actually quite light.

117
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.200
If you ever look at a hair under a microscope it's almost see through.

118
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.070
It's just the density of hairs that cause it to have a colour.

119
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:48.030
Now you will have to bear this in mind if you are creating hairs on a model because they're going to

120
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.760
the cycles engine is a physics space renderer when it comes to rendering.

121
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.270
If you have very dark fur it's going to look even darker than you intended it to.

122
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.220
So I'm going to set it as this orange colour for the moment and we're change this time to hair be STF

123
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.450
and I'm going to actually before I do anything further.

124
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.900
Going to move the camera around because I realize it's actually on the wrong side of our bunny So I'm

125
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.260
going to rotate that Z.

126
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.900
Oh that's rotating around there.

127
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:24.630
If we set the pivot points as the rabbits down here that's the pivot point has a 3-d cursor.

128
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.060
Now rotates long.

129
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.400
That said axis and look at it from this angle it should still be pointing at our bunny.

130
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.590
Let's just check.

131
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.280
Yes it is.

132
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:41.640
I'm going to move the camera about slightly and just zoom out ever so slightly there.

133
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.600
Okay.

134
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.130
So we've got that there.

135
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.140
Let's go in here.

136
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.380
Render and see how our bunnies looking at the moment.

137
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.110
I haven't signed any fluff so I should imagine it's not looking too great.

138
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.540
So we've got brown fur here and skin.

139
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.280
Great.

140
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.180
So let's go to the particle system down here.

141
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.710
And I was actually assigned it brown fur.

142
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.700
That was a bit of luck more than anything else.

143
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.420
And we've got something that's starting to look quite nice.

144
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.230
Okay brilliant.

145
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.400
Now you see what I was saying earlier I can see that the skin colours come through on the years as well.

146
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.880
So you can see I was saying earlier the hair is actually quite a light colour.

147
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:26.330
However when it goes when there's a whole load of it like there is here and this rabbit unfortunately

148
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:32.640
looks a bit like a brittle brush them home rather than a real rabbit.

149
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:38.780
We'll get to making that a bit better soon but you can see even though the colour is this really light

150
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.500
colour it comes out quite dark on a big bunch of it in fact if we go ahead and adjust this and make

151
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.650
it even lighter.

152
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.350
Bring it back down here so.

153
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.590
Or an orange.

154
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.000
Really really like that's almost like a light peach.

155
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.270
I'm going to get into colour questions here and render that out again.

156
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.830
We may end up with not quite as long as we thought it was here.

157
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.850
So I'm just interested actually to see how this comes out.

158
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:12.800
Wow.

159
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.390
Okay.

160
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.650
That's that's really interesting how that's come out how it's still dark brown in the middle and this

161
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:25.130
lighter colour round edge so you can see there that cycle's is actually doing a very very good job at

162
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:31.490
realizing well if you've got lots and lots of hair not very much light reaches in there or it gets absorbed

163
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:37.040
so you end up with a darker colour even though you started with this quite light colour.

164
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:37.900
Okay.

165
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.590
Some other things that I can see just looking at here.

166
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.400
We've got these we had highlights here.

167
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.770
I'm going to see whether those disappear later on when we start going over this model in a bit more

168
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:49.390
detail.

169
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.540
But otherwise that's looking quite good at the moment.

170
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:58.700
And if we have a quick look over here just finally in the properties window here down here we've got

171
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.490
our brown fur and skin assigned but these are original materials that were made earlier are still here

172
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.630
ready to use.

173
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.020
But the moment I go and save my file and reopen it.

174
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.410
So let's do that now just to re highlight that point and save my file and then um just go into open

175
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.290
recent and open our fluffy bunny says opened it up again.

176
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.760
And if we go back to the materials they are gone.

177
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.970
So please share your bunny in the discussions are love to see your combination of colours.

178
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:34.000
Have you gone wacky if you gone for a completely different style of bunny please share those in the

179
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.330
discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
