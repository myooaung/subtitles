1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,440
Welcome to making texture's look more three day in this video you play with the texture planes to alter

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,690
their appearance.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,300
I understand that the more complexity you add here the less you may need later on.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,950
So we're going to take a simple blade of grass.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,080
Just our texture that we've played with before and we're going to make it into something much more vibrant

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,390
a 3D object as we spin round here.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,490
We can see that it is truly 3-d.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,160
So let's go create something like this and hop on over into a blender.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,870
Okay so hidden in our hills at the moment we've got some blades of grass.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,890
The first thing I'm going to do is just well I'm going to rename these so this grass seed here well

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,040
there are one fifth layer so let's hop over to there now getting rid of everything else or actor press

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,480
than number five on the keypad itself.

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,130
On the keyboard itself an ominous zoom around here and I'm going to change the viewport shading down

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,280
here to the material modes I can see what's going on.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,350
Okay so it looks like this one here is the tool blade of grass.

16
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,980
So I'm going to call this grass.

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,620
Tall.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,960
And then see.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,490
Just so I know what's going on.

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,180
This is grass medium.

21
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,890
And I'm going to call it grass medium one because we've got another one here which Scott on a raid modifier

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,850
applied to it.

23
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,550
I'm going to remove that array we're not going to use that.

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,790
That was just to demonstrate the light path's themselves.

25
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,260
And I'm going to call this grass medium too.

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,060
And then the final one is this little one down here which must be this one the grasp of background.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,740
I'm going to rename that one grass short.

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,070
Excellent.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,860
So we've got these four here.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,660
I'm actually going to hide them now.

31
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,220
I'm going to take a duplicate of my grass short by using shift Andy.

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,880
Of being there.

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,380
That's absolutely fine.

34
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,390
And I'm going to name this grass short example because that's what we're going to use in a few moments.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:29,490
Now I'm going to do a bit tidying here and I'm going to select these grass grasses and put them.

36
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,330
On the ground plain themselves.

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,190
Just move them there manually.

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,640
Probably be quicker.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,210
Okay so underneath the ground plane I have four types of grass.

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,210
We've currently got if you've got more or less that's absolutely fine.

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,140
Okay.

42
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,250
Let's go ahead and move this should short example that we're going to be working on to a new layer a

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,150
press m.

44
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,220
And I'm going to move it to layer 6 I suppose.

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,960
There we go.

46
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,260
Now we've got it on there six.

47
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,020
We can just view it by itself.

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,850
So we have our blade of grass and we want to make it look a little bit more 3D.

49
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,770
So I'll just pan across to it now.

50
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,300
Right now we have this in front of us.

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:23,920
What we can do is start manipulating it and some very simple ways you can do this is to duplicate again.

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,270
Now you got to watch out on the outline of us and get too crazy.

53
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,020
But we can group it together all at the end.

54
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,020
So we're going to duplicate that which we've done.

55
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:42,110
I'm going to rotate it immediately on the z axis by let's say one at 80.

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,770
Disappeared somewhere.

57
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,770
Where's it gone.

58
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:53,280
So it's just zoom out and see if we can see what's going on okay the pivot point is the 3-d cursor down

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,680
here.

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,550
So I'll be spinning around the 3D cursor so we dont want that we will change the 3-d as the pivot point

61
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:06,090
from the 3D cursor to the medium points which will put it right on the origin of our object which is

62
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,450
great.

63
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,680
Thats what we want.

64
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:17,480
So Im going to wrote Oh sorry jubilate first and then rotate on the z axis by 180.

65
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:19,790
Yeah.

66
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,440
We get Okay.

67
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,390
And now I'm going to move that out ever sisler.

68
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,410
It looks like I'm going to have to do a bit of rotating otherwise that's going to look like a funny

69
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,280
grass plants.

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm just going to rotate that round.

71
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,670
I am viewing it first from the front.

72
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,790
You may have to do a side depending on where you place them or even the top if you still got them laying

73
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,800
flat on the ground.

74
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,080
Although they should have completed one of the last videos challenges to make sure that they're all

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,870
the right way up.

76
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,740
All looks we've got another blade of grass here that's okay we'll scale that one down by pressing the

77
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,050
right key and do excuse me I can't always see the keyboard and rotate that one around a little further.

78
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:10,320
Okay so now we've got a grass plant that's still to day but it's getting there so let's select all three

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:20,190
of those and duplicate them in a scale them up ever so slightly and rotate them around on the z axis

80
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,310
by Nancy.

81
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,440
Okay that sunscreens and looked pretty good.

82
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,630
And I'm going to scale them.

83
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,380
Oh my.

84
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:36,180
Will want to take a duplicate first and then scale that in ever so slightly and rotate it on the z axis

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:43,980
by maybe 60 this time so it's not always 90 and there we go we can slowly build up a grass plant that

86
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,920
looks pretty awesome.

87
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,190
So the final thing that we're going to need to do here will be to group all this slots together some

88
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,070
coming use border select by the b key select everything and I'm going to join them all together with

89
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,460
control and J.

90
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:06,180
And um I feel like just duplicating it once more was shifting day and rotating it on the z axis again

91
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,260
by another one the pick a random number one hundred thirty five.

92
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,380
Just to make it a little bit more dense and I'm going to.

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,070
Scale that in ever so slightly to select them both and join them.

94
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,480
And then I'm going to do one final thing.

95
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,460
I'm going to duplicate it once more.

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,900
Rotate it on the z axis.

97
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,110
But this time it's going to move around and randomly pick a point.

98
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,710
That feels right to me.

99
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,790
Okay so it's much more dense now.

100
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,520
And when we go to I'm not going to render the image there I'm literally just going to be rendered just

101
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,860
here that looks like a much fuller grass.

102
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:57,570
So let's go ahead and hop back into material mode selects the two grasses that we have joined together

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,840
into one and I'm going to call this grass paw grass short.

104
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,230
Plants.

105
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,480
Excellent.

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,670
I'm going to group that under the ground playing.

107
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,390
And there's one final thing that I'd like to show you here.

108
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,210
Perhaps I should have shown you before making a whole plant up.

109
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:24,200
So what I will do is I will work on a another layer quickly and I'm going to add a nother images plane

110
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,310
and I'm going to grab my grass blade PRNG again or let's just undo that let's put the 3-d cursor in

111
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,760
the middle and try adding that again but this time remembering to select the fuse and transparent and

112
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,480
to use the alph for Channel.

113
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,190
So with the grass blade selected here it should come in.

114
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm going to look at it from the top so you guys can see what's going on.

115
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,150
Not to bother reposition the origin but what we can do here is for instance add loop cuts in.

116
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,060
So in edit mode we could add a couple of loop cuts in or we can even subdivide.

117
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,460
So I'm going to subdivide it a couple of times and you see that's probably over the top but you will

118
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,240
see that this allows us to alter the shape of our model.

119
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,790
And I can't see why that.

120
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,680
Oh yeah the proportional addicting size is up.

121
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,300
So this enables us to twist and shape and remodel.

122
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,510
Ah ah.

123
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,190
Blade of grass to our heart's content obviously you can do some very weird things.

124
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:35,430
And the reason why we add this extra geometry is if we've just got these four vertices on the end it

125
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,870
becomes quite difficult if we go and grab a vertex and move it.

126
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,670
You can see it has a harsh change just around here.

127
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,770
And that's not so great when trying to make something look a bit better so you can move this around

128
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,330
in the more geometry your ADD so we go and subdivide select everything.

129
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,130
Subdivide it gives us more control.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,470
Over this particular model so as well as rotating that well like we did to make it flat we could actually

131
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:15,570
pull this virtex out a little and make it a little bit taller although sometimes it can squish parts

132
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,060
of the model you didn't want to squish.

133
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,140
There's lots of to play with for her.

134
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,370
And in fact what you can do is make this a bit more three dimensional in itself so you can have the

135
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:35,040
grass actually curving round in 3-d space even though it's just the flat texture and unlike normal geometry

136
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,900
when you're filling it in.

137
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,740
It's obviously got a couple of sharp angles here as it moves.

138
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:48,570
Now those angles are determined by the geometry itself not so of just for example or not anything to

139
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,950
do with the shading.

140
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,960
You've got set so if you wanted to be a smooth transition if you're making a texture more 3D you're

141
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,670
going to have to add more subdivision's or something along those lines.

142
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:08,110
And once you have more subdivisions you can start moving things with a little more fun ness.

143
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,320
So it's not so wonky.

144
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:11,970
There we go.

145
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:19,220
So that should now curve round a little bit better than how it was before school got a few sharp angles.

146
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,840
But in general that is much much better.

147
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,320
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

148
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,550
I'd like you to make more grass plants.

149
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,110
So make one or two more grass plants.

150
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,700
This will help with making our grass look better.

151
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,300
Now remember to preserve the original blades when making those plants pulls a video now and give that

152
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,890
a go.

153
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,660
Okay guys.

154
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,480
Welcome back.

155
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,740
Let's hop back over into blender.

156
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,000
So I'm going to use the blade of grass.

157
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:58,320
I've been working on here to demonstrate how you can work around your model itself.

158
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,300
I'm going to set the origin point first of all so let's come out of here and hopefully that sat on the

159
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,690
mesh.

160
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,770
Yes it has.

161
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,150
And I'm going to go up here and set the origin to this 3-d cursor that gives me lots of options including

162
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,930
planting it firmly on the ground.

163
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:25,590
And I'm just going to rotate this round on the x axis by 90 I think minus 90.

164
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,450
There we go.

165
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,500
So we've now got that coming out of the ground.

166
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:36,060
I'm going to hop into object mode and I think I'm going to duplicate it all.

167
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's set the zero first.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,890
Before I do any of that I think I've got a duplicate there as well.

169
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,460
Yeah.

170
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,890
It just helps when things are all sprouting from the same place especially with grass because if you

171
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:53,330
have a look at a grass plant it does tend to all sprout from a similar location and can adjudicate those

172
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,150
pretty and round locks them to the z axis.

173
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,200
Come round here perhaps.

174
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,570
Okay so that's starting to look pretty good.

175
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,280
I'm going to do some scaling here.

176
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,290
So it looks a wee bit different.

177
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,080
I'm actually going to bring in another texture on here.

178
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:18,800
So we've got our grass tool I'm going to Jew placates Our can't do it whilst the layers not active.

179
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,390
So let's go and find our grass was our grass tool Oh my upsidedown.

180
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,380
I think I just might have built the last thing upside down.

181
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,560
Did anybody spot that.

182
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,580
I certainly didn't.

183
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,790
I was too engrossed in making some grass.

184
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,870
Me Wait.

185
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,900
Let's duplicate.

186
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,380
That's embarrassment out of the way and move it to the appropriate level.

187
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,740
I think I'm working on they are 6.

188
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,000
Or am I on there 7.

189
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:51,890
I think I am on layer 7 at the moment so let's move it again to layer 7.

190
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay it does look like I produced some stuff upside down so I can select all of these grass blades here.

191
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,440
And just dropped this one out for the moments of these one.

192
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,200
This one this one and this one.

193
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,740
And explain why the rotation was a bit funky.

194
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,200
And there we go.

195
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,520
It's amazing what happens when you're not paying full attention.

196
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:22,600
So I'm going to bring that up and sighted at zero zero and zero sort of one here is to produce a plant

197
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,070
that's basically a seeded plant.

198
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,610
Let's see how that's looking at the moments.

199
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,000
Looking pretty good.

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,090
Now it says she got some grass down the bottom.

201
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,860
I'm pretty happy with that.

202
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,030
So I'm going to group them all together song and select them all.

203
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,020
And let's just come out in back into material mode.

204
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,190
This orange border by the way can get quite irritating.

205
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:55,390
You can turn it off in the propertys if we scroll down and go to display there's an outline selective

206
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,630
that you can toggle on and off and when you start having a geometry as you can see here turning that

207
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,840
on and off can help massively and we'll probably use that again later on when we've got lots and lots

208
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,350
of blades of grass going on.

209
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,950
So I quite like what's gone on there.

210
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm just wondering if you look at it from this way it's not so great.

211
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,730
So let's produce two of these tools seeds before grouping it all together.

212
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,170
Or.

213
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,850
Yeah.

214
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:34,100
That's that's worked from there so that's duplicate that and rotate it on the z axis by 90 degrees.

215
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,020
Not the z axis I'm British.

216
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,040
There we go.

217
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,260
So we've got that coming out there.

218
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,230
Might as well have a third one I think so.

219
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,090
Jupe Cates rotate Z.

220
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,510
Let's have it fair solent.

221
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,510
So that looks like a pretty good grasp.

222
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,890
I'm going to make these one of these look ever so slightly different so again I'm going to turn on the

223
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,790
outline selected.

224
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,190
This is when you do want it on of course when you're trying to see things.

225
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,370
And let make this one a little taller.

226
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,130
This one a little shorter.

227
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,610
There we go.

228
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:18,420
Now they don't look so much like copies of one another and then go into edit mode here and try at she

229
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,030
to straighten that up a little more.

230
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,940
So just look straight and tall.

231
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,700
And I don't mind of the other.

232
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,150
Are a little bit curvy.

233
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,500
Let's grab this one here is where I am of course this is one of these things again.

234
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,800
Does it matter if you do so much with it.

235
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,770
Well with most things in blender and in life I suppose the more you put into it the more you're going

236
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,790
to get out.

237
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,750
Obviously we've got diminishing returns at some point.

238
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,040
I'm going to stop there.

239
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,490
I'm going to group all of these together.

240
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:57,580
And that I think is all of them are selected them in the outline and thereby holding down a shift.

241
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,960
And I'm going to join them all together with control and J.

242
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,620
And what's it called at the moment grass blade 0 1 dot.

243
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,730
That's no good.

244
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,030
So it's a grass tone caps off.

245
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,990
It's a grass it's a seeded grass.

246
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,140
And it's a plants so grass seed plant planet not quite plant.

247
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,980
Excellent.

248
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,280
How did you guys get on.

249
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,910
Id love to see what grass plants you managed to create.

250
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,340
Please share them in discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
