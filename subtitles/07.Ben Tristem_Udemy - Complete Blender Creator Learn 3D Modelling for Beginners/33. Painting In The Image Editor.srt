00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,020
Welcome to a painting in the image ed in this video.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,690
You will create your own image using blender become more familiar with the image editor.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:17,060
We're about to use it quite a bit in the upcoming lectures will realize Blender's limitations when it

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:24,240
comes to image editing and I understand that you may have to use external packages for better control.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:33,440
This isn't as powerful as Photoshop nor gimp or any of those other type of packages but it does still

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,170
have some great versatility.

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,670
So let's go explore this now and start painting over in blender.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,770
Okay so before we go and hop into the image editor and start work out want to show you this set up but

9
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,890
I've got at the moment now I don't have a whack stylus or a cinti or anything fancy like that.

10
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,640
I do however have an iPad and a Mac which means I can use a program called ashtray pad to use the iPad

11
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,800
as a second screen.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,130
Now when I do that I can literally start doing things on the screen itself and it's just mirroring the

13
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:10,720
other screen.

14
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,910
And this is going to become quite useful for me when I'm sketching now.

15
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,740
By all means you do not need a stylus in order to do any form of graphical art on a computer but it

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,260
does make it a lot lot easier.

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:31,670
A bit like having a three button dormouse have make Splender and the 3D viewport so much easier to use

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,820
than trying to use a trackpad or a lot of other control interfaces.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,040
My stylus by the way is not pressure sensitive or anything along those lines so I'm not going to be

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,810
able to do some of the fancy tricks where if you press harder the lying gets wide or something like

21
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,250
that.

22
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,410
So let's now hop into the image editor and start doing some painting.

23
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,690
Okay so I've just changed my 3D editor to a movie image editor and this is what it looks like.

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,410
Pretty boring so far and not much to do.

25
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,880
So let's go ahead straightaway and add a new image.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,750
Now you can do that in the image menu using the shortcut keys.

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:15,620
Oulton n or of course hitting the big new button there and it gives us a couple of options so I'm going

28
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,180
to give my image that I am about to create a name and I'm going to call it test image.

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,250
Underneath we have width height colour Alpher blank and 32 bit floats.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,730
Well the width and height.

31
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,970
I'm going to leave those as the phone I suggest you do too.

32
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,220
At the moment.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,740
Later on we'll go in to texture resolutions and what size to pick on where to pick them etc. and what

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,810
size to pick them as well.

35
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,280
The colour will just be the cut the base colour that appears in this case it's going to be black I can

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,880
say that anything I want and not really important at this point in time either the generated type but

37
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,900
it gives us 3 different types who got blank which is just that solid colour you v grid and colour grid

38
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,540
and we just want it left on blank and click.

39
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:12,570
Okay now you will see that image now has a star against it which means that it's not saved.

40
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,690
But before we go ahead and save this image I just want to have a look at the properties of the image

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,120
editor.

42
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,960
Someone hit the N key to bring up the properties tab.

43
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,770
Now this gives us an option up here to rename our image.

44
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,300
Change the type of image is et cetera et cetera it allows us to change what aspect ratio we've picked

45
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,350
so we can go ahead and change the x and y coordinates.

46
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,400
Now do bear in mind if you do an alter any of.

47
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,730
Do bear in mind if you go and edit any of those after you've started doing some paint with the image.

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,080
It will wipe the image because you're essentially overwriting your default settings for the image and

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,270
therefore everything will go that you've done and there's no one do that.

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,470
Here we have the unique grid and colour grid that we could have selected before and the colour down

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,030
here.

52
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:10,320
We can go ahead and pick any colour we choose on the colour well that's all we going to do in the properties

53
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,200
for the moment some of them are closed down.

54
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm going to go and open up the tool shelf because we're going to be using that lots in a few moments

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,260
now at the moment we cannot actually do any thing painting wise because we're not in the paint mode

56
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,170
so we need to switch the image editor to paint mode and I'm going to do that where it says view.

57
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm going to change that.

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,920
Not this view over here.

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,200
Keep going all the way over here for the mode selection so much like you've got edit mode sculped mode

60
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,170
and object mode in the 3D editor.

61
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,200
There are three modes here.

62
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,370
We've got view paint a mask we want to switch it to paint.

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,310
Okay now we've done that.

64
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,710
We still haven't saved our image so let's go ahead and do that.

65
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:59,470
Now the first time you save the image you're not going to be able to quick save it as you can and once

66
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:07,600
it has safe because at the moment it doesn't really exist anywhere except in a blender which is dangerous

67
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,380
because it blender crashes your work that you've been doing will go.

68
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,340
So make sure we off that to a place on our hard disk straight away so I'm going to save azimi And I'm

69
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,360
going to use test image and click save.

70
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:28,060
Now that this star has gone it's been saved if I make any other changes to this file so I'm going to

71
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,850
literally click and draw something on here.

72
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,850
We see that it's got the star there and I can now use the shortcut key Oulton S and that will save the

73
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,190
file and once the asterisk is gone it means that it is safely stored on the hard drive.

74
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,440
That change I've made.

75
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,410
I can now pick up the file and use it in any other program including blender.

76
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,000
So let's go through the tool shelf now and we're going to focus only on this paint section.

77
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,610
There are a couple of other sections and we'll get to those later on.

78
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,620
But just this top paint section for the moment.

79
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,680
Firstly.

80
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,910
The top one is the brush type and when you click on that you'll see six brushes and wonder why are we

81
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,670
trying to do anything with only six brushes.

82
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:18,960
Well they're quite versatile brushes and they can be edited and changed quite significantly.

83
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,300
So much like most things in blender.

84
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:28,310
We've currently got text draw and if we click the two next to it that will create a unique rush.

85
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,570
And now I can call that my brush.

86
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,880
Now the problem with the name mind brushes it means nothing.

87
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,840
So of course you would want to name your brushes appropriately based upon what they do at this point.

88
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,980
It's a demonstration brush so my brush is absolutely fine.

89
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,890
Underneath we have a colour wheel and we can go and move this little white dot around and basically

90
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,150
pick any colour that we want.

91
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,530
There's a little slider to the right of it which enables us to make the colour lighter or darker.

92
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,610
Now you will notice that the left hand little panel underneath the colour wheel is the only one that's

93
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,540
changing.

94
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,260
So these are your two colours that you could pick from very quickly.

95
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,720
So we got our brush colour there and our secondary colour.

96
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,540
That's what blender calls them.

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,270
Now you can switch between them very quickly using these double headed arrow buttons just here.

98
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,070
In fact it says when we hover over the foreground and background brush covers that's what you will see

99
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,200
in a lot of image editing packages as well.

100
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,940
Now we've played with radiosonde strength before when we were weight painting the particle system over

101
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:42,180
in the bunny and that basically is the same here so we've got radius and strength and we can control

102
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,840
those with EF 4 the radius can shift an F for the strength with it being stronger when you move towards

103
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,180
the centre.

104
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay so underneath we've got a blend and there are lots of different options and are not going to go

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,550
through them at the moment they basically change when you lay things on top of one and other colours

106
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:10,470
how they mixed together and accumulate is something that is very important under certain circumstances.

107
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,320
If I set the strength down to let's set it to point two.

108
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:21,450
If I said it's a point to start drawing because accumulate is off until I decide to click again or start

109
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,360
drawing over the same.

110
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,970
Part of the image but starting a new stroke.

111
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,480
Only then does it apply.

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,560
The next level of.

113
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,290
Colour if accumulate is turned on.

114
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,890
It doesn't matter if I stay over the same place it goes.

115
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:48,210
White Very quickly because whites the colour I've got we're not gonna use use gradient at the moment

116
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,330
does it change lots of the different options that you have here is very powerful but were not going

117
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,940
to use it at this early stage.

118
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:03,940
Now this is possibly the most powerful feature of all and actual palates because at the moment you've

119
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,760
got no way of storing your colours after you've selected them.

120
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,870
Sure you can click on the let's say the foreground colour here and go to the little pet and go and pick

121
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,140
up.

122
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,360
Let's say this lighter mauve at the top pair or purple or pinky colour whatever it is and that's great.

123
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,700
We've picked that up again and we start painting with it.

124
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,380
But that wasn't the original colour that cause that whatever the original colour was was a lot stronger

125
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,340
than that and we were just painting with it at 20 percent.

126
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,800
So we would want to store that colour.

127
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,790
And how do we do that.

128
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:46,540
Well with a palette so I can go ahead here and under the new option go ahead and click that and we get

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,860
a plus and minus symbol appear next to the colour wheel.

130
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:57,160
If we go ahead and click the plus it adds the currently selected colour to a palette.

131
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
If we hit the minus it removes it.

132
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,380
If it was the one that was selected.

133
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:09,790
Now if I go ahead and name this palette warm and let's say go in add some warm colours so yellow is

134
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,150
just going to be orange and red and things like that.

135
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:24,710
So I've now got four colours there that I can use and go back to at any point and continue using.

136
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,510
And the great thing about building up a palette like this that has a style to it like whether it's warm

137
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:39,840
or cold or nature or water or whatever you've decided to build up it means that you can then access

138
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,760
that colour palette from another blend file.

139
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,490
So this is a way to block some of these brushes.

140
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,510
So if you linked this data block in a new blend file.

141
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,410
When we went to this drop down here we would see that there would be zero L. warm at the moment in this

142
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,200
particular blend far as say f warm if you appended it it would just probably say zero warm.

143
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,620
Of course if you don't do anything with it at that point you will end up with it being lost when you

144
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,990
saved your file of course and you can do the same.

145
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,930
Here we see that all of these got f next to them because if they didn't the moment we so saved blender

146
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,480
and shut it down and reopened it.

147
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,890
All of them would disappear.

148
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,190
So there are more options underneath here as well but they're more advanced than we're not going to

149
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,280
touch them at this moment in time.

150
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,450
But I do have a bit of a painting challenge for you guys.

151
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,300
I would like you to create a quick image.

152
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,640
Remember to have some fun paint a couple of simple pictures.

153
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,710
I'm not asking you to be artists at this point.

154
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm asking for some simple pictures.

155
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:58,210
Like very very early on in this course you remember when I was asking you to draw things like simple

156
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,930
cups and simple planes in there a picture of a boat and they're not real in terms of how they're asking

157
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,900
you to be a super artist at this point.

158
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,170
And it also does not have to be related to the current project.

159
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,710
It's more important at this point this is to make sure you're familiar with how the image editor works

160
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,620
when we are going about painting.

161
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,090
So have some fun scansion things simple things.

162
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:29,570
As I said depending on your skill level and make sure you're having fun as you do it.

163
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,470
Balls a video now and give that a go.

164
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,810
Okay guys welcome back.

165
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,010
Let's go create a quick image over in blender.

166
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,230
Okay so in front of us I've got something that's not that great at the moment.

167
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,710
Let's see what we can do with it.

168
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,160
So I'm going to zoom in just a little bit more so I can work on my image.

169
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,830
I am going to probably clear this down.

170
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,430
And one of the quick ways that I can do that is clicking any of these colours and dragging it over the

171
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,640
top it will actually replace everything if I do that.

172
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,040
So let's click here and drag and drop.

173
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,500
There we go.

174
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,260
What are white canvas to start with.

175
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,380
So I am going to do something really dull probably.

176
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,540
But here we go.

177
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:25,090
So I've got a radius I'm going to increase that and in the sky I'm actually not using my stylus at the

178
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,110
moment I'm using the mouse.

179
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:34,850
Turns out when I'm recording it's actually more awkward to use the stylus because it's well it's in

180
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:44,030
the way it's I'm tryna look at something that's directly beneath a microphone which is quite difficult

181
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,790
to do.

182
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:51,150
So there we go we've got some basic stuff in there and let's do that.

183
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,350
I am going to do a house I think so let's make this radius a lot smaller not too small.

184
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,800
Yeah about fair and let's have an orange house I might as well utilize what I've got there and then

185
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,730
zoom in.

186
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:12,190
Zooming is very important because it does allow us to have some more control over what we're doing.

187
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:19,470
Now at this point in time I need to increase the strength of that brush well undo the stroke for I just

188
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,380
did and just do that again.

189
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,070
There we go.

190
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,020
That's much better.

191
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,060
I'm using the stylus for that square.

192
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,990
By the way.

193
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,550
Oh okay.

194
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,420
I thought I zoomed in a lot more than that.

195
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,030
Okay.

196
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,730
Losing reference with the rest of the image can be quite critical.

197
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,420
So there we go.

198
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,530
I will put a roof on my house that's not too great.

199
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm going to change my fill time brush to a fill type.

200
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:53,820
Oh only to select for colour that I want only a slight The slightly lighter orange and using a couple

201
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,220
of different brushes.

202
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,870
There we go it's looking pretty good.

203
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,920
Even if I do say so myself.

204
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,950
What else can we do here.

205
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:09,700
Let's give this house a car swap that's a round.

206
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,020
And I was going to draw a.

207
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,100
Carb there.

208
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,210
Nice simple can't like oh.

209
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,750
My children a.

210
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:25,710
Now obviously joking aside here if you spend the time you can actually get some really nice images going

211
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,370
here.

212
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,810
I'm being as simple and as straightforward as possible with my drawings here.

213
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:39,030
I hope you are having fun doing yours remember to share your work in the discussions and of course there

214
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,350
goes and smoke.

215
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,630
I will see you guys in the next lecture.
