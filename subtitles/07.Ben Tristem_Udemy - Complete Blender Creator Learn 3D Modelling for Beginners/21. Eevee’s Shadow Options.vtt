00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.100
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.570
In this case you're going to have a closer look at shallow specifically trying to make them look a little

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.750
bit better at the moment they look okay on the left hand side you can see one of the issues we have.

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.840
Does it really look like much of a contact shadow but over on the right we actually have shadows where

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.380
the pins are touching the ground and before they were just a bit faded.

6
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.590
That's no good.

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.680
But in order to have a decent look at this let's go have a look at a default scene and work it out from

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.400
there with nice simple objects.

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.040
Okay.

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.040
So over in our default scene here I'm going to add in a plane and scale it's up and I left my cube up

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.620
by one.

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.000
And I'm going to turn on shaded mode.

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.340
The reason for this is if we're in shaded mode we get to see our shadows.

14
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.290
If we're in any other mode we typically do not.

15
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.980
Okay.

16
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.040
So what we have here are a few issues.

17
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.300
So the first one if I turn off all overlays by clicking the little button next to the overlays we can

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.350
zoom in without any of the UI interfering and we can see that at the moment here on the corner it gets

19
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.690
lighter.

20
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.380
That shouldn't be the case.

21
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.820
And we also see that the shadow itself is a bit jagged around the edges.

22
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.690
We'll have a look at both those issues before we do that.

23
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.330
I want to add another type of light into the scene so let's say my overlays back on I'm going to duplicate

24
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.070
this lamp that's already here.

25
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.710
We get a second shadow when we do that and I'm going to scroll down to the lamp properties and I'm gonna

26
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.820
change it to a sun lamp.

27
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.540
Now I'm going to hide that in a moment but to make sure that I have got the right lamp and I'm adjusting

28
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.610
it appropriately.

29
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.070
There we go.

30
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.850
If I turn the lights on and off we get a shadow which is overpowered at the moment and we can also have

31
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.790
that SA point lamp and that's our sun lamp.

32
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.730
So they've both produced shadows and in fact the sun lamp.

33
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.180
You can see it's much more jagged than the other one was.

34
00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.170
And look at that.

35
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.990
That looks really horrible around.

36
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.370
As if it's not connected to the floor.

37
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.270
If I rotate the sun lamp ever so slightly so we get a slightly stretched out shadow.

38
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.470
Can I get it quiet.

39
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.960
They're not quite as rotated.

40
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.410
There we go.

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.820
It's a nice tall shadow.

42
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.760
It shouldn't look like that around the edge here.

43
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.940
And one fell quickly show you is if we change our rendering mode under the render tab from eevee to

44
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.080
cycles we actually get a proper deep shadow coming from that corner.

45
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.410
So let's go back to eevee for the moment and have a look at our settings.

46
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.950
Hey guys.

47
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.380
Mark you've probably noticed some changes going on in a newer version of Blender if you're not using

48
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.260
the current version in the video the first thing you might notice is if we select the light from the

49
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.370
outline or in the top right and go down to the shadow options it's actually on by default now that it

50
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.560
was off in the video is now on you'll also notice that we have lost a couple of options.

51
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.560
We've lost the ESM the ESM jot down.

52
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.130
This is because they've reverted to a different shadow mapping.

53
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.250
So those launches no longer exist and the bias options are now all combined down into one.

54
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.100
The same is that the contact shadows and you will find also if you travel because you are missing the

55
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.670
softness on both of those if you customize up to the render settings under the shadows you'll find a

56
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.870
checkbox for soft shadows and that will cover the soft shadows slider and it will calculate it a lot

57
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.720
better with a might make a.

58
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.960
The first thing to look at is the lamp properties itself.

59
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.360
Now whilst we don't need to worry about those cycles we do when it comes to the Eevee render engine.

60
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.990
So we scroll down and have a look under the lamp properties.

61
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.110
We scroll down further.

62
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.390
There is an option to turn off and on shadows.

63
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.390
Well we do want them on in this case but it's worthwhile noting that you can turn them off if whatever

64
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.880
you're trying to do doesn't need shadows or in fact to shadow spoil the look of it.

65
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.820
That might be especially true when it comes to things of a tune shaded or more comic book style or more

66
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.200
cartoon like style.

67
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.760
So we need shadows turned on the next thing we need to look at is the contact shadows.

68
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.280
So this is where one object meets another.

69
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.230
We turn on contact shadows we see that suddenly down at the bottom here we appear to get an extra shadow

70
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.330
appears and then it kind of fades out and we get this light line here.

71
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.750
So this is where we need to play with these settings perhaps increasing the distance and blend the two

72
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.860
types of shadow together.

73
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.340
Now it's not quite there yet.

74
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.160
I would suggest increasing the softness ever so slightly until we can get it almost matching.

75
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.960
There we go.

76
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.060
That's close enough for me especially at this type of distance.

77
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.150
But what about this horrible jacket ness.

78
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.040
Well this is the reason why we have two different light types in our scene because evey calculates them

79
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.320
differently and oh look at that when we're at a different angle it behaves slightly differently so that's

80
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.720
another thing just to remember there that we may need to look through the camera to work out if the

81
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.920
shadow that we think we have is the one we're going to get.

82
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.130
So let's have a look at this jagged edge along here because that is not a nice edge at all we'd want

83
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.440
it be a bit smoother basically.

84
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.580
So what can we do here.

85
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.040
Well if we go to the render properties again make sure you're on the Eevee render engine and I'm going

86
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.520
to scroll down until we get to the shadow section when we open that up.

87
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.050
We get a couple of options.

88
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:43.080
We have the method of calculating the shadows ESM and V S.M. ESM is great.

89
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.280
It's lovely and quick.

90
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.750
It's not as I would say accurate and not as neat but if you were doing an animation ESM would result

91
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.710
in a quicker render then ESM would if you're just doing it still perhaps she should pick BSM but as

92
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.350
you can see you can switch between the two and they do give slightly different results.

93
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.800
In fact in this case v ESM looks a lot more jagged than ESM so on the first look he may think oh no

94
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.890
Veer seems horrible and never use again but then we need to look at the cube size and the cascade size

95
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.010
when we're dealing with the cube size was specifically talking about two types of lamp points an area

96
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.510
like shadows.

97
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:32.090
So if we turn off our sun lamp for the moment by just hiding it and turn on our lights we end up with

98
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.910
oh we haven't sorted out the contact shadow here but let's focus on this jacket edge along the end here.

99
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.390
If we change the cube size to 64 we get it's looking really really jagged the benefits of it looking

100
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.420
really really jacket is it renders really really quickly but we can increase that from sixty four to

101
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:58.020
four thousand ninety six and then we get a really really smooth shadow at the sacrifice of performance.

102
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:05.690
So that's what all of this is is a trade off between performance and I would dare say reality but a

103
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.610
more realistic shadow.

104
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:14.510
You can also turn on high bit depth and soft shadows and that will really make the shadow soft around

105
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.770
the edges like in real life.

106
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.240
However it will have a performance impact.

107
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:26.620
You will find though if I set this back to 64 and turn off those two options you will find that changing

108
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:33.380
the cascade size will not have any difference whatsoever when it comes to an aerial lamp or a point

109
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.070
lamp.

110
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.820
However what it will make a difference to is our sun lamp.

111
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.440
So we've got our sun lamp here and well our shadows disappeared.

112
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.250
That's because we set the Cosco size 64 we turn it up we start to see that it comes into reality is

113
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.320
it where it's quite chunky at the moment he says it's four thousand ninety six we get a lovely smooth

114
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.980
edge.

115
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.780
Of course we can't go any higher than that so you will in this case and that was some Jack bidness around

116
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.470
the edge.

117
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:06.860
We can make it a bit softer by turning on soft shadows that will try and smooth this out and you can

118
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:13.250
see noticeably there's a slow down in even calculating this and I'm not sure that I like the effect

119
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.940
that we've got there but we can also turn on high bit depth as well to add to the realism and this particular

120
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.850
case I think we need to go back and tweak the settings under the sun lamp to work out what's going to

121
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.670
work best here.

122
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:32.060
I don't like the look of that but you may find switching across the VSO erm makes a little bit of a

123
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.810
difference.

124
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:39.470
So let's go through it once more if we turn on soft shadows that's the thing that's causing this hardness

125
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:47.300
and if we turn on high bit depth we get a slightly different shadow specially on these faded areas I

126
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:53.480
don't know if you saw that there but with high bit depth turned on we don't get these horrible artefacts

127
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:59.780
This is probably going to show up more under our lights itself so let's go back to working on the cube

128
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:07.820
size of say a thousand and let's try VSO here if we go high bit depth it actually helps out massively

129
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:14.420
on this edge here for instance as well because it's all mottled here with a very light shadow we turn

130
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.730
on the high bit that it's a lot lot smoother so there's various options that you can play with with

131
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:27.340
each try and get your shadows looking much better now with big objects like this cube you tend to find

132
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.920
that shadows don't need much altering.

133
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.430
But our ball and pins are a lot smaller.

134
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:39.490
So in order to get the same detail in our shadows we're either going to have to make those objects bigger.

135
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.290
We shouldn't be in the interests of trying to keep things semi realistic or of course we could turn

136
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.690
up the resolution of our shadows and that will depend on the lighting that you've got in your scene

137
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.680
as well.

138
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.980
So now we've had a look at the very shadow options.

139
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.600
It's time for your challenge.

140
00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.820
Okay see your challenge is to create some lighting for your scene at the moment I just stuck with a

141
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.290
default point lamp.

142
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.120
I'm going to make it just a little bit better I'm going to go for a three point light setup myself although

143
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.370
feel free to experiment.

144
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.490
Consider a backdrop at the moment especially if you've been following along.

145
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.730
We've just got a plane on the ground and then this horrible gray background so consider adding a backdrop

146
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.900
to your scene.

147
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.430
Make sure your pins look like they're connected to the floor so you're gonna have to tweak those shadows

148
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.090
settings in order to achieve that.

149
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.360
Go ahead pulls the video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

150
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:40.450
Let's go ahead now and make sure that we've got all seen sets up with lighting and shadows okay.

151
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.150
So here we go.

152
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.800
We've got a bowling scene open.

153
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.410
I'm going to start having a look at my lights.

154
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.070
I'm going to switch the shading mode to rendered so I can see the shadows.

155
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.910
Without them it would be a bit useless.

156
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.280
And I'm going to scroll down to my lights settings now do bear in mind that whilst we're dealing with

157
00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.570
this light 0 0 1 is a different light from the one that was copied over in the standard layout scene.

158
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:08.300
So if we wanted the same light everywhere we would have to link them together of course we can just

159
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.550
move this lighting rig that we're currently creating back to the standard layout later on if we wanted

160
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.820
to.

161
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.420
So it doesn't matter in this particular thing but it's just something to be aware of.

162
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:25.360
So let's go back to our smash and add in some different options it's a contact shadows.

163
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.340
Now the contact shows themselves.

164
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:33.290
We don't need too much detail in here but we do need it to look a little bit better than that we can

165
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:38.060
see that the thickness there if we turn that all the way up it just doesn't look great.

166
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.820
So so we can turn on a little bit and we can soften it up as well.

167
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.890
That would just make it look much better.

168
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.460
Okay.

169
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.400
So that's the contact shadow done.

170
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.820
But what about the rest of the shadow itself.

171
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.940
Now there are loads of options that we can tweak here but to be quite honest I don't think we need to

172
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.160
go into too much depth.

173
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:06.710
One of the things I've noticed is that the shadow itself doesn't seem to be that dark and that's fine.

174
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:13.740
But it does mean that as we look at this our contact shadow seems to go and fade out very very quickly.

175
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.220
So I've clicked away from it because I've clicked on the pin there.

176
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.950
Let's go back to our lights here and just have a look at the other options that we can do here.

177
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.300
I'm going to increase my exponents slightly and that should make things ever so slightly darker.

178
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.340
OK brilliant.

179
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.820
Now I'm going to go to my render settings and go to my shadows.

180
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.120
Now I'm working with ESM at the moment.

181
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.260
I could switch it to VM.

182
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.180
You'll notice that it looks horrible initially and then we'll have to come in probably use high bit

183
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:48.750
depth to get to the place we want and turn up this cube map a little bit.

184
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:54.900
But you can see if we go really high it makes things quite soft again depending on whether that's what

185
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.590
you want.

186
00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.770
It's entirely up to you but I will warn you that using the ESM as I've mentioned is much more intensive

187
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.180
and potentially has the side effects of taking longer to rent.

188
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.490
So I'm going to stick with ESM for my own sanity at the moment and let's just have a look at what soft

189
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.630
shadows does to us.

190
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:18.800
Does it do anything appreciable so let's have a look at it from the camera's perspective.

191
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:26.070
So soft shadows on soft shadows off doesn't make any difference if I turn this down to 1 0 2 4 and then

192
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.490
put soft shadows on soft shadows off.

193
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.000
Now I don't see any difference there.

194
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.240
In fact high bit depth I can turn that off as well.

195
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.910
So some of these things will make a big difference and some of them just won't.

196
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.320
I'm happy with my contact shadows there.

197
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.750
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate my lights and move it around to the side.

198
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:51.030
So at the moment it's all the way over there I'm going to move it a bit closer and I'm going to duplicate

199
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:58.620
it and place another one over here and then I'm gonna go to those light settings and just turn down

200
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.210
the brightness ever so slightly I'm going to set out half the brightness of before.

201
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:03.920
Okay.

202
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:04.620
That's brilliant.

203
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:10.230
We've got fewer harsh shadows on our objects so we're almost there.

204
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.720
I would like to create a background.

205
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.330
I'm going to create a background in a slightly different way.

206
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.810
This is going to be parts of our lighting and camera sets up because it's going to be the background

207
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:19.980
to our scene.

208
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:26.040
And I'm going to create it by adding in a cylinder looks pretty good.

209
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.680
I'm just going to move that over here.

210
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.350
Now what this is gonna do if I could leave it like that but what I was thinking was going into edit

211
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:39.350
mode and selecting a semicircle from it.

212
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.120
So maybe here to here.

213
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:46.530
That's delete those vertices and then I'll be able to press El on this slots over here and delete them

214
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.380
completely from the scene.

215
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.020
Now if we have a look we're not quite there yet.

216
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:58.700
We're gonna have to scale that up and move it across and probably move it towards the camera as well

217
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.100
so we have a look at where it is currently.

218
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.790
Or we could rotate that towards the camera and move it here.

219
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:11.820
And what that will give us is it will give us a backdrop which is a bit better than the boring gray

220
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.670
that we have before.

221
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.680
The internal shades smooth and we've also got a gradient going across there.

222
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:22.840
So now I can go ahead give it a material let's give it the name.

223
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:29.280
Background now I could of course go in and model loads of extra details.

224
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.450
I don't want to do that at this point.

225
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.950
I'm going to give it some dark color in the background.

226
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:41.880
I mean this is where you really get to pick where you're going I'm going to do this or that color.

227
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.890
I don't know what you call it's over deep purple and we've got this gradient because it's curved.

228
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:53.290
We will actually get a decent gradient across the backdrop so that's starting to look really nice and

229
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.810
of course in reality it's all smoke and mirrors and that's something to bear in mind whenever you're

230
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.330
creating anything like this.

231
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.020
Smoke and mirrors is fine.

232
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:08.170
Now if we were to move this too close you can see that the shadow starts casting on our scene so you

233
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:15.160
may want to push this through an in or you may need to adjust your lights if you do have shadows being

234
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.030
cast from these.

235
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.670
I'm happy with mine looking like that for the moment though and I don't think I can see any of those

236
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.810
rendering artifacts in it.

237
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:23.560
Brilliant.

238
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.870
So the final thing that I do want to do here is bring these two lamps down even further.

239
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.130
The re are.

240
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.390
So I'm starting to get a shadow appearing in this case.

241
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:38.350
So what I can do there is I can bring the lights closer and turn it down and let's also let's bring

242
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.500
it closer which we have done here and then I'm going to turn it down a little.

243
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.940
So maybe make it three watts.

244
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:50.950
That seems far too bright for a three watt bulb unless it's talking about incandescents Of course.

245
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.340
There we go.

246
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:57.390
So we've got some lovely gradient Phil across the background got better shadows on our scene.

247
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.540
Excellent.

248
00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.530
How did yours turn out.

249
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.580
I'm going to rent the mine out now should really saved before doing that.

250
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.130
I always feel a bit bad when I just hit render.

251
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:14.440
Just in case blender crashes you just lose your work so I'm going to call this smash with lighting and

252
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:21.840
I I do really like keeping a progress of how I'm progressing and I suggest you do as well.

253
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:28.000
It's great in the future to look back at your early work as you're developing as an artist you'll often

254
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.310
think that you're not good enough.

255
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.730
I certainly do myself.

256
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.280
And then you get to the point where you look at some of your early work and you think oh my look how

257
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.320
much I've improved so do keep your early work as you go.

258
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.830
I'm going to save my work here just in case something happens like blender crashing it's not happened

259
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.950
yet fortunately but it could always do that.

260
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:52.090
Whether or not we're in a beta so please share your work.

261
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.800
Have you set up your lighting.

262
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.300
I'm looking forward to seeing it and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
