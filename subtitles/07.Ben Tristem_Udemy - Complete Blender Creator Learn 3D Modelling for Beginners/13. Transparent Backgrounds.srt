00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:08,180
Welcome to transparent backgrounds in this bonus video going to learn how to set up your background

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,550
as transparence.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,770
The options are different in both blender render and cycles so we'll cover both of those and they're

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,080
relatively straightforward.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,930
However the options are hidden in a way and what you'll end up with as as you can see here you end up

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:31,490
being able to present a model on to a background because the background itself is transparent.

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,690
And let's go explore this now and hop on over into blender.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,160
Okay so we're over in blender here and let's just go ahead and render our scene.

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,830
I'm going to hit off 12 to do that now we can see on the info head a bar and obviously by this rendering

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,270
itself being so starkly contrasted it is blender render.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,450
And you can see the background here is still grey when it's transparent you get that kind of chequered

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,500
effect.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,980
Now if we export this as is in going to file and save an image then we're going to end up with this

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,640
key with a grey background on it which is not what we want we want the cube isolated from the rest of

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,310
the scene.

16
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,990
So how do you do that.

17
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,980
Well it's in the render properties for both blender render and cycles.

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,790
But it's in different places.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,970
Logical Yes.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,790
Okay.

21
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,510
So we need to scroll down and t find shading it's probably collapsed as mine is here.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,190
If we go ahead and open that up we have a series of options and we need to change the option that says

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,330
Alpha changed that from sky to transparence.

24
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:47,650
Now when we go ahead and render our image you can see that the background itself has this chequered

25
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,530
appearance.

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,300
And then you can go ahead and get an image and save an image.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,250
Now I am going to I've already saved one here as a test the one you saw a moment ago.

28
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm going to set one up that's for Blender render and I'm going to savour in a few moments.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,940
But before we do let's go down to the lower left hand corner and have a look at the options.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,840
So we've got a P N G select.

31
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,810
At the moment which does contain an alpha layer.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,630
However sometimes a production of a PRNG with a now fired out layer especially there's a gradient between

33
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,090
it be the cue for instance is just a solid edge so that's fine if you have a graduated something like

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,100
a light effect or a particle effect.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,000
Then you may want to select something different.

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,010
You may wish to select tiff.

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,990
Now it's going to produce a larger file but it's going to handle the Alpher layer much better than potentially

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,480
the PRNG does.

39
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:49,840
But Store is a PRNG first see how it works and if you end up with a slight halo effect around your image

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,710
when you apply it to a background then you probably want to try a different formats colour depth where

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,800
most people don't have the ability to see more than 8 bits on their monitors so you can leave it as

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,300
that.

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,520
However if your models be made for a high dynamic range environment.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,190
HRT visa starts to come around and monitors won't be far behind.

45
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm sure you'll want to make sure that's set to 16 bits.

46
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:20,020
In some ways you know it is better to have the highest quality possible but on the same fronts you don't

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,970
need extra where it's not going to make any difference whatsoever.

48
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,320
So with that selected I can go ahead and click save image and now I've got an image on my computer with

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,180
an outfit out background that I can now apply to whatever I want.

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,160
So we've explored that in blender render how do we do it in cycles.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,910
Well we can switch over to the cycles render engine first so we can see what's going on.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,070
The rendering properties change quite dramatically when this happens.

53
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,630
And in order to render the background transparent we need to change a couple of options.

54
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,220
So let's first of all render it as it is and see what happens.

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:02,740
Now I'm currently using my CPA to render and it's taking a little while to do harm but I'm going to

56
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,430
switch across to GP you now.

57
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm also going to change my samples.

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,750
No not samples.

59
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm going to change my proof under my performance setting this ungeared a set her 2 5 6 2 5 6 for the

60
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,770
moment so it renders a bit quick for you guys.

61
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,590
So where in this muddle of options do we change to make this background transparent.

62
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,210
Well it's under the film dropdown This may or may not be open for you so fine.

63
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,680
The film properties and put a tick in transparent and there we can see that if we hover over the world

64
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,430
background is transparent.

65
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:45,430
Now when we go ahead with that box checked and we hit render we get it rendered out with feet.

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,110
Alpher layer and once again you can go ahead and save that's to your hard drive.

67
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,650
There we go.

68
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,220
Nice and straightforward.

69
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,880
But it is a little bit complicated where they've hidden it away.

70
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,020
I hope you find that incredibly helpful.

71
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,780
And we'll see you guys in the next lecture.
