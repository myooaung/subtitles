00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,620
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,830
In this lecture we're going to do one last profile modelling.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:16,880
But this time using mesh objects enables us to have a much more detailed surface on our model.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,010
So let's go ahead and hide the archway once again.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,690
Now this time I'm going to do some sort of block work and it's going to be really simple once again.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,420
So let's go ahead and add in a cube.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,900
It's going to be added in completely the wrong place.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,120
But again I don't care at this point in time because we're going to manipulate it.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,190
So I'm going to go into edit mode that there have to apply anything.

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,870
And let's pop that there and what we're going to aim for is some alternating Block works just to give

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,580
ourselves a bit of variety.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm going to scale that on the x axis and get a lift that's up.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,820
So it's approximately in the right place there.

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,970
I'm going to duplicate that scale it's on the x axis by point five which will halve it and I'm going

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,830
to leave a little bit of a gap there and then just place it on top like that.

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,600
Now what I can do is get that to follow our arch way around which should be pretty awesome by itself

17
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,870
and hopefully what we'll be able to do probably get it up to the top and then mirror it's coming down.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,060
I don't think I've measure that perfectly.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,250
If it does work out really well like that even better.

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,840
So I'm looking at this here going perhaps I should scale it down just a little bit more.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,330
Otherwise those are going to be some pretty big bricks.

22
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,230
Excellent.

23
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm going to Bevel all of those edges as well just to give myself a bit of variety.

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,450
I don't need that many segments however chunky block like that.

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,540
I'm fine with now it is pretty uniform but I'm quite happy with it.

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,240
But I am going to push it into the floor so I'm going to line my camera up zoom in because it's just

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,440
above the floor at the moment I'm going to go GZ and push it slightly into the floor.

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:16,170
Okay so we've got our our objects that we want to move around our doorway so to speak.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,280
So where has that gone.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Let's call this archway bricks or something along those lines because that's what we're going to use

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,900
it for archway bricks.

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
And it's part of the building.

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,670
And in fact we've got a bit of a hierarchy problem here.

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,980
I'm going to use the parenting I'm going to enable all of this.

35
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,740
I can definitely select them.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,740
So the door mirror all of these archways as well I'm holding down shift walls that do that and whilst

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,840
I've still got shift height held down I'm going to click and drag it on the doorway and it will set

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,350
the doorway is the parent for all of those objects.

39
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,230
That's a much better hierarchy to look at and all of these are to do with the doorway.

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,510
Okay.

41
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,670
So I'm going expand that again and select my archway bricks that we've created.

42
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,910
I'm going to hide the other ones there.

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,630
Okay.

44
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,930
Now we go to the modifiers tabs we've got a couple of options that we can use here.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,480
There's the option of a curve.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,490
So we're going to deform the bricks based upon a curve.

47
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,170
Is that what we want to do.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,300
Kind of.

49
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,550
Because that won't repeat the bricks.

50
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,430
Now what do we need in order to repeat something you remember.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,180
That's right.

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,720
The array modifier.

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,050
Now if we use the array modifier what we can now do is fit type.

54
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,850
We can fit it to a curve.

55
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,790
We've already got the curve going round that's the curve direction so we can go ahead and select that.

56
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,470
So now this is the appropriate length apparently to go all the way around our curve.

57
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,300
Now of course we can just half that later on absolutely fine.

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,840
But it's not bending around the curve at all.

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:04,930
So what we can do now is we can go and add another modify and deform this array so it fits the curve.

60
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,780
And once again we can pick the curve direction as the profile that we're going to be following.

61
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,880
Now this doesn't look right.

62
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,010
It kind of works and it's completely the wrong way.

63
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,990
So this is where you can have a look at your defamation axes and see if you can find one that works.

64
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:30,520
But it's not a defamation access in this count it is the means tilt of the archway curve.

65
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,820
So there's a couple of options that we can do here.

66
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,170
We can go back to the curve direction.

67
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:43,070
So that's what we saw in that showing that's unlike the archway curved direction and then with that

68
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,640
selected go into edit mode I seem to have lots of objects selected let's just select the archway itself

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,140
the curve direction go into edit mode.

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,480
And now if we adjust the mean tilt look the bricks move round for us as well.

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,020
But it changes the other curve extrusion that we've got going on.

72
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,480
So we don't want to destroy that.

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,600
So we can even duplicate the curve direction and use it specifically for the brickwork which would be

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,180
absolutely fine or we could just rotate our bricks round again both of them are absolutely fine.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,310
I'm going to hide my curved direction and just to demonstrate that if I go into edit mode on my archway

76
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,250
bricks you'll notice that it hops around and that can be quite annoying if we can't see what's really

77
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,990
going on.

78
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,200
So we can turn on this option here on the curve modifier so we can see what's happening in edit mode

79
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,320
and then we can rotate things around to our heart's content.

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,900
So let's try rotating on the z axis.

81
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,050
No on the y axis well maybe on the x axis.

82
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,000
There we go.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,290
That's what we need to do.

84
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,810
We need to rotate it round so it looks flat by the looks of it.

85
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,290
So let's rotate it round 90 degrees.

86
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,190
That looks very odd doesn't it.

87
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:11,220
And then I'm going to just move it around so g z up and down seems to work.

88
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,610
Oh no I haven't quite got it the right way round.

89
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,270
Let's continue rotating it now at this point in time I'm looking at that going.

90
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,460
Actually that doesn't look too bad in terms but it's not what I intended.

91
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,220
So let's go back into edit mode make sure everything selected and rotate it once again until we get

92
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,300
the right fit.

93
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,920
Now that's pretty cool.

94
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,400
I might just keep that you know that is pretty awesome.

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,380
That's not why I was expecting.

96
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,100
Here we go.

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,460
Let's see these rotating around a little bit more.

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,420
Let's do it by whole numbers.

99
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,000
Ninety is not bad.

100
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,660
Minus 90 is probably what I was looking for.

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,370
That looks spot on right now.

102
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,830
It would be entirely up to you which way you do.

103
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,410
I would actually recommend a different curve direction and follow round because then it's more intuitive

104
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,900
what this object is actually doing.

105
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,020
But ultimately your end result is what matters.

106
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,420
Okay.

107
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,050
Now where this is around the arch is a little bit problematic.

108
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,030
So let's go in and sort that out.

109
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,510
What's the reason for this.

110
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,650
Well if you remember with curves it matters where it starts.

111
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:28,120
So our issue here with it going up and down again this distance here is probably the same distance as

112
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,670
it is to the origin of our world.

113
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,820
So once again in edit mode if I grab all of that remembering that a curve only perceives the world in

114
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,760
to day and move that along the x axis all the way back to the origin look at that.

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,850
It matches however as it goes around here we can very easily see that it doesn't do what I would have

116
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,240
hoped it would and work all the way round and end perfectly.

117
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,130
You might want that type of look for your game or for your assets for your game.

118
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,230
I don't want that look I want it to end.

119
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,620
So one of the best things I can do is go back half way around and then just mirror it.

120
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,330
So what we can do here is go into the array modifier itself and at the moment we're fitting the curve

121
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,010
which is absolutely fine.

122
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,540
We can play with relative offset constant offsets going to be a bit more picky.

123
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:23,900
So I prefer relative offset of let's say adding a bit more or a few more gaps inside the brickwork.

124
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,200
Absolutely fine.

125
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,540
I'm going to leave it as one though because I like that nice tight brickwork.

126
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,380
But what we can do here is instead of fitting the curve we can go ahead and just fit a certain length

127
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,310
at the moment.

128
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,810
There is nothing there but as we increase that we can see it builds up in fact it's going backwards

129
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,910
in this case and that's about the middle.

130
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,790
Just up there.

131
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,170
Perfect.

132
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,560
Can I get a negative with my length.

133
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,180
No I can't.

134
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,410
So let's work with it like that.

135
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,990
That's absolutely fine.

136
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,630
And what I can now do is add another modifier right at the bottom.

137
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:06,210
A mirror modifier it's not going to match but we've already got a mirror point in our scene our door

138
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:06,850
mirror.

139
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,110
So let's use that now that's almost perfect.

140
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,300
You see how they grouped together like that.

141
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,100
And again you've got a couple of options we could solidify at this point and then try and merge so we

142
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,440
could apply the array and curve modifier.

143
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:30,040
However I like the option of our geometry here being non-destructive giving us basically infinite variability

144
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,590
later down the line the moment we solidify this to a mesh we lose quite a bit of control.

145
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:42,190
Little things like maybe not the defamation axis there but maybe adding a little bits of relative offset

146
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:48,380
which should merge the two top like so we can continue pushing them together.

147
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:56,110
So let's try a relative offset of that looks pretty good I'm holding down shift here to get a smaller

148
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,240
value but yeah it looks like a nice Keystone.

149
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,400
I think they call it at the very top.

150
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,530
I like that.

151
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,460
And of course you can use this technique with more mesh detail or less.

152
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,680
Just bear in mind the more you put in if you added another brick in here you'd have to rejig how this

153
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,140
merges together.

154
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,570
Yeah I really like how that's come together.

155
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,800
And of course now what we can do is go back to that mirror modifier and repeat on the y axis as well.

156
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,510
Look at that.

157
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,290
Awesome.

158
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:30,200
Now one of the things I will finalize here by saying is that if you really wants to make an impact with

159
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,080
these bricks you may want to solidify as I was talking about actually applying all of these modifiers

160
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,410
maybe taking a copy first so you can always rewind.

161
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:46,700
And then what I would do is make sure that some of the edges were a bit more worn or a bit less uniform

162
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,920
so it doesn't look quite new.

163
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,010
The other thing that I do want to do here is look how shallow these are.

164
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,920
So I'm going to go in if I already am in edit mode of these these bricks here and I'm going to go g

165
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,590
and Y.

166
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Remember this works on two axes.

167
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:08,240
So I want the Brooke Block words come out a little on that direction so I can actually have the edges

168
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,550
of the bricks coming through but it not be too deep.

169
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:17,690
That's really good that way but I want the brick work this way to be much deeper so like a g x.

170
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,320
That's the up and down that we've talked about before said g z is going to be backwards and forwards

171
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,090
and then we can have massive block work.

172
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,580
Something about that I should imagine.

173
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,110
Excellent.

174
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,660
Wow.

175
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,020
Yes.

176
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,410
Brilliant.

177
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,840
I'm loving how that's coming together.

178
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,520
Now this is giving you a lot of scope for variations on your doors.

179
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,950
Really looking forward to seeing what you come up with.

180
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,720
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you well in the next lecture.
