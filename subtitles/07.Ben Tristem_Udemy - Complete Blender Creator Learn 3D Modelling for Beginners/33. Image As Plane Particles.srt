00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,390
In this lecture, we're adding a different sort of grass to our scene by using images as planes and

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,700
transparency to scattering some other sort of grass OSAT by making sure we've got the right.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,460
Add on in edit preferences.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,200
We need to make sure we've got images as planes turned on, which, yes, we do.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,890
Now, what I'm going to do is shift A and then find image, look for images as planes that will add

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,950
a new images plane once we find what it is that we're looking for.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,360
Kind of just like life, isn't it?

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,470
Find what you're looking for.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,470
I am looking for fluffy grass to see, you know what that looks like.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,280
It's this image down here on the left.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,490
Once again, you can go to texture's dot com and find yourself your own good looking image that you

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,620
think could be used as a piece of grass.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,190
I'm going to hit G.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,090
Y to move this down to the side so that we can see it.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,470
I've got to lighten it up in Photoshop just now so it's more yellowy.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,360
Hopefully that turns out okay and is in a little bit of a mistake.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,280
But let's see how it goes.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,050
Now they've got that image sitting there.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,460
I don't need all this real estate.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,170
I'm in the silo.

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,060
Move that over a little bit.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,310
I'm going to click on my plane and add a new particle system.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,750
Click plus double click.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,480
This will be our fluffy grass.

25
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,480
Not sure if it's fluffy, but Fluffy is a fine name for it.

26
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,190
Click on hair blink.

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,540
We get a whole bunch of particles, change the length down to a more modest point.

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:20,900
Eight.

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,670
See how that is as a starting point.

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,480
I'm also going to change my emission much lower down to, say, 200.

31
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,340
I don't want as many of these and scroll all the way down to children just to get our numbers figured

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,520
out.

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,850
First of all, interpolated, I'll change this to five.

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,610
And also in the render amount, five might come back to that.

35
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,990
But that's okay for the moment.

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,300
We'll do our trick that we did before in terms of getting some randomness in the heights, all at the

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,320
randomness.

38
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,260
This is under render timing, random, random, random, two point five.

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,370
And I've kind of saved the best till last, actually.

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,550
Let's go and make our particle look like our image.

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,370
So under render instead of Renderos path will renders object.

42
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,450
And then down a little bit lower, you can see instance object.

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,430
Click on the selector eyedropper.

44
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,690
Find your image that you've just brought in fluffy grass.

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,520
Click on that and then hey presto, not much happens.

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,170
Gosnold pretty tiny.

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,660
So under rindo we see scale just increase scale until it gets the point where they're starting to look

48
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,650
like this sort of size.

49
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,050
We want them to be that starting to look like it, I think.

50
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,290
But you can see they're all underneath the ground, which is not what we want.

51
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,150
And that is because of the origin point.

52
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,450
So up top right options, click on options.

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,280
You'll see origins, select origins.

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,250
We need to select back on our original object.

55
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,930
This is where we can see our origin.

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,250
If I click on G and then Z, I can change the origin point to be down at the bottom of my object.

57
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,280
That will have everything sitting on the ground as it should.

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,370
Back on options, turn off origins.

59
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,910
So we're not seeing that all the time.

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,050
Now, this is great.

61
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,250
We've brought in a whole bunch of these bits of grass.

62
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,990
You can see a lot of depth already, but when we're on the side, it looks pretty.

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,400
Not so good because they're just flat.

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,480
There's a flat images.

65
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,150
This is a more efficient and I think quicker way of doing it, then modelling geometry.

66
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,910
But we end up with these planes, these billboards.

67
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,230
Now, you can absolutely model geometry, particularly if you're having issues with this approach,

68
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,390
with the transparency or with it working.

69
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,190
You can model a leaf or or a stem or a stalker, a bit of grass, and you can put a texture onto that.

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,780
And then you can duplicated a bunch of times to make your own little arrangement within a job geometry

71
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
that can be an object.

72
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,500
And then rather than clicking on this flat image here to populate your particles, you can click on

73
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,270
an object so you can use the particle system to spawn a whole bunch of whatever you want.

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,370
It'd be crazy even thinking about it, but I could spawn a whole bunch of cats as particles around here

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
if I wanted to do that.

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,970
You know, I'm going to try that to see how badly it breaks things.

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,070
OK.

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,290
Hasn't broken it so far.

79
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,540
It's Kalakala, it's silly.

80
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,970
Scale it up.

81
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,070
There you go.

82
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,280
We've got a whole bunch of cats being spawned, so I wouldn't recommend this is the best look of making

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,020
grass look good and goodness only knows what sort of geometry we've got going on in there.

84
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,430
But just to show you that you can use any object so you could make little flowers and arrange them using

85
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,330
this same technique.

86
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,930
I'm going to remove that particle system before my computer implodes.

87
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,920
There we go.

88
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,060
Now we're back to the problem we've got here, which is everything's facing in the one direction.

89
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,860
So make sure advanced is clicked on and we're clicked on a fluffy grass.

90
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,780
Scroll down and you'll see rotation, click on rotation, open up the opening puppy thing.

91
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,390
And instead of orientation axis being velocity hair, I'm going to change this to global Z.

92
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,600
So we're gonna rotate around our upby Downy Axis.

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,240
Now, when I increase the randomize phase, you'll see that things turn.

94
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,960
If I play around with it, you'll see that they turn in a random direction.

95
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,270
So we have a lot more of that depth of depth of the look to what we're doing with our grass here.

96
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,620
Let's do a quick render to see how things are progressing and we'll see if I made a huge mistake by

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,210
going and doing my last minute coloring of that grass to make it more yellow.

98
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,260
So far, it's not terrible.

99
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,030
And you can see straight away there's more of a realistic, high, detailed look that we get with this

100
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,650
image is plain than we do when we've just got our our hair particles from our previous lecture just

101
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,430
bombed in there.

102
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,890
So it's a step up in terms of complexity.

103
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,420
One issue we're getting here is look at we've got all these black spots in here.

104
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,760
This is where the light is not getting through.

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,830
The transparency information is not working.

106
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,300
So you see down the front here.

107
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,740
Transparency is working.

108
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,150
But over here, it's not working.

109
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,880
One solution I've found is that if we jump over to our render properties and we look at light paths,

110
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,780
what I found is VI increase the total number of light paths to 20.

111
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,820
And the transparency to 20.

112
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,050
Then I can fix most of those black hole issues.

113
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,930
So I haven't played around with it to the full extent.

114
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,390
I just put those numbers up.

115
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,330
Both those numbers up and it seem to fix it.

116
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,320
If you're getting the issue in more an extreme way, you might want to put your numbers higher.

117
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,230
Depends on the transparency that you're using.

118
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,550
This is going to get pretty intensive on your computer if you've got too much of this going on.

119
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,750
So bear in mind that it's a little bit dependent upon the rig that you're running.

120
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,010
And if you've got a bit of a potato, which is what I had up until recently, then it's pretty tricky

121
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:12,470
to do.

122
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,050
But this has ended up pretty good, I think, in terms of getting that extra flavor in here.

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,430
So I could play around with this a little bit.

124
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,590
I might just increase the density of this.

125
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,870
There's a few more of those, and I'm definitely gonna change the randomness of the height a little

126
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,900
bit more and add a little bit more randomness in general, I think.

127
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:35,320
So if I do a live randomise at the top, he can see that it's randomising in a number of directions

128
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,220
on different axes.

129
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,830
So going to a little bit of that to push it off.

130
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,480
And then I'm going to add some scale randomness so we get different heights.

131
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,060
And you can see here, if my scale is one point three, that's the maximum height and the scale randomness

132
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,310
is going to scale things up to that height.

133
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,100
So let's see around about there, I think is going to give us some of that height, randomness.

134
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,850
And then just for fun, I'm going to come down a roughness and play with the randomness there, see

135
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,260
if anything at all happens.

136
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,560
I don't think it will because we're using an image.

137
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,390
We're not using up strands of particles.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,020
When you're looking for randomness, you just twiddle anything that says random, don't you?

139
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,070
Just to see what happens.

140
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,380
Okay, then there's one more thing that you can do.

141
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:21,010
If you're feeling brave and adventurous, you can hand place some of these flowers if you want them

142
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,700
to get to get them in a specific spot.

143
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,560
So click on.

144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,230
Plus, I'll hide the other two particles systems.

145
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,380
I'll rename this to be, let's see, larger graphs.

146
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,380
Now I'll turn the number down to something more manageable.

147
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,410
Ten click on hair length to one.

148
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,970
Scroll down, scroll down.

149
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,790
Instead of paff with sprinter's object, click on these selecta.

150
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,830
Find our object.

151
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,500
Now obviously you could do with this with a totally different object.

152
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,320
Totally new flower or something.

153
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,520
Increase, increase, increase.

154
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,020
While it's still in this mode.

155
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,430
Before I go and do anything else, I've got to get them all set up exactly how I want them, because

156
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,170
I'm going to go on hand, place them in one year.

157
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,690
Once you hand place them, you lose some options.

158
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:08,950
So click on advanced scroll down to rotation like rotation once again, Global Z, etc..

159
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,320
Being randomise, I'm going to use phase and that will rotate all of them in the direction of where

160
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,580
the camera should be.

161
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,730
Okay, mostly to where the camera is.

162
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,600
So this is specific rotation as opposed to random rotation, which we could do.

163
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,300
If you've just got one fixed camera, you can have everything in exactly the right alignment if you

164
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,930
wanted to do that.

165
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,590
But that won't look so good if you're doing a rotate around.

166
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,210
But for me, I'm seeing a fixed camera.

167
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,580
So this is is or should work.

168
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,300
Okay.

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,550
Speaking of camera, where is my camera?

170
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,630
Where is all the way back here.

171
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,880
So let's go and get generally where it's going to be.

172
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,950
Okay, so a couple of these are going to be in front of the cat.

173
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
That might be a good look.

174
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,330
I don't know.

175
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,210
We've already got a couple in front of the cat, so it's just a little test.

176
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,640
Renda, while we've got those couple of new ones placed in there, I might not need a hand place them.

177
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,070
Maybe the randomness will do the job for me.

178
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,860
Okay, I'm liking this one over on the side here.

179
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,850
That looks nice.

180
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,860
The one in the front, not too bad, hides a little bit of the cat to make Libya more mysterious just

181
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,110
to show that that's an approach that we can take.

182
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,300
So what I will do, I think they're looking pretty good.

183
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,000
Might just scale them up a tiny bit more.

184
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,110
Sorry.

185
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,780
Back on to my ground.

186
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,530
And find scale and render scale just a little bit bigger.

187
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,610
Yep, that's fine.

188
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,160
Now going to try something crazy, which between just you and I.

189
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,050
I've not actually yet done so.

190
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,050
I'm going to change the number down to zero for my particles.

191
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,730
Jump over into particle.

192
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,170
Edit bearing in mind that as soon as I do this, we're going to lose some of the controls that we have

193
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,730
over in our control panel.

194
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,250
And I will place one just there and just there, a couple over in the background.

195
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,130
I think if I place them here, they probably won't be in camera.

196
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,660
But we'll see what happens.

197
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,780
Now, when I jump back into object mode, they're facing the camera.

198
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,050
Good.

199
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,120
They're in exactly the spot that I place them.

200
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,580
Now, I have a little bit of control in terms of saying where would I like some of those longer bunches?

201
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,860
Now, obviously, you could just take your image.

202
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,810
The texture is plain that we imported and you could just duplicate that and place it exactly where you

203
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,240
want to.

204
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,360
But the point of this exercise is to show you how we could do it with the particle system so that we

205
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,460
know the full power of the particle system.

206
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,140
So let's scale this down.

207
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,550
I'll have this in view.

208
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,200
So I see exactly what I'm talking about.

209
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:30,190
Okay, so we want to get some couple more at the back and maybe one down in here and one over in there.

210
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,110
I got a couple of tests renders I figured that I need a little bit more volume at the front.

211
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,060
So there's not quite the contrast between my two particle systems and I'll probably do some more of

212
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,990
this in the next lecture.

213
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,810
But just a reminder that you can increase or decrease the length of your particles when you're editing

214
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,990
the particles so that you get taller or smaller flowers.

215
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,640
But this is what I've come up with.

216
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,450
I think it's pretty good.

217
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,950
My point here is that you can add any type of object that you want.

218
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,350
You can add a whole bunch of different flowers.

219
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,300
You can create geometry.

220
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,730
It doesn't need to just be the image as planes.

221
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,830
And if you're having any issue with the transparency with it, not working with it, not rendering correctly,

222
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,480
then there's other ways, other solutions to go about implementing something that's looking grass like.

223
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,600
So I think I probably put a little bit too much in here now.

224
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,190
It's a little bit of a wall of grass.

225
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,550
I'll take a couple out just so it doesn't look like my cat's completely hidden.

226
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,410
And if you haven't done so already, your challenge is to add some flavor.

227
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,870
Find a transparent grass or flower image to add to your grass scene, to add to your plane.

228
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,030
If you want add more than one, add a whole bunch hand.

229
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,000
Place them if you want or just have them randomly spawn if you would like that as well.

230
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,760
There's your challenge.

231
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,620
And please do share what you come up with after you go through this process so we can see what you've

232
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,590
created for your wonderful grass scene.

233
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,120
Okay, I'll see you in the next lecture.
