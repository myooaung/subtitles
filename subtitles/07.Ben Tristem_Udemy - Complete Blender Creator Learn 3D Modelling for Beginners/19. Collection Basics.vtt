Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture on collections collections are a way of grouping and organizing
1

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.390
things if you will.
2

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.860
Collecting them into one place so if you have a look at the outliner in the top right here we see that
3

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.170
we've got a collection which is this a box file type object lighting and camera.
4

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.390
And if we open up we see lights and cameras within and we've got our bowling objects which contains
5

6
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.280
our ball, Our pin.
6

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.570
And this plane at the bottom.
7

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.060
We should probably rename that as well.
8

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.080
So let's hop on over back to our bowling scene and find out more.
9

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.500
OK so this is where we left off everything before we've just got one single collection.
10

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.660
Of course we've got a scene collection at the top here.
11

12
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.420
So we have this collection that's got everything in it.
12

13
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.360
And looking at everything we could have a collection within the collection as well.
13

14
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.270
That's always a possibility and sometimes a useful thing to do.
14

15
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.140
So really what we want to do is make sure that all of these objects are within their own collection.
15

16
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.050
And that will enable us to do several things including if we append this to another file we don't have
16

17
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.360
to bring in everything individually again.
17

18
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.700
We can literally append the collection of objects.
18

19
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.870
So let's start off with these pins I'm literally going to draw the box around them if I've got border select
19

20
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.960
not turned on you can turn it's a select box over here or indeed use the w key to cycle through.
20

21
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.120
So I've got all of these pins selected if I press the M key it will bring up moved to new collection.
21

22
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.310
We can also go to the object menu collection and then we've got a series of options here as well.
22

23
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.880
Now we've already got a collection that exists what we can do is move things to that collection so i'm going
23

24
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.070
to click on one of my pins, press the M key.
24

25
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.120
Create a new collection and then a type in pins.
25

26
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.670
In this case press enter and then click Okay.
26

27
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.630
And now we should find if I just minimize collection we've got pins with bowling pins 0 0 5 in it.
27

28
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.300
Brilliant.
28

29
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.420
So let's go ahead and select these other ones as well.
29

30
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.450
I'm just going to manually do it for the moment because that's going to be just as quick as doing any
30

31
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.350
other way.
31

32
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.320
And press M again and now pins is one of the options because we've already created it so we can add
32

33
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.830
the rest of the bowling pins to it.
33

34
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.970
Perfect, right.
34

35
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.540
How about the bowling ball and this ground plane that we've got here. In factr it's still just called plane
35

36
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.490
let's call it alley.
36

37
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.930
That's one of the things we need to do.
37

38
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.860
Let's add those.
38

39
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.990
Now we don't want to add them to pins but we could add them to a scene called bowling.
39

40
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.020
So let's at them there/
40

41
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.560
Or bowling objects I think it would be a better name for our collection.
41

42
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.660
So it's very easy at this point to forget that you need to click okay as well.
42

43
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.390
I've misspelled that so I can double click over on the right hand side in the outline and put the S
43

44
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.480
on the end there and I'm going to click and drag pins and puts it inside this other collection so we
44

45
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.900
can have nested collections and this is useful because now at any point I can right click on that collection.
45

46
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.220
I've got a series of options and one of them is to select objects.
46

47
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.620
So that will select everything that's within the bowling objects or I could come in two pins for instance
47

48
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.550
and select objects or just deselect the pins if I wanted to.
48

49
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.200
So that is really really useful for organising our scene.
49

50
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.300
And there are quite a few things you could do a collections.
50

51
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.950
This is just an introduction to them.
51

52
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.500
So you can start organizing your work.
52

53
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.880
And now it's time for your challenge.
53

54
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.120
Okay.
54

55
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.120
Your challenge make sure that you have a bowling objects collection that has both the alley and the ball
55

56
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.960
in it.
56

57
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.190
Once you've done that also create a pin collection, nest the pin collection within the bowling objects
57

58
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.510
collection and then finally add your camera and your light to their own collection as well.
58

59
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.610
Pause video and give that a go. Okay everybody, Welcome back. 
59

60
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.280
Let's go and hop on over into blender and create our collections OK.
60

61
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.170
So I'm going to go back to the beginning here so I can go through it step by step.
61

62
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.990
So in this particular case what I'm going to do is I'm going to highlight the ball and our alley.
62

63
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.730
Now I've not hit the camera itself.
63

64
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.420
If I'd done that box just a little bit too large the camera would have also been selected.
64

65
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.110
So I'm going to add those to our bowling objects collections of bowling objects and then once I've done
65

66
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.800
that it's just a matter of adding everything else.
66

67
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.100
So the pins themselves got to be careful not select the camera.
67

68
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.820
I could rotate out and away, But
68

69
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.310
I won't for the moment, I'm going to create a new collection called pins, now here you may have already
69

70
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.560
noticed that the final collection that we need to make we don't actually need to select anything because
70

71
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.650
those are the only two objects currently left in my scene.
71

72
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.430
You may have other objects in there in which case you might want to go ahead and create them but I can
72

73
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.810
just rename this other collection camera and lighting.
73

74
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.390
There we go.
74

75
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.830
So I've got my three scenes.
75

76
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.730
The only thing I haven't done yet is nested pins within bowling objects.
76

77
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.420
And there we go.
77

78
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.820
We've got camera and lighting, our bowling objects and we're going to save my file.
78

79
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.280
Brilliant.
79

80
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.260
So nice straightforward challenge.
80

81
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.390
I do like these type of challenges where it's really easy to get to the end of them but I cannot stress
81

82
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.100
the importance about organization and naming.
82

83
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.400
We've already mentioned naming a couple of times but organization is key as well.
83

84
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.980
You will find that if you create a big project it's very easy to end up with lots and lots and lots
84

85
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.500
of lots of different objects doing different things and then later on when you pick it up perhaps in
85

86
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.330
a week's time you don't know what anything is and where it is and what it's supposed to be doing.
86

87
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.510
And that can really really slow down your productivity.
87

88
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.530
So I would suggest organizing things as you go.
88

89
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.590
So that's it for this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
