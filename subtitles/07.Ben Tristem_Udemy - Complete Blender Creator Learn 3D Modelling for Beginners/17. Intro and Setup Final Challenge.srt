Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,720
Now before I give you your final section challenge this is something that you guys can already make
2

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,420
with the knowledge that you have.
3

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,530
Now you might doubt that with its complexity but it really really is that simple.
4

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,970
This whole church is made up of little blocks I can go and pick them up and literally move them about
5

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,160
you can see here I painstakingly put these together.
6

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,110
Now there are better modelling methods in order to do what you just saw in front of you there. 
7

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,420
However none are quite as therapeutic as stacking blocks on top of one another is going to be a lot
8

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,740
harder to get that aesthetic.
9

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,290
But there is some smoke and mirrors and this is a really important thing.
10

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:56,840
A lot of people when they first start making 3D models go down the route of trying to do too much.
11

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Now if we zoom out look the rest of the world isn't modeled it's just the square.
12

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,850
But from the camera's perspective you don't need to know that that moon in the sky.
13

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,910
I'm just going to I'm going to fly.
14

15
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,810
I'm just gonna walk over there and speed up a little as I go round.
15

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,250
So we have just a plane on the ground and oh what's this ah ha.
16

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,230
How about that our moon is just a circle in the sky place behind.
17

18
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,600
What about the background.
18

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,580
It seems to be blue rather than that horrible gray.
19

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,530
Well let me show you how to change the color of the background in blender.
20

21
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,160
So that's come out control and space.
21

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,730
And if we go down the properties panel you'll see there's a picture of a world and in fact it says world
22

23
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,310
if you hover over it long enough if you click that we've got a color and we can literally change the
23

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,640
background to any color we want.
24

25
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,110
So since it was a night time scene I thought a dark blue would be ideal for it.
25

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,390
Now there's one more file that I want to show you. 
26

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:09,530
And how I'm going to open it I'm going to go to my files and I'm going to find the blender file and
27

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm going to click and drag it in and drop it click open.
28

29
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,300
And there we go.
29

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,410
We've got a rocket.
30

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,670
Let's go and render that and see what it looks like.
31

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,720
Awesome.
32

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,450
Let's go to fully rendered mode.
33

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,960
So once again what you're seeing in front of you here is a very simple shape it's a series of cones
34

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,640
and cylinders stacked on top of one another.
35

36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,810
In fact if you have a look at wireframe you can see that the cone here is stuck inside itself in order
36

37
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,820
to produce that's effects and that's a cylinder here.
37

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,180
And they've just been colored in differently to give us this overall effect.
38

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,390
And I've got these sky bright blue you might think no.
39

40
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,880
If we come out of that there is no sky.
40

41
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,440
It's just the plane in the background.
41

42
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:01,790
So that's another way that you can go and make yourself a background is simply by putting a plane which
42

43
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,410
is just one of the primitives.
43

44
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:11,450
We can go shift an A add a plane in scale it's up color in whatever color we want in this case I'm just
44

45
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,850
going to grab another material that's do oranges and orange sunset in the distance then it's just a
45

46
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,730
matter of rotating it's around I'm going to rotate it around 90 on the axis and then 45 on the Z axis.
46

47
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:31,490
And I think that's all I did actually in order to put it into the appropriate place G not Z shift it
47

48
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,860
forward slightly make it really big.
48

49
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,420
Now go back and we've got an orange background.
49

50
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,910
It's as simple as that to create backgrounds.
50

51
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,470
Remember anything that's not within the border of the camera it doesn't matter if it's not going to
51

52
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,080
be seen then don't waste your time on it.
52

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,960
Focus on the model that you're making all the parts of the model or the parts of the scene rather than
53

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,180
trying to do things that the viewer or what you're going to render at the end of it is never going to
54

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,200
see. Hello everybody and welcome to the challenge.
55

56
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,880
We're going to put our knowledge together in this end of section challenge and I do encourage you to
56

57
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,820
have a look at other students work for inspiration as well.
57

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,310
So start with a simple model and make a couple of different models to practice your skills and a big
58

59
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,010
tip here.
59

60
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,310
Look at the real object and reference material as well that really really helps.
60

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,500
Now before we jump into the challenge let me give you a couple of examples of what you could do.
61

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,420
Here we have a very simple speaker that's sat on my desk in front of me very low poly very simple but
62

63
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,870
it's just to get those skills honed in.
63

64
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,010
Then I decided to put some squares and cylinders together squares some cubes and sentences together.
64

65
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,770
And before you know you've got this lovely tractor next we can go a little bit on from that.
65

66
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,440
I've stacked some cubes together you can see I've gone ahead and made this castle with a couple of hills
66

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,170
around a blue background and some trees.
67

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,140
Very simple very straightforward and they're much like the tractor if you stack a few more of those
68

69
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,130
cylinders and cubes together you can end up with something like this train.
69

70
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,630
Yes this is just manipulating primitives and no other modelling techniques.
70

71
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:21,360
And finally here are another couple of examples to give you an idea of where you could go make yourself
71

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,150
a couple of models basic if you're new to this little bit more advanced if you think you already know
72

73
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,360
blender and remember to share your work over on the forum.
73

74
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,830
So go ahead pause video now and give that's a go. Okay
74

75
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,070
everybody welcome back.
75

76
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,830
Let's go hop on over into blender and see what I came up with.
76

77
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,480
Hello everybody welcome back.
77

78
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,860
OK.
78

79
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,380
So I'm not going to cause myself too much grief by trying to redo that church.
79

80
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,080
I did take over an hour to do with those blobs.
80

81
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,020
But what I am going to do is I like space travel so I'm going to make myself a rocket.
81

82
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,660
So I'm going to do the main body first and I'm going to cheat a little.
82

83
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:09,460
Well now that's the thing I wouldn't say it's cheating that's it's important to get through that.
83

84
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,360
Being efficient is not cheating.
84

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,170
There's a difference.
85

86
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,550
So I've got myself a booster cone there.
86

87
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,170
In fact I'm going to scale that down by point five so it's half the size.
87

88
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,990
Maybe point two, the look from the top.
88

89
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,010
I can't see the grid so I'm going to go over to the plane itself.
89

90
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm going to call it ground so I know what it is good practice to get naming in early.
90

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:44,730
Even I sometimes forget especially when I'm doing you know simple for simple in quotation marks things
91

92
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,550
like this.
92

93
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,540
So let's lower this booster down and I'm going to turn snapping onto do this.
93

94
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,170
So let's gets it says flush on the floor.
94

95
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,160
Perfect.
95

96
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,580
OK.
96

97
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:59,220
I'm going to let them move this across the head duplicate it and move it over here and then look at
97

98
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,550
it from the other angle and just move both of these to one side going to highlight them both duplicate
98

99
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:15,460
them again and move them here and then go into add in a cylinder going to the scale that cylinder down.
99

100
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,450
It's going to be about that big in total now.
100

101
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,130
So if I scaled it by point five that's going to be about right.
101

102
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,980
I think, I'm going to go G Z and just lift it up until it's within.
102

103
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,080
So there we go.
103

104
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:37,980
There's the booster looking good so far thats the lower parts and I'm just going to duplicate and press
104

105
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,450
Z to lock in the Z axis.
105

106
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,850
This is the second part and I can start color coding them now so this is going to be a booster. 
106

107
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,890
So it's going to be a darker color isn't it.
107

108
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:55,610
So let's make it a dark color go to LookDev mode as well so I can see that it's a dark color.
108

109
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,370
ExcelIent, I'm going to call this booster ... nozzle.
109

110
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:08,340
I think a nozzle then I'm going it's just going to select these other three that one at the end and
110

111
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,250
make a link to those materials.
111

112
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:19,710
I could have gone in and manually selected them and I'm going to call this one here rockets white and
112

113
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,380
actually make it a little lighter.
113

114
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,180
And this one I'm going to call it rockets black.
114

115
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:36,010
Now some of you might be thinking Well Mike if you're just using colors why don't use set the boosters
115

116
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,320
and this section to be the same color.
116

117
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,340
And the reason for that is because then I can't just change those things without affecting things that
117

118
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,710
well really they shouldn't affect.
118

119
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:55,900
Now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to scale that cylinder on the Z axis by point of five and
119

120
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,790
G Z lower it down.
120

121
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,830
Now it's not quite clipping to the right place.
121

122
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,100
So going to hold down shift to do a gradual lowering down to about there.
122

123
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,740
And we can see some intersection there so I'm going to go into orthographic view and zoom in a little
123

124
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,660
and go G Z left it up to the right place.
124

125
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,700
Grab this lower one duplicate it G Z.
125

126
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:33,060
I haven't given myself much room to get that right maybe a G Z let's bring that back down
126

127
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,810
okay so this point I want a tapered off but I don't want it going all the way.
127

128
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:51,230
So I'm going to add in a cone and open up the operator panel for the cone.
128

129
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,840
We still want 32 vertices because that's what the cylinder underneath has but note it has
129

130
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:07,730
radius 1 and radius 2 so us at this is point five and then go G Z to lift this thing up aha scale 
130

131
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,030
by 0.5.
131

132
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,810
He said lower it down.
132

133
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,490
We're almost there we just need to align it's a bit better.
133

134
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,690
Here we go.
134

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,540
Starting to look pretty good.
135

136
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,770
Now once again we can take this one here.
136

137
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:33,030
Duplicate it, Go G Z lift it up and then scale that by point five.
137

138
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:41,670
Look at it from the side, scale it by two on the Z axis and then go G Z and lift it.
138

139
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,030
Oh it was right.
139

140
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:49,320
Perfect I'm now going to go G.
140

141
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,560
Z lift it up to there and I'm going to add another cylinder going to duplicate one and just scale it
141

142
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,340
down on the Z axis.
142

143
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,240
By point 1 I think I'll fit in this gap.
143

144
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm going to make this one rocket black and go G Z and lower it down to the right place.
144

145
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,050
She's about there and then I just need to check that it fits properly.
145

146
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,310
Oh it does.
146

147
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,190
Perfect.
147

148
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,010
And I might do the same here.
148

149
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,990
So I'm gonna grab both of these areas go G Z and lift the two way up.
149

150
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,020
Grab this one here.
150

151
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,740
Now I'm starting to repeat myself lots.
151

152
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,350
I think you guys are getting what I'm doing here.
152

153
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,750
So I'm going to fast forward the video now because I'm just going over the same stuff repeatedly getting
153

154
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,140
that sorted.
154

155
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,270
The final thing here is going to be a nozzle on the end and nozzle on the end.
155

156
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,850
Why am I thinking a cone on the end of the nozzle.
156

157
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,940
Okay so let's go ahead.
157

158
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,400
I can't duplicate that because it doesn't have the right end but what I can do is create a new cone
158

159
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,640
K were almost there.
159

160
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:03,860
I'm gonna go for a very sharp cone go and there's a very doddey looking rocket.
160

161
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:11,360
Let's see if we can make these boosters a bit more boosty, I'm going to put these all in a collection
161

162
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,820
called rockets just so it's easy to manage.
162

163
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,040
That's looking good.
163

164
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,560
So all of the rockets together bring back the ground give the ground a material.
164

165
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,530
I'm going to call the material ground.
165

166
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:30,260
I'm going to still make it portray in it's aspect ratio by going to the output properties and changing
166

167
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,440
these around.
167

168
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,780
So this will be 1080 by 1920.
168

169
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,630
There we go.
169

170
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,940
And we can do a quick render just to see how things are looking.
170

171
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,780
Excellent.
171

172
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,600
So the final thing that I'm going to fake the sky is one of the things that can happen with a lighter
172

173
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:53,100
sky which I'm sure some of you have now discovered is it will contribute to the light.
173

174
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,920
So if you just change the background to a bright blue it changes the entire scene which is not great.
174

175
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,630
So I'm going to keep the background a darker color of gray and then we just need a fake sky.
175

176
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,430
So let's go ahead and pop back in.
176

177
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,870
Going to put a plane in rotate it's on X or Y by night.
177

178
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,330
Then rotate by 45 degrees on the Z axis and put it behind the rocket.
178

179
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:26,390
Usually it has to be far enough away that it's not to cast a shadow on it and we'll break the illusion
179

180
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:33,770
and let's call this one sky and I'm going to make this a very light blue and we'll render that out.
180

181
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,610
Awesome.
181

182
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,810
And the great thing is because it's being lit up we've got this lovely fall off across the image as
182

183
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,960
well so it's lighter on one side than the other creating that lovely little gradient on both the ground
183

184
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,670
and the sky element.
184

185
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,380
That's pretty awesome.
185

186
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,760
And it's going to name this sky as well so I know what it is.
186

187
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,750
I really liked how that worked out.
187

188
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,770
Well there we go.
188

189
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:03,890
Just using some very fundamental skills were able to make some quite convincing models straight off
189

190
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,410
the bat.
190

191
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:11,840
And of course the more time you put in you can create some really intricate objects and houses and vehicles
191

192
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,410
just by slapping together primitives and maybe scaling them and stretching them.
192

193
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,020
Okay so there we go.
193

194
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,070
Well done.
194

195
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,730
I'm happy with my rocket here.
195

196
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,450
I hope you're really happy with whatever you've made as well.
196

197
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm really looking forward to seeing them so please do share them over in the discussions and really
197

198
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,510
looking forward to it.
198

199
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:35,230
I can't wait to see what you guys have managed to make up from just primitives and sticking them together.
199

200
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,330
Did you make a castle or a fort perhaps a train a vehicle please do share your work and I'll see you
200

201
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,040
all in the next lecture.
