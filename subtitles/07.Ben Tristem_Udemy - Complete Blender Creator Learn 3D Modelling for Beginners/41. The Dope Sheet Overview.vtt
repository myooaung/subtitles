00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.430
Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.440
In this lecture we're going to have an overview of the dope sheets editor.

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.790
Now this is the type of editor that is going to look incredibly familiar.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.710
If we have a look at the bottom of the screen at the moment we have ourselves the timeline.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.900
Now the timeline is going to look very much like the dope she headed when we get to it.

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.700
Now there are a couple of ways of getting to.

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.350
Eventually we will just modify our view that we've got at the moment.

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.990
However if we go to the very top and click on animation we can go to the animation work space.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.020
We're not currently using this and we can adjust this bottom area.

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.450
Now you may be forgiven for thinking that was another timeline but no this is the dope she Ed..

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.600
So you look at it and go Well hang on a minute let's go back to layout Okay what's going on here.

12
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.330
Well it looks like if we select our items in our scene.

13
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.850
Well what's the difference here.

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.090
We've got circles and squares on their side.

15
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.970
Okay.

16
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.940
Well there is a bit more difference than that's essentially the dope she Ed gives us far more granular

17
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.840
control over what is happening than just the timeline itself.

18
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.100
So let's switch out the timeline ed for the dope sheets switch that's out there.

19
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.040
I'm going to lift this up so we can see a bit more of our scene.

20
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.000
Now you may notice here that these have certain drop downs we can just click on them and they'll go

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.480
down and well we've got a lot of information there you may be wondering what this look is all about.

22
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.890
Well if you remember we named our two main bones that we're using to control our lamp itself.

23
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.270
We've got the look bone which is that circle one there.

24
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.090
Sorry the spare and then the big circle one stem or base one of those two so if we go into Poe's mode

25
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.550
we can select those individually and we can see the name changes accordingly there as well.

26
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.720
And if we shift select both of them then we will also get all of the information and we can drop that

27
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.270
down and see what's happening and where.

28
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.980
Now one of the things you will notice here is that we have orange dots everywhere.

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.040
And these are key frames but we've also got these orange backgrounds and we've also got at the very

30
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.550
top middle clicking to drag around.

31
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.400
We've also got orange dots at the top.

32
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.510
So what do these all mean.

33
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.520
Well let's close the base and look down and start at the very top of the hierarchy.

34
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.310
So in summary something is happening on these frames frame one frame twelve frame eighteen frame twenty

35
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.410
five hex cetera et cetera.

36
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.660
And we can see that was specifically talking about an armature being moved.

37
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.300
Now bear in mind you can animate other things as well not just an armature but we can move objects.

38
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.380
We'll be moving the camera in a bit as well so we will see that under this summary at the same time.

39
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.560
Now we're talking about the armature action and it's specifically referring to two bones that we're

40
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.690
controlling and in this case we're controlling where that control bone is and what its rotation is as

41
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.960
well.

42
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.020
And we can see that in both aspects here.

43
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.080
Now these orange lines are quite clearly an indicator that something is continuing.

44
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.320
And if we have a look let's drill in on the x location of the look which is the sphere just here so

45
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.360
let's only have that one selected.

46
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.830
Now if we look along here we've got an orange continuous line all the way up to 100 and if we left click

47
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.850
and just pull across the top here you'll see that the location the x location doesn't change until that

48
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.760
point.

49
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.240
So to demonstrate that even more if we go to this middle one here which is currently nought point nought

50
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.380
to eight then just change it.

51
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.790
Press the eye key to key that in.

52
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.090
We can see that that continuous change there is now broken.

53
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.470
I'm going to undo that because I don't want to mess up my previous animation.

54
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.560
So that's key.

55
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.460
It gives you a nice overview of what's happening.

56
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.170
And one of the biggest things here is to take away the fact that this is when things are happening.

57
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.030
So one of the things that I really like doing with the dope she is just controlling when things happen.

58
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.170
So for instance if we go ahead and press the space by her to play it and we decide that's okay it takes

59
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.830
far too long to land.

60
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.250
So we go to 1 0 1 what we can then do is minimize the look and actually pull everything back so we can

61
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.770
select the key frames that we want in this case I'm just going to key in the look area and you'll notice

62
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.070
that the top 1 also highlights which would indicate to me that that is the only thing that this top

63
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.520
level on the summary is referring to.

64
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.190
And then I can just press G and move it to a different time so I can have it looking at us sooner then

65
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.770
we can go ahead we can select the base down here and perhaps pull that back as well.

66
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.230
Now let's see what that looks like when we go ahead and play it.

67
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.640
So we've got it jumping up and then it lands much quicker than it did before and that is a far better

68
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.450
experience.

69
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.440
Okay.

70
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.820
So in summary are dope sheets editor allows us to finally control when movements are happening and this

71
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.160
is going to become critical when we start refining our animation over the next couple of lectures to

72
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.010
produce our final animation itself.

73
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.190
The other thing that the vote sheets editor allows us access to is a couple of other views.

74
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.700
For instance if we wanted to make multiple actions this is very important.

75
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.880
If you were having an idle animation you can set that as an idle action and then you could have a walking

76
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.250
animation or a jumping animation and have them as individual actions.

77
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.900
That's a much better set up than having actions spread out as you might have seen before.

78
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.450
Just on one continuous timeline.

79
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.610
We've got the shape key editor and we have some more specialist modes that we can switch the dope sheet

80
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.850
into as well.

81
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.710
But for the moment that concludes our overview of the dope sheets.

82
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.800
Incredibly useful being able to manipulate when things are happening so when those key frames happen.

83
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.240
So that's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
