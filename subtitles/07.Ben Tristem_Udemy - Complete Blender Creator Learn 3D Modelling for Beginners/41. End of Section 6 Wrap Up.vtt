00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.100
Congratulations guys.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.950
This has been a fantastic section and the bunnies you've already shared.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.610
Wow.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.920
Book characters I've seen already.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.280
Thank you for sharing.

6
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.540
And if you haven't done yet if you were a bit shy about sharing your work please don't be.

7
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.730
I love as a teacher seeing how you guys are getting on.

8
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.570
It really inspires me as a teacher and it also inspires students that are not quite at this level yet

9
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.270
in the course to make them carry on as always carrying on is what I want you to do straightaway so hop

10
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.020
on to the next section or there's an alternative and apply the knowledge you've already learnt on models

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.780
we've already done or perhaps something that you have been working on outside of the course.

12
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.590
And remember to share that as well.

13
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.370
I love seeing other things that you guys are doing.

14
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.130
So with that in mind let's hop back on over into blender.
