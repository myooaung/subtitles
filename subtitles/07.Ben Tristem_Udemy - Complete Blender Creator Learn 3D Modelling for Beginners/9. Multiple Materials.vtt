00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.170
Welcome back everybody in this lecture.
1

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.890
We are going to explore giving our surfaces of our objects different materials as you can see here.
2

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.890
Each one of these faces is colored in differently.
3

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.960
And we've done that by assigning different materials to each face.
4

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.330
Let's go hop on over into blender and find out some more.
5

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.830
Okay everybody Welcome back first of all.
6

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.430
Let's go ahead and go to our cube.
7

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.260
Make sure it's selected and go to the properties panel got to make this area wider because we're going
8

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.090
to actually need to see what's going on in here.
9

10
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.750
Now if we go down on our materials as you've experienced before when we've colored in the whole object,
10

11
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.100
we can go down to the material properties and then we can name this material. 
11

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.870
Now I'm going to name this material straightaway red and change the color of it to red.
12

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.180
Why can't we see anything here.
13

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.500
Well we need change our rendered mode it's currently set to solid.
14

15
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.790
I'm going to switch across to lookdev and you can also do that we experience the pie menu in the last
15

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.440
lecture you can presss the Z key and you can see there two four six and eight will turn on our various shading
16

17
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.670
options in this case and in the press 2 and there we go we've changed it to lookdev we can see what's
17

18
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.200
going on now depending on what this original material was we'll be the one that's assigned to the entire
18

19
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.000
object by default.
19

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.510
Now if we go ahead and create a new cube object and let's move this over here select that cube object
20

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.530
it doesn't have any default materials assigned to it we can use the dropdown and select red from it
21

22
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.090
or we can create a new material slots however unless we remove the red from it and then add a new material
22

23
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.170
in, if we go ahead now and add another material noticed this object now has two material slots if I
23

24
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.680
change this bottom one if I go Oh no I wanted it red notice that because this one was on top and it
24

25
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.840
was assigned to the object first It is therefore the default color for all of the faces on our model.
25

26
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.440
Now if we go ahead to the red we can actually lift it up in this material slot list and that's the up
26

27
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.060
and down arrow just here.
27

28
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.880
But notice lifting it up doesn't color in the entire model red we'd have to remove the other material
28

29
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.720
in order to do that.
29

30
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.750
Now I'm going to leave this other one on the side as a demonstration in a moment but let's go back to
30

31
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.210
our main one in the center of the scene and I'm going to press the tab key and go into edit mode and
31

32
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.080
you'll notice that when we do that in the materials we have assign, select and deselect.
32

33
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.490
That's pretty awesome.
33

34
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.120
That means we can assign the material to our object specifically to the face of our objects as well.
34

35
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.700
So I'm gonna make the material slots a little larger and I'm going to add in another three materials
35

36
00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.170
I've hit the plus key three times I want to go ahead to this top one here creating new material to go
36

37
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.780
in that material slot and call that material yellow I'm gonna go to the next one click the plus to create
37

38
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.080
new material and I'm going to call this one blue and then finally for this last one what I'm going
38

39
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.750
to do is I'm going to start with the red so let's say there's some properties of the red material that
39

40
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.330
I want to keep and I don't want to have to tweak anything but maybe the color or assign a different
40

41
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.640
texture to it later on in the course.
41

42
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.820
So what I can do here is I can click the dropdown select an already existing material in this case red
42

43
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.770
and we can see straight away that we've got Red assigned now if we go ahead and change this red here
43

44
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.280
what I want you to be aware of is not only does it change the default color but anything else that also
44

45
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.340
has that color assigned so do be careful.
45

46
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.590
Not only does this object have four material slots two of them are actually just the same material in
46

47
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.350
general you probably wouldn't want that.
47

48
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.970
Now if you notice next to Red let's inherit the properties of red and then change it.
48

49
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.850
Now there is a warning just here.
49

50
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.160
We can see next to the word red to the right of this.
50

51
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.220
We have the number three that means there are three users of this material it just happens to be that
51

52
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.130
two of them of the same cube.
52

53
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.880
And then this other cube is also using it but it's grayed out at the moment.
53

54
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.340
And the reason why it's grayed out is because you cannot make this change whilst we're in edit mode.
54

55
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.410
If I was to come out of edit mode back into object mode you'll need your cursor over in the 3D window
55

56
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.860
to do that.
56

57
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.270
If you're pressing tab whilst your cursor is anywhere else it won't work.
57

58
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.420
So make sure you're over the 3D window when you hit that key and then click on that number three.
58

59
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.390
We see that it's changed the name of that material to red 0 0 1.
59

60
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.510
Now if we go ahead and tweak the color it's his own individual color pretty awesome and we can call
60

61
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.850
that green.
61

62
00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.110
Now the reason why you might want to do that is if you set something up perhaps you'd tweak some of
62

63
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.640
these settings down here and you'd light those settings but you wanted to try it with a different color
63

64
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.770
than you would want to copy that material's properties and then just change it.
64

65
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.110
So it's unique and that's what I'd recommend if you are creating a new object.
65

66
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.780
So if you need to tweak the materials on another object it doesn't necessarily alter.
66

67
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.180
Now of course if you planned out your scene perfectly you might not need to do that you know that certain
67

68
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.340
materials are shared everywhere but we're only dealing with basic shades and colors at the moment so
68

69
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.130
it shouldn't be too much.
69

70
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.430
OK.
70

71
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.190
So let's go back into edit mode of this cube and with one of the faces selected we're going to first
71

72
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.210
of all select the face.
72

73
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:49.130
Notice that it is highlighted red at the top if I go ahead and click yellow and then click assign we
73

74
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.970
see that that face has has changed which is pretty awesome.
74

75
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.970
Very useful.
75

76
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.420
I'm going to also change it to yellow so we can really see what's going on there and what we can also
76

77
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.000
do here's click another face.
77

78
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.130
Scroll back up.
78

79
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.520
Let's select the blue assign that and I'm also going to change the color.
79

80
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.200
And it's as simple as that to start assigning different materials we see here if I click on green and
80

81
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.660
assign it switches but do bear in mind if you click on another one it will switch back to whatever that
81

82
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.150
material is because it's ready to edit that material.
82

83
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.030
Now what you can do here is we can select all of the faces that are currently using the red material
83

84
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.740
so I'll go ahead and click on select.
84

85
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.200
You'll see that they're all highlighted and then I can change them all to a different material that
85

86
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.500
is incredibly useful if we go over to this particular object and go into edit mode.
86

87
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.840
Notice that it doesn't have any of those additional material slots but we can switch this out for one
87

88
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.740
of the other ones pretty useful hey let's say that none of our objects now use blue.
88

89
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.130
So let's switch blue out for red on this object and have we got blue in this one.
89

90
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.330
Yes.
90

91
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.350
So let's go over to this object.
91

92
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:11.910
Select blue and change it to green, so now blue doesn't have any users in our entire scene but it's still
92

93
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.340
assigned to this object.
93

94
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.100
If I were to go ahead and remove it from this object it seems to have disappeared completely.
94

95
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.540
But don't worry it's still there.
95

96
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.160
You haven't lost that but this is very important notice.
96

97
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.140
It's got a zero next to it.
97

98
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.530
That means that no users in Blender use this material and you will see this zero crop up in all other
98

99
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.060
places within blender as well.
99

100
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.900
What this means is if I go ahead and save my work so let's do this now as a real example and I'll call
100

101
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:49.880
this 8 material lost and you can probably guess by the name what's going to happen now.
101

102
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.280
At the moment it is still there blue material.
102

103
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.480
If I go file and revert we shall revert to the save state.
103

104
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.710
What we will find is that the blue is no longer there.
104

105
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.230
In fact it is gone completely.
105

106
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:09.480
Now that happened to be not just a color adjustment but something we'd spent tens of minutes maybe even
106

107
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.300
an hour or two crafting a very complex material but you'd never assigned it to anything or you deleted
107

108
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.830
the objects it was assigned to save your file and your computer crashed and you reloaded it back up
108

109
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.400
you would have likely lost the material at that point.
109

110
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.370
So do bear in mind anything with a zero next to it.
110

111
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.570
It may be problematic.
111

112
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.220
So I'm going to go ahead here and these greens are going to swap them out for the yellow material which
112

113
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.750
should mean that there's zero next to the green.
113

114
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.660
Perfect.
114

115
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.870
Okay.
115

116
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:43.850
If I go into edit mode and then add new material slots green before I go and get rid of it.
116

117
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.660
Notice this little paper object like a corner of a piece of paper.
117

118
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:56.630
If we click on that it says save this data block even if it has no users now it means if I remove this
118

119
00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:04.120
material which we can't do in edit mode if I remove that material from the material slot if we now have
119

120
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.860
a look at that material it's got an F next to it which means it has a fake user.
120

121
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.510
But most importantly it's not going to disappear at any point.
121

122
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:19.420
So if you are playing with multiple materials within blender but they're not necessarily all assigned
122

123
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.490
to any objects.
123

124
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:25.930
That's how you make sure they stay in your save file when you go ahead and save and come back to that
124

125
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:26.910
project later.
125

126
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.030
Wow okay.
126

127
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.380
So we've taken in lots to do with materials they're mainly just adding different materials into different
127

128
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.980
materials slots assigning different faces.
128

129
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:43.150
And now it's time for a quick challenge. Okay so it's challenge time I'd like it to go ahead and create
129

130
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.130
multiple materials assigning them to a single mesh object.
130

131
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.110
Now I'm going to assign them to the model that I made in the extruded exercise earlier.
131

132
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.700
So I will end up with a model that looks like this is just two main materials there a roof and a wall
132

133
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.450
material.
133

134
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:06.240
But as you can see it really does make the model come alive pause a video now and give it a go. Okay
134

135
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.480
everybody Welcome back.
135

136
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.290
Let's go ahead now and assign multiple materials.
136

137
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.690
Okay everybody Welcome back.
137

138
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.700
I am going to go ahead and find one of my previous files rather than creating something new.
138

139
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.020
I'm going to go over into open recent.
139

140
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.860
I'm going to go into my church that I built earlier and when i am in
140

141
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.980
edit mode on this.
141

142
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.760
So I am already in edit mode.
142

143
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.410
I'm going to go to my materials that have to do in that order and we've got a couple of options here.
143

144
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.950
So I'm gonna bring this open we've got our first material.
144

145
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.920
Call that wll since the majority of the surfaces of this church are going to be a wall.
145

146
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.220
And then I need another material I'm going to call this one roof.
146

147
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:52.390
I'm gonna make it slightly darker in its color so let's go for a gray, a dark gray.
147

148
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.780
I'm gonna go ahead and select the roof tiles.
148

149
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.190
I want to be this color shouldn't take too long to do as we whizz round.
149

150
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.260
Perfect.
150

151
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.090
And I'm going to assign those colors.
151

152
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:08.250
I'm gonna make sure I mean lookdev mode I'm gonna use the radio dial that we saw earlier and with the
152

153
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:13.410
Z key I'm gonna change it to lookdev so I can just see the color differences and I'm looking at it
153

154
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.770
going OK.
154

155
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.580
I didn't have the roof selected when I was doing those assigns.
155

156
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.400
Now I have I can see the difference.
156

157
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.120
Excellent.
157

158
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.150
Now I don't quite like the wall color here.
158

159
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.810
I'm going to make it more of a yellowy brick and I'll make that a little lighter as well.
159

160
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:35.430
Just need to fiddle around here until I get roughly the right color that looks much better.
160

161
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:41.540
And as you can see it doesn't take much and that changes the whole appearance of the building straight away.
161

162
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.560
We know roughly by looking at it that it was probably a church or a building like a church.
162

163
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:52.170
But until we put the roof colors on it you're like yes yes it definitely is.
163

164
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:58.320
Now of course this is a very simple very very low polygon model and I would certainly want to add some
164

165
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.860
tiny details in here if I wanted to flesh this out but if I wanted a a rough object that I could just
165

166
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.570
add into my scene this is four metres wide by two metres tall.
166

167
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.050
If we look from the front or not quite two metres tall would be all the way up here.
167

168
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.110
So it is quite a small church.
168

169
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:24.060
So I might scale it by maybe two and just apply that scale and now have a look at it from unease.
169

170
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.760
Definitely see the side.
170

171
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.180
So it is that way.
171

172
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:27.900
So here we go.
172

173
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.810
Now we got two metres tall being about midway up here which is which is roughly right.
173

174
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.580
So there we go.
174

175
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.550
That's now a small church of the right size.
175

176
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.700
So if you were to go and import that into a game engine or use it in other places in your scene it's going
176

177
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.440
to be more representative and more in scale with most other objects.
177

178
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:54.600
If we can go in and add ourselves a new mesh cube for instance I'm going to move it out this cube is
178

179
00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.480
two metres tall something would go G Y and move along this axis here and I'll go G Z one to lift it up
179

180
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:07.110
and then I'm just gonna make it a little narrower as well so I'm going to focus in on our cube here
180

181
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:15.030
and not adjust the heights I'm going to scale it and go shift Z to say not the height not the z axis
181

182
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.770
and then go point five by half. There you go.
182

183
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.770
Soit's one metre by one metres roughly the space a person would take up and we can see here that
183

184
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.210
they would pass through about here.
184

185
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:31.840
So yes it is a small building but it's representative and is a more accurate size now than it was before.
185

186
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.250
But how did you guys get on.
186

187
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.980
You know what.
187

188
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:43.050
Before I finish off here I'm going to colour in this a slightly pinky colour to represent a person there we go.
188

189
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.820
Hey Hey!
189

190
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.330
Excellent.
190

191
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:50.520
How did you guys get on looking forward to seeing what you've gone ahead and coloured in and we're getting
191

192
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.840
ready now for our mid section challenge where you're going to be able to put all of this stuff together
192

193
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.730
please share what you've done over and the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
