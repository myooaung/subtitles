00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,780
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to look at texture projection and how and

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,920
all the different ways that you could map a texture to a model in blender.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,000
So there are lots of ways many many options of how to map a texture to a model.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,870
And they're incredible and super useful especially when prototyping because we can slap a texture on

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,070
a model without having to worry about UVA unwrapping it and everything else.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,740
And that can be a real great thing to do if you're rapidly prototyping and trying out different textures

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,630
on different models to see how they affect one another.

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,400
However ultimately if you're exporting to a game you will need to use UVA mapping.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,910
So even though we can do everything that we need within blender and if you're staying in Blender that's

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,780
great.

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,170
However if we're exporting to any other program the other program needs to know exactly how we're going

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,000
to map or how it is going to map a texture to its model and any way of doing that is with the UVA mapping.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Now you can use the others.

14
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,440
That's one of the things that we'll have a look at later on because once you've got a texture on your

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,310
model you can then bake that texture from what you can see on the screen over to an image so you can

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:25,550
have the option of using any of the other texturing methods and then bake the result down to a u v map.

17
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,020
And that's incredibly powerful and quite liberating to be quite honest.

18
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,410
Now you're using map and what that means.

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,670
We'll discuss that in the upcoming lecture.

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,940
But I'd like to show you now using the cube example where we were playing about with the node wrangler.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,900
I'd like to show you how the different projection methods can actually affect your your overall texture

22
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,550
and the appearance of your model.

23
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,910
And for that of course you'll need to hop on over into blender.

24
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,010
Okay.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,630
So over in Blender.

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,710
We've got quite a complex node set up here.

27
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,460
I'm gonna delete that material and just start a new material with a basic texture on it.

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,140
So we're not worried about anything else.

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,430
Now you could see there how quick that was to actually get that up and running.

30
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,560
And again if I go to the dropdown next to new because I haven't shot blender down it hasn't lost any

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,580
of these bits of information so I can come in and I can go and grab the albino.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,010
That's what I want.

33
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,580
And there we go.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:29,630
It gets applied to the model so there are a couple of areas that we want to look at here that all this

35
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,450
side so that to do with these three here we briefly touched the fact that you can move your texture

36
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,300
around we can change the scale etc. But we can play with the texture coordinate that gives us some interesting

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,980
results but also over on the texture itself.

38
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,760
This node here with the orange top we've got a couple works as flats here.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,710
We've got a couple of projection types and I'll show you more about that in a moment if we might need

40
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,300
a another object in our scene.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,120
So if the mouse up in the 3D viewport look a shift they add something a little bit more interesting

42
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,830
it will come you ve unwrapped for us they all do.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,850
So I'm just going to move that over to one side with it selected.

44
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,880
I'm gonna go to the materials drop down in the shade of view and I should be able to attach material

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,730
0 0 1.

46
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,050
And there we go.

47
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:25,270
So that looks a mess on here looks awesome on the cube which is you know pretty understandable.

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,400
Even though that's you v unwrapped I think we might be able to do better and with another objects in

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,800
our scene I am going to add another object let's just add a cylinder cylinder would be quite good.

50
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,440
Let's go g and shift that out and assign it the same material then we can see how different materials

51
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,360
get affected in different ways.

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,930
And all of these have you v maps on them.

53
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,770
That's why it's able to map to it really well.

54
00:03:51,770 --> 00:04:00,050
And look we're using a u v coordinate a texture corner in order to place the texture onto our model.

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,030
Now we have this mapping node here.

56
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,450
I'm gonna go down to the scale and bump that up to 5.

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:13,730
I think that's a nice level of detail that we can play with and see what is actually happening now generated

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,790
an object will often give near identical results.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,290
This is a great start.

60
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,380
If you've not yet you've unwrapped your model.

61
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:31,430
So if we go to generate it and pop it into vector we get a different result coming out and we can see

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,030
that we've got lines coming down when anything's vertical looks like hits.

63
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,840
And so the textures all stretch to infinity down the edge and works on the tops and bottoms.

64
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,170
I'll explain that in more detail in a moment.

65
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,550
If we select normal I've almost never used this one.

66
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,390
It's not going to give us a great results u v if it's EUV unwraps.

67
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,300
This will work it is not it won't.

68
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,460
In fact we can force one of these to not be you v maps anymore with the cylinder selected.

69
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,760
Let's do it to the cylinder.

70
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,190
We need to come down not to the object properties but down here to the mesh data properties and then

71
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,140
under U V maps I can delete the U V map it's currently got.

72
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,800
So with u v map highlighted I'm just going to press the delete key and it can't map the texture anymore

73
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,560
on this model it doesn't know how to.

74
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,230
If you select t u v and that's the sort of result you will get if you've not unwrapped your model.

75
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,980
But now we can use generated pop that's on and we get the results we can use objects and we'll get a

76
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,960
different result but very very similar.

77
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,800
We can use the camera camera and window will be nearly identical they have different scales to them

78
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,580
but they will be literally a projection from our viewpoint or rather the camera's viewpoint in this

79
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,400
case directly on our model which results in when we move round the texture not moving you can see the

80
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,850
scaling is just a bit off here so we set this back down maybe 2.5 we can really see that the texture

81
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:11,300
really just stays in one position is almost as if these are cutouts and windows through to the texture

82
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,390
behind all of this slot and we'll find if we select window and do the same we end up with exactly the

83
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,790
same but this time the texture is scaled a little differently we go.

84
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,940
And in fact is a little bit squashed as well by the looks of it.

85
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,880
Finally reflection is very interesting.

86
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,810
It's as if things are being reflected off the outside world and these have all got they use this in

87
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,900
general though I've not found this one to be particularly useful as as you can see here can result in

88
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,710
quite a mess.

89
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,080
So if you didn't have a u v map object or generated are two to try.

90
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,450
I'm going to plug in generated into our vector component of mapping it where we could remove that altogether

91
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,930
let's remove it altogether to keep everything nice and simple and plug the generated node output sockets

92
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,650
into the vector input socket.

93
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,760
OK so let's look at this projection.

94
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,970
Len go through these options here.

95
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,180
Linear closest.

96
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,410
That's just the interpolation.

97
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:18,830
So if you've got a particular texture that you're having to zoom in on is going to use a certain type

98
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:26,280
of filtering in order to kind of make it not as blur as it might otherwise be flat.

99
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,560
Now this is where it starts to get interesting.

100
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:38,330
What's really happening here is the image or texture is it being projected onto our model from above.

101
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,050
That's what flat means in this particular case.

102
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:48,840
So if I press seven on the number pad to make the view off the graphic we can see that this is absolutely

103
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,170
right.

104
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:56,700
If I grab my cylinder and move it we can see we can align it up and it's pretty much perfect in terms

105
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,900
of how its test relates with one one another.

106
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,200
And that's because it's being projected from above.

107
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:10,710
But the problem is when you're projecting onto something from above as the edges curve away what you

108
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,650
get is the texture stretching.

109
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,150
And eventually when it reaches a certain point the texture.

110
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,580
In fact when it's exactly vertical the texture can only repeat whatever the edge pixel is.

111
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,560
So whatever the individual pixel is right here on the edge.

112
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,320
Notice that it's blurry.

113
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,710
So we won't know the true color but that's being stretched down the entire side.

114
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:41,490
In fact if we play with these options there we go closest even though it's not as blur is it's a bit

115
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,240
more pixilated.

116
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,820
We know exactly what color the stripes are going down.

117
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,210
So playing with a sometimes will get you a different result and maybe a smoother one.

118
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,780
And to be quite honest I like closest something and leave it on.

119
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,540
It's more true to nature what you see is what you get with that so how can we solve this.

120
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,820
Well instead of flat if we imagine that we had a box and on each side of the box including the top and

121
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:14,340
the bottom was a projector projecting the image onto our model and that's what box will do.

122
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,590
Now that is incredibly useful.

123
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,590
Look at that straight away we've got ourselves some models.

124
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,440
Now bear in mind that the cylinder is not usually unwrapped at all.

125
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,880
That's a very nice texture being applied.

126
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:35,880
I would happily just put that in the scene as perhaps one of my pillars for the church in fact what

127
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,500
we could go ahead and just you know cheekily do is scale that up.

128
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,150
But I would do that in edit mode.

129
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:51,970
I'd grab the top bit here and go GZ maybe five and then we go we've got ourselves some extra geometry

130
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,790
did I extrude that.

131
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,490
No there we go.

132
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:01,000
I need to tap backwards and forwards and this is a potential problem here we've got the texture but

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,120
it's stretched.

134
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,760
So if we brought back our mapping node we'd be able to sort that's out.

135
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:13,690
So let's go ahead and search for mapping and drag it over the connection and it will join it in for

136
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,370
us and then we can come in with the scale on the z axis.

137
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,020
I don't know point five.

138
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,530
Now bear in mind this is a shared material so it's going to change all of the others as well.

139
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:26,780
Okay.

140
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,780
So it looks like that's going to be the one.

141
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,310
But look here this is where repeat comes in.

142
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,640
We do want it repeated up and down our model.

143
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,090
And interestingly it's not actually repeating.

144
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:45,080
I felt that was a bit weird Hello everybody and welcome back.

145
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,970
This is Mike from just the near future just stepping in here.

146
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,860
You know we had this issue here with the texture not mapping properly.

147
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,080
That's actually a result of this touch the top one here.

148
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,740
There's no interpolation.

149
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,410
So for some reason it won't repeat as we've got it here.

150
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,900
It were as you repeat the texture.

151
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,790
So we have to change that from closest linear will bring everything back cubic.

152
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,890
Does that bring everything back or does that play silly.

153
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,210
No cubic works.

154
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,910
And I said probably smart will work as well.

155
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,680
Excellent.

156
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,450
So that's how we go ahead and sort that out and of course that's going to be necessary in order to make

157
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,420
sure that things fit as they do serve.

158
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,220
Now scale.

159
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,970
That's all we've got here.

160
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,940
We've got it on object.

161
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,360
Let's put it on.

162
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:40,230
Generated these big easy this ones now all stretched out whereas objects isn't stretched out as much.

163
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,630
She's really useful.

164
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,720
If I turn up the scale so type in a smaller number.

165
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,130
Yeah that looks a lot better.

166
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,640
And I'm going to turn off the blender.

167
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,060
Thanks.

168
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:55,720
I don't think it's needed too much on our on our pillow just here and there we go.

169
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,380
So that's the solution to the model's going black is if you're using closest then it will do this.

170
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,030
Unfortunately there's no way around it.

171
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,720
Okay.

172
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,030
It.

173
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,170
I'll pass you back now to past me.

174
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,580
Okay so that does cause a tiny bit of stretching on the side.

175
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:19,820
So that's just something to bear in mind and we'll look at how to sort that type of thing out later

176
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,220
on.

177
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,980
If we put objects in instead we get a similar effect.

178
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,360
No we get this projected in a very weird manner.

179
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,720
Oh that's bizarre.

180
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,100
Others have not seen it work like that before.

181
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,700
Let's just change shading modes for a moment.

182
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,750
No it is being projected in a very weird way.

183
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,050
OK.

184
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,830
Wow that's that's an interesting results.

185
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,230
So that wouldn't be the correct way of mapping it in this particular case I'd go back to generated and

186
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,230
I'll deal with the stretching with a mapping node if we need to.

187
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,080
Now the final thing I wanted to look at was the color space.

188
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,810
Now this is something depending on the type of texture you use.

189
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:04,010
You need to remember to set up otherwise your textures won't work as you'd expect them to.

190
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:11,020
So currently we're in s RG B which is color basically but we've got loads of other options here.

191
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,270
Now I will remind you when it comes to using them.

192
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,270
But if you're not using something that's color in general you should set it to non color.

193
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,100
Now it will obviously look weird in this case because it's supposed to be color but if you don't show

194
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,860
your normal maps and your height maps won't necessarily work as you'd expect them to because blender

195
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,400
will be interpreting it as a color image if it's set to be color.

196
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,670
Okay.

197
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:44,750
So before we wrap up I have totally glossed over blend blend is pretty awesome.

198
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,080
It's not going to work too well with this texture.

199
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:53,240
It works really well with things like moss and rock that don't have rigid edges.

200
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,860
However this will also show how blurry things can get.

201
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,410
So fortunately our texture lines up perfectly with everything on our cube.

202
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,730
However if we increase the blend what it tries to do is blend between two joins.

203
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,930
Now it's going to work best on our Suzanne head.

204
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,660
So if I change the blend there you can see that it's changing how the texture is applied and blending

205
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,920
it with another texture because of the uniform nature of this particular texture.

206
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,650
It's not going to make any real improvements.

207
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,870
However if you have something without direction or lines on it can help blur edges of textures so you

208
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,410
don't get any sharp seams between the two.

209
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
I mean I'm not sure of that looks any better with the blend turned up and down.

210
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,200
I think it does just a little there's a harsh edge.

211
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:53,060
Here's a here's an example of it anyway we've got this harsh edge running around here.

212
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:59,810
If I increase the blend amounts it does make it a lot more palatable not so contrasting.

213
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,340
So it's harder to see.

214
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,680
So if you're at a distance like this you'd be absolutely fine.

215
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,330
Okay so that goes ahead and covers our texture mapping and projection.

216
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,850
The combination of these two and if you need it the mapping node as well will enable you to make the

217
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,160
most out of your textures remember you just experiment with these and have fun.

218
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,650
It's very easy to get yourself in a pickle if you're not careful so don't be scared of using the Undo

219
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,320
key.

220
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,500
But now is the time to practice whilst we've got some basic models in front of us just slapping the

221
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,680
texture on seeing what all of these levers do.

222
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,020
Just playing with it and having fun occasionally you're not going to get a desirable result sometimes

223
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,400
you'll get something that you didn't even expect or is exactly what you wanted.

224
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,530
So if you're playing around with this now I suggest you go away.

225
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,290
Spend the next 10 or 15 minutes just playing with different ways of linking up the texture coordinates

226
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,450
make sure you link all of these via vector by the way otherwise it won't pass the information through

227
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,230
properly.

228
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:10,710
But playing with your texture settings playing with your mapping you know what does rotating do does

229
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,460
it add anything useful to your particular model.

230
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,850
I doubt in this case rotation will do anything useful.

231
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,000
However scale is bound to be useful.

232
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,940
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
