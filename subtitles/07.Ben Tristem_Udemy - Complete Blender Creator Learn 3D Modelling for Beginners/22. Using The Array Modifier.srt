Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,900
In this lecture we are going to use the array modifier in order to make these steps.
2

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,270
There is in fact only one step here and it's repeated several times.
3

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,950
You can also see there's some other things that we need to watch out for as these steps are pushing
4

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:27,410
through our railings and we don't want that to happen as all but over into a blender and find out more.
5

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,690
Okay everybody Welcome back.
6

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,950
The first thing that I wanted to do before we do anything else here is I'm going to rename my cube.
7

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,270
This is this hasn't been a cube for a very long time.
8

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,570
I hope some of you have been screaming at the screen saying Mike you haven't even named your pyramid
9

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,610
yet please name it.
10

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,030
And I probably think you have already mentioned that.
11

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,850
But here we go.
12

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,200
I've renamed my pyramid.
13

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,270
I'm just going to go ahead and make sure I save that appropriately.
14

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,660
And now that that's saved we can go ahead and play with the array modify now instead of playing with
15

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,620
it in here.
16

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,380
I'm gonna go ahead and create myself a new blend file that we can hop back to in a bit.
17

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,630
Okay.
18

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,880
So with our cube here I am going to just duplicate the cube and move along the X axis.
19

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,910
So it's just over to the side. Lets start off with this cube and go to the wrench or spanner icon I'm
20

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,220
going to make this column just a little wider.
21

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,860
Now once we're in this area we can add a modifier.
22

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,010
Now the great thing about modifiers is they modify what you have in front of you in a non-destructive
23

24
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,880
way.
24

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,130
As we see that it's a procedural operation or effect to the active objects.
25

26
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,810
In this case we're going to go to generating additional geometry using the array modifier.
26

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,190
And what this has done is it's added in another cube as we can see here the count says 2 so there's
27

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,980
two of them.
28

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,890
The original one and the one that's being generated and we can increase that number let's say to six
29

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,160
and then we have underneath a constant offsets or relative offsets.
30

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,140
Now relative offset takes into account the size of the cube.
31

32
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,650
So if we put one in the X direction and one in the Z direction it will step up like a series of stairs.
32

33
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,840
If we have a constant offset and have a 1 and 1 you'll see it looks significantly different.
33

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,610
And the reason for that is the cubes are two meters by two meters.
34

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,860
So relative is great when you need to repeat an object over and over again and constant is great when
35

36
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,780
you've got to fit them into a certain space.
36

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,380
Speaking of fitting them in and we'll get to these settings later on in the course we also have a couple
37

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:39,640
of types so we can fit an array around curve we can fit them around a certain length as well which is
38

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,120
also incredibly useful.
39

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,470
I'm going to leave it is relative offset for the moment and turn off constant.
40

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,570
As you can see you can have more than one turned on.
41

42
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,970
Finally you can have something actually offset with another object.
42

43
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,640
And that's really useful for having curves and spirals and once again we'll get to that later on.
43

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,930
So now that I have the array here it's not real.
44

45
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,280
That's the important thing to bear in mind if we go ahead and delete the array.
45

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,660
Everything goes and let's undo that for a moment if we decide to apply the array then it becomes real
46

47
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,960
geometry and it's editable but we've lost the flexibility of it being part of a modifier.
47

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,870
So we can't quickly modify it anymore.
48

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,820
There are pros and cons to doing this.
49

50
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,270
In you'll experience those pros and cons as we start using the modifiers more and more for the moment
50

51
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:42,820
what's all the device that you do is only apply modify if it is necessary if it is not necessary leave
51

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,400
it as a modifier because it gives you the options later on to go back and edit the modifier and create
52

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,560
new geometry and easily edit your models.
53

54
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:59,260
The final thing that I wanted to show you is if we want to use the modifier again on another cube in
54

55
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,120
this case the one that we duplicated earlier we can go ahead and select the cube or the object we
55

56
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,890
want to inherit.
56

57
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,290
Let's try something else.
57

58
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,640
Let's add in Suzanne the monkey and move her along the X axis.
58

59
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,350
There we go.
59

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,860
And now I want to shift select the objects I want to inherit modifiers from I can't just pick a single
60

61
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,960
modifier if there were more than one
61

62
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,150
applied to our cube.
62

63
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,200
Suzanne would inherit that as well.
63

64
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,160
But if you've spent some time tweaking and setting up some settings in an array modifier and you want
64

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,870
to reuse that it would be silly to have to type all of that information again.
65

66
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,530
So what we can do is select them like we have done here so the one we want or ones we want to inherit
66

67
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,470
the modifiers are selected first and then we active selected as the one we want to inherit the modifiers
67

68
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,330
from we can then go control
68

69
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,370
and L, we will see this a couple of times throughout the course where we need to grab something really
69

70
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,620
quickly from another model and then we can go ahead and grab the modifier.
70

71
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,100
So we're going to make links and copy those modifiers over.
71

72
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,610
Now once we've done that if we go back to our original and change it it does not cascade down it doesn't
72

73
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,960
inherit them anymore.
73

74
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,320
It just inherits the modifier as it was at the time one final thing to touch on here is that modifiers
74

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,780
in general can be affected by UN applied transforms.
75

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,390
So if you have scaled rotated anything do bear that in mind when you go ahead and use a modifier that
76

77
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,370
it may change depending on what that modifier is and how you're using it.
77

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,300
It will vary as I say from modifier to modifier.
78

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,100
In this case the array modified can actually be affected by any unapplied transform so make sure that
79

80
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,530
you apply them to avoid any undesirable effects.
80

81
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,740
And with that it's time for your challenge okay.
81

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,160
Challenge time, its time to create those steps.
82

83
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,800
So using an array modify creates smaller steps leading all the way to the top of the pyramid.
83

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,350
Now I recommend half metre, quarter metre or even eighth meter height steps.
84

85
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,690
Just makes it a lot easier to do the numbers all the way to the top.
85

86
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,920
Fix any holes left in your model you may find after you put the steps all in the either of the top all
86

87
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,990
the bottoms align aligned quite right.
87

88
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,320
So just fix that up at the end.
88

89
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,990
Puase the video now and give that a go. Okay everybody welcome back.
89

90
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,170
Let's hop over into blender and create some steps.
90

91
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,140
Hello everybody and welcome back.
91

92
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,070
So in front of us we've got our pyramid.
92

93
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,460
It could do with some steps.
93

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,810
Now I know these big steps are approx.
94

95
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,140
Well they are one meter high.
95

96
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm going to try half meter steps going up and I can just add in a new cube and scale it not on the
96

97
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,930
Y axis which is useful because it would be correct by point two five.
97

98
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,730
Now it's half a metre tall and I'm going to move on the Z axis by 10.
98

99
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,770
Excellent.
99

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:10,050
And then I probably need to lift it up by let's have a look let's just move it by
100

101
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,340
eye initially is going to be point two five isn't it nought point two five.
101

102
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,850
So there we go.
102

103
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,510
We've got our step in an appropriate place and we're almost ready to use the array modifier on it.
103

104
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,190
One of the things that I noticed when showing you guys earlier is that these two ends are pushing through
104

105
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,670
so I'm gonna make sure with those ends selected they are moved in.
105

106
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,500
So snapping is a brilliant option here I'm going to snap to face the press G to move that and snap it
106

107
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,560
to this face.
107

108
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,420
Of course locking it to in this case is local Z axis.
108

109
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,830
I was not expecting that.
109

110
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,730
There we go.
110

111
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,790
Of course here upon reflection I've just left it with the transform orientation set to normal as we
111

112
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,090
can see at the top here.
112

113
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,620
so G Z,
113

114
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,830
There we go.
114

115
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,430
Perfect.
115

116
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,340
And we can check in wireframe mode that is in fact where we would want it to be and we can even turn
116

117
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,700
on transparency to see it's perfectly lined up.
117

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,860
Okay so that's a great start.
118

119
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,860
The next thing we now need to do is go to our array modifier.
119

120
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:20,680
So let's add array modifier in, it looks like we're going to be moving negative 1 and up 1.
120

121
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,630
Here we go.
121

122
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,310
And now we just need to ooop all the way up.
122

123
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,410
Okay.
123

124
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,770
It looks like I'm gonna have that many.
124

125
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,710
So 16 in total.
125

126
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,230
And let's have a look around our model.
126

127
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,220
Now I think we could actually probably do more steps up there so I can tweak that in a moment.
127

128
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,810
That's the great thing about it being relative and we will need to move around our model as well to
128

129
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,860
compensate.
129

130
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,660
But anyway that's the basics.
130

131
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,860
Done.
131

132
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,520
Here we go.
132

133
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,400
This is what I was warning you about in the challenge.
133

134
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,280
We may need to alter our model to match up with the steps now before we decide where we're going with
134

135
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,840
that.
135

136
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,700
I want to make sure I've got the right number of steps present first.
136

137
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,870
Otherwise adjusting the rest of the geometry isn't going to work.
137

138
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,390
So I'm going to backpedal a little.
138

139
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,840
I want this to be half the size again.
139

140
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,820
So I'm gonna scale everything selects everything and scale it on the Y.
140

141
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,890
Sorry not on the Y axis.
141

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,020
By point 5.
142

143
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,110
It's going to get smaller.
143

144
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,170
And I'm gonna have to move it down at this point.
144

145
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,930
And I've also not applied my transform so let's apply my scale.
145

146
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,560
It hasn't made any difference to our model which is useful and I'm going to move this down to point
146

147
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,670
1 2 5.
147

148
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,890
I'm having to think there.
148

149
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,010
There we go.
149

150
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,970
And now this is gonna be 32 up.
150

151
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:45,390
I'm pretty sure and once we get to the very top we've got ourselves some alignment to do so I'm going
151

152
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,510
to go ahead grab this edge the other edge.
152

153
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:48,960
There we go.
153

154
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,890
Edge snapping.
154

155
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,780
I'm gonna go G to start moving it around I want to snap it to this edge.
155

156
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,260
I want to lock it to the X axis.
156

157
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,750
Now that doesn't appear to.
157

158
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,330
Oh it's locked it to the wrong X axis.
158

159
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,440
There we go.
159

160
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,500
That's now the appropriate X axis.
160

161
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:09,810
So we no longer got a hole in the top of our model and that is looking pretty good.
161

162
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,530
I think those double steps there made all the difference rather than having them as they were before.
162

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,300
Brilliant.
163

164
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,810
Let's turn.
164

165
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,620
LookDev and have a look around our model with a bit of shading turned on.
165

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,910
We're gonna start adding some lights to our scene soon.
166

167
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,690
You may have already done that in anticipation at the moment of course.
167

168
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:33,540
The lamp is not really in an appropriate place but anyway that is starting to look really nice.
168

169
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,340
I like the number of steps that I've got there and I'm liking the overall feel of my model.
169

170
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,610
How are you guys getting on.
170

171
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,420
How many steps did you choose did you go for the big ones that I had.
171

172
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,150
Have you gone for even smaller.
172

173
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,070
Of course all of these decisions are just aesthetic at the moment and I think this looks a lot better
173

174
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,610
as smaller steps than I did as larger.
174

175
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,570
So I'm happy I made that change.
175

176
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,740
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
