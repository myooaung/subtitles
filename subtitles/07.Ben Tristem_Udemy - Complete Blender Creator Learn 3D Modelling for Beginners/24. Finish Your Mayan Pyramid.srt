Okay so this lecture we're jumping straight into a challenge. 
1

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,020
It's the end of section challenge.
2

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,440
I'd like you to give a bit of thought to it and make it your own.
3

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,730
So I'd like you to go ahead and finish your mayan pyramid.
4

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,160
What do I mean by finish.
5

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,850
Well add some materials, add some lighting, add that camera to the right position.
6

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,210
So you're ready to render it's out add some additional features or objects to your scene as well that's
7

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,270
another thing you can do.
8

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,600
But most importantly play have fun and share your creations as you've gone.
9

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,290
So go ahead pause the video now and create your final Mayan pyramid
10

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,260
Okay
11

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,150
everybody welcome back.
12

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,290
Let's hop on over into blender and I will go and create my final mayan pyramid.
13

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,890
Okay so this is where we left off before.
14

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,420
Let's go ahead and make sure we save our work.
15

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
I'm going to save mine as 21 so we're ready to go.
16

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,540
So looking at it at the moment it's pretty plain and boring whether we're looking at it in lookdev
17

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,660
mode or even shaded mode and in fact in shaded mode looks kind of dramatic with the lights lower down
18

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,260
like that but that's not giving me the look for I want.
19

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,180
So a couple of things that this Mayan pyramid exists in nowhere at the moment.
20

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,510
So let's go ahead and I'm going to add myself in a ground plane and I'm just going to scale that up.
21

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,800
So there's something that this thing is set on I want to call its ground straightaway get naming in
22

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,890
there and I'm going to add a material to it straightaway as well whilst I'm here and I'm just going
23

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,400
to call that material ground okay.
24

25
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,600
I want to make it a green I'm going to make it a little darker and I'm going to leave it like that for
25

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,240
the moment.
26

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,170
The next thing I want to play with is my lights.
27

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,470
I'm gonna go for a three point lighting setup.
28

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,220
We have our rough camera angle here.
29

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,600
I think I want to help sort out the camera first so let's see what the camera can see.
30

31
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,650
Not a lot at the moment looks like we're zoomed in quite a bit.
31

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,580
Now I'm gonna go to view navigation and go down to walk navigation.
32

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,530
This will enable me to look around.
33

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,530
Ah yes I could get a really dramatic shot there but I'm not gonna go for that at the moment.
34

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,840
Let's just back up a little I want the whole pyramid like that so I can show it off to everyone.
35

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,100
So that's what the camera's going to see.
36

37
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,280
Looking at all scene from above.
37

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,680
Make sure your cursors over this the 3D editor when you try and do something like that I'm going to grab
38

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,860
our first light and when it's selected I'm going to press G and just move it somewhere else.
39

40
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,520
Now at the moment it looks like snapping still turned on something to turn it off and move it around.
40

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,550
Now the question is is that still at the right height.
41

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,210
Yes it is.
42

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,250
Okay.
43

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,260
So we got our camera which is all the way over here actually.
44

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,530
So I want a light around here.
45

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,900
I want a light back here and a light over there.
46

47
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,100
Now in this case I'm going to have the filling lights perhaps over here and a little bit brighter.
47

48
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,180
I'm going to pump the energy up to 30 because we're dealing with quite a large scene here that looks
48

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,070
pretty good and what I want is that even bit of lighting I do want shadows there but I don't want them
49

50
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,570
to be too overpowering as well.
50

51
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,710
I can lift lights up and down if I feel like this too you know too many shadows coming down from underneath
51

52
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,130
I can lift that up and light those surfaces.
52

53
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,320
And I think that's a good overall luminance lighting for our scene.
53

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,770
Now we have here a kind of a bland rocky type color I'm going to go in I'm going to rename the material
54

55
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:38,420
itself pyramid and once I've done that I'm going to change the base color to more of a sandy color.
55

56
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,530
It's going to make it stand out just that little bit better.
56

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,360
Okay so that's looking pretty good.
57

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,510
There's a couple of other things that I want to do here and that's have a lamp right smack bang in the
58

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:48,930
middle.
59

60
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,420
At the top here, as if something's coming out from inside.
60

61
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,380
So I need to move either a lamp to that position or if you remember using the 3D cursor so I'm going
61

62
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,560
to use the 3D cursor tool and I'm going to place it there.
62

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,720
Now we can also shift and right click to place the 3D cursor if we want.
63

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:15,890
So as well as using the 3D cursor option over on the tool shelf I'm going to add in another lamp so
64

65
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,120
a fresh lamp.
65

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,230
And I'm going to change it to a deep orange color.
66

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,090
Not going to adjust the end.
67

68
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,720
Yeah  i will wi'll knock that down to five for the moment.
68

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Let's come out and look from the camera's view of what we've got that is looking pretty awesome.
69

70
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,730
Now the one thing you may notice at this point is that we've got lights bleed coming through our scene
70

71
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,480
so I'm going to press G and then X and move that slightly out.
71

72
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,750
So that's not happening anymore.
72

73
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,600
And that's always something to watch out for because if you put a light inside an object you may get
73

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,090
issues like it coming through like that.
74

75
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,590
Okay.
75

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
That is looking pretty good at the moment.
76

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,190
I'm happy with that.
77

78
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,570
How did you guys get on looking forward to seeing your work over in the discussions.
78

79
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,210
Please now render out your models by going to render render image.
79

80
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:15,380
Go head to image save as save that on your hard drive and then you're ready for sharing your work looking
80

81
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,420
forward to seeing it.
81

82
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,530
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
