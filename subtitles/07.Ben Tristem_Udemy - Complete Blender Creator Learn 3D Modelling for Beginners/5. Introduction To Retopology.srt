00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,570
Welcome to the introduction to reap apology.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,180
Now first of all what is right apology.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,690
We've mentioned it a couple of times in passing and it's time to have a more detailed look at what in

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,640
fact it entails.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,900
So you probably already have done it to some degree.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:27,150
It's basically remaking a mesh so that the arrangement of polygons is uniform and is often all quads.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,440
It can significantly lower the polygon count.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:38,940
Getting rid of unnecessary vertices which is useful especially for optimization and planning can help

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,070
avoid doing much of it starting with the low level of detail and working up can help avoid it too.

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,200
It's very tempting to start working at a very high level of detail and coming back down.

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,650
Unfortunately that does mean then you have to create a base mesh.

12
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,170
Now there's no right or wrong as always.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,350
Some people like working at the high detail know making the rough low poly model afterwards.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,360
Some people will prefer getting the rough low poddy model right first and then adding the detail to

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,320
that's others.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,420
Pros and cons to doing it both ways.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,750
I would prefer to start a low detail and work up by purely I do understand if you like working at that

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,700
detail level and coming back again.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,090
The big thing for me is it's time consuming.

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,010
If the base mesh isn't right or doesn't feel right I know that very quickly if I've been sculpting for

21
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:38,370
ages on a very high poly model try to get all that detail right and then find out that the overall form

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,010
isn't quite there.

23
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,690
I may have just wasted a lot of time there's a lot of things you can do to try and edit it but if the

24
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,680
general form is wrong it's you're going to have to start again.

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,800
Don't be afraid of starting again eeva.

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,230
I hole I really do recommend trying doing something several times just to see oh well if I do it this

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,600
way or that way how does that pan out.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,580
Does that make it easier.

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,050
Does that make it more difficult.

30
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,180
Does it make it easier in certain situations.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,520
So what is re topology.

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,380
This is an example we made a bunny in the previous section.

33
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:20,820
Using those metter balls and they basically generate a load of triangles is really dense mesh and you

34
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:28,680
can see that when we take that and Rita apologize to that bunny on the right hand side you can see all

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,940
of a sudden there's a.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,320
Well a lot less polygons for a start is easier to manage is where you can start to see those edge loops

37
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,670
we've been talking about which makes editing and controlling the model a lot lot easier.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,540
And you'll also see that in general apart from the areas where there is detail we don't have a ton of

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,360
polygons a ton of vertices.

40
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,750
Remember these vertices as many as necessary but no more when that goes without a lot of things not

41
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,010
just in blender.

42
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,630
But if you don't need detail there then you don't need a virtex.

43
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,100
It's as simple as that.

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,660
Do you need to apologize.

45
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,620
As is often a good question to have.

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,070
If you look at your model in its state go back to this real quick and it's more like the one on the

47
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,700
right.

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,760
Anyway you might need to edit a few things here and there.

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,880
Perhaps put in in a few more edged loops perhaps a break and edge loop or redefine where the edge loop

50
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,280
actually meets one another.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,580
I can certainly see a few pointers or in the model itself on the right hand side there where I could

52
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,490
improve the flow of where the edges go round.

53
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,790
In general if it looked on the left and then you wanted to animator it'll do something on those lines.

54
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,030
You definitely need to read topologist course if you were close to the right hand one in the first place.

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,960
You may not have to do as much.

56
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:56,010
So the answer is almost always whether it's moving one or two vertices to make an edge looped more defined

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,860
or whether it's adding some detail adding another edge loop define an edge.

58
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,920
Well that's what they do.

59
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,500
But planning can help avoid it in the first place.

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,600
If you're sculpting the original model ill often be necessary especially if you using dynamics apology

61
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,530
because that creates a big load of mess.

62
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,490
Like we can see in on that left hand picture.

63
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:25,440
Where where I've added detail around the mouth etc. It ends up being incredibly dense.

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,100
It leads to a clean and well defined mesh which also means that others can then work with your mesh

65
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,260
to if it is there.

66
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,430
If you've got a mesh that's kind of standard what people are expecting.

67
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,850
So Edge loops around the eye etc. It becomes much more easier for others and yourself to work with it.

68
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,980
It enables animation properties so if you've got to start deforming your model not just actually animating

69
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,380
it but deforming it in any way it stops things like pinching.

70
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,710
Especially if you made it up of quads.

71
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,810
It allows you to refine.

72
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,750
And easily edit your mesh and that can be a real godsend if you do need to make any alterations or indeed

73
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,460
just minor tweaks.

74
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:16,880
So let's try a bit of reeds apologizing now on some nice simple shapes and hop on over in a blender.

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:17,870
Hey.

76
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,890
So a backhoe in blender here.

77
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,650
And I'm not going to read to apologize cube because that would be crazy.

78
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,470
Okay some gotten rid of that.

79
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm going to give myself an eco sphere to work with.

80
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,740
I'm going to increase the number of subdivisions and just bump up the size a little and thus making

81
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,630
it a bit easier to work with as well.

82
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,790
You don't have to zoom so much or zoom so close.

83
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,740
So I'm going to hop into edit mode so we can just see how it's made up and clear the selection there.

84
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:57,270
Okay so as you can see it's made up of a series of triangles and that's bad for modelling in general

85
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,720
because we can't select the edge loops we can't.

86
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,390
There's lots of things we just cannot do at this point in time.

87
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,920
There are several ways of which you can start apologizing.

88
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,850
It would depend on what you want to do and I would like to go through a couple of ways.

89
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,900
Now how you can very quickly reet apologize without worrying too much about the model out or destroying

90
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,030
the model in the process.

91
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,320
But getting the loops that you want which can be challenging so don't worry if you start getting a bit

92
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,070
frustrated take a step back and think about the crossroads that happens when you've got an edge loop

93
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,510
and we'll see that in a few moments.

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,860
So one of the first things you can actually do it instead of adding or taking anything away is moving

95
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:51,450
things so you can move vertices around and question whether that actually sorts out your problem or

96
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,080
your mesh flow or anything else.

97
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:02,100
So in this case I would turn on a vertex select turn on the snapping tool turn on vertex snapping and

98
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:09,750
then turning on Merge vertices automatically so that's questionable whether you want to do that because

99
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,530
sometimes it can be undesirable.

100
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,520
But in this case for instance I could drag this vertex and place on top of that one and then I've got

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,780
a newly defined shape it's still triangles at the moment but it may be well on its way to actually getting

102
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,730
a decent shape coming out.

103
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,590
Now there's something you can do with a virtex which is kind of cool.

104
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,520
It say this was the centre point of an eye.

105
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,980
Now it doesn't make any sense that you can bevel vertex initially but it can be great for starting to

106
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,820
make some edged loops.

107
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,900
So saying you managed to get your eye to a point at some point and you wanted to bevel it you could

108
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,300
actually do that and that is not the normal bevil at all.

109
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,650
It's actually a bevell vertex tool so we need to go to the mesh operations vertices and in here we will

110
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:07,200
see there is a vertex bevel she's control shift and or shift control be there and when we do that we

111
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,860
can see that it's almost like you're in setting.

112
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,830
But from the single virtex that's there and that can be incredibly powerful because once you've got

113
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:23,250
that shape you can start creating some more edge loops by setting you can grab this edge loop round

114
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,980
the outside then scale it in and out.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,750
Benim got snapping turned off at a moment so that's why it's jumping all over the place.

116
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,600
So there's lots you can do with that one technique and of course by doing that you may have noticed

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,660
we've got an ng on in the middle we can sort that out if we want to but we've now got an extra loop.

118
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,940
Or even better a face loop that we can follow if we go to the next sort of loop around.

119
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,910
We can see that we've also created an edge loop or a face loop.

120
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,900
Both in fact here is where and that could be the definitions around and I know of course then you can

121
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,100
use the loop cutting tools to add more and more detail in here.

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,250
If you wanted to and then of course you can go in and start shaping things how you want them to be.

123
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:21,060
So there we go there's a little I don't know volcano in the surface there and you can see how quickly

124
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,170
you're starting to define the shape of your model.

125
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,360
So that's one thing that you could do there.

126
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,640
Now if you wanted to create a loop running around here you've got a series of triangles or maybe just

127
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,760
one triangle.

128
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:40,710
If I want to do this faking the loop here that band of faces ought to be joined together.

129
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,440
I could go in.

130
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,220
You probably see that you can make quads by combining two triangles as a couple of ways that you can

131
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,650
go about doing that.

132
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,450
In this case you could dissolve.

133
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,720
You can select both of these faces and dissolve them change into just one giant face or undies you could

134
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,780
dissolve the edge in the middle.

135
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,770
So by selecting the edge in the middle and going to delete it but instead of deleting the edge you can

136
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,800
dissolve the.

137
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,320
Here we go.

138
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,160
Edges.

139
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,300
That has now created a quad.

140
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,590
You can also select two faces and dissolve the faces and it creates another quad.

141
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:27,090
Now if you carry on doing this round what you will find is you start to create your own face loop and

142
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,570
then of course with comes a face loop.

143
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,190
You'll end up with Edge loops.

144
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,430
Now at the moment there's well as this one here.

145
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,740
It's only two edges wide.

146
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,920
But that's because it's bounded by these.

147
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:46,300
If I can select these loops here now because there's a poll just here if we count One two three four

148
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,410
five that edge loop gets terminated that would need to be four.

149
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:58,680
And the problem is we've got well we've got this triangle here that's causing that problem.

150
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,480
Now it could be a quad there if we get rid of this particular edge in the middle here.

151
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:10,910
We've still got a poll here and this is how you can define edge loops and where they branch off and

152
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:18,350
go to so you can end up with four call three squads meeting one another for quads would mean there's

153
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,600
almost a crossroads of face loops.

154
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,930
And then of course you've got five quads meeting together and that's what we have here.

155
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,770
We've got one.

156
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,490
Oh that's going to face we've got one two three four five.

157
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,520
And because they all meet together when you try and select an edge lupi goes down here and goes across

158
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,320
there so it's a way of defining it.

159
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,670
And this one will go round this fake either.

160
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:49,550
I've been making very very useful as one final tool that I want to introduce you to before I give you

161
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,190
a little bit of a challenge.

162
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,290
And that's the knife tool.

163
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,790
So with the knife tool you can select it so you can go to the tool shelf and there's a button that says

164
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,820
knife and you can see the shortcut there is k..

165
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,250
You can also get to it through the space menu.

166
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,710
If I type in a knife we can see that it's knife topology tool with a k..

167
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:19,280
When you've selected it if you take a quick look down at the bottom of your screen you see that's gives

168
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,410
you some instructions on how to use it.

169
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,300
There you go off the end of my resolution.

170
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,350
I've got here at the moment so I can't see all of those instructions.

171
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,520
But this is the thing where if you right click right click is not how you apply this.

172
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,120
So you got enter pad enter which is the number pad entry if you've got one.

173
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,480
And space you can use to confirm the cut escape or right mouse button cancels left mouse button starts

174
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,450
to define the cut in double left mouse button closes the cuts an E is a new car and those are the ones

175
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,970
that I generally use.

176
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,270
So let's just practice with it now.

177
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,620
So if I cut there to here and then press space.

178
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,190
It puts it in brillion.

179
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,500
I will now have a faceless hoop running up there towards the middle of my eye.

180
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,660
That's looking good.

181
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,580
What else can I do.

182
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,370
Well if I wanted to carry on it's very simple I can just hit the caky and carry on cutting I can just

183
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,020
click and click.

184
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,410
You can even click and drag as you're going across.

185
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,340
I wouldn't advise that unless you're being really nimble or rough and ready with it.

186
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,540
But I don't want that at the moment so I'm going to cancel it and I can cancel it with the escape or

187
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,640
the right mouse button and you can see it disappears.

188
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,690
Now if I've made a cut from here to here and then I want to make a cut from there.

189
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:45,720
There I can't do that at the moment with out's drawing a line there and drawing a line there.

190
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,430
Perhaps that's not what I want.

191
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,230
So what I could do is draw a line from this midpoint to here then press the E key and start another

192
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,980
one from here to here.

193
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,870
Now will vary on what you're wanting to do to press enter to confirm that.

194
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,920
And of course by doing that I've caused a few problems because I've broken up a load of edge loops there

195
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:12,000
and again at this point I can just grab the knife tool and join those bits back together press.

196
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,450
And now I just cannot test got a facelift running around their interests.

197
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,050
Oh yes I've cut this triangle because of cut it here it's now a quad.

198
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,730
It's part of this face Luke and of band and the other one at this end.

199
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,210
When I select this one here you can see that this is kind of a loop going round itself which could be

200
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,950
beneficial if you were working on hands or fingers things like that.

201
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,470
But that's one loop and that's the other one.

202
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:45,340
So you can very easily cut your way in to making some good top logical choices.

203
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:52,210
That's a big word there but you can basically cut out the topology that you want from the mesh and then

204
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,970
put faces back together if necessary so if these two needed to be back together a could dissolve them

205
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,780
back together.

206
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,240
And of course that leads me onto a challenge for you guys.

207
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,760
Okay it's Challenge time.

208
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,400
I'd like you to create some loops.

209
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,610
So start with an AI code sphere roughly three subdivisions or more so you've got enough geometry to

210
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,630
play with and create two or more face loops that cross one another.

211
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,310
Now what I mean by that.

212
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,770
I'll just hop over to blender and show you.

213
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,290
So here we go if you're originally an ecosphere and we've got to face loops that are going round our

214
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,840
model S a bit wonky in places but they're actually crossing over one one another.

215
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,790
So we've got two defined face loops so we can get face select turned on.

216
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,670
Here we can select that entire loop running around there and if we go this way round we've got another

217
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:54,260
loop running around our model there so borza video now and give that a go.

218
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,270
Okay guys.

219
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,580
Welcome back.

220
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,900
Let's go create some loops around and IKO sphere.

221
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,140
Okay so in order to do the challenge I am going to save my work here.

222
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm going to go to a new file.

223
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:17,890
I'm going to remove our cube that we get by the fall as I add in a new ecosphere with three subdivisions.

224
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,820
And let's start work on it.

225
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,250
So there is no quick way of doing this.

226
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,510
It is a manual job.

227
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:33,490
However what I can do here for instance is select every other one of these going round and hopefully.

228
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,800
That will work as we go all the way around.

229
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,150
And not that one that one that one that one.

230
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,860
And thear should loop back round.

231
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,160
Yes it does.

232
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,020
Perfect.

233
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:53,220
Now if I dissolve the edges there I should have a face loop running around.

234
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,410
That's perfect.

235
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,220
Now I need one.

236
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,690
Intersex signee to make a decision on where that is and where it's going.

237
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,180
So I'm going to have a look at probably here.

238
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,920
So we're going to go round the model.

239
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,460
I don't want to select.

240
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,190
That's how we want to select that one that takes us there.

241
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:23,870
I might actually go for that's all once if for one two three four I might actually go round the model

242
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,650
like this.

243
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,220
I think this is going to work.

244
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,980
Because that should alternate backwards and forwards.

245
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,150
So be a bit of a wonky one as it goes.

246
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:41,870
I'm not sure about these pyramids I think as I say I think they should work pyramids these Pentagons

247
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,240
is what I meant to say and didn't.

248
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,040
Looks good so far.

249
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,840
So we've met back up here so let's just see how that's looking at the moment.

250
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,790
So this are no I can't do it like that because I can't do all at once because it will do that's of course

251
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,130
silly silly me.

252
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,240
So this is one of those jobs where I have to go round and do it manually.

253
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,080
So I see you guys back in a few moze.

254
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,400
And there we go.

255
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,940
I aren't.

256
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,290
No.

257
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,240
No we've not quite got it almost there.

258
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,630
We've got oh I've made the wrong quad by the looks of things but we've almost got that one going around

259
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,290
there.

260
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,570
And we definitely got that one running round there says good intersection there.

261
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,930
Of course summate that's a bit.

262
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:41,270
Need to what I do here is move this one down a little so it's more in line as it goes round.

263
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,160
That's more of a choice of shape that you're going for if you decide that.

264
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,040
So you got a little problem here.

265
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,490
How do we get rid of that.

266
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,330
Well I'm going to grab this virtex and merge it.

267
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,760
I want to move it down a little or say down a little I really need to be looking at its spots on to

268
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,510
get this perfect.

269
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,140
But this is not an exercise exercise in perfection.

270
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,040
I wants snapping turned on.

271
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,270
There we go.

272
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,210
Let's move this increment rather than virtex get there eventually to there.

273
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,110
Now what that should do is complete the loop around our model.

274
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:27,480
It has done perfect so we've now got two intersecting face loops which is great.

275
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,290
That's exactly what we wanted.

276
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,290
A could be neat and up of course.

277
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,090
Don't worry about that at this stage.

278
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,350
You can always go back and solve the at a later stage.

279
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,300
So there we go we've got the two intersecting loops running around.

280
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,880
Please share your work in the discussions if you who's struggling at all.

281
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,360
I suggest you practice as much as he can because this is an incredibly important skill especially coming

282
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,270
up soon.

283
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,710
And as always I will see you guys in the next lecture.

284
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,580
Take care.
