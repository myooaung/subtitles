Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.880
In this lecture we're gonna be talking about planning your project now defining its scope and your goals

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.810
is so important it helps prevent scope slip and I'm gonna help you here by giving you some guidance

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.640
in terms of how long the project should take and things along those lines.

5
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.680
Of course you can follow along with what I'm doing that's absolutely fine.

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.530
But if you're feeling confident or you've had some previous experience with this type of work then do

7
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.700
push yourself at this point and remember to show your work as you go.

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.050
And for those who have followed along go along and make your own small models as well that really will

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.250
help you reinforce your knowledge.

10
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.480
And when we think about scope we are really concentrating on how far we want to take the projects we

11
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.450
obviously want to take it to a kind of a final project.

12
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.070
I want to be able to use these assets in a game engine as ultimately the goal of this project.

13
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.610
However what we don't want is to create thousands of items thousands of level components environmental

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.300
props that's just not within the scope of this project.

15
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.440
So I'm going to end up limiting myself to something like five to 10 scenery pieces things like the stairs

16
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.880
the walls etc. and then maybe another five to 10 props that I'm going to place within my scene whether

17
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.450
that's a table or an altar or something along those lines something to enhance the overall scene.

18
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.020
And then finally this is a great time to start gathering your basic reference material.

19
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.380
So I know that I'm going to be focused on a Gothic church that really starts honing in what I'm going

20
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.270
to go for.

21
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.260
However there are so many different varieties so this is where we go really really wide.

22
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.970
A great big breadth of reference material and then we can start honing in on specific reference material

23
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.910
and we talk more about that in the next lecture.

24
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.210
So what I'd like you to do now is take five minutes and go through some ideas of what you would like

25
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.080
to make.

26
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.550
If you're following along with me that's great but what are you going to do after you've followed along

27
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.480
with me.

28
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.770
Sheva over in these discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
