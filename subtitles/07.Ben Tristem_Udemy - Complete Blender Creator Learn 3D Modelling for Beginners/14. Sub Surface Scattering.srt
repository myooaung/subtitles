1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,830
And this video we're talking about subsurface scattering and we're going to create a new layer that

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,630
will plug into the subsurface so we can get some subsurface scattering going on so let's talk about

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,500
what this is all about.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,540
But first couple of quick points I did a little bit of fiddling with my character off screen made the

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,600
hair a bit darker.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,400
And the second thing I'm at the point now where I'm annoyed with how shiny my character is.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,560
Skin has a little bit of shyness but not that much.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,260
So I'm gonna go into my main node and just turn speculum all the way down so the character now doesn't

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,210
have that shiny penis.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,740
We can go and put that back in later on but now I just wanted to get a consistent flat not speculative

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,260
feel like you only have a little bit in your if you felt that makes it feel natural then you can pump

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,790
it up just a little bit to get a little bit of that greasy oil back on your face if you wanted to.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,640
Okay now let's talk about subsurface scattering.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,010
I've got an image here which I'm sure you've done yourself.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,460
You've put the flashlight or torch up against that your hand and you can see that the light shines through.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,480
Now it's not shining directly through what's happening is the light is hitting your skin and then being

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,710
dispersed or scattering amongst your skin.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,660
So some materials the light hits it and just stops it's not scattering it's not spreading throughout

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,220
that material that you can see here very clearly particularly thin skin.

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,810
Like in the ears or in the nostrils the light is is penetrating through the skin but not just being

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,980
shown through the skin but also it's spreading around and getting that effect.

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,340
And that's what we're going to be simulating in blender.

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,730
And the first part of this exercise is to jump back into our properties and to for our vertex colors

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,940
add a new layer this layer we will call subsurface scattering or SS s for short.

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:48,090
And then within our shader Ed shift a input vertex colors SPSS drop this down the bottom here.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,400
Now going to go back to my solid shading view find SPSS which we're on.

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,650
Once again I will make sure I'm clicked on my brush.

28
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,840
Start off with white.

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,930
So shift K The whole thing's entirely white.

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:09,930
Now if I plug the F A C the factor on my attribute you can see you've got f I see the step and we plug

31
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,100
that in to sub surface boink like that subsurface.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,930
Now go back over to our render view.

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,440
You can see are crazy it's crazy for me because I've been playing around with this subsurface color

34
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,240
it's red.

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,400
If we put this back to its default of white if I can do that properly right in the middle of White what

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,490
do we get we get this kind of really weird but cool but not weird more than anything else.

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,290
Wax figure which is great.

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,210
That shows when we have one hundred percent.

39
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,830
So it's completely black.

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,620
We've got this really weird crazy thing going on.

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,440
That's not what we want.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,670
Note a ball with the surface and subsurface color is I put it all white I could have said well let's

43
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,920
make it pink and so we get this kind of pink waxy kind of figure we will make it a little bit pinkish

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,930
a little bit skin color.

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,530
If now put it back to white so we can illustrate what's going on.

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,630
Now I'm gonna go back into where are we back into.

47
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,980
Yes we're still on SPSS I can do my solid shading view grab my paintbrush and instead of white I am

48
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,380
going to go and paint with 100 percent strength blacks I've just dragged the line all the way down to

49
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,510
the bottom on the color I'm going to just paint paint paint paint across the frontier paint paint paint

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,460
all of black full of black along the front and I've still got my mirroring on in case you're wondering

51
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,540
about that pink paint paint paint up to that point then let's see what's happened when I've done that

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,940
we've got regular on the bottom and wax we'd wax figure on the top in a way this is kind of a cool effect

53
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,770
but not what I'm going for in this particular instance you can see that when it's 100 percent black

54
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,790
it doesn't apply any of the subsurface scattering when it's 100 percent white it implies a whole bunch

55
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,240
of it.

56
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,220
So what we're going to do is back over into our solid view make sure we're on the right layer.

57
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,020
Okay.

58
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:01,110
I'm gonna undo that painting yet call me to undo it now I'm going to do is jump up to paint and so click

59
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,930
on dirty vertex colors it's gonna take a moment to calculate that hopefully my computer doesn't crash

60
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,740
come on blender you can do it you can do it.

61
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,220
What's that showing is that from Napoleon Dynamite.

62
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,730
No I think I'm thinking something different.

63
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,050
Okay.

64
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:21,420
And that applies a little bit of it's trying to go around and find the edges the sharper bits and make

65
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,790
them more white make the other areas more dark I find that when I do this I get Okay results.

66
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,680
However for some reason my subsurface colors come back to red again I don't have that shock as we had

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,390
last time we go ahead and have a look at how this is I still find it's too waxy we're getting too much

68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,850
of that waxy effect in this particular instance so that might have worked perfectly for you but I find

69
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,100
we need to do some tweaking on top of this I'm going to go and select a fairly dark ish brush make it

70
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,440
pretty big and just go and paint nice and dark the areas that I don't want to have too much applied

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,360
too so remember we'll get more of that subsurface scattering when we have white and less of it when

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
we have darker.

73
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,760
So let's see what happens if we go around and just a little bit of I'm gonna make this even darker I

74
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,280
think and pump up the strength

75
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:25,220
Oh it's the airbender paint up the middle so make it fairly dark ish OK now I'm going to switch it back

76
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,500
up to white strength down a little bit low I don't want it to too strong I want to overpowering definitely

77
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,440
on the ease the ease is where we really have this subsurface scattering come to the fore because they're

78
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:44,910
quite thin quite thin fleshy bits of our body got a little bit of bleed there that shouldn't matter

79
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,250
but we'll see how it goes just take note of that and then definitely on the nostrils nostrils nostrils

80
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:58,510
nostrils I know you can do that too low definitely on the nostrils leave it on the nose you might need

81
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,510
to come back and repaint that someone are getting too high but we'll see how it goes.

82
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:10,290
Little bit on the lips but I'm going to turn the power down the strength down that is going to go a

83
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,770
little bit of blurring so it's a bit smoother.

84
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,290
We don't want sharp edges when we're doing this because your skin tends to not go from one sharp bit

85
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,690
to another sharp but it's more smooth and curves organic after all this is organic modelling that we're

86
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,490
doing at the moment so make sure we get that organic look by doing lots of smashing and smudging.

87
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:29,720
Okay.

88
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,940
Now let's just go and have a look at what we've got here.

89
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,330
Change the render view.

90
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,450
So I'm gonna change the color dramatically so we can see where it's popping.

91
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,730
If I make it very red then you can see we're getting this sort of pinkish is is are often pinkish when

92
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,060
we get that going on and a super important point as we saw in the other are the live examples where

93
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,440
we're doing it.

94
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,390
It depends a lot on what you're doing with your light.

95
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,520
So if you're finding that you're getting the not getting the effect you're after just play around with

96
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,440
where your lights are positioned object mode move it around a little bit here often if you put one right

97
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,320
behind the character's head you can see what's going on in those is super clearly back in the vertex

98
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,020
paint.

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,320
Make sure I'm clipped on the head.

100
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,920
Yes okay.

101
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,630
So I don't want it to be quite as pink as that so just bring it back up into the middle.

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,030
Okay.

103
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,840
And then you can see these is have a little bit more of that kind of fleshy see through feel to them.

104
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,830
And so it's up to you you can go and paint a little bit more do a little bit less.

105
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,810
Make it more pink.

106
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,110
Sorry.

107
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,380
This is the way you can make it stronger less strong.

108
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,510
You're on a scooter a little bit more orange you can.

109
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,340
That's totally cool if you want to get that feel to it.

110
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,100
So if you look here on this eyebrow I've got it more strongly lit.

111
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,350
The E has more definition to it.

112
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,580
There's a there's a tiny bit of that see through it kind of feeling to it vibe to it.

113
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,690
So play around if you want to put a little bit more speculum back in here so you do get a little bit

114
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,810
more of the shiny you can do that play around with your color so that you get the color that you think

115
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,150
is naturally shining through when you've got the inner parts of the skin and obviously play around with

116
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,130
how much you paint how much you unpainted when it comes to the color you put in here.

117
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:03,630
Okay.

118
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,690
I've just been doing a little fiddling around off camera to say you haven't have to watch every brush

119
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,100
stroke.

120
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:16,060
This is what I'm going for at the moment with my final layout just for head nose cheekbones round the

121
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,720
mouth eyes et cetera.

122
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,840
I'm also going to just have a little bit of a play with the subsurface radius and the moment it's set

123
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,900
to 1 so if I click on subsurface radius it brings up these three little boxes here and I drop this down

124
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,650
and see you can see if you lift it up it really balloons everything out it makes it glow a lot.

125
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:43,570
Very impressive so I'm going to drop it down I think to a very low point point three I think second

126
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,080
they point to if we increase that you can see.

127
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,730
Likewise we get a bit of a glow.

128
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,570
I'm going to drop that one down quite a bit.

129
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,720
Just mouse off it.

130
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:59,610
Two point one and then the last one I found doesn't do a great deal if I if I change it up and down

131
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,480
doesn't do a lot so I'm just gonna leave that pretty low pretty much where it was.

132
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,000
So the challenge I have for you is to apply subsurface scattering to your model and then do a final

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,710
pass with tweaking all your different layers and how you've painted them the colors the lights you've

134
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,170
gotten this you're seeing the strengths of the blending between the different layers and get it to the

135
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,930
point where you're happy with it and render it.

136
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,610
And please do share it with us.

137
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,800
I think that's enough for now in terms of our playing around with the human head and the texture vertex

138
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,480
painting so in the next videos we'll move on to something a little bit different.

139
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,080
So put a little bit of love into it now and let us know what you've done and what you've got.

140
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,610
And when you've done that I will see you in the next video.
