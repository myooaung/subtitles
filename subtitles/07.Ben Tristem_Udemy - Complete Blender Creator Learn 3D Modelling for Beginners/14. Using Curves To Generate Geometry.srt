00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,630
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,040
In this lecture we're going to focus on creating a base for our lamp.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,630
You can see.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,860
Well let's get rid of the lamp itself so we can just see the base.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,080
We're going to create a shape like this and we're going to use curves to make hits.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:25,690
So this generation of data here this mesh that we can see is actually just a series of curves and bang.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,750
Suddenly this comes to life.

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,690
Let's go ahead and find out more okay.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:38,690
So let's learn about curves now and use a default scene in which to do it rather than our complex or

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,180
starting to become complicated scene.

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,890
And the other reason for doing that is because I can show you exactly with whole numbers.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,980
Whereas I think our lamp is not going to be a whole number.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,190
So the first thing we need to do is give it a path to follow around.

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,580
And so first of all we're going to add in a curve and we're going to make it a circle so you can just

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,900
follow around.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,650
So this is a kind of profile modelling we're going to make the side of our lamp.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,120
And it's going to follow that around.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,560
So this is going to be the path.

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,160
So let's give it a path.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,910
There we go.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,060
And in fact in many ways this is although it is the path some it's also going to be the base itself.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,470
So I'm also going to put path forward that's a really bad spelling a path we.

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,000
So that's the base.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,470
That's the path that the curve we're about to produce is going to follow.

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,660
And let's go ahead and add in another curve and we're going to use a busier curve we had in a busier

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,610
curve and I'm going to call this one the profile curve some profile curve.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,680
So what we're going to do here.

28
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,210
Oh dear my curve curse I must be cast anyway.

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,680
So we have a path and a profile for this to follow.

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,780
Let's see what happens if we plumb these things in so selecting the base and then going down to the

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,750
curve properties when we're in the curve properties we're going to scroll down much further until we

32
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,600
come to this area called geometry when we're there we open that up scroll down a little more and we've

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,790
got these Bevel options we're going to select and objects and in this case we're going to use our profile

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:18,620
curve that we've constructed and boom straight away we've got a 3d surface that's pretty awesome and

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,440
very quick we've got to that point you can see immediately that all you could probably do the bowling

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,990
pins like this or you could do the chess pieces like this or in this case the lamp base like this as

37
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:37,610
well now using curves is a good way of making sure that things are infinitely editable and we can change

38
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,560
the better year handle type in a moment and make Richard Sharp changes.

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,120
And it's great being able to define a curve and it automatically translating into a 3D shape.

40
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,860
Now one of the things you're probably asking here is well how do I control that curve underneath.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,110
Well what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go into wireframe mode so we can see stuff.

42
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,950
I'm going to select my profile curve and move it around and you will notice that as I move it's around

43
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,380
this doesn't change.

44
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,650
Now from that we can understand that it's to do with the origin of this object and the circle that's

45
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,910
underneath.

46
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,850
So how does this work then what's going on.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,500
And this curve obviously looks right this way but it's been projected round this way.

48
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,560
Really what is going on.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,350
So the best way of looking at this is from a quad view.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,870
So we're going to do that would control alt and Q It's going to split the viewport into four different

51
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,710
areas.

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,710
Once a 3D window is still the others are locked into all graphic perspective and the good thing about

53
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:45,410
this is I can zoom in here and we can see the profile from two different sides and because it's a circle

54
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,100
these two will be essentially the same and we can see our curve itself.

55
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,040
Now if I position the curve you probably if I zoom in here you can see the two lines that are running

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,780
around just here.

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,150
One of those is the circle.

58
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:07,460
The base path that we originally drew and you will find that if you line up the origin with the original

59
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,140
circle that we made which should be roughly around there any way it matches perfectly.

60
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,820
Now if we go into edit mode and start editing this you can see underneath the profile matches perfectly.

61
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:27,340
So if I was to grab this particular vertex point here and move it it will make this the base larger.

62
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,320
If I was to grab a hand or one of these bits at the top.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,980
Press g a move it's around we can change the overall shape of things.

64
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,760
We can even have it come out slightly first.

65
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,240
Now if I change this just to a rendered mode for a moment you can see that we're starting to generate

66
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,130
quite some unique sets of geometry.

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,040
Now I am going to move it to this slight angle here and just demonstrates you that where this is on

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,540
the z axis doesn't matter at all.

69
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,220
All that does matter is where it is on the x and y axis.

70
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,950
So what does that mean.

71
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:05,090
Well that means that our curve itself when it's being used like this is a two dimensional object with

72
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,680
X and Y being the only coordinates that we worry about X in this case being its width and Y being its

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,420
height which is why if we move this point here this vertex at the very end across slightly we can produce

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,980
a hole in the middle.

75
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,820
Now I'm gonna rough out a rough idea here for a lamp base and of course we can tweak it in the challenge

76
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,570
itself.

77
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,170
Now you may want a sudden drop into that hole.

78
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,730
How do we do that with curves.

79
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,630
Well it's quite difficult when it's set like this but what we can do is select the whole curve right

80
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,640
click and subdivide it.

81
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,780
This will add a control point right where we want to.

82
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,570
In the middle it should give us a few more options for moving things around.

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,180
Now that we've added that you'll see that there are twice as many arrows going round.

84
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,780
So what we should really do is keep the level of detail or the resolution of the entire curve consistent.

85
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,200
So it was at 12.

86
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,850
Before we go over to the busier curve properties we lower that down to six it will now be consistent

87
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,780
with the amount of data that we had before.

88
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:20,480
So if we move this control point over here and move this one down slightly we've still got this curve

89
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,400
going round.

90
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,540
But what we can do is select the handle at the end we can move it round or we can try and gets it's

91
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,180
looking like it's 90 degrees or we can just go ahead.

92
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:38,810
Press the V key and change the handle type from automatic to vector vector is simply a straight line

93
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,240
and we do that to both of these.

94
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,460
What we will find is that it becomes a straight line which is really really useful.

95
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,430
That means we can then go g x move this back and have it in line and this will now go straight down

96
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:59,830
and you can see that over here in the viewport as well if we go back to wireframe mode for a moment

97
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,110
so we can see a bit clearer what's going on.

98
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:08,980
You can see here how we're able to form this particular shape very very easily just by manipulating

99
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,540
this curve.

100
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,270
The other thing that we can do if necessary is say we wanted to move this up a little and then extend

101
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,160
this particular line.

102
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,710
Well if we wanted to do that we could just select the control point that we want to extend.

103
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:31,520
Press the E key to essentially extrude new geometry and I'm going to scale that one in so that we don't

104
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,630
have control points overlapping.

105
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:41,550
Now the obvious issue here is we've got a lot of extra geometry really close in at this base point.

106
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,800
You can see here there's loads loads more.

107
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,730
So once again what we can do here is we can just lower the resolution of all of the lines ever so slightly.

108
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:56,150
But if you try and keep your basic curves as we've experienced in the past two points of inflection

109
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,150
that often helps massively.

110
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,060
But here we go we've got a shape coming on this one here looks more like a donut maker a bagel maker

111
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,940
or maybe a trifle dish.

112
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,730
I don't know it's not looking quite like a lamp base at the moment but I'm sure we can get that sorted

113
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,640
over in your challenge okay.

114
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,240
So this is a really straightforward challenge using curves creates the lamp base pulls for the year

115
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,380
now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

116
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:32,010
Let's hop on over into blender and use curves to create our lamp base OK Okay everybody so we're over

117
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,110
it.

118
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,260
Now seen at the moment I'm going to clear my render border and I'm going to select my lamp and I want

119
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,530
to hide everything else in my scene as a caveat when you do this to undo it will bring back even other

120
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,990
things that you've had and I'll show you that now shift and H solos that one object.

121
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,660
So that's one way of hiding everything from your scene and bringing it back.

122
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,110
Alton H Moore brings back cover stuff as well.

123
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,930
So let's go ahead then and hide everything from our scene.

124
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,910
So we've got our lamp here that we're going to work from now unfortunately our lamps origin is all the

125
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,760
way over here rather than where it was with the original drawing that we did.

126
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
There's a couple of ways that we can go ahead.

127
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,250
I am going to fix that right now I'm going to find the lamp sketch select that we can see the origins

128
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,250
there and I'm going to go shift an S cursor to selected it then I'm gonna go back to our lamp itself

129
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,960
and then select it right click set.

130
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,910
Origin 3d cursor.

131
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,600
There we go.

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:38,800
And we've got the 3d cursor in the right place to make our circle which is going to be our lamp base.

133
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,840
In this case I'm going to put in a path because that's what it is at the moment.

134
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,400
Now thinking about that path itself and remembering what we were talking about and the profile following

135
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,520
it round I really want this path to be a lot smaller because that's essentially where we're going to

136
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,100
end our profile and drop it down.

137
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,850
So I'm going to scale that in by maybe points one point one looks about right now I'm going to bring

138
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,930
up the properties panel here.

139
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:13,340
Notice I've got a scale on my curve throughout this section and you will find to your detriment if you

140
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:19,080
do not apply your scale or do your edits in edit mode it will cause a problem later on.

141
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,990
So it's really really important that you're mindful that you either do your edits in edit mode or after

142
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,180
you've done something like a scale control an A.

143
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,560
Apply that scale then we know it's got a scale factor of 1 it's not going to cause anything weird later

144
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,900
on I'm going to put the profile that I'm going to use actually back at the World origin it makes it

145
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,240
easier to work with.

146
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,610
As far as I'm concerned so busy a curve and I'm just going to move on the y axis downwards.

147
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,230
Okay let's look at this from the top.

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:56,440
Let's select how busy a curve this is going to be the lamp base profile.

149
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,050
Here we go.

150
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,900
So we got the lamp based path we can go there go to our object data properties our curve properties

151
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,540
I'm going to lower this down straight away the resolution preview because I don't want that gets in

152
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,120
the way I'm gonna go to the geometry and select my lamp base profile.

153
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,110
Brilliant.

154
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,590
So now we've got an idea of what's going on.

155
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,680
And as you can see here it's tiny at the moment but that's fine.

156
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,470
We can go ahead go into edit mode here and start tweaking these about remembering the X if I go in g

157
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,730
x it's going to pull it out.

158
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,970
Now you can see here it doesn't seem to be conforming to the scale that we wanted.

159
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,700
So let's just check and make sure there's nothing funky going on with scales here.

160
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:46,180
So this has got a scaling factor of 1 which is fine and the base has also that's absolutely fine.

161
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,390
Okay.

162
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,750
So we've got the base at roughly the right size.

163
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,780
I'm going to hide this out of the way for the moment our lamp that we had there.

164
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,140
Press H to hide it.

165
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,050
Let's go ahead grab this.

166
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,080
Now remember that that circle is where this origin is going to be.

167
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,520
So what I can do is whilst I'm in edit mode I can grab this anything to the left of that origin.

168
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,100
Now we go we start getting a circle.

169
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:15,300
So it's place it in the right place and at the origin we've got the circle in roughly the right size

170
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,400
that we want.

171
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,210
Okay so this is starting to look pretty flat but it's got a good start to it.

172
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm going to select all of my curve right click and subdivide to add a little bit of extra geometry

173
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,670
in a little bit of extra control.

174
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,510
Let's select these two handles here.

175
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,590
Press V and changed into vector because I do want these lists to basically be straight down so I'm going

176
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:44,580
to make that all the way up and fortune I can just set the x value here to be zero then I know it's

177
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:51,270
all the way up and let's move first x equals zero as well and it's definitely all the way up and then

178
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:58,570
g z or not GZ sorry G Y left it up depending on how high we go.

179
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,110
Let's have a look here.

180
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,920
We might need to bring our lamp reference back in.

181
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,380
I think that's probably the best we can do here.

182
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:13,010
I want to look at that from the side and was it still so let's just continually lift it up so about

183
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:13,590
there.

184
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:13,930
Okay.

185
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,480
That's high.

186
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,160
That's out of the way again.

187
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,020
So that's starting to look pretty good but it's not got quite the shape that we want.

188
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,860
So we can even add more information or we can adjust these handles to get the right sort of shape.

189
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,250
Now your lamp might be slightly different if it is.

190
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,400
Don't worry about it.

191
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,330
It'd be nice to see different types of lamp.

192
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,810
Now I'm moving this in a 3D world which is going to move it and make it look a bit odd.

193
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,450
So when you're doing this I still even know it doesn't matter that if your handle disappears up in the

194
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,970
z axis if you're looking at it's straight down in auth graphic projection you know that at least it's

195
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,030
going to remain pretty consistent.

196
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,720
So I think I want a little sort of lip in the middle so I'm going to select these two again and subdivide.

197
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,340
And then also I should be able to do is have a little bit of a lip just there we can see it's coming

198
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,970
into effect.

199
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,350
I'm going to lower that down to about there.

200
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,860
Let's have a look.

201
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,340
Yeah.

202
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,030
So I'm liking how that's looking.

203
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:22,310
Of course we can go ahead and render that see what it looks like and not very good at the moments that

204
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,750
bring everything back in.

205
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:32,330
So bolts and H whilst we're not in edit mode ult and H brilliant we've brought everything back in now.

206
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,030
The lamp doesn't actually have a material on it.

207
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,740
So that's not the end of the world.

208
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,380
And of course my computer is fast enough to render this out.

209
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,530
But if I wanted it to be a bit more high definition not as in resolution but in terms of the number

210
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:52,440
of samples that we're using let's say we set this back to 32 which is its default I can pop that render

211
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,120
border in and just check.

212
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,730
Very quickly how it's looking.

213
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,050
The other thing I might want to do here is a little bit of cleanup as well.

214
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,520
Now one of the things that you'll notice is after we've moved the origin of this.

215
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,890
Yes.

216
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:15,060
What's our lamp and lights have also moved position which is well which is right because they were linked

217
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,690
to where the origin is.

218
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,630
So let's go g y and pull those back into where they should be.

219
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,590
Excellent.

220
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,640
There we go.

221
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,550
We've got the lamp all sorted now.

222
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,480
As we start working on these and moving them around we are going to have to pay attention to what's

223
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,760
going on in the outline.

224
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,610
Because otherwise we end up with things on top of one another and our renders will end up horrible.

225
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,910
But we'll deal with that as and when it comes up.

226
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,590
So there we go.

227
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,120
My lamp has a new base.

228
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,090
It's not quite solid yet it's you can see through the bottom of it et cetera.

229
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,680
He says not not moving it around.

230
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,550
There you go you can see through the base of it.

231
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,170
If I hide the world you can see all the way up into the base not necessarily a bad thing if that's the

232
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,550
look you're going for.

233
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,200
But in this particular case that's not ideal.

234
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,540
Let's bring back to the world base now there are a couple of things here that I can do to tidy up.

235
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,030
I don't need that drawing any more we've got that and the other drawing that we started with the lamp

236
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,470
sketch that can also go.

237
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,680
We're not going to use it again at this point so it's pretty safe to delete and hide my lamp.

238
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,840
And if we just click the little eye in the outline it doesn't hide each children.

239
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,350
If we wanted to do that we press shift at the same time and it hide that.

240
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,330
So we've got our base just here looks a bit low resolution at the moment but we can sort that out in

241
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,840
a bit.

242
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,580
We've got the lamp profile stuck out here and in the height that's out of the way we can't hide the

243
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,740
lamp base path that is that object there.

244
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,610
That's fine.

245
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,480
OK.

246
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,090
Brilliant.

247
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,080
That is a nice little set up there and we can have a look at it all by itself as well to see how that

248
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,650
looks when it's rendered.

249
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,650
Nothing really exciting going on that we need to give it a good material at some point but we'll do

250
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,280
that later on.

251
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,410
How are your lamp bases coming along.

252
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,540
Please share them and show them off over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
