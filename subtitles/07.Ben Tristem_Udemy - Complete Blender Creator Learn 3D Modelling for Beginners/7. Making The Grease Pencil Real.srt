Hello everybody and welcome to this quick tip of solidifying the grease pencil as you can see here by

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,590
the end of this lecture you'll be able to make your grease pencil sketch into some real geometry.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,960
It's a great start when you need to create a place holder that it's not just a boring cone bit more

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,840
true to the final product.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,980
Let's find out more.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,390
Okay so let's start out by just cleaning up a little here I'm going to press the end key to get rid

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,080
of the properties panel and the tall shelf out of the way as well.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,230
So I'm going to remove the cone that we've just added.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,490
Now it does feel like a consulate's it.

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,450
Yes there we go.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm literally get into later.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,000
I could hide it but since we're going to have a place holder that's our sketch I think that will be

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,140
fine.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:51,900
So with our sketch selected just the lamp objects here what I can do is go ahead right click and convert.

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,850
Now you think it might be two mesh but no we want to convert it to busier curves because what we can

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,030
then do is have a look.

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,080
It's created this thing called primitives.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,620
And I can call that lamp as well.

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,920
Now if I do call that lamp because you can't have two objects both called lamp name to the other one

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,420
lamp 0 0 1.

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,610
So I'm going to go in here and change that to say something like lamp sketch or something along those

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,140
lines.

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,410
So we've kept the original date.

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,030
I'm going to hide that out of the way and then we've just got this rough outline in place.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,760
Okay.

26
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,030
Now before we go and make that solid what I'm going to do is add a light into the scene I'm going to

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,330
add in in this case as some lamp so we can lights at the scene.

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm going to press the Archy twice to rotate it round and to roughly the right location about there

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,110
because you can hop into rendered mode to see where the shadow is falling.

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,860
That's a good start.

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,810
We can refine that later.

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,680
Let's go back into solid shading selects our object here which is now a curve object and then go to

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,600
the curve properties so we scroll down these tabs here we get this green one of course this now color

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,870
coded which is really useful and we go to the curve properties.

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,920
Now this could be lamp properties or mesh properties depending on what type of objects you've got selected.

36
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,810
And then we'd scroll down here and go to where it says geometry.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,620
If we open up that drop down and then continue down to where it says Bevel we've got a depth that we

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,960
can use we just increase that slightly.

39
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,080
Look at that we've got ourselves a 3D object.

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,860
Now it won't be absolutely perfect but it's a brilliant start to making sure that things look really

41
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,570
nice.

42
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,920
Now we've got a couple of options here we can turn down the resolution and if you turn down the resolution

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,980
down to zero it's going to be as simple as it can be.

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,260
And if you ramp that up a little of course it's going to look more and more cylindrical.

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,210
Of course we can change the depth here to make it more of a wire or more like an inflatable lamp but

46
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm happy with the default of around point nought one which is just what you get when you click it just

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,080
the once.

48
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,570
Now the resolution itself I think having a simple one like that is absolutely fine.

49
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,470
Of course if you bump up massively all you're doing is adding extra unnecessary geometry into the scene

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,010
at this particular point.

51
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,240
So when we go for maybe one that's a good compromise between the two options there then finally I'm

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,500
going to go back to rendered mode and have a look.

53
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,930
Now the shadow doesn't look perfect and we know we can play with the contact shadows and other things

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,600
along those lines but because we got a sun lamp here one of the things to remind you of is unlike cycles

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,540
the sun lamp if it's a be owned if we just move this this way you can see that the shadow just disappears.

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,140
That wouldn't happen in cycles it does matter if you're using eevee where you put the look of how that

57
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,620
makes a huge difference where you put your some lamp so just bear that in mind when you're working so

58
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,260
focus on the direction of this case the directions all the way over there.

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,720
Go rotate that round ever so slightly press the AHA twice to have this trackable rotation.

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,990
I prefer that we're mucking around with shadows and let's place it about there it just moved it across

61
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,230
slightly and there we go we've got our scene set up a bit more geometry here and this is the great thing

62
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,660
it will now look like shadows there as well which is a really really good start.

63
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,610
We've got a place holder now that's much more representative of the final product.

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,720
Now if you've followed along with this instead of using a blank place holder I'd like to see how yours

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,200
looked when you went ahead and converted your grease pencil into real geometry please share your work

66
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,880
over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
