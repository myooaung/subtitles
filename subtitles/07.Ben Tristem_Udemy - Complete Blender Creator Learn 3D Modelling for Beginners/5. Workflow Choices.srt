Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,610
In this lecture we're going to have a look at expectations see you know what's coming up and also how

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,920
some of these decisions affect workflow versus doing it just yourself.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,170
Once you've gathered all of this knowledge because the methodology that we're using won't always apply.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,610
Sometimes you will do the modelling first and then rickets and that would be typical in industry for

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,810
instance you'd often not even do the rigging yourself it would be passed on to the rigor if you would

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,240
just doing the modelling or as a rigor.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,390
You may actually get a model passed to you that then you have to rig.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,890
But in this particular section we're going to end up with the same results.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,460
Whatever path we decide to take.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,910
But what is really important is that we test things as we go.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,530
So we're going to start off with a bit of a blender setup and explanations we've already set up the

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,900
scene ready to do some work in.

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,540
But because we're using cycles we need to understand how that works and how it works differently on

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:07,650
different computers with some with graphics card some with multiple use or try and cover the vast majority

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,020
of you out there so you know what to expect and how blender behaves because sometimes people get a bit

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,750
confused of why things are all noisy and or grainy and don't look very good especially since we've been

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,590
used to eevee up until this point.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,570
Now we're going to do many iterations through to the end even though the lamp won't be fully belts.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,160
So this alludes to what I was saying earlier where we would typically model something completely and

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,200
then go and rig it.

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,370
What we will be doing is modelling a part of the lamp then rigging it to make sure it's working as we

23
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,370
would expect it.

24
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,750
So rather than get to the end of the modelling stage only to find that we need to change something of

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:51,120
the model to make sure the rig works properly later on rendering times unlikely to be a lot longer than

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,030
the last section primarily because we're focusing on cycles and that does take longer to render than

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,160
evey does but throughout the section I will show you some hints and tips on to make sure even if you've

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,400
got a slower computer that you are able to get the best or the most out of your computer by only focusing

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,300
on areas that you actually want to see rendered and we'll be making the lamp and testing as we go.

30
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,300
That's the important thing.

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,390
So we wouldn't be necessarily following a typical workflow of making and modelling everything and then

32
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,310
rigging it and then animating it will be just testing things as we go to get the feel of everything

33
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,760
and then we'll loop background to the end.

34
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,440
And one of the things that we will be doing that is slightly different is we will be building all of

35
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,760
the components of the lamp as individual mesh objects.

36
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,500
And then at the very end combining them all together into one mesh objects.

37
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,430
The reason for making them separately is it just allows us to focus on the different parts of our model

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,490
individually make sure that they all work as expected and then finally put them all together into one

39
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,480
object.

40
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,110
The benefit of it being one object is then you can 3d printer then you can export one object and then

41
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,630
it will work in the game engines for instance if we leave a separate mesh objects it can be a real fast

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,950
to get it working externally in blender so we'll blend it all together at the end.

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,470
And of course if you wanted to after learning all of this knowledge you could create your lamp just

44
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,480
as one single mesh object.

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,890
But unfortunately because we'd be using things like the mirror modifier it would be best to build it

46
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,830
separately first rather than trying to do it in edit mode throughout that would be very confusing.

47
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,070
OK.

48
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,870
So without any further ado let's hop on over into blender and start setting up Arsene.
