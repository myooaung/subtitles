Hello everybody and welcome to this.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.010
Introduction to Ahmed chairs now Ahmed chairs consist of bones.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.620
Much like our skeleton does and you can see this bone here it's this pyramid type shape with a little

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.770
ball on top will be added to the scene.

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.030
Now this is the first stage in rigging rigging is a much larger topic which involves like being a puppeteer

6
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.820
putting all the controls in place to move your lamp.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.100
But in order to move your lamp we're going to have to put some bones in to begin with.

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110
And this is the first stage of.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.580
So let's find out how to add our first bone over in Blender okay.

10
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.200
So this is where we left off before our scene is set up by this now rather than playing about in our

11
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.070
scene and manipulating it there.

12
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.730
What's we're going to do is we're going to open up a new blend scene so we can just focus on the basics

13
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.030
of setting up and arm a chunk and discard any changes I just did there.

14
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.360
Okay so in our default blend scene what we need to do is first add our armature object now our armature

15
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.880
object consists of one or more bones and we're just going to deal with one bone at the moment and then

16
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.890
we'll add more later on.

17
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.620
So we go to our AB menu we can find armature under there.

18
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.410
When you add an armature you'll see just the top of the bone sticking out.

19
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.420
That's the tail end of the bone.

20
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.500
And what we can do here is make this visible no matter what we've got in front of it.

21
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.150
So what we do is we go over to our properties panel scroll down and go to the object data properties

22
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.610
or the little pitch Green Man little picture of a man jumping there and then we can scroll down here

23
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.700
and under viewport display there's an option to keep in front the other option I want to quickly look

24
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.390
at whilst we're here is the display as currently we've got it set to opt procedural.

25
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.870
You may want to experiment with some of his other options as well.

26
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.270
At the moment I like it like that because it's very easy to identify the parts of our armature.

27
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.830
So at the bottom here we've got the head of the bone and at the very top we've got its tail and having

28
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.060
it sets is OK to he drill means it's very easy to identify that visually.

29
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.390
Ultimately this is really important because the flow of how Bones interact especially with inverse cinematics

30
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.060
which we'll learn about later on they follow a motion from head to tail on each bone.

31
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.350
So it is important that you put things around the right way.

32
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.650
And if we go into edit mode we can just confirm that we can select the individual parts of our bone

33
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.070
or the bone itself.

34
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.520
And if we open up the sidebar properties we can see that we can move the head which is the bottom part.

35
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.240
Let's zoom out a little so we can see what's going on and the tail which is the top part individually

36
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.400
as well and just a reminder that we're building up the skeleton of our lamp.

37
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.540
Piece by piece rather than just all doing it at the end and this will give you a great understanding

38
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.030
because you'll be repeating the process as we go through this section and start adding more and more

39
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.710
to our model.

40
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.720
And also there will be times when you're constructing something and you need to add bone detail anyway.

41
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.150
So this is a workflow that's going to help you solidify the knowledge of making images.

42
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.120
And with that in mind it's time for your challenge.

43
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.560
Okay so your challenge.

44
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.490
If your lamp is not being constructed around the world Origin centre it's in your scene.

45
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.230
So mine at the moment is two or three blender units over to one side bringing it back into the middle

46
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.490
of the scene it's just going to help us when it comes to our construction.

47
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.220
So make sure it is around that center scene where X Y and Z are all zero ADD AN ARMATURE TO YOUR LAMP

48
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.560
MODEL but you didn't guess that one was coming.

49
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.500
And then finally you may find that the first bone that you've put there is too high so scale it to an

50
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.830
appropriate height.

51
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.630
You can even do that in edit mode or object mode.

52
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.950
Okay.

53
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.350
Pause the video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

54
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.510
Let's go hop on over into blender and add another much more to our lamp okay.

55
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.410
Everybody welcome back.

56
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.890
Let's go over to our lamp right.

57
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.920
So this is where we left off before.

58
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.850
Now one of the things that we're going to have to bear in mind is that the lamp itself is currently

59
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.930
not at the origin of our scene.

60
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.890
That can cause us a few slowdowns in our workflow.

61
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.180
We know that we're going to put it back over here at some point but I think a good place to put our

62
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.900
lamp at the moment is going to be all the way over here.

63
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.180
Now assuming everything's all linked together we should just be able to move it and place it at 0 0

64
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.280
0.

65
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.600
Unfortunately that's not the case.

66
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.670
It's not all parents together or anything along those lines so we're going to have to move all these

67
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.870
pieces over here somehow.

68
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.080
Now we could literally just work out how far we need to move on the y axis.

69
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.070
So two point six basically if we moved everything by the same amount it would work.

70
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.640
Now I'm pretty sure that this is all linked together.

71
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.530
It is as unlike the other parts of our lamp.

72
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.930
So this here Kate we've got the bulb and that's all linked together.

73
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.700
Now this doesn't really matter at this point in time but it is eventually going to go but if we select

74
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:19.040
to other objects as well and for the moment parent them to hear what we can then do is just move the

75
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.190
location of our parents objects which is the main lamp that we'd sketched earlier right back to the

76
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.610
beginning.

77
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.050
Okay appear to have not done the base but that's a very simple change I'm also for the moments going

78
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.180
to tidy up my scene a little more I'm going to hide the camera out the view and then hide these lamps

79
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.130
out of view as well so they're just not in the scene I'll have to bring them back later when it comes

80
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.640
to rendering and pieces like that but we need to clean up our scene at some point anyway.

81
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.390
So let's go back hide that.

82
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.090
We don't know this part of the lamp or the fake lighting that we need for evey at the moment.

83
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.680
And again we can come back and delete those later on if necessary.

84
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.430
So we've got two objects on top of one another here.

85
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.490
It's very hard to distinguish between the two.

86
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.880
Now I need to hide the lamp based profile so I'm going to go do that in the outline.

87
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.250
That's the easiest place to do that.

88
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.020
Let's close that back up again because the first thing we're now going to need to do is not hide that.

89
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.420
I thought I did.

90
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.460
What was the profile a head looks like something else is not hidden.

91
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.310
There it is the lamp base original.

92
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.340
Perfect.

93
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.820
Hey we'll do some tidy up later on.

94
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.960
So we've got everything all lined up in the center of our scene.

95
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.380
Really useful to work like that because it's very easy to add things have mirror modifiers work as you

96
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.170
would expect them to etc..

97
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.840
So let's go ahead now.

98
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.780
We don't have our 3-D cursor in the sense of the scene.

99
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.010
So I think this is at 0 0 0.

100
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:50.420
If not we can just go shift s cursor to selected or cursor to the world origin and then we can add in

101
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.190
our first armature.

102
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:59.090
Now what I am going to do for clarity is just scale this so that it's kind of in the right place so

103
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.080
let's look at it from the side and we don't need to worry about where it is at the bottom.

104
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:10.140
But if we scale this only on it z axis we can squish it down so ends up in the appropriate location.

105
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.540
Now much like everything else we need to make sure we apply our transform signal a shift and a and apply

106
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:24.110
the scale that will not only make this bone not look so squished but we'll also just make sure that

107
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.930
nothing funky is going to happen later on.

108
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.420
Finally what I can do here is with the armature settings make sure that we can see it because we're

109
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.220
going to be adding to this and constructing the rest of our lab very quickly from here.

110
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.520
Let's go to our viewport display and in front.

111
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.130
Perfect and to save my work.

112
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:44.620
Brilliant.

113
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.940
How did you guys get on looking forward to seeing your first armchairs coming together.

114
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.980
This is really exciting this is the first part where we start getting our lamp into a position where

115
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.630
we can move it's an animator and do some really cool stuff with it.

116
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.740
So I look forward to seeing what you've done so far.

117
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.610
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
