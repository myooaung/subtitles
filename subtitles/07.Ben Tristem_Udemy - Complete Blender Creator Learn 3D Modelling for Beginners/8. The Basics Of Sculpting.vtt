00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.400
Welcome to basic sculpting.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.680
In this video you will learn the basics of sculpting.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.300
Adjust your brushes type strength and size.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.720
Understand how dynamic top policy works and when to use it.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.710
And then finally how to find a brush.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.590
If you've accidentally deleted it send it on straight on over in a blender.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.840
Right so.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.650
Well now we're over in blender The first thing I want to do is we're going to be playing with something

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.070
that's quite destructive.

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.130
So I don't want to work on our fluffy bunny for the moment.

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.270
Somebody go ahead and open up a brand new blender file with our default cube in it and I suggest you

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.800
do the same.

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.130
Now to play with the sculpting tools.

14
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.160
So let's go ahead and start playing with the sculpting tool so if we hop down to where it says object

15
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.240
mode we've got a series of options and we're going to click on scolloped mode and you will see on the

16
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.260
left hand side in the tool shelf the menu options change.

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.030
Down here there are different tabs going down.

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.590
We're going to be focussed on each just the tools one here and I'm going to pull this out so we can

19
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.380
see a bit more of what's going on and down at the bottom here.

20
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.960
The menus have changed ever so slightly.

21
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.250
So what does this do.

22
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.570
Well we can literally start changing our cube about now as you can see um left clicking here and it's

23
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.260
kind of pulling the corners of ask you about we're not really changing its shape.

24
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.440
There's nothing awesome going on yet.

25
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.910
Now the reason for that is the brush tool directly affects the underlying mesh.

26
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.830
So in this case there are only eight vertices so the only thing I can move are the eight vertices and

27
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.060
everything else is joined to that.

28
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.700
So if I were to add more vertices to this mesh so if we go in and quick we're doing this is probably

29
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.110
just subdividing it and applying the subdivision so I'm going to go over to our modifiers.

30
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.910
I'm going to go down on the generate column turn subdivision surface modifier.

31
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.640
Of course it makes it kind of spherical.

32
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.880
I'm just going to add two subdivisions and apply them.

33
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.050
So now we have some more geometry to play with and we can see that in wireframe mode as well.

34
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.730
We've now more FA model about now it's not moving very much at the moment as we try and move it I'm

35
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.670
just clicking away and wiggling around and there we go.

36
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.930
It starts to move up and every time you go over the top of one of those verses again it moves it out

37
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.960
slightly and we can see here this is the type of brush we have and we're currently adding you can subtract

38
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.830
of course which does the reverse and pushes stuff in there we go.

39
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.960
So let's flick that ad for the moment.

40
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.890
Now the first thing I'm going to deal with is this radius and strength.

41
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.130
So the radius is the size of that brush.

42
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.280
Now you notice it's in pixels Now this is important because if you zoom in or out on your model you

43
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.660
see when it's all the way zoomed out here were affecting the entire model by doing this sculpting.

44
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.340
If we were to zoom in and we're only affecting one vertex in fact in this case but the radius of the

45
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.940
brush hasn't changed.

46
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.340
So depending on the scale of your model your radius will differ.

47
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.210
Now the shortcut for adjusting the radius of your brush is the F key on the keyboard.

48
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.490
And if we press F now we can see we can make that brush bigger and smaller and that outer red circle

49
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.180
will show the new sides.

50
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.910
Now you'll notice that it's faded and it's faded because it doesn't affect the entire area.

51
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.750
Equally it affects the middle more so than the edges and that helps with your sculpting otherwise you'd

52
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.730
end up with a very sharp lines.

53
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.040
Now if that's something that you wanted then you can control that the strength itself is currently set

54
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.380
to 50 percent and the strength allows you to be much more gentle with your sculpting.

55
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.780
So imagine that this was a real piece of clay in front of us.

56
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.350
If you went for it really heavily with a tool you would end up making more of an impression of changing

57
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.610
it more than if you were very gentle.

58
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.050
Ultimately you can do the same amount of sculpting at 50 percent you just have to do something twice

59
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.240
to get the same result as if it was up at 1 or roughly speaking.

60
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.200
However the lower the strings it does afford you more control when you're working on something detailed

61
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.290
now.

62
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.440
Unrest set the size of our brush down a little some.

63
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.970
To press the F key and move it back down.

64
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.480
So the strength of the brush can be changed either here in the tool shelf or it can be changed with

65
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.540
the sheath and F key.

66
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.900
Now you notice it gets this way is a bit counterintuitive.

67
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.590
The brush gets weaker or weaker less strength when you go towards the outer edge of the circle.

68
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.020
The big circle here and stronger as you move in and in so you'll want to pick.

69
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.930
I usually leave it around 50.

70
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.490
But if you need to make massive changes quickly obviously you can bump the strength up and if you need

71
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.550
to be more gentle and subtle with your changes you can lower the strength and have more control.

72
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.620
Now we've already covered the add and subtract.

73
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.720
They basically mean are you pulling the model outwards or pushing it inwards but at the top.

74
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.710
We've got this picture so we're not quite doing this in order here.

75
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.810
But that at the top we've got a picture of a brush and if we click on that it gives us a selection and

76
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.210
these are the default selection.

77
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.650
So we've got one two three four 8 16 18 different brush types to choose from and they all affect our

78
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.050
models slightly differently.

79
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.440
Obviously you can customize these like you can anything in blender.

80
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.920
That also means you can unfortunately delete something.

81
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.290
So if I go ahead now and.

82
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.090
Let's say this blob won't select it.

83
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.590
Now during the messing about up here if you were to experiment with it if you accidentally hit the F

84
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.940
key which removes the users from it and creates a fake user and then click the cross for some bizarre

85
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.940
reason.

86
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.650
And on top of that so it's still there at the moment.

87
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.310
You can see it's just there but it's got a zero next to it.

88
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.040
But if I now save this blend file.

89
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.210
So let's go ahead and save it and brush gone test.

90
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.380
Now if I call quits from my blender program.

91
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.250
Okay now I have quitted from Blender start it back up again.

92
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.410
Need it bring it down on to this screen.

93
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.050
Make it the right size.

94
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.170
Okay so go file an open response and go to brush contest.

95
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.810
Now it's not there anymore.

96
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.500
So if you hadn't realized you had done this you need to get that brush back so let's cast our eyes to

97
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.640
the sculpting head down at the bottom.

98
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.480
And there's a word there that says brush.

99
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.410
Okay and then if we click on that there are a series of options here one of which is sculped tool.

100
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.790
And the one that we've deleted was called blob.

101
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:59.030
So you may have to refer to an unaltered blender file if you were to do that but here we can go ahead

102
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.670
and go blob and that's added it back to our.

103
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.450
Oh no sorry.

104
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.210
That's overwritten the one that was there previous which was brush sculpt Clay case and we need to click

105
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.240
the plus to lock clays 001 and you can see that's here.

106
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.160
And with that one selected we can go in and go brush.

107
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.210
Sculpt tool blob.

108
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.570
And of course rename it's here to blob.

109
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.160
So if you wanted to modify your tools and you actually found a brush type you light and you were working

110
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.920
with volts you could go ahead and create a custom type.

111
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.080
And now you can see there are FS all across these.

112
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.340
That means it's got a fake user so that when you close blender down and open it back up again you will

113
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.660
see this again with materials.

114
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.180
In fact we covered it briefly in the material section before it has a zero next to it.

115
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.570
It means that the next time you close blender and reopen it it won't exist anymore.

116
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.270
Okay so finally we scroll down here you might not have the score yourself.

117
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.490
There's something here that says Dean toppo or dynamic topology.

118
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:11.210
Now as we mentioned to begin with this is actually turned off.

119
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:20.320
Now when I move this is moving that single vertex about if I enable dynamic topology it gives us.

120
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.680
You can see straightaway it's triangulated our mesh it needs to do that it can't work with quads.

121
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:34.880
And if we go in here and start modelling you see that is adding new vertices to our model enabling us

122
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.090
to add a fine amount of detail to that small area.

123
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:45.670
Yet if we look at the underlying mesh all in fact it's got reflection turned on as well that's important

124
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.200
and have a look at that in a moment.

125
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:54.660
So this here is adding detail where we need detail but keeping the rest of our model plane.

126
00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.670
Now that is quite important when you're modelling because in this area here doesn't need lots of geometry.

127
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:06.060
It's pointless having lots of geometry and if you cast your eyes up to the top we can see this.

128
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.990
This model now has nearly twelve hundred verses and if I draw some more in there it will go down.

129
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.290
Now why is it gone down.

130
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.700
Because I was zoomed out slightly.

131
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:20.610
In fact if I zoom out a lot so this brush size is the entire model and click.

132
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.700
It's dropped everything down so you can see that dynamics apology is very useful.

133
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:32.990
But if you didn't know that actually zooming out and using it will actually lower the amount of polygon

134
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.910
in your scene that could be very destructive if you've just been working on some detail.

135
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.390
You'd have to obviously go and undo it.

136
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.730
But if you'd gone past your undo buffer you'd be pretty much stuck.

137
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.940
Okay so final thing now on reflection.

138
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.440
So further down we've got symmetry.

139
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:58.020
And we can see here the direction on dynamic top ology here because we've got it enabled it is minus

140
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:05.680
X 2 plus X so if we were looking front onto our model here and this was the site we can give it some

141
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.380
must give it some is I suppose if you wanted or a nose and we can see that we can start building out

142
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:19.300
a model very quickly and I haven't really played with this too much going on here and we can see if

143
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.810
we turn dynamic top ology off.

144
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:29.180
Symmetry and symmetry lock down here is locked to the x axis at the moment which means that as you can

145
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:35.630
see here along the access it will mirror and we can change that if we want to the y axis which will

146
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.630
do this way and then Z access wince will do the top and the bottom.

147
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.800
And of course that will depend on the orientation of your model.

148
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.970
So one final thing to cover here is smoothing the auto smooth feature.

149
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.890
So as you're going around your model and adding You may end up with it not being quite as smooth as

150
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.820
you wanted.

151
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:01.580
Now there is a brush here that is smoothing as well which is this one here looks granya and smooth and

152
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.210
that one itself will help smooth out details.

153
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.570
If you've made too much of a sudden change in your model.

154
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:15.310
Now if we have a look back at a normal brush time let's go back to blob and we can see here also smooth.

155
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.430
If we turn that up as you're modelling it will help smooth out the details so it won't be as aggressive.

156
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:28.640
The other thing that you can do when your modelling is press the shift key and this will smooth as your

157
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.170
modelling so it's no longer doing the blob it's doing smoothing so it can help flatten out details.

158
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:40.090
If I let's go here it's up the strength to one and really bring this out here.

159
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:47.380
Let's turn on dynamic topology as well to make sure we get detail in there as well so that's bringing

160
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.890
it really far forward like that.

161
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:56.020
Now if we wanted to make all this jaggedness smooth Well we can just hold down Shift as I'm just going

162
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.750
to make the window a bit bigger so we can see what's going on.

163
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:05.230
I can hold down Shift as I'm doing this just to run over these aggressive details to smooth them out.

164
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:12.310
Now of course if you wanted a large amount of detail then you may want to go back again with a smaller

165
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.390
brush and add in that detail.

166
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.240
Now do be careful when using the smooth of course because as you can see here this lovely point that's

167
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.080
coming out.

168
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.880
If I just smooth it eventually it will end up flattening it back down because that's what it will tend

169
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.660
towards.

170
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.530
But smoothing your model out helps massively.

171
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.350
And we can see here that you can see all the faces.

172
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.810
Perhaps you don't like that of course in object mode.

173
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.120
What we haven't done here is set the shading to move it we set the shading to move.

174
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.270
We get a much better appreciation of how that's looking.

175
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:48.100
Of course when it's flat we get a much better pression of the underlying geometry.

176
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.050
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

177
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.830
I'd like you to define your bunny shape.

178
00:12:54.050 --> 00:13:00.050
So the head will want the most detail since it's a focal point for our model recommends making sure

179
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.120
symmetries turned on it's going to make making your model much much better.

180
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:10.370
Now use reference material for an accurate shape although if you do want to caricature your bunny rabbit

181
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.820
then please do so.

182
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.320
It's cheap.

183
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.550
Remember this is your model.

184
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.560
There's no right way of modelling a bunny.

185
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.940
As long as everybody sees it as a bunny that is great.

186
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:27.530
Now do models the is at this stage to using whatever method you want an ad to use is for the eyes and

187
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.290
keep them as a separate object for now.

188
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:37.360
Now I would suggest with the IS themselves that too quickly block model a couple of years basically.

189
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:44.150
And then join them to the rest of the mesh rather than trying to use the sculpting tools to create is.

190
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.480
Although if you want to do that do give it to go have fun with it.

191
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.970
Pause a video now give that a go.

192
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.570
Now because of the length of the solution for this video the actual solutions will not be in this lecture.

193
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.940
It will be in the following lecture.

194
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:04.340
So get creating your bunny and I will see you in the next lecture.
