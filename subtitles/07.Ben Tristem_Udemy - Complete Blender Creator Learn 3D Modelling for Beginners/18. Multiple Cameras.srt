1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:08,430
Welcome to multiple cameras in this video you will add another camera to the scene change the primary

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,160
camera.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,570
Learn how to quickly move the camera around and change the camera's properties.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,320
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,940
So we're left with our bunny here and we're going to hop back from the image ed which you were in at

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,170
the moment over to the 3-d view.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,430
Now we're over in the free TV.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,750
I'm just going to move this across just a little.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,580
And I'm simply going to take a duplicate of our camera.

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,780
I'm going to zoom out a little selects my camera in the 3D view.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,750
It's highlighted orange and using shift ends.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,930
Make a duplicate and place it over there.

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,680
So we've now got two cameras in our scene.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,750
If we go down to view and view from the camera view it'll go straight back to camera.

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,860
Well the one that's just cool camera and one called cameras 001.

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:10,430
So I'm going to name this camera over here camera wide and we'll make that a wide angle lens in a moment.

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,850
So we've got our two cameras here.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:19,000
But how do we how do we actually view it from the camera or this wide one that we've just made well

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,290
down once that's selected.

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,630
Down on view and cameras.

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,310
You can set the active object as the camera.

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,200
You can see the shortcut.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,680
There is control and no pads zero just switching to the active camera is no pad zero is very straightforward.

24
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,560
Your cursor does have to be in the 3D window control and zero will switch the camera over here.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,130
So we've got these two cameras that we can select and go backwards and forwards between.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,070
Have to be over 3D view.

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,250
Mary Kate so why would we want to do this.

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,080
Well there will be times in your scene where you don't want to keep having to move the camera about

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,620
between certain positions where you can just have it set up.

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,200
Another reason would be if you had different styles of camera so a wide angle where you can see lots

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:15,380
of a scene or a close scene shot there's a lot of theory on the size of focal length as to what you

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,830
require.

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,670
But this isn't a camera course it's a call some blender so are only touch on it very likely.

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,370
Focal length is measured in millimetres.

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,770
And basically the lower the number the wider the angle will be.

36
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,350
So the more you'll be able to fit in your scene and the closer your camera will have to be to any object

37
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,470
and you also get that very wide angle look a lot of state of videos and things like that have that fisheye

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,280
lens.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,070
Now a fisheye is an extreme wide angle it pretty much encompasses everything in front of the camera.

40
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:55,190
But it's a bit distorting as well portrayed tends to be around 80 mm something like that telephoto if

41
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:04,740
you're taking a photo of a bird or an animal in a distance you may have 200 300 400 even higher mm lens.

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,360
Now if you were replicating something in a blender that you wanted to do in real life then of course

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,960
you would have to make sure you'd also set up your camera appropriately by default.

44
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,890
And we can have a look at these settings.

45
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,170
Now we've got the camera selected at the top here in the propertys window.

46
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,250
There's a camera.

47
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,430
And when we click on that we can see the focal length here is set to 35.

48
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,810
And that's great.

49
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,550
That's a great standard size 50 mimics the human eye.

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,690
That's a good number to remember there.

51
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,410
But of course it all depends on what you want to do if you're doing a wide open landscape.

52
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,830
You probably want a wide angle lens.

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,140
You're zooming right into the eye of an animal you're probably not going to be right up next to that

54
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,710
animal.

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,740
So I'd look really odd if it was wide angled apart if you're looking for an odd type of view then it's

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,200
a perfect way of getting there.

57
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,160
So we've got our focal length here we can lower that and raise it and if we set that down to something

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,300
like 10 it looks like it's just moved further back from the Rabbit.

59
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,310
But in fact hasn't.

60
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,270
But I want to move my camera now towards that now is selected at the moment.

61
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,910
One of the great things you can just do is open up your properties tabloid press the nke and up here

62
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,330
there's a button that says Lock camera to view.

63
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,720
Now the great thing about this is as you move around the camera moves too which is very powerful when

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,910
your having to position a camera.

65
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,760
So now we're at this silly wide angle.

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,530
You can see that the rabbit becomes much more distorted.

67
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,770
And if we take that down to something crazy like five.

68
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,830
That's not what the Rabbit looks like anymore but we can fit the whole rabbit in the scene.

69
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,790
If we come out of the camera view for a second to see that the camera is actually there it's really

70
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,880
really close to our rabbit.

71
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:05,210
Now if we set that back to let's say 50 like the human eye all that might not actually work.

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,530
Oh yeah.

73
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,410
There we go.

74
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,420
We're right up against the rabbits.

75
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,290
There's a big difference between 50 and five.

76
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,890
As you can see and if this was a real rabbit we'd probably be taking a photo from all 300 mill lens

77
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,740
or greater.

78
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:26,650
And yet we would be very close to grab at that point so we can move the camera out of just present twice.

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,290
They're to move just backwards.

80
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,990
And now to fit the whole rabbit in view you can see it's also not distorted as much.

81
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:41,900
Well here's a good thing to watch here we've were reaching the clipping point of the camera so I will

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,070
just leave it about there.

83
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,790
So the heads in shot but let's go see where that camera happens to be.

84
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:54,770
I'm going to remember to turn off lock camera view because now when I move away I'll be able to see

85
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,880
the cameras all the way over there as if you were hiding in the bushes taking a photo of this rabbit.

86
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,700
So there we go if change some of the camera properties we can move around.

87
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:16,550
Control and no pads zero or down here in the camera's menu under the View menu here cameras.

88
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,580
You can set an active one so if we want to go to this wide angle lens here and I go over the 3D view

89
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,670
and the control in 0 There we go back to that when I can lock the camera it's a view and just rotate

90
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,170
it round and move it about.

91
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,960
So that then I get it back in shot absolutely fine.

92
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,840
Now the active camera is the one that renders as well so if we go ahead and render here it will be using

93
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,610
the camera wide in order to render our shots.

94
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,460
However if we then set the active camera to this one here the just the one that's called camera.

95
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,680
So there we go that's Camera wide rendering that one now if we go back over to the 3D view and get a

96
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,460
camera and go view cameras set camera say active objects as the camera.

97
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,400
There we go that's that done.

98
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,400
Now if we go and render again we're now going to be rendering it from that camera viewpoint.

99
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,730
So if you're playing about this make sure you've got the right camera when it comes to rendering the

100
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,870
shots that you want to do.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,270
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

102
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,340
I'd like you to create another camera so create a couple of new cameras.

103
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,090
Play about with the settings that we've just done.

104
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,700
Gets used to how the camera handles and sets one of the new cameras took a wide angle break quite close

105
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,540
to the Bunny and I suggest about 18 mm pause a video now and give that a go.

106
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,340
Okay guys.

107
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,120
Welcome back.

108
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,460
Let's hop straight back over into blender.

109
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:58,190
So I've already created a couple of cameras here and I'm going to call this one here camera 35.

110
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,780
And the other camera up here and then record it camera.

111
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,320
Three hundred eight not three thirty three hundred and I'm going to duplicate another camera.

112
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,450
So the easiest way I could add a new camera to a scene if I wanted to but I'm just going to duplicate

113
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,230
this camera 35 with shift Andy.

114
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:27,860
And unguaranteed was all the way over to espy control in zero so I can see what's going on with cameras

115
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,180
zero zero zero.

116
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,820
I mean we call this camera 18 so I know what it is.

117
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,710
Down in the lens properties of the camera.

118
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,430
I'm going to set that to 18 and see what the views like.

119
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,710
And I'm going to position the camera and lock the camera at two of you.

120
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,620
And let's just zoom in just a little bit more.

121
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,900
Probably about there and to rotate round a little.

122
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,730
Let's look up on the bunny Let's make the bunny huge in our scene.

123
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,210
Sue me out ever so slightly.

124
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not quite happy with that.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,180
I want to see more of the is in the scene.

126
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,020
This way a little over a take rameau course.

127
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,660
This is all artistic licence has no right or wrong way of doing this.

128
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,580
There again let's render and see how that looks because that's the active image.

129
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:28,000
It's always a good idea to render things out or at least have a small part of the scene rendering.

130
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,880
X. And so that's what my Rabbit looks up like when it's got an 80 mil lens pressed against its face.

131
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,570
I'm just going to make sure that I've got on here go back to the 3D view can uncheck this lock camera

132
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:48,980
to view because the last thing I want to do is actually move the camera after I've set it all up.

133
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,260
One thing you will notice is that when you zoom in an ounce that's obviously the view the cameras got

134
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,500
there when you click lock camera to view.

135
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,710
Well now the cameras zooming in and out so as before you probably saw that it was like that on my screen

136
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,280
and I was zooming in and I could see enough on my screen.

137
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,070
Sorry if you couldn't see much going on there but you could zoom in and reposition it from there and

138
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,610
get a much better feel about what's going on.

139
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,260
Brilliant.

140
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,650
How did you guys get on.

141
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,700
Love to see your wide angle rabbits.

142
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,470
Please share them in the discussions.

143
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,080
And I will see you in the next lecture.
