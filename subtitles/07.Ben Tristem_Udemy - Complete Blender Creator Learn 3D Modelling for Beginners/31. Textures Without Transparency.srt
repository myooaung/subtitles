00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,250
Welcome to texture's without transparency in this video you will import an image with out a transparent

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,390
layer which means no alpha Channel.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,500
We're going to understand that this is useful if you have no image editing software to hand no time

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,790
to process a load of images or just trying out images for your textures.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,520
So what is our offer.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,030
Well basically an image contains an alpha Channel.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:35,890
Each pixel is represented Additionally by a numerical value which specifies the opacity of that pixel

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:45,250
in how four channels 100 percent or a value of one specifies it's being opaque and zero or zero percent

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:53,140
or zero specifies a transparent pixel i.e. it emits nothing is completely transparent.

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,180
Now we must understand that this is not the best way is I ideal to have a solid coloured background

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,250
with these images.

12
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,380
It is 100 percent black or 100 percent white to help separate the image from the background.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,320
White is better because your image itself may contain black and we don't want to make anything that's

14
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,450
dark in the limited transparence.

15
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:20,770
Now it would be best if your images are processed to include an alpha or a transparency channel.

16
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,480
So then we have the red green blue and alpha.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,240
So RG be a.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,930
That's what that little acronym you'll see dotted about the place means.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,600
Okay so now we've discussed those bits.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,520
Let's hop over and see this in blender.

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,780
Okay so back over in blender.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,050
Let's go ahead and import the image that does have a background image.

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,550
So let's move these to grass.

24
00:01:50,270 --> 00:02:00,560
Plant out the way and centre the 3D cursor and go ahead and add a mesh as an image as planes go into

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,020
the next nature's pack and the grass blade would background.

26
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,400
Gee peg and if we go to the thumb now you can see it's quite clearly here now.

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,590
This one here.

28
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:17,960
And if a grass blade 01 or grass blazer a three are actually the same image I have gone in with an image

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,850
editing software and created the PRNG for it.

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:29,900
But we go into play now with the background and essentially use Blender itself to create a mask to basically

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,980
do the job of Alpher ring.

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,220
To make that white background transparent.

33
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,270
So let's open up the image and see what we've got now.

34
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,310
I think at this point in time we can bring in our our nodes that we know he works.

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,970
Some of the deletes the diffuse shader.

36
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,680
And I'm going to add in the one we've already built the transparence be STF.

37
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,930
Oh no not that one.

38
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,110
I do apologize.

39
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,050
I can't remember what I've called it is a very good idea to remember what you've call things.

40
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,770
How embarrassing.

41
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,010
In fact the easiest way of quickly checking it is called Make.

42
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,380
Okay so let's go in and search for make.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,070
Perhaps I should have put transparent at the front.

44
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,120
Important when your naming files that you obviously remember what you name their name I forgot what

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,970
I've named in five minutes ago.

46
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,940
Oh my word.

47
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,800
So let's link these things together.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,640
So the colorin and the shader out and we should get the image appearing.

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,900
And what we're going to do is break out this group here.

50
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,030
We've got a a factor here going up and down because there's nothing actually plugged in at the moment

51
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,360
and this factor was going to control the transparency so because it set at zero It means that it's completely

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,140
transparent.

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,110
If you remember a value of zero means that the alpha channel lets everything through it's completely

54
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,610
transparent.

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,910
And if we set that's whole one then we see the image in its full glory.

56
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,840
Now we can't use the alpha channel of the image text because it doesn't have one it's as simple as that's

57
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,630
a J plague.

58
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,700
It's outputting R G B red green and blue pixels and that's it.

59
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,320
So we're going to have to create our own.

60
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,590
Alpher chenowith sensually how we can use the colour coming out of here to do that.

61
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,090
First of all let's expand our group here.

62
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,550
So once the group is selected we're going to have to edit it slightly so let's go into node and ungroup

63
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,790
and you can see the shortcut key there is often G and that will break it apart again into its various

64
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,440
parts.

65
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:45,950
So before when we had the colour coming through into the diffuse shader here and coming out into our

66
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:52,520
surface material that's flowing through here now the transparence one isn't doing anything at the moment

67
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,560
because it doesn't know what to mix in fact it's just is it's transparent and if we move this up and

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,310
down it just makes our image our whole image transparent or not.

69
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,660
So I'm going to have to add something using the colour channel itself into this chain to control this

70
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,200
factor.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,430
We're going to have to essentially make our own mask.

72
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,480
So let's see what happens when we move the colour into the factor.

73
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,920
Let's just try that so makes it go black.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,920
That's good because that means that we will if we play around with these we can see that the colour

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,470
itself has some influence over what's shown and what's not what becomes black and white so there is

76
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,230
some information there that we can use.

77
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:40,660
So with that in mind what we've got to consider here is how what do we need to link in from the colour.

78
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,410
And what do we need to come out in order to make our mask.

79
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,180
Well if the image is white here we need any think that's probably less than white.

80
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:56,150
And remember a white on the value of nought to 1 is 1 on red green and blue.

81
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,480
It's 100 percent red 100 percent green 100 percent blue.

82
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,160
Anything that's less than 100 percent.

83
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,330
We can leave on an anything that's higher than that can be transparent.

84
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,620
So I've got a challenge for you with that in mind.

85
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,710
I would like you to make the white background transparent.

86
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,910
Now you will need a maths node for this change the Node 2 an appropriate type.

87
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:33,150
Think about what needs to be done to that white background what does it need and make the white background

88
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,370
transparency you may have to change the value in order to make nice neat or even zoom into the image

89
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,440
to make sure that you've not gone over the top.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,450
So pause video now and give this ago.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,620
Okay guys.

92
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,690
Welcome back.

93
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,410
Before we hop over into blender you did give this a go right.

94
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,920
I know it's quite tricky.

95
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,940
The maths now looks complicated if you haven't paused video again and do give it a go for the rest of

96
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,500
you.

97
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,830
Let's hop straight on over into blender and link all of these things up.

98
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,420
So we're going to use the colour channel coming out of here to control this factor at the moment just

99
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,230
to bring the whole image and I know we need a maths node and I've told you that as well because otherwise

100
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,550
finding it is a difficult.

101
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,590
So searching for maths for that's what I've done before so let's bring up the maths node where the reason

102
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,770
why it's a bit of a pain to search for is simply because it's not called what you need it to be called.

103
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:39,230
So I'm just going to plumb in the colour to the value and this value here coming out.

104
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,700
In fact I'm going to look at straight what I'm generating first of all so I'm going to see the mask

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,670
I'm creating because I've cut off the output is now showing me exactly what's going on with this at

106
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,240
the moment.

107
00:07:51,300 --> 00:08:00,000
And now I want this white surface anything that's this white surface and it is less than white or greater

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,550
than black or something to be right so let's try less than whites to begin with.

109
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,640
So let's go down to less than.

110
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,250
Excellent.

111
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,910
So let's play with this value here and see what it does.

112
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,740
So obviously a value of minus 18 is not going to be great.

113
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,050
Let's start at zero and just click this one.

114
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
Times are images appearing when we're doing that.

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,330
That's looking great.

116
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,700
So let's just keep upping it.

117
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,510
And when it our There we go when it reaches one.

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,000
It's not complete.

119
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,910
I bet every ticket one further the whole thing goes white.

120
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,510
Okay.

121
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,270
So I think this is the setting we need which is looking really good and obviously at some point we're

122
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,590
going to lose the image itself.

123
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:47,870
So by plugging the value and back into the factor and then the shader output to the surface are that's

124
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,360
looking really good.

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,650
Let's zoom into the surface and see how it's looking now I've got a value here of points 6.

126
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,560
And if I turn up eventually the edges get really fuzzy.

127
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,080
Now obviously if there's anything that is pure white on our image it can start to eat away so this edge

128
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,910
here is actually quite light.

129
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:15,390
So if we go too low on this value it starts to put gaps in our image and that is no good.

130
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,450
We see there that part of our image is now missing and up here in fact there's a whole section missing.

131
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,600
So let's go up and that's about 50 percent at the moments that's increased a little more.

132
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:32,570
I think that area at the top there's thin anyway so by the looks of things about a value a point six

133
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,570
seems to look quite good.

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,630
Excellent.

135
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,740
Do try this with other images you've got to go out and grab something take a photo of it against a white

136
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,880
background and see how it comes across in blender.

137
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,160
Do share your blade of grass in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
