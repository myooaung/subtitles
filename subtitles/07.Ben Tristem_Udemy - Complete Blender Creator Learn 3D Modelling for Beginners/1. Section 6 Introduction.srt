Hi guys.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,460
Welcome to this new section.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,850
We're going to be focussing on making a fluffy bunny sat in a field of grass.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,970
So what are we going to learn in this section.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,270
Well we're going to be covering the beginnings of the particle system and will realize how powerful

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,430
that's going to be.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,600
Also going to be looking at our first texture's we're going to actually be painting directly on our

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,390
model once we've made it.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,200
Also are going to do sculpting so we're going to create two blobs.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,960
And from that create the basic shape of our rabbit.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,850
There's lots of exciting things to do in this section.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,540
So let's crack on and dive straight over into blender.
