00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.600
Welcome to adding random nurse with children in this video.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.490
You'll adjust the particle settings to get a more realistic and less uniform hair appearance.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.410
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.410
Okay so we have our bunny in front of us and I'm just going to switch across to the 3-d view.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.140
Okay.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.180
And let's focus on just one particular part of the bunny at the moment and let's focus on the body itself

7
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.020
so I'm going to turn the other particle systems off.

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.680
So it's nice and quick to move around.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.020
Now at the moment our bunny has a very uniform look to it looks very shiny very sleek.

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.160
Now tear tends to be quite uniform when it's shorts.

11
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.530
But you still have these stragglers roaming about.

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.340
But you can also have tuft's.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.100
I mean hair isn't going to be completely regular as if it has been combed.

14
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.300
Especially on a wild animal.

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.630
So we're going to have to add a bit of randomness into that.

16
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.560
So on the part cool properties over here we've got a selection of options under our children.

17
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.560
So moving further down from our display and our renda Settings here the seeds etc..

18
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.200
Long hair.

19
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.590
Well we're not gonna use that because it is relatively short here.

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.550
But you would use that option if you approve it.

21
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.260
Perhaps making a lady and you wanted long hair you know going down to the waist line rather than a short

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.410
bob or something like that.

23
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.980
Anyway back to this here so klump.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.450
Now this goes from minus 1 to 1.

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.930
And when it's set to minus one that means it will clump together at the root.

26
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.460
And in this case it will mean the children clump together round the parent close to the skin and then

27
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.390
radiate out from there when it's set to one it's the other way round it starts further away in clumps

28
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.330
together at the tip of the hairs.

29
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.930
Now this doesn't seem to be working at the moment so let me investigate why it's not working.

30
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.190
Have I come across a bug or have I forgotten something.

31
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.710
Okay so I've just worked out what was going on there why those settings weren't changing for me.

32
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.110
That's just simply because I had the wrong particle system selected here.

33
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.030
So even though the body hair was being viewed I had actually Selecta chest hair.

34
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.940
I've made some changes as I was feeling about so I'm just going to open up the saved file I'd made and

35
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.360
I do suggest at all times you keep a regular save going on.

36
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.260
Let's go back to where we were before now with body hair here.

37
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.790
That's a good learning for us all.

38
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.120
So let's have a look at our bunny and let's let's hide the properties and tool shelf so we can see more

39
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.400
of our lovely body.

40
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.540
Okay so we were talking about the clump of the clump value at negative one clump sit at the base and

41
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.480
at positive one clumps at the end.

42
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.030
Now that I mean that looks a bit silly but might be good for grasses because they tend to clump together

43
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.710
at their roots and then come out from there.

44
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.250
And if you had a wet rabbit it would probably have a clump value of one as hairs do tend to clump together

45
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.190
when they're wet.

46
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.350
And I'm going to render that.

47
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.540
So I want to see if it does in fact look like our bunnies gotten a little soggy.

48
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.030
It does indeed it looks either wet or greasy.

49
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.950
Okay so let's hop background to the 3-d view.

50
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.990
And we probably don't want it clumping together too much but since hairs clumped together naturally

51
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.700
having a little bit of clump does add to this sort of realism of our model.

52
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.450
So looking at the length here well if we set it down to zero it makes them all very short.

53
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:57.380
And the threshold under neefe Simply tells blender the percentage of hairs that are at this lower value.

54
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.190
So that's good.

55
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.820
If you've got a lot more hairs in here for making sure you've got a variation in hair length.

56
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.720
So if I reduce that ever so slightly and then have the threshold not all the way down here.

57
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.300
Not all the way at the top but somewhere in the middle we get a nice compromise so let's have a short

58
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.310
length and the threshold of ones that like fat quite high.

59
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.770
There.

60
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.070
So partings not going to give us too much of a difference in our model but we can see it does make a

61
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.090
slight difference to the hair itself.

62
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.230
Now uniform the roughness.

63
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.300
These are all roughness settings here.

64
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.730
So we've got the uniform ness of it and it's currently set to zero.

65
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.730
And if we play with extremes here so we just slide that up gradually to one you can see it gets increasingly

66
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.510
more and more scruffy until it goes over one and carries on going.

67
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.940
And that's a very very fluffy bunny.

68
00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.240
So this is basically telling blender how disorganized is going to become the size here.

69
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.950
As you can see causes a few ripple effects and gives us the size of the disorder.

70
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:14.820
So if you imagine the hairs themselves if you had a metre long hair and the size was high it would.

71
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.880
Be disordered.

72
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.000
But it would ripple in a very long ripple.

73
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.230
But if you pull the size back down it causes this disturbance it looks like a ripple at the moment doesn't

74
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.460
it as it's going down but it causes more and more and more kinks in the hair.

75
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.070
It ends up a very scruffy Bunny.

76
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.070
So we render it out whilst it's looking like that it's going to look not like it did before it's actually

77
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.530
going to look like a very rough matted hair as we can see here.

78
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.710
And in fact it does look more matted than the head does.

79
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.950
So we can use that to our advantage as well.

80
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.590
In this case that looks again is gone too far.

81
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.130
I don't think a rabbit would ever have hair that looks like a bristle brush.

82
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.250
So again let's go back to the 3-d VIEW.

83
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.580
We're going to set the uniform here.

84
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.350
I'm going to play with these figures just a little bit and probably make it just a little bit fuzzy

85
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.700
but not much.

86
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:21.910
Now the end point that changes how the end of the hair the very end of the hair itself is actually being

87
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.700
roughed up.

88
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.850
So it changes the direction of those very end hairs.

89
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.200
So we look towards the end of hairs and I move this.

90
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.410
It deviates them around and you see because there's a lot of children there.

91
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.380
It tends to move everything around at once.

92
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.360
So we've got to be careful about not creating escorts of a wave pattern going on.

93
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.650
Plus we certainly don't want that.

94
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.980
But having a little point there does change it.

95
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:53.710
How the shape itself determines where on the hair that it starts are actually changing so at zero it's

96
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.740
going to start changing at the base.

97
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.840
And we can see there it's moving the whole hair about.

98
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:06.340
And if we increase that up is going to change the very very ends of the hairs instead which gives them

99
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.290
again a much more realistic appearance random.

100
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.090
Now this as you can probably guess adds randomness to our model.

101
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.560
The higher we increase the randomness the more scruffy our model will get.

102
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.360
And then we've got to size value.

103
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:28.720
So if we change the size value that changes how does the same the size on the uniform it changes how

104
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.960
much randomness is across the whole hair so the larger sizes the more the randomness is spread over

105
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.810
the hair rather than lots of little changes in the hair.

106
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.390
So if we change the size all the way down we can see it becomes very very disordered.

107
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.100
However if we change it up it comes more and more back into being uniform.

108
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.140
And of course we want probably a little bit of that in our model as well.

109
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.230
And the threshold of course very similar to the threshold with the length when it's at 100 percent here

110
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:08.170
or 1 then none of the hairs none of the particles are left untouched by the random rough amount.

111
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.240
But if we decrease that's more and more particles or more and more hairs.

112
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.990
In this case become randomized.

113
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.260
So let's just have a quick look in the rendered image how our bunny is looking.

114
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.190
So it's certainly looking a little more rough around there.

115
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.140
But I do want it to be a little more fluffy.

116
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.710
So we're going to have to experiment with here so I think I need to up the end point disorder and that

117
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.600
set that value perhaps at one and this one at point two.

118
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.980
All that might be a bit fluffy.

119
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.520
So said it appoint one.

120
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.630
And let's go and render again.

121
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.290
Doing this over and over again it's not a bad thing you're going to have to have a look.

122
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:56.180
And the reason why I'm going straight for the rendered mode rather than viewing it in the viewport is

123
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.450
because if I view it in the viewport I'm not seeing all of the hairs involved.

124
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.710
And we still have this bald patch on our bunny just here so I'm going to go ahead and investigate that

125
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.960
now and see what's going on.

126
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.030
So we're looking at it from here and I can see straightaway that there is a lack of hair around there.

127
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.760
Couple of options that we can do with that because I don't want to have to restyle the bunny just yet.

128
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.910
Let's just see if it's a virtex issue so let's go in select the body.

129
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.180
That's what we're doing.

130
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.830
So we've got that selected.

131
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.550
And let's go into white paint and just add I've assuming I've got ADD turned on.

132
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.600
Yes.

133
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:42.220
And I'm just going to go in here and add more hair to this area.

134
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.570
It just in case that's not enough.

135
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.460
And see if that covers up half poor rabbits bold spots.

136
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.570
So let's go back to work.

137
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.690
We can just render it now and see if that solve the issue if it hasn't we might have to change some

138
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:04.340
of the options perhaps just increasing the number of children ever so slightly so that's still not covered.

139
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.560
That area there.

140
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.470
So let's go into the particle options and can we increase the number of children we can I'm going to

141
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:17.500
try going up to 150 on the final render and seeing if that makes a difference.

142
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.670
So I'm not liking this bald patch.

143
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:24.430
I thought it would be relatively straightforward to cover it up but it doesn't look like it's being

144
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.650
relatively straightforward.

145
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.390
So this here is getting better now.

146
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.020
However I think the issue may be that the hairs are actually pressed to fight against the rabbitskin

147
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.760
possibly even an Engro or it looks very rough there as well.

148
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.270
So let's see if we can go in and particle it.

149
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:49.640
Oh we don't want it at length some risks to undo that let's go and comb it and just move it back a little.

150
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:56.080
That seems to be a quite had a lack here of parents.

151
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.930
This part of our model.

152
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:03.220
So one of the other things that we can do just to help us with covering up this bald spot in general

153
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.220
seeing a better impression about what's going on if we look over on the tool shelf with the tools tab

154
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.390
selected scroll down we will see children.

155
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.870
And if we put a tick in that we can see how the particles are actually looking in this case the hairs

156
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.820
including the children which is very very useful.

157
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:29.440
So I'm going to try playing with the seed of children just a little and see if that sorts out are boldness

158
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.890
problem that indeed looks much better.

159
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.680
Brilliant.

160
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.760
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

161
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.520
Id like you to alter the remaining particle groups.

162
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.860
So add some further styling to the rest of the bunny.

163
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:47.590
So make some of the other hair on my head perhaps make it a little bit more frizzy etc..

164
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.810
It's up to you how you do that of course.

165
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.940
Now make the chest hair and whiskers a different colour.

166
00:11:53.950 --> 00:12:01.500
Now I suggest white in this case when you render it you may find it comes out a little grey.

167
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.040
Don't worry about that.

168
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.760
We'll sort out the colouring in a later lecture.

169
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.980
And finally a little hint for you.

170
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.570
You will need to create another couple of materials underneath the rabbits or bunny mesh.

171
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.650
Pause video now and give that a go.

172
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.700
Okay guys.

173
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.670
Welcome back.

174
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.220
Let's hop straight back over into blender.

175
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.650
Right so the first thing I'm going to do here is just create the materials.

176
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.850
So we need two materials.

177
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:39.110
I'm going to click this one here and actually select brown fur for both of them.

178
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.310
Now there currently there's three uses of brown fur which you can see one two three.

179
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:48.960
Now I want to make them unique users so I'm going to click that three and now that three becomes a two.

180
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:59.240
And I'm going to call that white fluff and I'm going to call this one here whiskers in case the whiskers.

181
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:06.160
We decide to do something else with later Ron and we go in to set the colour to white.

182
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.610
You can do that quite easily by the way with the hue saturation and value of hue and saturation as nothing.

183
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.730
And the value as one that would be pure white and I'm going to do the same with the white fluff here

184
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.610
arguably I should have made one of them white and then copied that one.

185
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.330
But there we go that's done.

186
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:29.780
So we need to assign those materials to the appropriate particle systems of the chest down here on render.

187
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.750
We're going to select white fluff and the whiskers we're going to select whiskers.

188
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.860
Perfect So that's all those set up.

189
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.630
Let's have a quick look how that is looking.

190
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.490
Oh dear.

191
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:46.490
One day I will hop into the right mode you can't render in particle edit mode it doesn't show us our

192
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.430
hairs properly.

193
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.300
So let's see how that's going to come out.

194
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:56.450
Probably find that they will come out a dark grey which they have done that's not a problem at all we

195
00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:02.720
can sort that out in a bit um just want them to be a different colour at the moment perhaps a little

196
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.180
long.

197
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:09.380
I will make them shorter so chest it looks like I've edited them at some point.

198
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.750
Let's go into 3D view here.

199
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.040
Oh they're hidden So let's turn them all on so we can see what's happening.

200
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.290
So let's see if we can fluff out this chest area.

201
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.090
Let's try less hairs.

202
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:28.350
Let's try 400 hairs with a length of point to five.

203
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.750
And let's just try actually fluffing them out.

204
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:41.240
So if I come down here and uniform point one a bit of randomness in there as well and the end points

205
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.790
let's make the points a bit scruffy.

206
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.420
So that does look a lot more fluffy and I'm happy leaving it like that for the moment.

207
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.880
And the threshold of randomness.

208
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.880
Well let's not make everything random about 40 percent they'll be absolutely fine.

209
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.910
Okay so that's those bits.

210
00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:03.230
They're done let's make the head go up here and again you can spend as much or as little time on this

211
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.190
as you'd like.

212
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:11.150
I'd like the head to be relatively smooth so I'm going to add in a randomness value of one I want it

213
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.340
to be totally random.

214
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:19.550
No I want to increase the threshold now so that some of the hairs are completely maybe random of one

215
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.470
is a little too much that's just adjust the size here.

216
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:32.990
Let's turn the random value down as where a lot of this is a bit of playing as well.

217
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:41.810
So the larger the size the better it's going to look over ride and there's a still a bit scruffy that's

218
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:49.550
lower the randomness have the ranton was quite low and the size one that's looking pretty good may have

219
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.510
to read brush.

220
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:55.820
If I make it to random because you can end up starting to see through your model.

221
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.080
And let's add a few more parents.

222
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:04.100
I don't know why I just feel like any more parents now we're going to have to go to free edit at this

223
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:10.950
point and just top that up a little Thousands are going to be too many maybe 15 hundred.

224
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:18.070
So occasionally you will have to do this back into particle edit and basically brush your rabbit again.

225
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.210
And of course taking the brush around the eyes down here.

226
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.900
Pull that back.

227
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.580
Pull this down here onto the body.

228
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:34.520
Now depending on how much time you spend doing this will change how your rabbit looks quite significantly

229
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:40.500
actually because it alters everything it alters the whole feel of your rabbit.

230
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.200
So I'm just here making the hairs go round.

231
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.430
Now you'll notice that when you're brushing you sometimes have to pull around lots because it brushes

232
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.190
relative to where you're viewing from.

233
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.640
Not necessarily where you think it's going.

234
00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.620
So if I'm not careful just brushing straight up the rabbit's head here we'll end up with a queef.

235
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.000
But that looks good to me.

236
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.920
Let's see how that renders.

237
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.700
Oh dear I've done it again.

238
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.910
Let's hop into object mode and render that out.

239
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.820
Okay I'm liking the look of that we've got our collard Wisconsin that we can't see at the moment obviously

240
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:23.730
because there's a background there and looking at the there's a nice sheen to the ears themselves.

241
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.460
The rabbit's head is fluffy enough that's great.

242
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.870
This is all looking really good so far.

243
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.420
How are you guys getting on.

244
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.610
I'd love to see how your rabbit is coming along.

245
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.450
Please share in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
