00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.500
Welcome to setting up our repo and committing in this video.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.890
We will set up our repository will register source tree.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.830
Make sure that we come commit later on learn how to glued data from our repository stage our files and

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.100
finally make our first commit.

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.790
So one of the questions is how many repositories now on a complex projects you could use a repo perm

6
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.310
model that you create.

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.930
This would give you the best level of control.

8
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.960
But in this case it's going to be to develop our model simply aren't that detailed to warrant a repository

9
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.850
just with the model.

10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.600
So you could track your whole project in a repo and that is what we're going to do.

11
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.550
Of course it will depend on the complexity of your project and how much control you need in that scene

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.880
in.

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.820
Very important.

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.730
Now talking about our repository which is going to store and track for changes in our prob project for

15
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.020
us we can exclude data from it and we do that to allow faster commits at a smaller size and that keeps

16
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.940
the database the repository simple and manageable.

17
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.450
We want to avoid storing derived or generated data in the repository wherever necessary.

18
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.410
An example here for instance will be our reference material they might be photos you gathered off the

19
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.750
Internet or even gone and taken yourself.

20
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.480
Those are going to be static not changing there's no point in storing them.

21
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.800
And they're very large files in comparison to everything else so we will want to exclude them.

22
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.740
There we'll go on to committing and it is important that you'll need to save all the documents that

23
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.200
constitute that commit first before staging them and then finally committing them.

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.360
Now this is going to be like saving our working folder and zipping it up at that moment in time.

25
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.180
But it's going to give us far more control over where we can go back to.

26
00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.300
We can even pull out files from way in the past and bring them back to the present with a new direction

27
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.080
to them.

28
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.910
So let's go on over and first set up our repository and then go through and manage these other things.

29
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.600
So here we are in my file system I'm using a Mac here you'll be using Windows Explorer if you're on

30
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.420
that or wherever the limits equivalent is.

31
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.170
So we've got my home directory here I've created repo's and I've got two here that are called Game asset

32
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.770
PAC.

33
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.250
One is for tracking my videos that I'm creating for you guys right here.

34
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.220
And one of them is going to be an example sarm in a very similar position as you are and I want to show

35
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.850
you what mine's looking at so you're familiar with it when I use it from now onwards.

36
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.670
So I've got an example here that I'm going to make into my repository.

37
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.640
So first of all an if you've not already done this please pause the video now and go register source

38
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.780
tree.

39
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.800
If you've already done that then let's carry on.

40
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.630
Now I've already got some repositories here you can see I've got seven representing the seven sections

41
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.610
of the course so far.

42
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.610
Now you are not going to see anything here whatsoever.

43
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.960
But now we can go ahead and create a new repo so we can click on new repository and we go and create

44
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.000
a local repositories.

45
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.530
The third option down.

46
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.810
Once we've done that we've got this destination park here now.

47
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.770
Be careful.

48
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.010
It's very easy to think that this name underneath is going to create a folder.

49
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.220
If I just click create Now I would end up with a repo called my blender project which is great but it's

50
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.740
going to contain everything in my user section and I don't want that so I'm going to click these three

51
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.340
dots to the right hand side and simply go and select the one I've created which is this game pack example

52
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.800
and a click on Open.

53
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.600
Now this is the name of the project here and I'm going to name it my blender project that's absolutely

54
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.080
fine.

55
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.430
Type gitte.

56
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.810
That's what we want.

57
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.150
And here also create local remote repository.

58
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.410
Leave that one unchecked and go ahead and click create.

59
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.840
And there we go we've got a blender project that's appeared.

60
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.480
And if we go ahead and double click on that we can open it up and you should have something that looks

61
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.360
pretty similar to this so I'm just going to rearrange these windows a little because it's been opened

62
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.140
on a larger screen.

63
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.600
So we have a series of well this area at the top here is staged files and there's nothing at state it.

64
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.040
There's nothing ready for committing.

65
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.310
So one of the first things we need to do is make sure that everything we've been working with has been

66
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.570
saved and shut down.

67
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.380
So if you still got a blender file open that hasn't been saved.

68
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.390
As soon as we stage it I say this is ready for commit in its current state.

69
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.040
If you then go ahead and click save even though it's been staged before.

70
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.410
It won't be right.

71
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.860
So what do we need to do.

72
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.720
Well we do want to keep our message.

73
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.990
We can see meshes we can see here that the assets this is our directory that we've got so we've got

74
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.160
meshes under here which is going to collapse that with that little arrow we have got textures and my

75
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.460
details about how to nail textures I want to keep that.

76
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.610
And here is our reference material and as you can see I've just got a load of images from the Internet

77
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:24.230
so I've put a warning there do not use in the course directly which is why I've pulled a load of images

78
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.410
there.

79
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:32.300
Now I can select that and when I select that I can go up to actions and select ignore and it gives us

80
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.610
a series of options.

81
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.610
So here we've got to ignore exact file names if you got a specific file that you want to add to the

82
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.140
gate.

83
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.670
Ignore that we can have ignore all files with this extension.

84
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.710
And I don't want to do that because some of these pian Geez we're going to be producing pages later

85
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.570
on when we produce our own texture.

86
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.850
So we certainly don't want that.

87
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.920
I want to just ignore everything beneath.

88
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.390
And in this case anything that goes in that reference folder will not be added to our repository.

89
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.210
And I'm very happy to that.

90
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.860
The other thing to consider is where it says add this ignore entry to the global ignore list.

91
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.990
Now my folder name reference material do not use in this course.

92
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.480
No copyright for it.

93
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.710
We've got to bear in mind that the global ignored list will place anything with that particular folder

94
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:29.050
name onto it and that means every repo we then make going forward it will be included in the ignore

95
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.840
So if you have a name something like texture's or meshes that can be very dangerous because that will

96
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.890
mean that every other one but you ever use will be added unless you remove it from that global ignore

97
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.460
list.

98
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.910
So in general I wouldn't use global ignore list I do in this case but I would make sure it only applies

99
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.750
to this repository only so I'm going to go ahead now and click okay and that will ignore that.

100
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.100
I've then got a read me file which is what I have build up as I go.

101
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.060
Of course you may want to add notes as you go into a text file.

102
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.060
Perhaps that says at what stage you are thinking etc. alas a good log and of course you can update that

103
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.630
as you go.

104
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.860
So now that I've got my assets my meshes and textures I can just click up the top here and select everything

105
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.080
and we can see it moves from the bottom here to that SOP.

106
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.030
Now that we've done that it's red it's staged and it's ready for committing.

107
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.200
Now I like to keep my commit messages nice and short and put the detail about what's going on in my

108
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.640
read me file.

109
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.570
And here for instance I can say first commits because that is what it is we've now got stuff that we

110
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:49.110
can commit and I'm going to hit commit and there we go ah everything's disappear from the screen.

111
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.460
What's gone on here.

112
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:56.020
Well we're no longer looking at our what's called Master branch.

113
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.310
So on the left hand side you can see it says Master.

114
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.060
If we go ahead and click on that then we can see what's going on.

115
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.660
And that is the first kimmett.

116
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.350
Now we go ahead and change anything we'll have changes up on top.

117
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:16.220
So I am now going to show you my particular repository so you can see how it looks after you've done

118
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.620
a few commits.

119
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.950
Okay so we are both back over on my repository here and you can see I've got my initial commits down

120
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.360
here then I fleshed out my read me with what I want to do.

121
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:34.300
Basic folder structure made one of the lectures is there another lecturers here and this is going to

122
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.770
be the end of the 10th lecture.

123
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:42.180
So what I would do in this particular case is I'd make sure that all of my items that are needed were

124
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.760
state which is fine.

125
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.180
I'm going to go ahead and hit commits.

126
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.850
And these are the trials that I've been working on and I'm going to put in here the name of the lecture

127
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.590
that I am working on which is very powerful.

128
00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:01.150
And I've got that in my paste buffer so I can just place that in now ordinarily Ah you're not going

129
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.800
to be using this push changes.

130
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.950
I am because I've got an online repo as well and we might cover that later on.

131
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.600
But don't worry about pushing changes here that's something I need to do.

132
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.470
You won't.

133
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.900
And once I've done that we can see that there are no more changes.

134
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.330
And I've now got that all set up and ready to go.

135
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.840
Okay guys so it's Challenge time.

136
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:30.160
I'd like you to make your commit so an optional task here is to create a text file explaining what you

137
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.640
have done that helps you keep track of your changes.

138
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.830
We can't really see what's going on in individual blender files and we want to keep those committee

139
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.730
names a short and succinct as possible.

140
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:50.700
Make sure you save all your open documents ignore your reference material stage your files and then

141
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.860
finally commit with the short and precise name as told what it is.

142
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.890
It's a title for that comment.

143
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:04.540
I've already done mine so ngoni to balls the video and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
