Hello everybody and welcome in this lecture we're going to discuss making a standard asset so in front
1

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:16,210
of us here we have a very low polygon pawn and it's based upon the staunton chess set that we saw
2

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,840
earlier.
3

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,980
Now one of the things to bear in mind that all of the chess set has a similar base to it.
4

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:30,340
So if I was to take this top piece off we could place the bishop the king the queen even the knight
5

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,680
itself on top of here with a few modifications and of course the rook as well.
6

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,510
So we've got this standard asset that we can create once and use again and again and again and perhaps
7

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,960
make a few modifications obviously to its size.
8

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,720
And of course to how it looks.
9

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,060
OK.
10

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,750
So now a blender open we've got a couple of ways that we're going to do this.
11

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,080
The first thing to bear in mind is that you will have to have the add on turned on if you've somehow 
12

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:06,750
lost the add on you go to edit preferences and under here we've got the add ons on the left here, If we
13

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,580
search here for planes we've got import, export, import images as planes.
14

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,820
This is the important thing here we need it as a plane and not an empty.
15

16
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:23,140
If we have imported as an empty then we can't do any scaling to it and we can't set the plane.
16

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,660
In this case to the appropriate size which is going to save us a lot of time aligning our reference
17

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,400
material.
18

19
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,380
So let's go ahead we can go file import images as planes once that add on is turned on.
19

20
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,040
Or we could add image images as planes.
20

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,730
So in this case I'm going to add my image as a plane.
21

22
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,380
I need to go to the right place.
22

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,260
We can't just drag and drop it in it that'll add an empty.
23

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,800
So we need to go to the appropriate location find look under recent we see here we've got models.
24

25
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,720
I'm going to go up a level down to reference and then find our pawn and what we should find if I go
25

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,460
ahead and delete the cube.
26

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,330
This is the important thing here we need to be able to see our plane.
27

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,000
Look at it from the front or side and then it's just a matter of organizing it and we can see here that
28

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,580
we've got ourselves in the properties panel.
29

30
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,700
This is situated around the origin being 0 0 0.
30

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,070
But we really want to lift it up and I want to see what I'm doing as well.
31

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,130
So I'm going to turn on lookdev mode so I can see what I'm doing.
32

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
Go into edit mode and just go G Z and lift it up.
33

34
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,320
Now by how much.
34

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Well if we have a look at the size of the plane itself out in object mode we've actually got a dimension
35

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,210
here of Y is one metre an X is about 58 centimetres.
36

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,940
So the first thing that would strike you here is how's that X and Y there.
37

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,990
And that's Z didn't Y that we can see what's going on here.
38

39
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,660
Well when you're dealing with two the objects in Blender X is to the left and right and Y is up and
39

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,740
down it's as simple as that.
40

41
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,590
It doesn't respect the fact that it's in a 3D world it's talking about its local dimensions.
41

42
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,470
So in this case we can see that it's one metre high and it's 58 centimetres or fifty eight point seven
42

43
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,790
centimetres wide.
43

44
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,660
So at this point we can just go to our dimensions and think well a pawn is going to be three centimeters.
44

45
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,070
So we could type in nought point nought three or remember we can type in three centimetres or remember
45

46
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,990
that we can also.
46

47
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,500
That's a problem there of course that we just squished it lots.
47

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,810
We need to divide it by the same amount or of course we can go to our scene settings go to our units
48

49
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,090
and change it to centimeters and then we can just type in these figures normally.
49

50
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,410
Okay.
50

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,970
So let's undo that for a second because I want this as is.
51

52
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,820
And let's go ahead and change this back.
52

53
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,030
to centimeters then all the fields are correct.
53

54
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:55,180
Whilst in edit mode which I was in I'm going to go G Z point five.
54

55
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Oh No, haha!
55

56
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,670
We're in centimeters that's gonna be 50 centimeters.
56

57
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,440
Now I know that sat on the ground.
57

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,620
That's a good start.
58

59
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,660
But the next thing to work out is how do I make this the right width.
59

60
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,120
Well in this case what we can do is we can press the S key to start scaling.
60

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,950
Remember you can hold down shift to move things very slowly and we will find as we scale down the dimensions
61

62
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:26,910
gets towards three centimeters, Let's scale that again and you can see it starts and get very very very
62

63
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,430
small.
63

64
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,480
And as we approach three centimeters we can hold down shift and just do the final few bits and there
64

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,590
we go.
65

66
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,430
We've got it at three centimeters and five centimeters high.
66

67
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:45,570
Now that is encouraging because we establish that a king is approximately nine and a half centimeters
67

68
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:45,840
high.
68

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,130
When we were doing our research so that is a good indication that we're around the right size.
69

70
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,010
I'm just going to apply the scale on this because that's just habit and we can see it's not exactly
70

71
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,160
five centimeters.
71

72
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:05,280
So now we have our image at the right scale and we can start constructing the rest of our model and
72

73
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,150
for that it's time for your challenge. Okay everybody it's time for your challenge.
73

74
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,050
I'd like you to go ahead if you haven't done already to import the Staunton pawn dot PNG.
74

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,790
Of course if you're using your own reference material then you'll want to import that and of course
75

76
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,390
set it to the appropriate size to help you judge the scale of your model I'd then like to add a cylinder
76

77
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:36,580
and get it to be the right diameter and height for the base not the entire model but the base itself.
77

78
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,970
Make sure the origin is at the base of the cylinder that's going to be important for later on we're
78

79
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,980
not doing physics or anything but it is going to be important so we can place it correctly on our scene.
79

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,530
And remember don't worry about getting the shape of the base right.
80

81
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,380
We're going to do that in the next lecture and then I'd like you to save your file as perhaps chess
81

82
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,170
piece base or chess piece templates whatever's easiest for you to name it.
82

83
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:10,770
I'm going to keep mine as chess piece base of course pause a video now and give that a go. Okay everybody
83

84
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,600
Welcome back.
84

85
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:19,090
Let's go ahead now and create our chess piece base OK so we have our pawn ready to go and the next thing
85

86
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,030
we need to do is insert a cylinder.
86

87
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,080
So let's go control and A.
87

88
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,420
And add in a cylinder.
88

89
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,860
Now I'm also going to make sure I name things as I go this is going to be huge.
89

90
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,250
I'm going to go straight away and change the radius from 100 centimeters.
90

91
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,920
Now remember the radius is only half the diameter.
91

92
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,230
We're going to set that's a one point five.
92

93
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,240
Which is fine.
93

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,040
There we go it's the right size.
94

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,870
And then the next thing we need to do here's the depth.
95

96
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,690
And we worked out that was going to be about five centimeters okay.
96

97
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,850
And the location.
97

98
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,130
Well we could shift up slightly.
98

99
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm going to do that manually in a moment.
99

100
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,180
So there we go.
100

101
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,460
We've got the cylinder in there it's just in the wrong place at the moment.
101

102
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,410
So we could lift it up and apply the scale but that doesn't put the origin where we want it to be.
102

103
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,900
I'm going to do things in a slightly different order.
103

104
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,450
I'm going to go round to the bottom and use the snapping tools that we used before.
104

105
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm going to select this face along the bottom and then go shift and S and cursor to selected.
105

106
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:26,620
Now that we've done that we can come out into object mode right click and move the origin to the 3D
106

107
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,000
cursor.
107

108
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,430
Now the origin is that the base.
108

109
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,660
We can just set our Z value to zero.
109

110
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,090
Now it may seem a little bit convoluted that we went that way round.
110

111
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,700
But this is an important skill.
111

112
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,510
We happen to know that it was going to be exactly two points five centimeters that we needed to shift
112

113
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:52,690
this pawn up but that might not be the case in all circumstances so it's better to learn the more advanced
113

114
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,710
skill knowing that you can just type in a whole value if it happens to end up that way.
114

115
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:57,990
Okay.
115

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,780
So looking at my transforms there's nothing I need to apply.
116

117
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,700
I'm going to go into edit mode and select this top face I'm going to bring it down.
117

118
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,860
Now I'm going to bring it down to one centimeter initially and let's look at it from the side.
118

119
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,050
Now that's not where the base ends so I'm going to press G and then press the Z key to lock it to the
119

120
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,920
Z axis and I'm going to bring it up to that base level.
120

121
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,140
And we can see it's around here.
121

122
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,590
Give or take.
122

123
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,780
And that is a one point three seven eight seven centimeters.
123

124
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,830
Now it's not important that we have that precise it's not a mechanical part that needs to mesh in with
124

125
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,880
anything else.
125

126
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:39,420
We could round it up we could round it down but I'm going to leave it exactly like it is there.
126

127
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,330
I'm happy with that.
127

128
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm going to make sure I now save my piece.
128

129
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,980
Go ahead save this, Needs to be in the right place.
129

130
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,970
So in my model's folder we currently have the board and I'm going to call this chess piece base and of
130

131
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,280
course you can call it whatever you like as long as it makes sense as to what you're going to use it
131

132
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,520
for.
132

133
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,070
So this is my chess piece base.
133

134
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,990
And what that does mean is I can start from this position every time for all of my pieces.
134

135
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,450
And there we go with that saved we're all sorted.
135

136
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:14,020
And of course we can now use this as a template file we can open up this file and save as pawn or bishop
136

137
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,030
and modify it from there.
137

138
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:23,440
Now what we're likely to do is get it right for the pawn and then go ahead and re save it for the other
138

139
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,610
four pieces that will share the same base size.
139

140
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,090
So we're going to modify this template as we go but that's it for this lecture.
140

141
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,320
How did you guys get on.
141

142
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,070
Did you manage to get everything sorted out in the right scale and proportions.
142

143
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,040
I hope you did.
143

144
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,320
Share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
