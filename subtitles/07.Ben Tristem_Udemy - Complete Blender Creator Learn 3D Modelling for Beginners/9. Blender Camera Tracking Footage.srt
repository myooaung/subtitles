00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,760
Welcome to blender camera tracking footage.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,140
So getting the right footage is important just like getting the right picture was important with a with

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,120
our CGI in it in the right footage for a moving scene is equally as important.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,400
And initially I would recommend using a low resolution video high resolution video will require more

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,310
memory and will be more taxing on your system.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,910
Now there is an argument to be said that higher resolution video will have more opportunities for high

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,030
contrast areas in them.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,260
That's also important but we'll get to that in a bit.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:47,470
I'll be showing you how to allocate some more memory to the sequence or clip editor so that you can

10
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:55,750
utilize more of your system's memory then Blender's default one gigabyte areas of high contrast in your

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,920
footage are essential for auto tracking.

12
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,080
Sure you can go ahead and place markers manually but that's going to be no fun.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,290
Well want to avoid that if possible.

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,150
So what else about the footage.

15
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:17,880
Short video is better if you have a look at any production film or even acg a short CGI animation.

16
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,040
You can see that the scenes themselves they flick very quickly.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,960
There are only a few seconds long.

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:32,040
I'll probably say don't try to go for any longer than 10 seconds unless the scene really requires it.

19
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,460
Now if you've got several videos that you're joining together remember if they're part of the same scene

20
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,360
same time frame consistent lighting does hap.

21
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,710
That really really help.

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,790
So have you shot one video at the beginning of the day one at noon and one at the end of the day and

23
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,170
are suppose to be at the same time.

24
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,070
The lighting is going to look dramatically different in the morning in the evening shadows are a lot

25
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,930
lot longer so something to bear in mind and that can ruin the illusion that you're trying to put together.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,500
Now you will need the same camera and lens information that we did with the still image.

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,750
And this can be problematic.

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,450
The more you know about the scene the better.

29
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,240
So this is one of these instances where you better even know the camera person who took the video and

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,520
they know the details about the video or it's one you've taken yourself.

31
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,100
Otherwise it can be very difficult because the video does not have the same metter data that a picture

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,600
has.

33
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:33,140
Very rarely have I ever seen the information for a video contain anything other than its resolution

34
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,730
and maybe its frame rate as well as its size and all that lot.

35
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,150
So that's going to leave us a bit in the dark.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,020
If you don't have that information now some tips when recording your own footage.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,710
Now you may have seen in the movies that people in cars and buildings and other bits and bobs sometimes

38
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,780
end up with stickers stuck on them called markers.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,120
Well if the scene is green screened which often happens in production a character that is moving and

40
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:08,660
is then to be replaced with a CGI character or indeed there is a lack of high contrast.

41
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,840
You can place markers in the scene so there's nothing distinguishable and you can obviously control

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,610
this if you're shooting the footage.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,060
If there's no high contrast areas you may need markers in the scene itself in order to.

44
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,470
Camera track properly.

45
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,120
Now are they going to be covered up by CGI.

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,030
If not then you're going to have to remove them afterwards.

47
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,350
So try and avoid actually putting markers where they're not going to be covered up.

48
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,440
And finally keep a log of your cameras set up.

49
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,250
Remember that some cameras a difference a don't.

50
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,950
I've got an iPhone in front of me.

51
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,550
Don't just write down iPhone right.

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,040
The version of the iPhone it is otherwise you may get confused when you put in the details for an iPhone

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,120
5 and it's an iPhone 6 for its iPhone 7 or whatever.

54
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,350
You know these things can make a difference.

55
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,620
So let's go import some footage now and hop on over into a blender.

56
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,400
Right.

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,160
So now they were over in blender The first thing I'm going to do is switch myself across.

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,870
So the video editing window.

59
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,430
Now we're over here we've got a breakout of everything.

60
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,510
Now this is going to seem quite cramped again because I'm running at a lower resolution.

61
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:29,390
Feel free by the way if you've got multiple monitors to start using your multiple monitors.

62
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,430
It's a great idea.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,780
In this instance.

64
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:40,250
So we need to import something into a blender and we'd can do that on the video sequence editor.

65
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,040
And this particular view we can see we can switch between fuse.

66
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,180
With these three toggles that move quite violently.

67
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,600
This is the sequence of.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,580
The next one along is the image preview and then after that we have the secrets and the image preview

69
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,770
so the image preview is the one in the top right hand corner and we're not actually going to use the

70
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,440
curb's in this particular lecture so I'm going to make that disappear.

71
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,440
So we've literally got one on top of the other and there's a time line underneath so we can play rewind

72
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,350
etc..

73
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,300
Let's go ahead now and add a movie into our scene.

74
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:30,280
Now I'm going to pick the high resolution so I'm going to go into my assets drone footage.

75
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm going to go to the for cave footage because really going to show the problems that you can have

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,090
when it comes to large files.

77
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,110
So I'm going to have this movie strip in now.

78
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:48,230
Incidentally it will add the movie wherever your timeline was positioned so if it was at frame 135 would

79
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,320
it popped in there.

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,370
Fortunately it was at frame one.

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,440
Now if I go ahead and hit play we can see in the video.

82
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,250
Well with that she got the clip itself the image preview going.

83
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,900
It's running about 10 frames per second.

84
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:10,240
Now we're up to about frame 130 I'm going to stop that and go back to the beginning and play and we

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,210
can see that it's now running at 30 frames per second and nice and smoothly and then it drops back down

86
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,870
again.

87
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,100
So it's start cashing that information is starting to store that information.

88
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:27,280
Now if you're working on a larger project you may find you run out of buffer to do that on and it will

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,610
depend again on your systems specifications.

90
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,430
Now this is all to do with the system memory not your graphics card memory.

91
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:43,180
So if you've got enough memory what we can do is go to file user preferences and go to the system tab.

92
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:50,500
Once you're on the system tab you may have to scroll down or expand this out but on the second this

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,130
middle column here sequencer and clip editor at the bottom there's a memory cash limit and this is measured

94
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,530
in megabytes.

95
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,010
If we hover over it's like most things it gives us a little tip says the memri cash limit in megabytes.

96
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,180
Now you don't want to set this any higher than your system's value that's for sure.

97
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,140
And you don't want a seller at your system's value either.

98
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,750
But because I'm going to be working with this for a file and I have had a bit of practice putting together

99
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,540
of his lectures I know that this fall k file is not going to be able to the entire thing is not going

100
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,710
to be able to fit in to one gigabyte.

101
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,330
So there are a couple of things we can do we can chop up the file to just the specific area we need.

102
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,890
But we might not be able to do that.

103
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,800
We may need more memory to work with.

104
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,630
And again this does depend on your system memory as well.

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:45,670
My computer that I'm on at the moment has 16 gigabytes of RAM so I'm going to give myself eight gigabytes

106
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,850
using about half the capacity it needs to.

107
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,660
It won't suddenly consume 8.

108
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,770
It will just use up to 8 to cache video anything that's in the sequencing clip.

109
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,020
Ed I'm going to save my user settings and close down user preferences.

110
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,570
Now if I left this to play out it would go through and it would remember the whole thing.

111
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,650
Incidentally I can also scrub backwards and forwards nice and quickly.

112
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,240
If I go outside the range that have already gone so it starts jerking about which is less than I deal.

113
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,290
It's nice and smooth here all jerky if we go further on.

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,020
Now this is a 30 second clip so if I let that play out it would take roughly three times longer it would

115
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,640
take about a minute and a half to play through and then the entire thing will be cached and you can

116
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,850
see how much memory is currently using If I just set this playing a wizard at 30 frames per second on

117
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,160
the info header bar at the very top here.

118
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,640
We got the version of blender etc etc and then we have the memory utilization and we can see that if

119
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,330
I just leave the mouse over it does nothing but if I keep revisiting it its will.

120
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,270
Updates we've currently got.

121
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,370
Five hundred ninety megabytes.

122
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,150
And it's not going up anymore.

123
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:06,070
Well it's not going up because our start and end frame who got a start frame at 1 and an end at 250.

124
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:13,180
If we look at the time line the sorry not the time line sequencer just here where we have the name of

125
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,170
the file and its location on the hard drive and then at the very end there is a vertical slash.

126
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:25,510
I'm not quite sure those are called but then we've got 9 0 8 6 9 hundred eight frames long so if I update

127
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,340
that to nine hundred eight frames and leave it to play it will actually buffer all the rest and we can

128
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,410
see the frames per second in the top left has dropped down and I'm going to use my mouse wheel here

129
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,470
just to move that back along so we can see the rest of the info head.

130
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:47,230
And this as you can see if I got using mouse will in the right place is now at 800 900 So that's climbing

131
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,540
up that's using the memory on the computer.

132
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,270
Now when it comes to editing this file itself being able to scrub through just left clicking here and

133
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:01,450
going backwards and forwards is quite useful and very powerful because it allows us to see our scene

134
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,650
really easily.

135
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,200
But we can also chop up our scene so we can place the play head at any particular point we could do

136
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,580
that manually down at the bottom.

137
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,110
Here we see what the counts are going up at the moment so you can position it exactly using this.

138
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,250
Or we can just do a rough cuts by clicking and dragging them out.

139
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,620
Do that.

140
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,270
In a few moments after this is finished counting up.

141
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:21,790
Excellent.

142
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:28,200
So that's now all done and we can see it's using nearly two gigabytes worth of memory and that's a lot.

143
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,480
If you think about it just a short clip.

144
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:37,330
Now this is one of the reasons why I'd recommend perhaps not working with for K footage but maybe 720

145
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,840
P Also the 720 footage is there for you guys that don't have really quick broadband's.

146
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,970
It's as simple as that you can get going much quicker.

147
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,480
OK.

148
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,290
So now we've got this bufford and we can scrub between it we can start to pick where to make cuts.

149
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,380
And there are a couple of types of cuts that we can make.

150
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,940
So if I position the cursor just that say Here where the air field starts to come into view in the lower

151
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,260
corner there you can go to the strip.

152
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,080
And we've got a load of options.

153
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:16,180
And at this particular point I'm talking about cutting and there are two types of cutting cut soft and

154
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,270
cuts hard.

155
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:25,660
The main difference between cuts soft and cut hard is the cut soft allows you to stretch and adjust

156
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,390
the timing of the clip.

157
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,370
Cut hard does not.

158
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:35,210
So I once I've cut hard at this particular point it may take a few seconds to do.

159
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,800
I can't extend this backwards and forwards.

160
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,410
I can move these clips about using the right mouse but in fact most of the controls you'll come across

161
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,690
a very similar compress X to delete.

162
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,070
If I wanted to but because I have them a soft cut there is no way of extending this back again in recovering

163
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,220
the early footage.

164
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,400
If I'd done the soft cuts I would be able to.

165
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,300
So I can use that to cut up parts of my image and I can hopefully undo those changes.

166
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,030
There we go we're back again.

167
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,620
Now can I undo a cuts that's been made who are in the right place and again something that I'm not used

168
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,950
to doing is waiting because the computer is relatively quick my computer when doing most things however

169
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,680
waiting for things to happen.

170
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,570
The video editor can be time consuming as you sat there.

171
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,900
Now as you see I faff the bout with that and it's jerky again.

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,710
Now if I keep moving the cursor backwards and forwards eventually it will start storing those frames

173
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,180
if at as undoing this.

174
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,300
If you take a cursory glance up at the memory at the top it's storing each of these frames as it jumps

175
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,690
over it and eventually it will start to get smooth again.

176
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,510
So when you're doing editing like that it can clear some of your buffer.

177
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,160
If you're not careful to just bear that in mind.

178
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,320
So now we can get a movie clip on to our sequencer and we can cut it up.

179
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,710
I think it's time for a challenge.

180
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,670
Okay so a quick challenge for you guys are likely to go ahead and import your footage.

181
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,830
So cut down your chosen footage to a suitable length I dare recommend leaving it minutes long perhaps

182
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,580
10 seconds or less.

183
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,740
Set up your camera accordingly so we haven't done that just yet and if you're following along with my

184
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:27,700
particular videos then the supplied footage was shot on a deejay I Phantom for drone So you have to

185
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,170
go and have a look and find the camera settings for that particular model.

186
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,200
As always remember to save your work.

187
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,550
That is quite important but when saving your work remember that your footage is not stored in the blend

188
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,810
file itself.

189
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:48,760
So I'd recommend putting it in its appropriate place now and then don't move it rename it from its location

190
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,990
on your computer.

191
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,840
Very important.

192
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,090
Otherwise you'll open up your file again and it will just be blank.

193
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,730
Which would be no good.

194
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,480
Suppose a video now and give that a go.

195
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,830
Okay guys.

196
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,910
Welcome back.

197
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,900
So now I've got my footage in.

198
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,790
I just need to cut it to a suitable length and set up the camera settings.

199
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,630
So let's go ahead and hop back on over in a blender.

200
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:19,010
So I've got two things to do here I need to pick the right length and I also need to set up the camera.

201
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm going to do the length first so I really want it coming in around heavy airport where we can see

202
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,340
the runway over there and that looks to be around here.

203
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,060
Round the five second Mark.

204
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,290
I'm going to use the shortcut key shift in K for that hard cuts.

205
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,370
There we go.

206
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,990
And I'm going to get rid of this beginning footage.

207
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:48,850
A raise and then the footage here we can see on V in the properties panel over here the start frame

208
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,840
angle is going to set that back.

209
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,810
At one it stops me having to drag things about that can be a bit well.

210
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,760
I'll show you here.

211
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:02,020
If I start dragging about it's really jerky simply because it's not buffered all of that stuff yet I

212
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,750
don't want to deal with that so that's that done.

213
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:11,580
Now I want about 8 seconds or so so that that'll be all the way up to where it says 8.

214
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,410
Which is where you saw and it looks like.

215
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,740
Yes that's pretty good.

216
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,570
It looks like the airport itself or the runway there disappears about that.

217
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,210
But point as well sir it appears and disappears there.

218
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,820
So I'm going to set that eight.

219
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,140
And again do a number of hard cuts.

220
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,180
Would the Thai be footage selected here.

221
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,070
And I'm going to get rid of that extra bit.

222
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,730
So I got my eight seconds of footage here.

223
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,090
And how many frames is that that's going to be always eight times 24 25.

224
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,330
I can't remember what I've got.

225
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,420
It's set up to be.

226
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,060
Either way are find out in a moment when you get to the end of it.

227
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,880
To 40 something like that's all very close very very close.

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,120
I'll leave it at 240 for the moment.

229
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:02,720
And once that's bufford which now is Perfect's in it will play back we can see that's the air strip

230
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,760
here is in view.

231
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,480
And then it comes out again.

232
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,180
Perfect.

233
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,790
That's a good time.

234
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,710
Any In fact here we can see it cuts out.

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,130
And then there's an extra frame.

236
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,160
So looks like it's 2 3 9.

237
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,090
Okay.

238
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,230
So now that we've got all of this lots in place we need to sort out the camera details.

239
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,850
Now this is where it starts to get a bit interesting looking at the specifications for the deejay I

240
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,700
Phantom for I literally went to Google and type in on another screen if you're wondering what's going

241
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,370
on.

242
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,850
And we have V.

243
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,540
Details here.

244
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,680
Now we've got a camera sensor size and there there's 19 more.

245
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,260
Well let's go to the official dji website.

246
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,310
And if we scroll down here we we have the sensor size how we got the field of view and here it says

247
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:04,150
it's a 20 millimetre 35 format equivalent now 35 millimetre format equivalent means full frame camera

248
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,650
so we can use that to our advantage and not having to worry too much about this extra information.

249
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:18,250
And I will go and show you that right away because if we go ahead let's make sure I save my file.

250
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,340
Movie that's fine.

251
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,060
And let's go ahead and go new.

252
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,620
So we have a sense let's go to our camera properties a look through that camera.

253
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,540
This is a certain camera set up and I don't know what is at the moment so I'm going to go to the camera

254
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,480
propertys and go full frame camera.

255
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,680
That's fine.

256
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,000
And focal length of 20.

257
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,760
So that's what's a 20 millimetre equivalent will look like when it's looking at that cube.

258
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,920
Now if we go ahead and add a nother camera into our scene so I'll just duplicated that and door and

259
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,460
let's call it phantom So we just know what's going on.

260
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,830
We've got the cube there we've got the phantom camera now the phantom camera.

261
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,710
According to their spiel is two and a third a cross.

262
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:20,310
Two point three inches so we can go to our sensor size here and go to Point three times two point five

263
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,950
four.

264
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,150
And that should convert inches into millimetres.

265
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,780
And there we go.

266
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,950
We've got two point.

267
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,790
So five point four eight millimetres that sounds about right for a tiny tiny camera.

268
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,760
And then we can adjust the focal length accordingly so it roughly matches I mean if you needed to be

269
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:49,500
really really precise you could actually go ahead and do it with mathematics to get you to the right

270
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,180
points.

271
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:57,720
However there is a nother thing that needs to be taken into account which is quite tricky.

272
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:03,120
Each sensor can record video not across the whole sensor.

273
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:09,600
It could record it only on part of the sensor effectively changing the sensor size when it comes to

274
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:16,030
actually recording and that will completely change the actual angle of the camera etc..

275
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:23,880
Now because de provided us with the thirty five mil equivalent I am lit she can stick to that's a full

276
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,070
frame camera.

277
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,200
I've adjusted these settings now which is a bit silly that was 32 before and 20.

278
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,050
So I'm going to have my camera set up with a focal length for 20 at full frame camera for Frankfurt

279
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,480
final camera so I'm going to go head now demonstrate that back to this which is the file I'm working

280
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,230
on go back to the default view go to our camera and I'm going to make sure the camera is named appropriately

281
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,030
so I'm going to call it's D.J eye camera.

282
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:02,440
And I'm going to call it 20 mil a meter thirty five m e equiv.

283
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,970
Should be enough.

284
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,550
So I know what's going on there suffern go to my camera settings and is currently set at 35.

285
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:17,400
If we set that 20 there we go that should now have the right field of view for whatever scene we set

286
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,810
up.

287
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,350
Now our footage is quite distant footage.

288
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,370
So we're going to have at the camera itself is going to be positioned quite a way back from this ground

289
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,890
plane etc. So there's a good chance we'll have to play with some clipping distances again but we'll

290
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,160
deal with that in a bit.

291
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,400
So we've got the clipping here.

292
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,750
In fact whilst we're here be silly not to set that too a bit higher.

293
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,780
Let's set it to 1000 meters or a kilometre.

294
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,900
Again with the height of where that drone was that might not be enough.

295
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,420
Will leave a thousand for the moment and tinker with it if necessary.

296
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,980
So now we got all that sorted we can save our file and we're ready to go.

297
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,340
How did you guys get on.

298
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:01,750
Are you using the footage that I'm using or are you using your own footage I'd love to see your work.

299
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,640
Remember to share on the forums and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
