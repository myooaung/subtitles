00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.750
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.730
Well we've had a look at this old wing geometry briefly in the past but now we get to use it as an anchor.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.160
So we're going to revisit it and learn how to dissolve geometry from our model in a meaningful way that

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.190
isn't wasteful.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.850
Let's find out more.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.200
Okay.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.310
So we start off with our chess piece as it is at the moment.

8
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.710
Let's go ahead select it and go into edit mode and we see that we've got an awful lot of geometry just

9
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.020
going to close down the properties panel and sole shelf.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.850
Now we can go ahead and start dissolving some of that so that we end up with a much cleaner bits of

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.790
geometry and we can do it one bit at a time we can select a face loop that hole down old and select

12
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.730
a face loop running round if we had face select turned on there we go or we can select individual edges

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.040
and work along all we can do things in bulk so I can hold down ALT and shift and select multiple edges

14
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.730
at the same time once I've done that I can go X and I've got the option here to dissolve so I'll remove

15
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.380
those edges as if they never existed.

16
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.360
You don't want to delete those edges if you do that you end up with this kind of shell left.

17
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.100
So we don't want that we want to actually dissolve them and what the dissolving will do is remove the

18
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.180
edges but leave faces in their place and you can see here it says it merges those faces together in

19
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.040
certain circumstances you may want to dissolve faces but that's not applicable in this case.

20
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.580
We're not mold merging multiple faces into one but we do want to dissolve edges what does it do.

21
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.620
Well it removes that extra geometry so that's moved remove this horizontal geometry and we'll have a

22
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.030
look at the vertical geometry in a nother lecture because there's several bits of it.

23
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.210
There must be a quick way of selecting it so let's have a look down the rest of our model and the key

24
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.120
thing here is selecting which parts to remove and also understanding that you can't always go back to

25
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.310
the original shape.

26
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.140
Now this is great if you've downloaded a model or you've been given a model and you want to make it

27
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.600
low poly.

28
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.110
Now of course there are there is the decimate modifier as well that can lower the polygon count over

29
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.620
model but it doesn't work in a very uniform way this way we have complete control over it so we can

30
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.210
pick and choose what we remove and we will have to alter our topology and rejig things around afterwards.

31
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.230
I'm sure one thing that we can never recover that we had before is a flat surface going all the way

32
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.980
down to the base because now we've added the bevel in whatever we do if we remove this loop and this

33
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.650
loop from the equation so X and dissolve edges you notice it now comes in.

34
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.660
So that's a case that we can't get back to our original shape.

35
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.970
So another example would be even though we can select this age loop running around our model here if

36
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.060
we had done an even division.

37
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.890
This is fine if we had done an odd division this edge would have been replaced by a face in the middle

38
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.370
and then we would have lost exactly how wide it was around.

39
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.280
So it's now time to practice that skill with your challenge okay.

40
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.410
So hopefully quite a straightforward challenge for you I'd like you to remove all unnecessary edge loops

41
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.200
from the base itself and after you've done that if you feel it's necessary fix up any geometry if necessary

42
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.110
there may be the fact that the base curves in at the bottom then select the edge loop around the base

43
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.010
and just widen it out again if that's the look you want to go for pause video now and give that a go

44
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.290
Hello everybody and welcome back let's hope on over into blender and remove all unnecessary edge loops

45
00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.550
from our base okay everybody welcome back so we've got a couple of options and choices here as always

46
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.350
there's not really going to be right or wrong the first thing I want to do is remove the unnecessary

47
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.560
edge loops there is a workflow order here my staff is scaling things before I remove them I wouldn't

48
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.930
really know what the end shape was like because there's extra geometry here already shaping it.

49
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.970
So let's think we want to keep this edge loop here we want to keep this one here and I'm gonna do this

50
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.580
one here and then just move it around so it's in the right place it's already the right width I want

51
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.620
to keep.

52
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.000
So there's a couple of options here I can select the ones I want to keep and then invert the selection

53
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.590
I don't think that's gonna work too well in this case I think oh selects loads of other edges that I

54
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:52.150
also don't want to select so I'm going to go ahead and select these two here then these two here and

55
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.060
that one and then this and these two.

56
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.230
Okay so I'm going to group dissolve them.

57
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.490
So X and then dissolve edges.

58
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.520
Now once I've gone ahead and dissolve those edges you can see straight away we've got our basic shape

59
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.290
back again and I'm going to work from the bottom upwards so I'm going to select this bottom edge loop

60
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.980
and make it wider and select this one.

61
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.900
Impressed GZ and just shift its ups I'm not changing anything about it apart from its position must

62
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.910
select this one and also move it up and scale it in on a scale t massively so I can see my reference

63
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.300
material and then bring it back out to around their this part here.

64
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:42.920
And when I pressed g g twice and shift it up and then scale its outs and then this bit here this is

65
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.000
the one I'm definitely gonna have to keep roughly the same so I'm going to press G.G. twice to slide

66
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.560
the edge up.

67
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.700
Now it's just a matter of maybe scaling this top one out slightly and this one in slightly to make sure

68
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.100
we've got some change in gradient as it goes up there.

69
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:10.270
Okay I think that's pretty good we've removed all the edge loops that we didn't need.

70
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.460
So we've got our basic shape back again.

71
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.550
Perfect.

72
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.090
The Alpha thing that's we now have to do is of course remove these vertical ones but that will be in

73
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.160
the following lecture.

74
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.250
But for now I think we've got this back to a low poly state that I like and you'd be right in thinking

75
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.910
there are several ways that you could do this if you approach it in a different way.

76
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.160
I'd love to hear how you approached it.

77
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.240
You may have even said you know what Mike.

78
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.530
It's gonna be too much work to remove all of this geometry.

79
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.460
I'm gonna start again.

80
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.960
You know what.

81
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.570
That's a valid point there will be times in your modelling where you just have to throw out a model

82
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.680
and start again because trying to repair it is a pain in the backside.

83
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.030
In this case we're practicing some key skills so it's okay to go through the motions but thinking about

84
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:06.080
your workflow in advance might have solved this issue but that's it for this lecture and I'll see you

85
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.670
all over in the next one.
