00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,440
Welcome to the introduction to data blocks in this video you'll learn about data blocks.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,330
Understand.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,300
But knowing about them is about to become much more important especially as they are seen starting to

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,360
get a bit more complex.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,450
Now we have come into contact with data lots lots.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,900
But let's now go explore them directly.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,390
So what is a data block and its characteristics.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,520
Well they must have unique names.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,330
So if you've got two things with the same name it will blender will spend it with the usuals 0 0 1 on

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,810
the end.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,170
Now they can link to each other which is very powerful.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,570
They can even link across blend files and that's going to become very important very soon.

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,310
McKay unused data blocks are eventually removed.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,640
Now we've seen that where we have a literal zero next to our texture's or next to our materials that

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,210
aren't applied to anything because a material is a type of data block.

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,410
And that's where we have used a fake user in the past to preserve that particular day to block.

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,940
So it's not destroyed when closing blended down.

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:25,320
So sharing data blocks Here's an example of that's the same texture on many materials the same material

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,040
or many meshes.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,630
Now we've done that before where we have several mesh objects all sharing the same base material.

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,990
We've done it with a particle system.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,660
Now we've often shared and then made that data block unique.

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:47,040
So if you've cast your mind back to the rabbit that we've created we started off with a particle system

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:56,190
and then use the same particle system again and then started making it unique depending on loads of

25
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,210
different factors.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,410
You could do the same with a mesh you could take the same mesh data.

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,510
I duplicate an object and then take it from there make it a unique object.

28
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,390
Okay so let's go have a closer look at what these data blocks are and where they are.

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,860
And blender of course before we get started let's press chemists on our source tree.

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,440
And I'm going to put in here data blocks.

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,760
I don't know what it's going to be about data rocks.

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,620
Well sure I do but I don't know what it is about data blocks for the moment so we can amend that later

33
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:28,770
on.

34
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,840
But we know it's something about data blocks.

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,440
So let's go hop into a blender.

36
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,940
Okay so we're back over in blender and we're going to have a closer look at our building scene that

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,450
we've just put together.

38
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,950
Now what we can do here is in the outline now have a look at all of the data blocks that exist and that

39
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,640
will give you a good overview about what constitutes a data block.

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:00,650
So I'm just going to make the outline a much bigger so we can see what's going on and the outline as

41
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,540
head where it says all scenes this dropdown we can change it to data blocks.

42
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:13,460
And let's just scroll up and down there and we will see that there are quite a few things that are actually

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,270
called a data block.

44
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,470
So we got our blend file data and then it's broken down into all these little bits.

45
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,210
Now some of this is exposed.

46
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,550
When you were going to append these objects you saw the other things that you could potentially append

47
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,540
including materials and other objects in the same.

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,330
So we have objects here those make up all of our object data and as we can see here we've got this little

49
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,580
square next to it so that's an object data block.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,630
Most of these do have their associated icon as well which makes it a lot easier to quickly spot what's

51
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,960
going on and look down here.

52
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,830
There's another object.

53
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,030
So this empty that's selected here is the room test object.

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
Let's have a closer look.

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,850
There aren't any materials assigned with this scene yet we haven't applied anything.

56
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,880
And that's reflected here zero items.

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,670
Let's have a closer look at meshes because this is something that we can have and use to our advantage

58
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,180
because we have a let's just count them one two three four five windows here.

59
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,780
They're essentially all the same.

60
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,660
In fact they're supposed to be all the same.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,030
So if we go ahead and open up this we can see that there's a lot of mesh data called a very odd namings

62
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,500
or a lot of namings but very useless namings.

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,560
So in this case there's something else that we need to make sure we name correctly.

64
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,700
Not only do we need to make sure that it's name correctly in the outline we need to make sure that it's

65
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:52,580
name correctly when it comes to the mesh data itself so we can identify what it actually is.

66
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,060
So let's go ahead and select one of these windows and I'm going to go in the outliner again and go back

67
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,720
to all scenes so I can see what I have selected.

68
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,200
So I have this one here is selected again that's not very descriptive at the moment.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:15,820
However if we go to the meche data down here we will see if we go down on the properties window to the

70
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:23,080
mestisa Tap which again is that little mesh icon the three vertices joined by edges upside down triangle

71
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,830
if you will.

72
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,290
We can see the mesh data is verte 05.

73
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,520
Now if we click on that dropdown we can see all of the other meshed data that's in our particular scene

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,820
at this time.

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:43,240
And that is powerful because I'm going to guess here that 0 0 1 all the way to five is these five windows

76
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,390
like a click on each one to check but I'm pretty certain it is.

77
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,960
I think this other verte is the doorway here.

78
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:58,830
So let's go ahead and switch them sort of 0 0 once a select every window and change it to series 0 1

79
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,300
of course yours may be named slightly differently depending on how it was all set up.

80
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,420
But there we go mining now all changed in that one.

81
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,380
There must be Verts procedural one.

82
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,250
Okay so now if we have a look at this dropdown again we see those zeros.

83
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,850
Okay now that's important because if we go in say this firewall now and reopen get those bits a meshed

84
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,100
data although they're all the same in this case are going to vanish.

85
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:33,520
So if that was a model or meche data that we wanted to keep we'd need to associate a fake user only

86
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,260
to do that at the moment.

87
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,170
So what we're going to do is to demonstrate that is I'm going to save the file which is now been done

88
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,710
and I'm just going to click revert here and that's going to reload the file again.

89
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,400
And because we've literally just saved it it won't look like anything that's happened but we go to this

90
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,730
meche data drop down we see there's no more Virts 0 2 3 4 and 5.

91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,510
They've completely gone now they dont exist in this blend file anymore.

92
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,790
In fact all of these are now sharing the same meche data.

93
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,360
So we hop into edit mode.

94
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,520
Look at that.

95
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,600
We can actually see that we're editing every single one of it.

96
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:21,230
So if I go and select a face let's say that's grab all I need to be a bit more zoomed in to select anything.

97
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:25,750
There you go.

98
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,900
This is the mesh object.

99
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,740
I'm editing not over here so I have to click one of these faces and we can see it's selecting them on

100
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,890
every single one survie extrude that out.

101
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,880
It's affected every single one.

102
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,180
Now that is very very powerful.

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,320
And looking at it that is if you did a duplicate link.

104
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,480
When ever you.

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,170
When we went in early and built this up by duplicating it.

106
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,760
So we done a duplicate link.

107
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,880
What that's doing in the background is saying that this mesh object shares the same mesh data block.

108
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,650
Very important and very useful because I'm going to undo that blob that just makes I don't want it.

109
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:12,520
But let's say that we wanted to put another door in just here so we can select it and go and change

110
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,170
it to um assuming here it's Virts.

111
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,120
Okay.

112
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,830
Where's it gone.

113
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:23,160
Okay so it is 90 degrees different so I can now rotate that's on me x axis by 90.

114
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,300
Yeah that's the right way around.

115
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,200
And in one quick operation without having to find another door and duplicate it and move it.

116
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,540
Okay we had to rotate it in that instance but you can see that I've changed the mesh data of that object.

117
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,270
It's now looks completely different it looks the same as this one.

118
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,580
So that's got incredible potential depending on the complexity of your scene that you can just simply

119
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,510
swap parts in and out.

120
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:57,490
And that's where it's very important to make sure you construct your models themselves to be as modular

121
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,370
as possible because that does mean that you can literally swap one object out for another and have a

122
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,770
completely different feel to your scene.

123
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:13,290
Okay guys it's Challenge time unless a particular mesh object needs to be unique.

124
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,980
Remove all redundant mesh data blocks.

125
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,260
Make sure your mesh data blocks have an appropriate and descriptive name.

126
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,370
Pause a video now and give that a go.

127
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,670
Okay guys.

128
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,640
Welcome back.

129
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,310
Let's go remove all redundant mash data blocks over in blender.

130
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:45,250
Okay so what we should end up with in the end is literally the same number of data blocks as there are

131
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,990
parts in our scene.

132
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:55,410
Not individual parts but unique parts so we've got this front door here the windows and the first two

133
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,620
we've got the floor panes which is three four and five.

134
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,310
So there's only five unique mesh data blocks in this scene.

135
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,380
So that's what we're going to shoot for.

136
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,270
We've already done that.

137
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,570
These doors they naturally save for set.

138
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,640
They share the same mesh data.

139
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,890
However what I can do here is actually name that meshed data.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,380
I got a call that one I'm going to call it exactly what it is actually.

141
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:27,070
I'm going to copy the mesh title itself the object the mesh object title and store that has the mesh

142
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,840
name as well.

143
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,370
And I'm going to do that to the window.

144
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,720
Of course in this case I'm going to tell what's going on there.

145
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,100
Three by four.

146
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,650
That's absolutely fine by not point nought.

147
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,660
That used to be twenty five I think because that's the size of it.

148
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,720
So let's copy that and put that in here.

149
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,750
Now we should find after doing that that the other ones have hit naturally inherited that.

150
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,840
Perfect.

151
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,400
Right.

152
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,380
So we've got our square here.

153
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm going to call it floor because that is actually what it is.

154
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm going to change this particular one which is plain 0 0 6 to the floor in the title down there.

155
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,810
Now I've done that.

156
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm going to select this one and switch it to a floor.

157
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,390
This one to floor and just literally go through and do that.

158
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,140
And then in a moment I think there are two more things to do.

159
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:28,790
You'll soon find out whether or not we've got down to the right level case and now that that is done

160
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,490
we've got this one here.

161
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:37,940
So I'm going to call I don't know what to call that let's find in the outline of first of all let's

162
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,330
just call.

163
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,950
Q But at the moment let's call it filler because that's what it is.

164
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,140
Let's do x y and z so it's no point to five by nought point twenty five.

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,400
So nought point to five by nought point to five by.

166
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,310
Three high plus points to fire.

167
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,040
So by three point two five so that is a descriptive name about what that is.

168
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,550
And I'm going to update the mesh data name as well.

169
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,300
So let's go ahead and fill in these ones here with phil..

170
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,660
Soon sumate move round I'm just wondering whether I can do two at once.

171
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm not sure if I can.

172
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,320
But if I can that would be much better although it's presenting a difficult selecting.

173
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,420
So if I go here and go filler and then just check I think it's only change the active one that's changed

174
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,060
to filter.

175
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,580
Yeah.

176
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,410
Does any change active one.

177
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,530
So fill out.

178
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,980
You can also search at the top of it becomes a bit unwieldy.

179
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,120
So I'm going to delete this cube from the scene because it doesn't need to be there.

180
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,100
Thus removing and this one's a bit different.

181
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,620
This is the same sort of filler.

182
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:55,560
But here it is for white not four point twenty five but it's four wide.

183
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,620
I've got to pick either X or Y I'm going to pick x.

184
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:08,520
Okay so in order to save you the mundane task of literally watching me rename a couple of mesh objects

185
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,640
here are just fast forwarded as I was round and renamed all of these parts.

186
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,060
And I'm going to save my file real quick and reverse it.

187
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,140
There we go.

188
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,480
So that means that I should have no extra ones here and look at that.

189
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,000
The mesh data in this scene the data blocks are down to five and we can confirm that in the outline

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,130
the by going to data block the meshes there are now five mesh items in here and they have descriptive

191
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,770
names.

192
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,480
Brilliant.

193
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,050
So the final thing to do of course after we saved our blend file is to make sure we commit those changes

194
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,780
so we can undo them if necessary later on.

195
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,180
So we now know it was removing redundant data blocks or removing redundant.

196
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,060
They two blocks in fact let's be even more descriptive.

197
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,500
Removing redundant mesh data blocks I need to stage those files using.

198
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,620
Ah that's absolutely fine and I'm going to press commit.

199
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,500
Okay.

200
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,220
Brilliant.

201
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,990
And of course I am now in my repository that I use.

202
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,510
This is what it's going to look like from now on.

203
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:24,120
I've been keeping it nice and simple for you guys before with how you and yours would be looking.

204
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,620
Mine's going to always look slightly different because it's set up around the structure of the lectures

205
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,040
that you're watching rather than just the tasks that are going on.

206
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,770
How did you guys get on.

207
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,480
Please share in the discussions if you had any troubles or challenges.

208
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,390
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
