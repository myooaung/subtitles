Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:11,390
In this lecture we are going to focus on making these holes in our sphere itself so that we can have
2

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,270
some finger and thumb holes.
3

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,990
Now you may notice that it's turned on flat shaded again.
4

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,180
And that's because if we go to shade smooth we've got this horrible artifact and I can't really show
5

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,740
you the holes that we've made.
6

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,830
Now we can resolve that and we will do in the following lecture.
7

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,100
But for the moment let's focus on those holes. Hello everybody and welcome back so.
8

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,820
This is where we were before.
9

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,680
We've got a little task to make these holes now.
10

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:43,340
First of all I'm going to change my view mode to wireframe the reason for that is so I can see what's
11

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,410
going on inside our model.
12

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,080
If I go ahead and select these three faces it's the problem with wireframe sometimes you can select things
13

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,540
behind and we extrude you'll see that it's going inwards.
14

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,640
They're all going the same direction which is great.
15

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,150
We can see at the top actually says normal.
16

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,540
But they're not going correctly.
17

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,360
Now the reason why I say correctly is because this bottom one here looks horrible.
18

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:14,540
And that's because it's assessed all of these faces and picked a normal relative to all of them rather
19

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,580
than individual faces.
20

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:24,200
We get around that very very easily I'm going to press undo to go back there and then I'm going to change
21

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,040
this and be explicit.
22

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,680
So at the top here we've got this option for global.
23

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,390
And once you've clicked on global you see that this is the transform orientation.
24

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,050
So that applies to whether you're moving scaling or rotating something which is what a transform basically
25

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,640
is.
26

27
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,850
And we can do it locally, globally, normally, gimbal, view and cursor. The gimbal, view and cursor.
27

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,110
I don't really use that often but it is possible to use them for that.
28

29
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,270
And there will be specific use cases.
29

30
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,330
Global well.
30

31
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,460
And the best way I thought about the difference between local and global.
31

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,810
Imagine if you were stood up your local and global z axis the way that you think is up is aligned.
32

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:12,440
However if you lay down on your bed or on the sofa on the floor now your local is going sideways whereas
33

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,120
the global has stayed up.
34

35
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,830
The only way that you will get your local facing up again is if you were to apply that rotation.
35

36
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,600
But we want normal.
36

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm going to be explicit in this case and then we want all of these to move together.
37

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,070
I could do them all individually and it would work now but we want it so it'll be together in order to
38

39
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,820
do that.
39

40
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,830
We're going to have to use individual origins under the pivot point menu.
40

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,840
It's quite easy to forget about the pivot point if you're not rotating something you often don't think
41

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,400
about pivoting but scaling is one of those things as well as extruding.
42

43
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,950
We're talking about using the individual origin.
43

44
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,710
So we're looking at this face here this face here this face here and now that we've set it up to normal
44

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,860
and individual origins we should get three blue lines which we do representing the normals of each of
45

46
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,350
these faces.
46

47
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,290
And with that you can finish this off now with your challenge.
47

48
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:06,590
Okay.
48

49
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,020
So your challenge is to extrude the holes for the fingers and thumb.
49

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,820
Make sure are all equidistant so they go in the same depth.
50

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,520
They should all be extruded along their normal also none of them are going off wonky inside the ball.
51

52
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:25,760
If you have any overlap points you extruded in scale the faces at the bottom of the hole accordingly.
52

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,610
So it no longer overlaps and I suggest you do that on all three for consistency.
53

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,990
Finally remember wireframe mode to see what's going on inside the model.
54

55
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,890
Pause the video now and give that a go. Okay everybody Welcome back.
55

56
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,110
Let's go ahead now and create the holes for our fingers and thumbs.
56

57
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,620
OK so now that we've got our bowling ball loaded up let's go ahead select these three faces.
57

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,280
Brilliant let's go to our transform orientation switch to normal so we're explicit about it.
58

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:06,350
I'm going to select individual origins and then I'm going to switch over to wireframe mode after I've had
59

60
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,550
deselected not before.
60

61
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,210
Who would do that.
61

62
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,280
Silly.
62

63
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,870
OK.
63

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,980
About there may be a little bit more so I can now move these but I'm gonna have to press the Z key again
64

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,540
to move them.
65

66
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,360
So there we go.
66

67
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,960
And it's picked up because I've got normal selected here and individual origins.
67

68
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,580
It's allowed me to move them as well along those individuals.
68

69
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,640
Now it's not quite half so I could probably scale it by point five and get away with it but that's still
69

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,530
not quite there.
70

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,090
I don't want it to be too small at the bottom.
71

72
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,390
Okay.
72

73
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,920
Looks good, I'm going to tab out into object mode.
73

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
Switch back to shaded mode.
74

75
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,150
Oh it hurts my eyes seeing that you know.
75

76
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,140
But there are various ways of sorting that out.
76

77
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,860
Are you starting to think Oh I know I'm going to I'm going to try this to make sure that that's shading
77

78
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,430
artifact thing that's happening around the holes doesn't look horrible.
78

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,930
And that could be a mini challenge for you before we actually get onto the various ways because there
79

80
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,750
is more than one way of sorting this out there.
80

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,120
How would you approach this at the moment with the knowledge that you've currently got more geometry
81

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
is definitely one way of approaching it whether or not it's the quote unquote right way.
82

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,550
That's entirely up to you.
83

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,520
But we've we're going to sort this out in the next lecture and look at the various options as well.
84

85
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,040
So there we go.
85

86
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,450
There's my bowling ball coming along great.
86

87
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,920
Not quite sure of the color we're going to have to add a material to it soon.
87

88
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm looking forward to seeing your bowling balls as well.
88

89
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,250
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
