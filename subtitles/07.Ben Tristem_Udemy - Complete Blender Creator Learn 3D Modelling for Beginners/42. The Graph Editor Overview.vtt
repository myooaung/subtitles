00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.390
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.560
In the last lecture we have a look at the dope sheet Ed..

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.310
And it's not by itself.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.930
It comes with a partner.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.530
If we go and switch to it now the graph editor.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.130
Now the graph editor is different to the dope sheet.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.270
Ed simply because it allows us to change the transition between those key frames.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.250
Let's have a look specifically at this point where our lamp is landing.

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.160
Now if we look purely at the up and down part of this animation so we're looking at the z axis which

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.390
is this blue line remember here we've got the base selected.

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.810
We're talking about the base control bone only.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.880
Let's highlight the blue line and you do that not by clicking on the line but clicking on one of the

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.140
control points.

14
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.960
When we click on a control point we get a handle much like how we used to controlling curves.

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.150
And as you've probably guessed if we tweak that it will change how the transition happens.

16
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.310
In fact if we go nuts and do something like that set the play head back to the beginning let's see what

17
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.960
happens it's going to shoot up and come back down again because that's exactly what this graph is doing.

18
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.230
Let's talk about this a little.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.110
How does gravity work.

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.930
Well because it was simulating gravity at this point.

21
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.070
We don't have to by the way we could turn off the animation and turn it back on later on and let it

22
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.900
The Lamp fall absolutely naturally.

23
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.900
But in this case we want to be explicit about how our lamp is moving.

24
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.240
If we have a look at this it jumps up and it doesn't it does slow down as it reaches the top.

25
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.340
We can see it curves off and then it starts falling back down again.

26
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.300
But look at this.

27
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.380
By the time it lands on the ground which is frame 92 it started slowing down even before it hit the

28
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.040
ground.

29
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.050
That's not how animation should work.

30
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.770
We should hit the ground with a thud and without slowing down before we've hit the ground.

31
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.670
We've got no rocket boosters to cushion our landing after all.

32
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.300
So you may be tempted to grab this and grab one of the handles and do that but then we end up with a

33
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.210
more of a spring effect with it going into the block the bench underneath.

34
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.920
So that's not ideal but we've just learned how we make a spring effect.

35
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.040
So we may want that as it impacts the ground we may want a few kind of micro bounces to just show the

36
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.950
viewer that it wasn't just a straight impact.

37
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.140
It was more of a hard landing and then a little bit of a bump.

38
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.160
So how do we go ahead and do that.

39
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.050
Well first of all we need to change the type of handle that we are using.

40
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.540
So with the control points selected I'm able to press the V key when I do that.

41
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.870
It gives us a series of options at the moment.

42
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.130
It will be set it's automatic.

43
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.090
However if we change it's a vector we can say it was a straight down impact.

44
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.560
And at that point we can have this speeding up more naturally so let's just go back and review the animation

45
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.740
comes down and hits the ground there and we can zoom in and check that that was the impact point which

46
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.880
it is.

47
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.950
So at this point in time we could actually make this a little bit steeper and have it fall sooner or

48
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.710
once again we can grab the main control point and move it back slightly.

49
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.340
Let's say to about there to make this falling a bit steeper as it comes through.

50
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.300
Let's have a look at how that looks.

51
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.860
I haven't a clue of it's going to work.

52
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.530
Let's go ahead and press play.

53
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.710
So we've gone up and it's landed very suddenly.

54
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.470
I missed that because I wasn't zoomed out to the right level.

55
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.550
Let's just click OK.

56
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.120
Now it looks like the jump the ever jump definitely lasts too long.

57
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.280
And you can see here now that we've got the curves in place and we're able to control the transitions

58
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.940
between each key frame.

59
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.840
We can start adding a lot more subtlety to the movement especially when it comes to bouncing.

60
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.840
I don't know if we've got quite enough time.

61
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.560
I mean that does land and then cut off.

62
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.910
I think that's going into our bench.

63
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.290
Yes it is slightly.

64
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.710
So we might have to skip or move a few frames but the other thing that we can do right here right now

65
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.880
is grab that key frame and press shift and the and duplicate it and we get another one and we can shift

66
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.210
in the again and we can change the magnitude here.

67
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.080
Now I'm exaggerating and not really setting up the key frames with any thought as such but that it also

68
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.150
looks like something is bouncing.

69
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.600
Let's see if that works out.

70
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.330
This might be a happy accident or we might need to refine it a little further.

71
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.350
Let's go ahead and do that.

72
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.310
This press space to play.

73
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.880
Yeah.

74
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.610
Okay.

75
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.220
That was far too exaggerated.

76
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.250
But you get the points.

77
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.500
That looks like he's landed on something very very spongy and it's dampened the effect.

78
00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.090
So let's come in and lessen the heights on all of these by minimizing the control handles.

79
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.190
So that's our first one or second bump should be closer together and not as high.

80
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.150
So something like that and our third bump should once again be even closer together.

81
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.890
Something like that and be half the height again.

82
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.640
So I don't know if that's going to work.

83
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.210
But you can see here how we can very quickly build up a bit.

84
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.840
Oh yeah.

85
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.110
That looks much better.

86
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.900
I still think it needs a bit of refining but as you can see here.

87
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.000
Zoom out and play it again yes.

88
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.950
That's starting to look much much better.

89
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.720
And of course armed with that knowledge you know it's time for a challenge.

90
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.360
OK so your challenge is to use the graph and it's to refine your lamps movement.

91
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.000
Now remember so far we've only played with one axis of one bone so far.

92
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.270
So there's plenty more that we can play with as well.

93
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.720
Expect this to take a while.

94
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.130
I probably spend the next half an hour 40 minutes as she playing with mine.

95
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.680
I'm not gonna show you all of that some of it was me just moving.

96
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.210
Tiny tiny changes yet and the bit to absorb the net.

97
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.280
They expect that to happen to yourself as well.

98
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.960
And one of the best piece of advice I can give you at the moment is if you are struggling it's probably

99
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.930
best to leave it for a bit go do some other modelling or just take a few minutes break and then come

100
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.410
back to the animation again.

101
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.070
One of the things that will happen with this is you end up iterating over and over the same animation

102
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.100
and just sometimes it's better to come back with a fresh head.

103
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:39.490
So go ahead pulls a video now and use the graph editor to refine your lamps movement okay.

104
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.670
Everybody welcome back.

105
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.640
Let's go hop on over into blender and refine our lamps movement.

106
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.830
Hello everybody and welcome back.

107
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.340
We've got a lot of tweaking to do here and a lot of the time it'll be just moving control points backwards

108
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.630
and forwards to get more natural movement.

109
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.290
Now not to say that this is going to be an easy process or one that's going to work quite as well as

110
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.870
I would want it to.

111
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.720
But we can start moving around and tweaking things as we're landing.

112
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.560
We can highlight multiple things at once that something to bear in mind if we need to.

113
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.970
And I'm going to lessen all of these down to that and perhaps even that last bump isn't needed.

114
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:25.710
But let's try that let's go back a little and this is what the next 5 10 minutes is going to be and

115
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.420
we can see here that we appear to just transition sideways too much at that point.

116
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:37.550
So this way backwards and forwards is the y axis going to drag this point here so it lines up with the

117
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.920
peak because what we don't want is it's sliding whilst it's on the peak looks much better straight away

118
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.280
and then it's continually continuing to slide.

119
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.740
And then when it hits the ground I think another bump would be great.

120
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.830
That's the beginning of the jump.

121
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:58.140
I want to focus on you know if I could do this in reverse this bounce bounce bounce in reverse perhaps

122
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.340
I could do that.

123
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:05.070
In fact that's something you can do if you've got a bounce bounce bounce that you like let's say here

124
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.070
and it's the wrong way round obviously.

125
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.310
But I can duplicate it and then move it I can duplicate that.

126
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:20.860
And here we go and move it to the appropriate location which is really early on.

127
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.920
Now I want it going the other way so I'm just gonna move it over here so it's approximately in the right

128
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:34.010
place but then I'm going to scale it and push it through itself that would invert it completely.

129
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.390
But how about if we only do that on the x axis itself.

130
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:43.810
Now when I say x axis here I'm not talking about the model or the bones coordinates I specifically talking

131
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:50.860
about the graph in front of us X being horizontal left to right and Y being vertical up and down.

132
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.780
So when I press X and minus one we should get an inversion.

133
00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:04.120
Let's see what happens by just leaving it there not a convincing bounce but it's a reasonable stance.

134
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:11.670
In fact I'm not sure if I scaled that appropriately or I pushed it through itself too much the I think

135
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.540
I'm gonna have to tweak those things manually.

136
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.180
That was the idea that the bounce would get bigger and bigger and bigger before we jump.

137
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.180
It looks like we jump a lot sooner.

138
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:26.910
Anyway so now it's a matter of grabbing these points again and pulling them back.

139
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.270
Let's say to them let's see what happens when we do it like that case.

140
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.200
It's far too frequent.

141
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:39.040
By that if I bring this down we can have a look from the side.

142
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.150
Come back again.

143
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.680
It's just jumping up and down at the wrong point.

144
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.750
I think that's good that's clear.

145
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.920
There is something that delete those altogether and just have a look at this frequency at the beginning.

146
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.730
That's not quite right there.

147
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.760
As we push off I think that's the problem.

148
00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.560
I want.

149
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:06.820
The lamp itself to stretch out more before we actually leave the ground because at the moment we're

150
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.260
leaving the ground huddled up and then we're stretching out.

151
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.270
So let's leave that.

152
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:18.250
Let's grow and grab where we leave the ground and move it a bit further and I'm going to lock it here.

153
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:23.200
So I'm not changing its vertical position along the x axis to maybe here.

154
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.290
Let's see what that looks like okay.

155
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.550
We've got a bit of Y transition here.

156
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.560
So let's go ahead grab a point duplicate it and just bring it back.

157
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.370
Level with the others.

158
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.990
Let's see how that works.

159
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:44.050
That does look better but it's a bit more of a Superman's take off because we've not adjusted for the

160
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.260
rotation backwards and forwards.

161
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:52.000
So at this point in time you can see that it's just about iteration going through and making sure that

162
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.160
you've got key frames lining up.

163
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.110
That's really important.

164
00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:00.270
But now it's time for me to knuckle down and just go through the process of getting this beginning jumped

165
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.340
sorted and then I'll be happy with most of this animation

166
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.460
that's fine and at this point we're gradually taking off that's we're not accelerating.

167
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.230
Again we do not have rocket boosters here.

168
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.470
We've got to suddenly go up.

169
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.220
And again if we rotate it like this it will sponge into the ground which looks great for a trampoline.

170
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.350
Not so great for us.

171
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:31.720
So we can press V and set it's a vector now or leave the ground much quicker as you can see here.

172
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.840
Our lines aren't quite right.

173
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.020
Let's see how it looks.

174
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.170
Well no they're not.

175
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.600
They're not lined up properly at all.

176
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.920
So let's have a look at this again.

177
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.340
Jump up and land down.

178
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.390
I think the duration is about right.

179
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.330
But the positioning as we move is not.

180
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.750
So let's bring this Y transition back to here.

181
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:59.700
And I think once again we're going to have to adjust here specifically this one this handle going to

182
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:07.610
have to make that a vector and then level out this one here in fact just making it nice and short should

183
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.520
help making sure we don't go backwards.

184
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:16.680
So it would look really odd if that was the case so we jump up here and then we just go up instead of

185
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.940
sideways.

186
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.110
That's our problem.

187
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.130
Let's grab this point here.

188
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.600
G x and bring it back

189
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.970
that's much better.

190
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:29.640
Brilliant.

191
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.700
Oh and fall off and there is a little bit of a jump there as we're going.

192
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.560
I think that's pretty neat.

193
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.470
The translate translation across the screen.

194
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.540
That's quite smooth that's play it from the beginning.

195
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.920
So jump.

196
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.900
I'm liking that jump.

197
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.260
Yeah.

198
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.040
Fall off and I think we need a little bit of a bump there.

199
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.450
Now going to see I tried it earlier but I'm gonna see if I can grab these here.

200
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.870
Duplicate them and move them to the appropriate location further on landing.

201
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.580
So you've got a little bit of a bump there.

202
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:08.530
Let's see if we can just place these around the same area perhaps even overwrite some of them.

203
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.010
Bring that down.

204
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:15.760
Okay let's see what happens here at us a bit better.

205
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.740
So hitting the ground here.

206
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.930
Let's go ahead grab this one that goes into the ground.

207
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.520
Let's bring it out again.

208
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.970
Make it quite steep.

209
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.860
Oh hang on a minute.

210
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.360
This is important.

211
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.830
We have a look at what happens at this point when we move this control point.

212
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.070
It's moving it on the bones.

213
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:37.940
That access.

214
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.230
That's not what we want.

215
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.230
They're doing so.

216
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.800
That's the lead that key frames those nonexistent anymore.

217
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.070
We're talking about.

218
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.670
It's why transition here it's going to shift it up and down there we go.

219
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.520
That's what we want.

220
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.360
So let's go ahead.

221
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:53.840
You okay.

222
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.640
I'm going to make up something like that.

223
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.620
Let's see if that works.

224
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.220
Yes.

225
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.080
There we go.

226
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.850
Hits the ground and bumps backwards and forwards and we really want a corresponding one for the base

227
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:13.240
itself at roughly the right timing as well so we can select both of these so we can see the timing on

228
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.180
both the top and bottom.

229
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.300
But notice we've got some highlighted and some not.

230
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.090
This is the top one.

231
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.420
If we go ahead and select that we also get the one that we were working on before as well.

232
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.620
And we can see here that the timing doesn't match up and because the timing doesn't match up it's kind

233
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.800
of oscillating that may be something you want to do but it may also just ruin the illusion.

234
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.520
So I'm going to align things up and see how it works.

235
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:46.330
After doing that and remove the extra key frames just like geometry too many key frames can cause you

236
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:54.250
issues not least because it becomes a pain in the backside to manage everything and move that back slightly.

237
00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:01.210
And that's the largest one than a smaller one.

238
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:01.680
OK.

239
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:09.580
So I think I've adjusted it how I want it to land so let's go and preview just this end part here.

240
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.540
Still notch I think it's the why transition that's causing me the problem here.

241
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.250
So this area at the top here I'm going to delete that last key frame.

242
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.490
Let's see if that works now.

243
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.550
Yes it does.

244
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.540
That works much better.

245
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.630
Is that shifting forward.

246
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.540
That didn't make much sense to me.

247
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.040
Still think he's bouncing just a little bit high.

248
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:38.470
So I'm going to have to really zoom and tweak these parts here is it the first bounce that's too high.

249
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.280
Yeah I think that first bounce is too high.

250
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.160
So again don't be shy tweak things.

251
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.890
And I also don't think we hit the ground either.

252
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.400
That's not going to help.

253
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.890
Let's see if that works.

254
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:56.180
Yes.

255
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.440
That's much better much more subtle.

256
00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.790
Let's try it one last time.

257
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.030
Yep.

258
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.670
Perfect.

259
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.030
So let's review it over at the very beginning and this is one of the key things that you'll just have

260
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:11.790
to get used to doing is going over and over and over your animation.

261
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.890
Let's make sure we can see it.

262
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.340
In fact let's make that area full screen.

263
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.140
Let's see our lamp jumping around

264
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.010
oh splat.

265
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:25.980
Yes.

266
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.170
Much much better.

267
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:32.540
And of course we can turn off the overlays to see that in its full glory perhaps fill up the screen

268
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.830
a little bit more with it.

269
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.620
So it's a brilliant jump to begin with and then slips slide.

270
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.470
Bang brilliant.

271
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.900
So there we go we've got our animated lamp really coming together now with some unique animations.

272
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.060
Please share your work over in the discussions I'm really looking forward to seeing how you're getting

273
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.780
on and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
