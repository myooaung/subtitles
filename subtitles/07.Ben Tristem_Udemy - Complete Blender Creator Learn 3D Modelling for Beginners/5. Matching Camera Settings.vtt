00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.800
Well come to Matching camera settings.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.450
So this is going to be mainly about configuring the camera.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.360
We'll be setting up the camera using the settings gathered from your picture and I will also be reiterating

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.290
the importance of accurate camera data and I'll show you why that is very important.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.710
We're going to use the text editor to store data for reference I don't have to keep going backwards

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.710
and forwards to that information and I'm going to start setting up a scene to match the photo.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.520
So let's go and hop on over into a blender.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.200
Right.

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.420
We are back in blender and the first thing we need to do is open up the scene.

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540
We've been working on so far.

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.530
I'm going to go here and open up the introduction to compositing.

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.790
I'm going to then go ahead and save as and this is going to be my next lecture.

13
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.180
Of course you can name these slightly differently if you so wish.

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.540
I'm going to call this one setting up KEMMERER I spose because that's what we're going to be doing.

15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.600
Saves a blend far.

16
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.120
I can confirm the name at the top is change and I'm ready to go.

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.530
Let's just have a look at my properties here because I was running on a GP you before so my tiles will

18
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.310
be at the wrong size and was going to save that file.

19
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.060
Excellent.

20
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.650
So we're ready to go.

21
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.000
First of all let's have a look at the camera properties and click on the camera to select it in the

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.520
outline and then go down to the Properties window and click on the camera tab.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.620
Once we've done this we can have a look at a series of settings.

24
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.600
We won't go through every single one of these.

25
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.680
However the important ones for us are going to be the focal length.

26
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.490
We're going to want to leave it on perspective that is quite important.

27
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.280
We're going to need a focal length and I'm going to have to look up what those details are in a few

28
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.200
moments.

29
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.610
Let's see down here and camera well have a look at that as well when it becomes important.

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.040
So first of all let's go ahead and set this appropriately.

31
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.990
I don't know what it is so I'm going to have to go and research I'm going to open another window up

32
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.480
and change that to a text editor.

33
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.450
And once I've changed that to a text editor I'm going to click on new and Kamerad details.

34
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.950
Now if you don't have the cursor your actual mouse cursor in that window it will stop typing.

35
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.310
So make sure it's over there if you're typing.

36
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.500
Now I've when I've done this it's going to save those details along with the file.

37
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.510
And I have to go and grab my particular picture and again you can grab this from your assets pack if

38
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.230
necessary.

39
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.110
This is the picture I'm going to go and get info from it.

40
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.670
And we've got the details here it's a canon e o s eleven hundred d.

41
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.140
Excellent.

42
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.780
I can cut and paste which makes my life a lot easier.

43
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.220
And what was the focal length.

44
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.680
Does it say EXIF data.

45
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.960
Focal length focal length focal length thirty four hour that will be 34 millimetres.

46
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.470
That's a great start.

47
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.850
Resolution may be important.

48
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.590
I might as well copy it across something that was under General subpixel Hi Tim pixel width and I've

49
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.710
got everything I need there.

50
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.700
I am going to ground the aperture data as well that aperture is basically how large the light hole is

51
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.150
in a lens and the lower this aperture value the shallower depth of field i.e. the foreground and the

52
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.560
background can be very blurry compared to the actual object you're actually focussing on.

53
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.600
I don't think that's going to make a difference in this case but I'm going to put it there so I've got

54
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.260
the reference and I'm going to save my file.

55
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.080
Excellent.

56
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.370
All that data there.

57
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.840
I'm good to keep it there for the moment but I'm going to make this window smaller so I can get all

58
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.340
of the data I want.

59
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.660
I only just leave it with that for the moment and I can scroll up and down if I need.

60
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.990
So going back to these camera properties.

61
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.650
Now you may think oh excellent we can just lower the focal length down to 34 and we're done.

62
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.830
Not quite.

63
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.480
We don't know the sensor size of our canon.

64
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.000
E o s eleven hundred d.

65
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.980
It may or may not be thirty two millimetres across.

66
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.780
Let's have a look and see if there are there is a series of cannons.

67
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.190
Oh there is actually oil in eleven hundred d built in to blender.

68
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.170
By the looks of things I also know that that is an A P S C sensor.

69
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.630
If your camera is not listed on this list which is really a relatively comprehensive.

70
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:34.510
I know for instance that the the nikam here the X format is all of the consumer ones the these three

71
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.260
thousand The three thousand one 5000 7000 etc..

72
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.830
I used to have nikon's if you got a different camera that's on here you will have to go and have a look

73
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.420
at the specification sheet for your particular camera.

74
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.470
So we know it's been taken with an eleven hundred day we might as well select it and that is the camera

75
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.920
all set up and ready to go.

76
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.340
Again I'm going to save my blender file so I'm ready to go and let's have a look and see if it renders

77
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.290
any differently to how it did before.

78
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.750
Now so be a little slower as I'm waiting for the c p u to render the the cube does look slightly different.

79
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.880
Now this is the important thing when setting the camera right.

80
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.900
If we got this wrong and set this sets a 60 it wouldn't be a it wouldn't work once we had that line.

81
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.390
Everything in the scene.

82
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:33.160
Now for argument's sake you can probably Eline something in a scene that looks absolutely fine even

83
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.130
though it's got the wrong perspective in everything else.

84
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.890
So that looks more in line with these ground lines.

85
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.080
In fact we're going to use those in a moment to try and work out scale etc..

86
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.200
I'm going to lower that down to thirty four because otherwise I will forget.

87
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.400
I'm just going to render that out once more so we've got a cube on a ground plane in a scene.

88
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.350
But the camera's in the wrong place it doesn't look right.

89
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.790
It's just floating in the sky it's not really in contact with the ground anywhere.

90
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.120
This is no good.

91
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.860
We need to manipulate where the camera is in order to manipulate where the camera is we're going to

92
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.560
have to fake some of the geometry that's on the floor and get it roughly right in scale.

93
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.980
So looking at that photo album open up the photo.

94
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.120
There we go.

95
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:26.620
So looking at this photo we can see there are lines on the floor there's some guides that we can use

96
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.620
in terms of perspective.

97
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.760
Now if I could read these numbers that were on here.

98
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.770
Perhaps that will give us some detail.

99
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.380
That's not working I don't know if he's a distance markers.

100
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.500
If I knew a bit more about runways I could probably work out the distance between here but we can.

101
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.230
We can guess you know is that fair.

102
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.890
That's probably going to be about five meters across.

103
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.710
So five blend units and then just stretch out into the distance.

104
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.750
Let's go ahead and do that.

105
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.840
Then we can position up the camera accordingly.

106
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.710
So I'm going to delete my default.

107
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.850
Now I'm going to lower it down I'm going to move it on that.

108
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.050
Not got it selected properly and to move it on the z axis by two minutes to say.

109
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:16.100
And that is going to be to blend the units across so I can scale vats on the x axis by two point five.

110
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.410
That's now five blending units across and then I can scale that on the y axis.

111
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.840
I asked into the vast distance okay.

112
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:32.150
I'm gonna assume that's the right width for what I'm working on and when I look at it from the can review.

113
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.140
Of course that's not going to be lined up with are seen.

114
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.140
In fact we can render our scene really quickly and see what's going on.

115
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.610
We're always going to have to render each time we change an actual model.

116
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.900
But in this case we can see that it's probably not going to be lined up right at all.

117
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.590
No no it's not.

118
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.230
So we need to move the camera now so those two things match and of course that can be very difficult

119
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.700
without it in the foreground for you.

120
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.030
And first of all before we go and manipulate everything else let's make sure you can see both of them

121
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.800
at the same time.

122
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.040
So to get this appearing in our view we're going to have to go to the 3D view and then open up your

123
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.230
properties panel scroll down and turn on background images.

124
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.770
We're going to add in image now it should be a memory show we should be able to pick it yes we can.

125
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:30.480
We can pick it from the drop down and that's loaded in amnestic it's a foreground and then we go in

126
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.770
front.

127
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:32.610
Perfect.

128
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.020
So that looks pretty much how the picture is looking.

129
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:43.500
Before you go cross reference that in a few moments after I have set the access of this view to just

130
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.370
the camera view because that's all we care about now.

131
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.560
Let's open up a nother window.

132
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.720
And make sure that these things match.

133
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.920
So we've got one of the lines going through.

134
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.500
Yeah that's pretty much what I'm seeing over here.

135
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.950
Excellent.

136
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.450
So now I'm going to make that disappear and we can start moving the camera about.

137
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:15.170
So the first thing I'm going to do here is whilst in the camera view shift in F Saidon go into first

138
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:20.590
person view and perhaps I'll be able to get the camera in a position that makes sense.

139
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.880
Now these are stretching away into the distance.

140
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.060
And as you can see.

141
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.850
I can move this around now.

142
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:35.420
It looks probably a little lower than it than the nine anticipating it being her.

143
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.800
Now this is trial and error and it can take a while to do so.

144
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.770
Don't worry if you're not getting it right first time.

145
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.820
Wow this is going to take a little bit of manipulation to do.

146
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.640
And of course that's an ideal time for a challenge.

147
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.970
I'd like you to go ahead and create your environment if you don't know the exact camera data.

148
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.770
This will be judgment and trial and error as specially if you don't know it's actual.

149
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.970
MM How wide an angle lens is and what camera it was taken on.

150
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.270
Now I suggest picking a scene especially if you're new to this that you know this information.

151
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.890
Otherwise you're going to spend in e.on tryna get to the end result.

152
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:25.190
Now knowing the actual camera's position is helpful in this particular example that I'm going through

153
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.070
I don't know where the photographer was stood.

154
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.120
Now I'm going to assume he was stood on the ground he or she was stood on the ground but I don't know

155
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.250
that they might be seated on top of a car or even in an aircraft control tower.

156
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.650
Now look for features that can be followed.

157
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:48.410
Now I've got some lines on the floor that I can map to a 3D model so it should only take me a few minutes

158
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.280
to line.

159
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:57.260
These are good enough that I can use it for placing 3D models on or other bits of geometry.

160
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:03.950
Go ahead and add a ground plane and any other objects that would have a shadow cast upon them.

161
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.320
So if you've got a pole or a little ridge in your Seen you need to model those as well so accurately

162
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:09.930
is modelled.

163
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:16.100
If you're modelling a window ledge you would have the model the lip over the edge as well so that shadows

164
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:23.440
if the light is coming in from above cast properly over the wall ball's video now and give that a go.

165
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.770
Okay guys welcome back.

166
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.660
I'm going to continue now creating my environment.

167
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:37.530
Now this is the stage I've gotten to so far and I am literally going to continue now moving the camera

168
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.560
about into why get it roughly in the right position.

169
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.550
Now this can take quite a while to get right.

170
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.320
You know is it to the left is it to the right.

171
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.240
Do I need to move quickly or slowly to align things.

172
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.450
And yes this can be quite a tedious process.

173
00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:02.700
Now I'm not going to bore you with this particular process I'm going to fade out now and I'll come back

174
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.490
after I faffed around for a bit and got it spot on.

175
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.080
Okay so I'm almost here at the moment and I've noticed an issue of it is a clipping issue.

176
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.590
I'm quite happy with this.

177
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.080
Edge is lined up but then it kind of stops there.

178
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.710
And that is the camera clipping distance.

179
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:28.210
So if I go in to my properties I should be able to change the view propertys.

180
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:33.410
Here we go clipping at a hundred or a thousand at the moment.

181
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:40.340
If I increase fat I should see more and I don't swing and I go to my camera clipping and scroll down

182
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:40.670
here.

183
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.260
Here we go clippings ends at one hundred.

184
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.060
So this is to do with the view itself.

185
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:52.400
As in this view which when I first created the shape I thought I had plenty of space but the camera

186
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:59.720
clipping is under the camera settings itself and once I extend that you can see it is now going into

187
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.750
the distance.

188
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:06.530
Son of a set that at a thousand as well and what that will be able to do is give me some more guidance

189
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:12.800
in making sure that this is correct and it's not at the moment so I will see you guys back in a few

190
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.790
moments.

191
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.710
Okay so welcome back.

192
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.090
And I think I'm almost done.

193
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:25.160
What I have done to try to approximate my my actual ground plane is I've jupe I've made these pieces

194
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.000
just a little bit thinner than they were before.

195
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.400
Alan I've while pieces there's plural.

196
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:38.480
I've created a couple of them because I think these gaps in the runway are different are different spacing

197
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.350
basically So I've made a couple of them laid them out.

198
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.970
I seem to be getting quite a good correlation between what I can see on the camera and what I can see

199
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:47.900
here.

200
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.990
Now I think these lines actually arch away ever so slightly so there may be a bit of distortion on the

201
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.360
on the actual image itself.

202
00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:02.180
Now one of the things I don't have or didn't consider is the other really good line and that's the horizon

203
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.740
line.

204
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:11.150
So I tried to match up the end of my piece with the horizon which I think I've done pretty accurately

205
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.570
here.

206
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.340
So what I should be able to do now after I've played with those things.

207
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.940
First of all I'm going to save because it took me ages to get the camera into that position to me about

208
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:25.790
5 or 10 minutes of faffing backwards and forwards and I'm literally going to scale this up on the x

209
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:32.600
axis so that it fits our runway or at least fits wherever the shadows and everything else are going

210
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.200
to go.

211
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.010
You can see here Virts it's.

212
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.450
It is expanding a wave.

213
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:44.610
I don't want it really too but that doesn't matter I can still move the object itself so it still lies

214
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.060
in roughly the right place.

215
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.690
Now I'm just going to scale back on the z axis just a little bit more.

216
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.510
I'll go over the corner of our picture and what happens over here in the distance doesn't really matter

217
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.030
we can see that it's slightly slanted away.

218
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.770
I don't think it's going to cause us any issues and if we zoom out in this sort of realm we can see

219
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:11.130
that's quite a large runway anyway so no matter where we put an object on there it should not matter.

220
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.910
In fact if there's an object right in the distance.

221
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.020
Well to be quite honest we're not going to really see any detail that it causes so this is the area

222
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.080
that was were literally going to be casting a shadow on in a few moments.

223
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.310
So my scenes all set up and ready to go.

224
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.460
How did you find setting up your scene.

225
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.310
You will see that it is somewhat of a pain to try and get it right.

226
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:39.870
Hence knowing that the more information about your scene the camera the lens that it was taken on is

227
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.910
very important.

228
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.890
Please show your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
