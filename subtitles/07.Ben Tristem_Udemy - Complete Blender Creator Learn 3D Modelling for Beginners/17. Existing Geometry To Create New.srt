00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,550
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,280
By the end of this lecture we're going to add a bit of color and we're also going to generate some geometry

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,470
using the new geometry that we've created.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,250
This is especially useful when you got parts that fit together because you can make sure that the parts

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,290
is the right size from the word go.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,300
So let's find out more.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:25,720
OK.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:33,160
So back over in a default blender file what we need to do is just experiment with separating out parts

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,500
of an existing model.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,920
So let's use this cube as a good example go into edit mode get the face on top perhaps inset that and

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,420
extrude down.

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,170
So this is similar to the whole we've got in the top of the lamp.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,360
Now the good thing is we've currently got this bottom face selected.

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,500
So what we could do is we can duplicate that face through the shift in D.

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,060
We've now got another face that exactly matches the one that was there before the press escape that's

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,990
going to place it back as if we had never moved it.

17
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:12,100
And then press the p key to separate and we do by selection or indeed at this point by loose parts because

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,110
it's not connected by anything but by selection we're being explicit here.

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,160
We've now got cube in cube 0 0 1.

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:29,020
If I tap out into object mode select cube 0 0 1 I then can go in and extrude out and we've got two pieces

21
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,180
here that are perfectly matched together.

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,780
Now at this point she may be saying well nothing in the real world a slow that it has tolerances we

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,940
need to give it a bit of space and your rights and we can do that in a couple of ways.

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:50,500
One of the easiest ones is to simply select it and scale it in ever so slightly giving us that gap a

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,390
little bit around it the other way that we could do it is we could start Beverly edges.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,290
So one of the reasons why this doesn't look quite right here it just looks like one piece is because

27
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,550
this edge around here is not beveled and it's just completely flush.

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:13,200
So an example of that would be selecting this one around here and then selecting the edge loop control

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,560
and B and just baffling that edge.

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,770
That gives you the impression that it goes in and that's one way of managing that.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,900
And finally if you didn't want to do adding actual geometry to our model we can undo that.

32
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,860
And as a whole object level we can go to our modifiers and actually add in a level modifier for instance.

33
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,810
The downside of that of course is it applies to the entire model in this case rather than just the edge

34
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,380
that we wanted unless we do some vertex painting which we'll learn about later on but for the time being

35
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,530
we could bevel and edge we could leave it as it is or we could just make sure we get everything roughly

36
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,870
the right size to begin with.

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,100
And so tuck it in ever so slightly select this one that's get rid of that and there we go.

38
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,290
It does look like two separate bits at this point or indeed make the other one slightly larger.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,580
In general you probably don't want to make the other one larger and you want to keep things as tight

40
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,050
as possible.

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,690
And there we go that's that's sorted in the terms of an artistic sense.

42
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,820
You do have to take more care if you're doing this for a 3D printed part for instance you couldn't just

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,610
ad lib it all the time because you've got tolerances often that you have to adhere to.

44
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,340
But with that knowledge it's time for your challenge okay.

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,100
So your challenge is to create the stem coming out of the base.

46
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,400
Now use the existing geometry to create that STEM.

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Now do also refer back to your reference materials that you gathered earlier on and make sure that you're

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,340
still following along with the design of your original lamp.

49
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,660
You're going to need to delete unnecessary geometry at some point and you may do it as you transfer

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,470
mesh data from one object to another.

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,410
You may not need all of the data that comes across.

52
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,210
And that was also true of your modifiers so check your modifiers because in general when you separate

53
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:17,600
mesh data into a new mesh object it inherits not only modifiers but materials and a few other things.

54
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,310
So I'd recommend also doing the materials at the end because what I'm going to ask you to do is add

55
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,510
some basic materials to your model.

56
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,440
Think about what things are made of how you want it to look overall pause the video now and give that

57
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,040
a go okay.

58
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,300
Everybody welcome back.

59
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:41,660
Let's go ahead create the stem and make our lamp base look a little bit prettier OK so we left off here.

60
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,130
Let's go ahead and open up our animated lamp.

61
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,550
You can get rid of that.

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,030
So where do we start here.

63
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,960
Well let's start by going into edit mode of this object and having a look at the area that we're going

64
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,410
to create our model from now as a couple of areas that we can create it from.

65
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,330
I am going to use this base area I'm going to select the individual vertex and expand the selection

66
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,290
twice.

67
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:15,280
So I'm going to use control and num pad plus to do that and we can see we've got this circle around

68
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,940
the edge.

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,540
That's perfect.

70
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:25,330
So also I'm going to do here is I'm going to duplicate that and then separate it straight away by selection.

71
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,390
Perfect.

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,870
So we've got here lamp based path 0 0 1.

73
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm going to call that lamp stem I think.

74
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,960
Oh dear.

75
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,400
Caps lock is on lamp stem.

76
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,430
And of course I'm free to change that name in the future if I come up with a better name for it.

77
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,540
Now the first thing I'm going to do is just have a look of this and I can see that this bit of data

78
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,910
because it's not being curved round is actually a slightly too big.

79
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,680
So I'm going to go scale that in ever so slightly but in edit mode.

80
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:04,960
So let's select it lost an object mode go into edit mode select all and scale it in ever so slightly.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,460
Okay that looks good.

82
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:14,650
The next thing I'm going to do is select all of this in inner geometry and delete the vertices that

83
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,690
leaves sort of the ring around the outside that we can select and press F to fill in.

84
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:26,140
Now this point in time of course we've also got the subdivisions surface modifier still on and I'll

85
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,100
show you what happens if we leave it on.

86
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,740
Let's extrude this up.

87
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,750
We end up with what I can only describe as a missile or something that looks like a lemon squeezy.

88
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm going to get rid of that for the moment.

89
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,870
I don't think I need it.

90
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,530
I'm not starting to look pretty good.

91
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,550
We could tab out of that is still looks pretty faceted.

92
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,560
So we're going to shade smooth now.

93
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,320
I'm not going to worry too much about this top edge for the moment because in the next lecture we'll

94
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,640
be talking about making sure that these edges are nice and sharp.

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,990
I could have add a bevel to it as discussed before but I'm not going to do that at this moment in time.

96
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,650
The next thing I want to have a look at is the material.

97
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
So you've got everything sorted out.

98
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,700
Let's go ahead to the materials tab creating new material.

99
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm going to call this stem.

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,390
It's important that you name your materials appropriately.

101
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,890
Now this is going to be a rod of metal coming out of the base.

102
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,380
So I'm going to turn up the metallic setting of the principal shader.

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,070
I'm also going to lower the roughness not completely but down to around nought point one ish.

104
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,250
And we can test that by going in to rendered mode and having a look.

105
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Now the rest of the scene and lighting isn't here at the moment so let's bring that back.

106
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,420
Alternate will bring stuff back.

107
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,740
Now I select that bits of lamp and hide that's out of the way.

108
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,610
And this really jacket one as well.

109
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,540
Okay.

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,310
Excellent.

111
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,670
And you can see here because this is metallic it's reflecting the world around it.

112
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,260
It's worthwhile bearing that in mind.

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,640
Looks pretty good looks very shiny.

114
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,510
How about this base.

115
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,680
Well let's go ahead and give.

116
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,660
That's a material.

117
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,380
And of course it's going to be lamp base at this point.

118
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,570
And I'm going to jump back to this one and call this lamps.

119
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,360
Them be really explicit.

120
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,320
Now the base itself.

121
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,160
I can have it any color I want but I think I'm gonna go for something quite vibrant maybe a deep orange.

122
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,510
Yeah I like the look of that but it looks a bit plastic key at the moment.

123
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
I want it to look like painted metal.

124
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,210
So I'm going to decrease the rough and everything is going to end up shiny in this scene isn't it.

125
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:37,210
I don't want it to look completely reflective like that and let's increase the roughness little bit

126
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,560
more about that.

127
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,310
Okay perfect.

128
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,320
That is looking really nice.

129
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,070
Let's go back to this rod here.

130
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
Increase the roughness a little bit more as if it was a brushed.

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,200
Bits of metal perhaps even lower the metal a little.

132
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,140
Yeah that's looking a bit better.

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,740
I'm going to darken this color as well.

134
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,400
There we go.

135
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,270
Yeah.

136
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,870
I'm liking the look of that.

137
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,240
How are your bases coming along.

138
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,510
I think it looks much better now we've injected a bit of color into it.

139
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,750
Please share your work over in the discussions look forward to seeing it and I'll see you in the next

140
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,200
lecture.
