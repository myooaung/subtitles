00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.770
Okay everybody Welcome back over into blender.

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.820
So in this particular case what we're going to do is we're going to probably adjust the scale of this

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.860
slots as well.

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.670
But what we really need to put it into context is a backdrop.

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.180
Now we're going to be looking at most of the animation from this kind of angle.

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.810
So let's first of all have a look at where the camera's looking.

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.970
So it is looking in generally the right directions are backdrops going to go back this way.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.500
And so Scoot upwards.

9
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.880
So let's go ahead and add in a plane and I'm going to immediately call that plane backdrop so I know

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.910
what it is okay with that plane selected.

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
I'm going to scale it up but I'm going to scale it up Boston edit my SO I DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER ANY

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.800
transforms.

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.150
So let's scale it up that's maybe when he certainly needs to fill the camera maybe 10.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.290
I think that's a good sign.

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.270
So it's going to be 20 by 20 that's come out of a camera view and I'm going to select this edge running

16
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.220
backwards and forwards just here.

17
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.620
And then once we've selected that I can extrude that and just extrude it up by probably 10 again maybe

18
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.700
10 maybe a little more.

19
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.310
Okay.

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.890
So one of the things to bear in mind here is we might pan the camera from one side to the other and

21
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.230
it will look odd if we don't extend.

22
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.230
So what's I'm going to do is I'm going to select these two edges either side and then literally scale

23
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.050
them but only on the y axis.

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.460
And that will pull them out and I'm going to do that by may be a factor of three or thereabouts.

25
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.820
There we go.

26
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300
So we've got a nice stage to work on.

27
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.580
Now what we can do here so we didn't get a harsh corner and have some nice lighting as we can Bevel

28
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.090
this edge.

29
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.790
So if I go control and beat a bevel I can bring that up and then add a few more cuts in.

30
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.140
Now if I wanted to limit how far that Bevel actually went what I could first of all do is go Control

31
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.370
an arm and put a loop cut in and just bring it back ever so slightly.

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.740
That will limit where that backdrop is then I can go control and B and it will stop at that point and

33
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.920
I can add some more geometry so maybe that much in there is something to bear in mind here.

34
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.490
If I move the bevel so actually butts up against this particular edge that we've just added what will

35
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.040
happen is we will end up with quite a harsh edge there.

36
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.990
Let's turn on smooth shading right click shade smooth in object mode and we can see here there is a

37
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.800
harsh line.

38
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.020
And the reason why that harsh line there is there is simply because there's two bits of geometry on

39
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.950
top of one another.

40
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.370
So again in edit married what we can do is press the heat select all I'm gonna go F three to search.

41
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.700
Search for doubles.

42
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.290
No.

43
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.120
I will get the hang of this.

44
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.160
It is now merge by distance not removed doubles and we can see that smooths out immediately that extra

45
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.000
edge that was there.

46
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.400
So that's something to bear in mind if you don't remove that extra edge if two surfaces or two edges

47
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.760
are butted up next to one another you get a harsh transition between the two.

48
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.530
Okay that's starting to look pretty good.

49
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.250
So now it's time for your challenge.

50
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.070
So you could finish off this backdrop.

51
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.040
Okay everybody.

52
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.750
Challenge time.

53
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.530
I'd like you to set up your background now you can even follow with the type of background I've got.

54
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.630
You can make your own background as well perhaps placing your lamp in more of a room environments.

55
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.060
Lots of examples that you could do.

56
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.880
I'm gonna make mine as we've seen so far.

57
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.040
Now also set up your bench or other prop that you are using.

58
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.810
So we're gonna have our lamp jumping along jumping onto something falling off of something.

59
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.080
There's lots of different things that you could be doing at this point but make sure that you've blocked

60
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.050
out your scene with the parts that you're going to use.

61
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.780
I might add something in later but for the moment I want to keep it is just the scene itself with the

62
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.860
prop the bench and then the lamp that's going to jump onto the bench and finally feel free to explore

63
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.850
different setups.

64
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.300
This is all an experimental stage is no right or wrong here.

65
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.840
If you've got an idea Why don't you just try it and see how it turns out.

66
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.530
And of course those ideas you do try and share them with us as well.

67
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.130
So go ahead pause video now and give us a go

68
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.150
Okay everybody Welcome back.

69
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.770
Let's go ahead hop on over into blender and set up our background OK.

70
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.130
So let's go ahead and add some place holders.

71
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.090
I'm going to add in a cube to the scene ironically we had just destroyed a cube and scale this down

72
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.570
by half and then move it up on the z axis by half and then move it along the y axis that's roughly in

73
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.080
the right place for our lamp to jump on and then I'm gonna scale it on the x axis by maybe to make it

74
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.960
a bit more of the bench to climb on.

75
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.400
And then finally I'm going to apply my scale it's important to realize that as you're adding things

76
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.540
to the scene it's important that they are applied and he transforms.

77
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.520
That's especially true when it comes to our lamp if we don't do that we're going to end up with some

78
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.690
very funky stuff happening through it later on I'm just gonna check my background.

79
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.520
Yes we did all of those edits in edit mode which means that the scale has remained.

80
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.450
Now we could add a place holder for our lamp and I do.

81
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.000
And the reason why I do is because I want to see how light is affecting a subject that I don't want

82
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.010
to add too much detail.

83
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.860
Now there are a couple of ways of doing this the simple way of doing this is to just add a primitive

84
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.740
in its place.

85
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.500
So let's go ahead and do that now.

86
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.730
I'm going to select the 3d cursor plop it roughly where our lamp is.

87
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.270
I could look from the top as well.

88
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.940
That's pretty accurate.

89
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:39.980
And then I'm going to add in a cone so mesh objects one cone GZ one and then we go we've got a rough

90
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.890
place holder but there is something more exciting we can do we can use the grease pencil lines that

91
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.780
we've drawn and convert them into real geometry and we'll discover more about that in the next lecture

92
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.320
but until then please share your setups.

93
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.120
Did you go for a slightly different set up here.

94
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.970
I've gone for something more complex.

95
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.560
Have you gone for more of a corner of a room approach.

96
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.510
It's entirely up to you do make this project your own.

97
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.750
Don't just follow along exactly with what I'm doing.

98
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.270
One of the things I am going to do by the way here is go lamp place holder for the moment and also our

99
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.020
cube.

100
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.430
I don't know what to call that to be honest I forgot switch out of the 3D curse it's all there.

101
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.770
Cube I'm going to call it obstacle or bend.

102
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.760
I'm going to call it bench for the moment.

103
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.020
That's why I called it earlier on.

104
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.370
I think that's a good name for it.

105
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.280
Okay so everything's named appropriately over here.

106
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.400
I could link the bench and backdrop together.

107
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.800
So moving one on top of the other doesn't work in this view unless you hold down shift.

108
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.220
If we hold down shift I can set a parents and there we go.

109
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.800
That means if I move the background around the bench will move along with it so there's no harm in it

110
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.850
disappearing.

111
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.920
Let's also switch over just to rendered mode to see what things are looking like currently.

112
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.380
Well we don't have a lamp in our scene so we're going to sort that out in the next lecture.

113
00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.940
See you there.
