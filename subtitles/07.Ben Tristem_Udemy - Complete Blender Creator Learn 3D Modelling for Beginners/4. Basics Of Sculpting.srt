1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,690
In this video we're experimenting with sculpting and I'm creating a hideous of Franken Caterpillar and

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,370
I'm going to challenge you to do the same.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,180
So let's jump in and get started.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,420
Then except first is to convert our minerals into mesh so that we can edit individual vertices and start

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,860
to do sculpting on our objects.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,370
So while clicking on our parent level amble I'm going to go to object scroll down convert to mesh from

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,670
curve metal surface text.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,470
Excellent that allows us if we go into edit mode you can now see all the edges and vertices and faces

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:40,610
so I could click on three and then g to move this around so you can see we've got individual faces that

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,240
we can manipulate.

11
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,900
Excellent.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,950
Next up I'll do the same for just hop to actually into object mode.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,350
I'll do the same for our eyeball eyeball.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,320
We will go to object convert to mesh.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,730
Excellent.

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,300
So anything that you've got in your scene that you individual elements you converted to mesh.

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:05,210
Now just gonna rename from M bowl to cat to the pillows so it's nice and clear and from I amenable to

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,190
just straight up.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,930
I.

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,720
What I'm going to do is set up my object so that I can mirror it so I'm only working on one side and

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,090
that gets mirrored onto the other side.

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,490
If you've created your creature so that it's not mirror a ball not a problem you can do everything else

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,910
we're going to do in this lecture with all the sculpting without mirroring.

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,890
But if you do have something that does have symmetry to it then let's go through that process while

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,190
clicked on Caterpillar.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,960
I'm going to go to edit mode so I can see everything that's going on hit one on the keyboard to get

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,160
my vertices actually jump straight on that's from behind jump straight on I'm going to hop in a wireframe

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,990
mode just so I can see nice and clearly highlight all the way down to get everything that is up to my

29
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,870
middle line.

30
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,450
Hit delete delete the vertices just hopping make sure I've got all the little vertices that there's

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,080
no stragglers and I do have a couple of stragglers here.

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,550
One more straggler I believe.

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:05,780
Delete and I don't think I hit the delete button delete vertices excellent and I'll hit one of these

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:14,010
or select one of these and hit El G and then X just so I can move my object right up to the line that

35
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,600
screen back into my other shading mode back into object mode because next I'm going to mirror.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,800
Now I have auto mirror set up so I can easily get to it from my menu at the top here.

37
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,980
If you don't have auto mirror already you can go to preferences and then search for auto mirror click

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,700
on the tick box and then save preferences and then up in the very right next to our transform widget

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,580
you will see on the edit we have auto mirror auto mirror allows me to select my object and then just

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,770
say click auto mirror and it will mirror.

41
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,390
Wonderful.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,860
Now we have used clip turned on which is important.

43
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:55,800
If I go back into edit mode and highlight grab one of these hit L to select the whole thing now I'll

44
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,460
go right on my front view.

45
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,130
Now when I move x.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,340
Now when I move these you can see due to do if I move it into the middle it gets absorbed it clips doesn't

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,060
go over the top of my other side of the object and if I move it right up close and let that go because

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:21,090
I have used clip turned on that should hitting g x I can move it again merge or Weld my vertices together.

49
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,490
So that is now stuck in the middle which is exactly what I want.

50
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,940
Back in object mode I'll do the same with my eye.

51
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,730
Let's select one of my eyes.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,280
Okay I want to keep things consistent on the right hand side so I'm going to highlight click L to get

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,930
all the linked vertices delete delete the vertices there or didn't do a good job on that.

54
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,130
And El again delete that should get all the vertices this time.

55
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,000
Excellent.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,410
Just check this eyeball.

57
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,600
El again.

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,580
Move it over a little bit.

59
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,040
Now one of the problems you can see here is that our origin point is way over on the left hand side

60
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,930
so if I mirror this it will mirror the equal point of the origin.

61
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,790
Over here as things are set up at the moment so I'm going to do back into object mode I will click on

62
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,650
my eyeball.

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,100
I'll click on the three day cursor.

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,950
Put that right in the middle right on the y axis you can see my blue line running there and then up

65
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,440
onto objects set.

66
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,980
Origin we want to set the origin to the 3d cursor nicely the little yellow dots in the middle of the

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,620
cursor.

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,440
I can click on auto mirror and blink.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
It should put it in the right spots.

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,720
That was just a matter of changing with the origin point is okay.

71
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,290
So we now have our caterpillar.

72
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,420
It's been mirrored excellently.

73
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,800
Now we're ready for action.

74
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,390
Before I start sculpting I just want to do one thing to make a little bit easier to see up in our shading

75
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,630
view.

76
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,110
You see little Right Arrow or the arrow to the right click on that.

77
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,860
Make sure that we're in the correct view which is the solid view.

78
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:50,380
Click on the arrow to allow cavity and I'm going to change type to be both and increased all of the

79
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,610
values of ridges and valleys and you can see now that we get more detail.

80
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,200
You can see the white lines that are showing up so that you and so that I can see what we're doing as

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,470
we go.

82
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,430
It makes it a lot more pronounced.

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,280
Now let's do some sculpting what we need to do is jump over into office where we'll click on Caterpillar

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,010
won't really be doing much for the eye click on Caterpillar and change from object mode into sculpt

85
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,750
mode.

86
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm gonna be showing you how to use some of the brushes but what I encourage here is you just experiment.

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,350
I'm going to be turning my caterpillar into Frank and Caterpillar.

88
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,100
He's gonna be a monster by the end of this.

89
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,070
So let's just stop playing around with things if we click on draw up over onto our caterpillar.

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,190
You can see that that's just adding vertices it's pulling things out in the direction we're waving.

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,660
If I hold down control then it will slip things back in again.

92
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,770
So usually control does the opposite of a particular brush.

93
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,450
We move it around wherever we like it will change things as we go.

94
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,790
You can see that we've got a circle.

95
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,860
If I hit F then that allows me to increase the circle.

96
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,510
This is the the area that we're affecting so this will be a much bigger brush.

97
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,400
If I hit shift F that allows me to change the strength within that brush.

98
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,390
So if I make the strength full I might actually just reduce this pressure.

99
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,400
I don't make a mess.

100
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:02,980
Just check.

101
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,380
Yep it's on full and then as I go it's a smaller brush but it's making a big impact.

102
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,310
You can see I'm already already breaking my caterpillar but that's fine.

103
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,010
We're gonna be doing a lot of that in this video.

104
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,940
Now this is a good time for us to talk about something which I think sounds like an evil super villain

105
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,270
which is dying Topo dying Topo allows us to dynamically change the topology.

106
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,230
What I mean by that.

107
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:31,690
Well let's have a look at the top ology if I jump back over into edit mode I can see a lot more clearly

108
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,800
here the mesh of my object and you can see it's a real kind of mess.

109
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,450
There's this weird sort of circle thing we do have some good loops but we've got a lot of just mess

110
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,520
throughout as well.

111
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,360
And that's not a problem because this stage of our project where being creative and we're just getting

112
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,590
the shape of things later on we can have the choice of Rita apologizing if we've got way too much topology.

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,760
That's not a problem.

114
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,570
Our point here our main goal is to have it look good and you know let me just show you very quickly

115
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,310
the flow that you typically go through with an organic modelling workflow.

116
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,610
Block out your model which we have done convert to mash which we've done start sculpting which we're

117
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,300
doing right now.

118
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,500
The point here is the the creative juices flow.

119
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,840
And then to read apologize if mesh is important for animation or texturing.

120
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,080
That's why we clean this up we would get the right amount of detail and we have the right shape so that

121
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,550
it makes it easier for us to put our textures on there and makes it easier for us to for animators to

122
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,460
do what animators need to do for us to animator object.

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,240
And then we might unwrap you v unwrap and map and then to paint or texture.

124
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,550
This section will be adding hair to objects which is a little bit cheating but we still need to have

125
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,230
some reasonably nice mesh or reasonably nice topology so that the hair behaves the way we want it to.

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,420
But for sculpting we're not worrying about that we're looking at detail.

127
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,500
So how does that relate to Dian Topo.

128
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,500
Well let's have a look at what happens at the moment.

129
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:55,170
If we back into sculpt mode if I'm sculpting you can see we've got a point a point a point my my mouse

130
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:01,710
is snapping on my cursor snapping a certain vertices as I draw it's pulling them out or pushing them

131
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,500
in and just modifying the existing topology or the existing mesh that we have now.

132
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,000
I might want to have more detail say around the mouth where these two vertices is just not going to

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,390
cut it.

134
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm going to have a lot more detail so I don't get these sharp pointy edges and the way we address that

135
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,700
is with Dian Topo to turn Dian Topo on.

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,670
We got to our top settings tab just here and we find scroll down scroll down we find the setting of

137
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,720
Dian Topo clicking that on you'll get an error message or a warning message saying Hey this is going

138
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,300
to break and modifier that's breaking our mirror which is not a problem because as we break that we've

139
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:43,050
lost our mirroring but what we can do under Dian Topo is we find Ramesh and then we I believe for me

140
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,370
it's going to be from plus extra minus X and we click symmetries symmetry right some tries seven tries.

141
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,160
That's the guy who fights nine Topo.

142
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,070
I think Silver tries.

143
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,260
Now what we've caught with time Topo is the ability to add more detail to our mesh if I go back to the

144
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,620
wireframe Modus Libre easier to see as I add you can see it's adding a lot more detail to our mesh it's

145
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,540
going to undo that.

146
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,690
How much detail is it adding.

147
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,960
Well there's one sitting here which it defaults to which is relative detail.

148
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,490
That means if we get really close then we'll be adding tons of tiny little detail whereas if we scroll

149
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:25,230
out scroll out it will be adding much less detail more bigger sized faces if you will which is great

150
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,010
if you're getting into the habit of okay.

151
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,800
If I want little details and lives here I'm moving very close in on bigger details I move out a little

152
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,390
bit more.

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,760
That's good.

154
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,070
If you get into that habit until then what I like to do is set this to constant detail and then we can

155
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,050
change the resolution at the moment it's three let's set it to six and see how that feels.

156
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,870
Which means no matter how far we scroll in and out it will always add the same amount of detail.

157
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,930
Now of course our brush size is going to change the way scrolled all the way in our brushes little.

158
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,800
So it's just impacting a little area and we're scrolling out our brushes big but the amount of mesh

159
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,950
that's being added is is consistent no matter whether we're scrolling or scroll down it's just how much

160
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,980
of the area is affected by the size of our particular brush.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,230
Okay.

162
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,530
So let's that's in Topo.

163
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,220
Let's go through some more of the brushes we have draw sharp which similar to draw but it's gonna draw

164
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,670
a much sharper line.

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,820
This one it's digging in as opposed to pulling out something to hold down control and that will push

166
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:27,570
up above If I go back to draw and drawing a little bit more detail you can see that drawing is adding

167
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:33,160
more detail whereas the draw sharp wasn't adding when I've already got that detail in place.

168
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,270
It can manipulate it but when I've got these fatter kind of detail it wasn't doing as good a job of

169
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,550
responding there.

170
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,300
So interesting that draw is adding with Don top I turn on is adding more of that detail.

171
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:45,990
Okay.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,520
And as we just go through clay that will have things behave as if it's lumps of clay which is really

173
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,700
handy Clay strips you can chuck down some strips like that again.

174
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,950
This is from more of the traditional clay sculpting.

175
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,380
So if you're familiar with that this is kind of a cool way to get those similar tools.

176
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:09,150
We have layer which allows us to put a layer on top of our existing geometry which is really handy.

177
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,140
So let me see if I can illustrate this more effectively if we put it over the top of there.

178
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,920
You can see that it's putting it over the top in a consistent manner it's layering it over the top in

179
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,320
flight does exactly what we expect it to do it puffs things up.

180
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,180
So if you want to inflate your tail down in here let me f make it bigger.

181
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,500
Inflate inflate inflate.

182
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,940
We can kind of inflate it like a balloon like a marshmallow blob is similar.

183
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,900
Just make my bra size a bit smaller.

184
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,640
But the strength a little bit more adds just adds a blob to things blob blob blob.

185
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,450
Excellent crease which is handy for us to literally add creases off us to go inside the mouth.

186
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,830
Yeah I wanted to create that up.

187
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:54,780
It's going to pull my vertices together to make a crease smooth does what we expect it smooth things

188
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,850
down smooth out some of our detail flatten which is great so underneath my caterpillar if I want to

189
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,420
flatten you to make it look like he's on top of some sort of surface make it less round that has a flattened

190
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,750
feel to it feel good for filling up particular spaces we might want to fill inside the mouth here scrape

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,760
that's going to be like scraping along clay with a scraping kind of tool if you make this tool quite

192
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,860
small then it's going to scrape just a bit of a line if I can do this correctly there it goes great

193
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,950
great great scrape and obviously bigger is going to do more I have a bigger scrape okay multiplying

194
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:35,970
scrape allows us to do a really cool kind of pinching scraping maneuver I quite like this too particularly

195
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,670
if you've got something where you want to have some sharp angles to it.

196
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,990
Speaking of that for all of these tools all of these brushes you can go through the right hand side

197
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,660
click on your top tab and then change the brush settings so the plane angle if I was to make the plane

198
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,300
angle very small then it's going to be a much flatter effect that I'm getting if I was to make that

199
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,890
plane angle bigger then it's really going to dig into it that might be something that I'd want to go

200
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:05,430
into my antennae and kind of dig around to make an outside edge to it it's a little bit of a clunky

201
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,900
way of going about doing it but I've sort of got what I wanted.

202
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,220
Similarly I could do this along the mouth to give them mouth a little bit more and more pizzazz and

203
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,940
then pinch as expected it allows us to pinch pull things together a little bit like crease but it's

204
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:27,780
more about pinching particular areas together grab is good if you wanted to grab an entire area and

205
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,970
kind of pull it up or modify it or stretch it out allows you to grab a lot of the mesh at one point

206
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,600
in time.

207
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:39,570
Similar with elastic deform snake hook is very different actually and show you snake is one of my favorites

208
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,940
I'll make the brush smaller.

209
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:47,610
This allows us to yank out of the objects I'm going to grab and pull and make these little kind of caterpillar

210
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,930
leg things Caterpillar leg Caterpillar legs I'm gonna go in and make a few of these Caterpillar legs

211
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,980
you might want to do something similar to yours.

212
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,320
It's also this tool is really really good for making kind of evil horn bump type things on top so leverage

213
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,120
is if we make this bigger then I can get a larger sort of hunchback a lump type thing going on with

214
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:17,640
my evil Caterpillar if I make it smaller then it's going to be more of a narrow lumpy type thing okay.

215
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,230
Out of the other ones is a few to play around with which are kind of cool.

216
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,940
The other one that I wanted to show you was two masks so if you click on mask and find an area where

217
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,610
you say Okay I want to mask out this area just here.

218
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,180
That means that my brush won't apply.

219
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,910
The area that I've got mask and then I can go and grab say the draw tool and you see as I go draw draw

220
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,880
draw draw doesn't do anything during the mask.

221
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,500
And then on the backside of the mask it starts drawing again.

222
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,420
So that allows me just to apply to specific areas and it's cool for doing this kind of took effect.

223
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,560
So this set setting a mask allows me to paint things on if I go to the box selection that allows me

224
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,150
to grab things quickly mask out that entire area if I hold down control and then select the mask.

225
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,180
It undoes that.

226
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,110
So as I said before control is usually the opposite for each of these things.

227
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,710
And if you haven't been playing along and if you haven't already jumped into the challenge the challenge

228
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,420
I've got for in this video is to flex your creative muscles go crazy with sculpting create something

229
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,700
that is hideous like I'm doing beautiful it is totally up to you and once you finish please share with

230
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,670
your your creation with it we would love to see it jump in take on that challenge now when you come

231
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:31,900
back I'm just gonna show you a little bit of extra tweaking I've done to my hideous Caterpillar so I

232
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:38,380
start off by inflating making my caterpillar look a bit fatter a bit more grotesque puffing it up just

233
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,210
grabbing the hook tool the snake hook tool and pulling some more bits out making some eye sockets giving

234
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,820
some ridges lift it fairly kind of bumpy and skimpy but later on I'll smooth that out just again going

235
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,490
along with my Ridge to trying to make a layer of detail on the outside trying to make it look like got

236
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,570
a bit of a bigger mouth to it as well I masked out the inside of the mouth because I found I was accidentally

237
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,700
grabbing it gives them spiky TV kind of things more of those sort of bumps just pulling it out played

238
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,780
around with the the antennae a little bit trying to grab it and pull it apart of stretching the head

239
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,520
I didn't really like the effect that was getting there more bumps just bumpy bumps snake hook pulling

240
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,710
things out the grab tool and I try to tie Oh but I didn't really like it so I changed my mind on that

241
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:19,820
okay.

242
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,540
There we have it my somewhat hideous of Franken Caterpillar beast.

243
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,790
So I look forward to seeing what you've come up with and I will see you in the next lecture.
