00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,430
Welcome to using source control resetting in this video you will go over how to extract a previous version

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,060
of your files and become aware that blend files are made up of linked files need to be accessed and

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,950
restored in a slightly different way.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,080
So first of all let's have a look at source tree.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,260
Okay so in front of us I have some uncommitted changes.

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:32,660
Now I have some unstaged files down here now this might look slightly different to how it looked before

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,180
and that's because I've gone for a flat layout.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:44,240
So on the top of this particular section there is a little button that if you click you can change the

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,410
view type.

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,810
So I did have it on treeview like this but I was getting fed up of having to open these folders up in

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,030
the hierarchy to see what was going on.

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,730
So I've changed it to a flat list single column is absolutely fine.

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,060
Tells me exactly what's going on and where things are.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,920
Although I can break it out so the path is separate to the others.

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,370
So I've got I've changed the scene.

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,650
The Gothic church I have a note that is a test for this lecture.

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,670
This particular lecture that so that's been added to the working directory that we were in at the moment.

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,340
I've got a couple of tests some in Dune stained glass windows few guys and a glass test blend file.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,290
I've been working on.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:32,870
Now if I want to go back in time I have to go to the next layer up and I've got all of my commit history

21
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,560
going here.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,840
Going back and back and back in time.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:44,080
Now if I want to pick up a file from with in any of these historical events see this as a time line.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,980
If I want to go back in time to that say Here we go.

25
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:57,240
G A P E 16 linking blend files I created a version of the Gothic church at that particular point.

26
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:06,620
If I go and right click on that I can open the selected version and that will open up that particular

27
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,860
file and we get a big long error message.

28
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,500
Now this is because it contains linked items.

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,020
If this was a non linked item so let's say the doorway or the archway the the items which were linking

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,990
then we wouldn't have this error message but because we got linked items it causes us a problem so we

31
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,750
just have a look at the blend file.

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,830
Once the error message is gone we can see that pretty much everything has gone.

33
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,150
Every bit of linked information and it's been replaced with empties.

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,560
So you'd have a couple of choices at this point.

35
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:49,270
You could relink formal by reimporting them into the scene and then replacing the appropriate empty

36
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,970
with the right mesh and that would be a real pain if the scene well even with this relatively straightforward

37
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,730
scene would be a real pain to do so we don't want to do that so what we need to do instead would linked

38
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:07,270
files is actually go back in time completely and we can do that by the following notice at the top here

39
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,970
the name is complete gobbledygook this is assets seeing Gothic church before and then a serial number

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,360
that's coming from the database that everything stored in.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,800
But because this is existing within that database and not within the actual file structure itself the

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,350
current file structure it doesn't know where anything else is.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,920
And this is perhaps where absolute links to our files would work better than relative links.

44
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:42,100
But that aside what we need to do now is basically close that down because that's of no use to us.

45
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,660
What we can do however is right click on there and check out this.

46
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,260
This basically this part in history when we do that it gives us a warning.

47
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,040
We can go ahead and click okay now.

48
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,430
My file structure is exactly how it was when this comet was made.

49
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,700
So if I go ahead and I can double click these as well.

50
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,900
If I go ahead and open that up we can see that it works.

51
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,400
Now that is pretty cool.

52
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:19,530
At this point I can go in straightaway and go file save as and call it.

53
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,220
I don't know it depends on what you're calling it recovered.

54
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,530
Say I'd made some major mistake during my model or added a load of nonsense to it and I didn't want

55
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,890
to go ahead and delete things and like when I could just go back to a previous happy state.

56
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,960
My model so recovered gough Gothic church and a save that blend file.

57
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:47,690
Now what I can do is go back to the source tree and go forward in time and go all the way back up here.

58
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:55,960
So then I go to the last comet and check out that comet that pushes everything back to how it was before

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,210
we went back in time to check everything else and when we go to are uncommitted changes if I just make

60
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,010
this area a little bigger we will see that now.

61
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,790
Waiting there for us is the recovered Gothic church blend.

62
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,430
Now will we make our new comet.

63
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,130
It will save that and we would have got back any potential date that we had lost or a model that we

64
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,030
now want to take.

65
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,070
Perhaps in a new direction.

66
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,860
That is brilliant.

67
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,260
Now I would like you to give this a go.

68
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,420
In a very small challenge.

69
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:33,230
I would like you to go back in time yourselves and restore a previous version of your interior scene.

70
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,020
Balls of the air now and give that ago.

71
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,660
Okay guys.

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Welcome back.

73
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,640
Let's do that process again and I'll show you a couple of other nuances as we go.

74
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,370
So we're back in the file structure itself down here.

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,530
And I want to go back now.

76
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:01,980
At this point in time I can see here that I made a commit that can change that contained the Gothic

77
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,790
church.

78
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:10,290
So if I want to go back before just one step before that I never committed I never made any change to

79
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,110
the Gothic church so I can be a little confusing sometimes if I want to go back just one stage in that

80
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,490
scene.

81
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,350
I'd actually have to find when I change that.

82
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,360
It wouldn't necessarily be there.

83
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,260
What just going one back.

84
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,040
So I'd go back here and go.

85
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,230
No it's not in there.

86
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,130
This is where the flats lay out really helps you know diving in and out of folder structures.

87
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,110
So no it's not though I'm just looking for Gothic church blend.

88
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,820
And as we go down here this is looking a bit bigger.

89
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,800
And there we go.

90
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:50,160
So I didn't change the actual scene itself didn't save that scene change anything in its way back here

91
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,330
in gaap 20.

92
00:06:52,350 --> 00:07:00,060
So at that point I could go back and check out that area click okay here the folder changes I can double

93
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,280
click and open up Gothic church.

94
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,360
It should work when it opens up.

95
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,640
I might need to tap into it.

96
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,920
There we go.

97
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,810
Just going to close that down and try double clicking that again.

98
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,580
There we go.

99
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,840
So that is how it was before I started adding all of the portals the light portals in in the previous

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,480
lecture.

101
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,530
And I might actually want to go back to this state if I don't want all of those portals in because it

102
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,660
turned out that at the moment I've got enough light coming in that the portals are having very little

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,170
effect other than slowing my scene down.

104
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:42,760
So at this point I'm going to go file save as an unknown and go Gothic church before portals and then

105
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,180
of course I can fork that and go off in a different direction with it so let's save that as the blend

106
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,080
file.

107
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,140
Now remember at this point I'm going to have to go back to the committee that I made or the most recent

108
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,920
committee in this case and I should have in uncommitted changes a list of items.

109
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,480
And here we go rigi off recovered gough at church someone done and got it shown.

110
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,970
There he is back in camp and Gothic church before the portal.

111
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,010
Well before light portal's I could have been a bit more descriptive.

112
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,850
So then I can go and stage all of my file so I don't lose any of the recovery that I've just done.

113
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,890
And of course I'm going to call this one appropriately.

114
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,780
And there we go I'm going to make my commit.

115
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,990
And everything's done okay.

116
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,520
Brilliant.

117
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:40,240
I hope you guys restored a previous version of your interior scene and I will see you guys in the next

118
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,920
lecture.
