00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are gonna play with the mirror modifier the mirror
1

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.710
modifier will duplicates or mirror any object that it's applied to and here you can see we can move one
2

3
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.080
cube around and the other one moves along with it.
3

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.560
Now this is a great tool for whenever you're modeling something that is symmetrical it means that you
4

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.410
don't have to worry about both sides of the object whether it's a plane a human or a knight.
5

6
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.220
It'll be incredibly useful.
6

7
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520
So let's find out more okay.
7

8
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.260
So welcome to the fold blend file.
8

9
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.430
Let's go ahead and add the mirror modifier straightaway.
9

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.550
And then we can discuss why it's not working.
10

11
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.110
Okay.
11

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.510
So we go over to the right hand side to the properties window and go to the modifiers tab which is the
12

13
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.520
one that looks like a spanner or wrench going to add a modifier and go to the Generate column because
13

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.070
we're generating new geometry and go to mirror.
14

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.890
And here we go we've applied the mirror modifier and we have a look we've got a couple of options down
15

16
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.800
here we've got these different axes here we've got bisect flip we've got a mirror object and there's
16

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.870
loads more other options down here.
17

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.240
First of all what happens with the X axis ticked.
18

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.360
Well what it means is that along this X axis that's is where is going to be mirrored.
19

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.280
So this cube is being mirrored either side of its own origin.
20

21
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.550
At the moment it's got no other mirrored object to refer to.
21

22
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.170
So it's just going to use itself in fact if I shift and right click over here and then right click and
22

23
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.070
set the origin to the 3d cursor There we go we can now see that it is indeed the objects origin that
23

24
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.080
is reflecting about and we can now move this and it all moves together.
24

25
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.630
So if you were doing it like this you'd need to be in edit mode.
25

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.520
And now when you move your geometry it will mirror about the origin points along the X axis as we can
26

27
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.360
see here put a tick in the Y axis as well you can see we get four and if I put one in the Z axis
27

28
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.480
you can see it goes along the Z axis and this can be incredibly useful if you're making anything
28

29
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.330
to be quite honest if it has these axes of symmetry.
29

30
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.550
Now our knight is going to have one axis of symmetry running straight down the middle.
30

31
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.180
So we only need one of these ticked but having it all the way over here.
31

32
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.390
That's no good.
32

33
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.710
So what else can we do.
33

34
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.050
Well my preferred method for using the mirror modifier is to have an object.
34

35
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.120
So when you're moving your messages around you have much more control over it.
35

36
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.150
So I'm going to send to my 3d cursor if shift in S and cursor to world origin and then I'm going to add
36

37
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.680
in an empty.
37

38
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.410
I'm going to call that empty straightaway something.
38

39
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.890
So let's scroll up here and I'm going to call it mirror point.
39

40
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.210
Now you don't have to do this but it is my recommendation it's just my personal workflow.
40

41
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.800
And then in the cube itself in the mirror modify we can set the mirror object to be that mirror point.
41

42
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.040
And now it doesn't matter where the origin is that's incredibly important.
42

43
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.070
If you're using the origin as a pivot point or a gravity point that wasn't smack bang in the center of
43

44
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.540
a model of course.
44

45
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.070
Now everything's all skewed.
45

46
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.430
I'm going to go ahead and set my origin back to the center of the geometry where it would be normally
46

47
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.160
we could see this is the real one over here and this is the one that's being generated by our modifier.
47

48
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.610
And then we can move things back together.
48

49
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.860
Now you're probably wondering as we push these things back together that we have intersecting geometry
49

50
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.780
going on and you would be right if we scroll down here there's a couple of options.
50

51
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.570
There's vertex groups merging and clipping now clipping is the one we want to turn on.
51

52
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.500
Which means that this mirror points here which happens to be exactly where the Y axis is is now not
52

53
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.980
being duplicated past this point when it reaches that barrier it just stops.
53

54
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.530
So you're pushing in here we go.
54

55
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.460
We can see it clips at that point.
55

56
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.820
Now you may notice it behaves weirdly one way and the other but it absolutely clips at that point which
56

57
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.870
is really useful it means you can now start building up a model quite quickly without needing to worry
57

58
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.880
about it.
58

59
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:32.900
Now if you were starting afresh with a fresh cube you may want to divide it up first so we can go into
59

60
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.880
edit mode and go control and up a loop cuts around the axis that you want.
60

61
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.530
In this case I am going to pick the X axis.
61

62
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.410
I'm going to press escape to stop the moving of it.
62

63
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.580
So now I've cut it up like that's what I can do is go into wireframe and select some of these vertices
63

64
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.350
I can then delete those vertices and we've got a hollowed half cube I can then go in and add my mirror
64

65
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.260
modifier and this time it'll be along the Y axis in this particular example.
65

66
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.070
And I've unticked X and there we go we've now got half the mesh data that we need to edit which is incredibly
66

67
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.680
useful.
67

68
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.940
And of course you can go in and add in a mirror object if you want to do that as well to be really explicit
68

69
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.520
that this is the point at which these things are mirroring around that's incredibly useful.
69

70
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.970
Let's say if you built a car and you want a wheel and you want it duplicated on the other side and at
70

71
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.390
the back end you can use a mirror modifier for doing that.
71

72
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.560
And I would use empties to position the mirror points.
72

73
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.810
Now clipping here here's a good example of it if we grab this vertex here we can move it the other side.
73

74
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.840
See that's pushing through the geometry or we can split it open but if we turn clipping on when we push
74

75
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.900
those two things together they become one vertex and they merge at that point as well.
75

76
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.200
That's crucial.
76

77
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.820
Otherwise you'll end up with doubles.
77

78
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.150
And that can cause some rendering artifacts if you decide to split it in half and you end up being on
78

79
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.630
this or this axis is going to be a bit of a pain in the backside to try and use the mirror modifier
79

80
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.990
because it won't look quite right.
80

81
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.880
So in this particular case make sure when you do cut your model in so you cut it up either along it's
81

82
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.230
X or Y axis before using the mirror modifier.
82

83
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.920
And now it's time for your challenge. Ok so your challenge.
83

84
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.530
This one will probably take you a good 10, 15 minutes or so to do maybe even about half an hour if you're
84

85
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.030
spending a lot of time with the modelling however long you take.
85

86
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:45.270
Remember you can do several iterations so don't just focus on just doing it once perhaps make a couple
86

87
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.030
of them and see which one you like the best.
87

88
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:55.230
Now start with the chess piece base that we made previously loading your nights reference material divide
88

89
00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:03.210
the base in two and add a mirror modifier using a mirror object such as the empty we used before the
89

90
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.990
base should now look like it did originally.
90

91
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.310
If it doesn't then tweak your settings until it does.
91

92
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.360
You may have picked the wrong axis on the mirror modify.
92

93
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.460
Very easy to do.
93

94
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.630
And this is the bit that should take the most time constructing the rest of your knight.
94

95
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.800
Now I would recommend starting by blocking out the main shape and then adding detail afterwards rather
95

96
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.400
than trying to add detail as you go.
96

97
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.140
You generally get a much better output if you do it like that.
97

98
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.110
The other thing if you're planning on like me doing some 3D printing at the end of the section to see
98

99
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:44.670
what your chess pieces look like then do make sure you don't have any intersecting geometry or any floating
99

100
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.850
geometry that's not joined to your main mesh.
100

101
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.480
If you do unfortunately the 3D print will fail.
101

102
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.830
If you were going down that route just the tip.
102

103
00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.570
And of course I'd want to see how you've got an answer please do share your night over in the discussions.
103

104
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.260
Now if you've made several iterations I'd love to see your progress too.
104

105
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.380
So perhaps after you finish your base layer share that and then when you start adding detail go back
105

106
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.300
and share your progress as well.
106

107
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:12.810
Be great.
107

108
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:19.610
See how you're getting on, pause the video now and give that a go. Hello everybody and welcome back.
108

109
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:27.240
Let's hop on over into blender and make our knight Okay so let's go ahead open up.
109

110
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.920
I'm not going to be able to open up my original am I.
110

111
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.380
No.
111

112
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.920
So let's go ahead.
112

113
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.210
I need to add a favorite here.
113

114
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.420
So chess set models.
114

115
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.510
Now the chess scene is what we're working on pieces chess piece base.
115

116
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.910
Let's go ahead and open that's up.
116

117
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.800
There we go.
117

118
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:53.710
Now sometimes you will end up with pink material like fest this has just lost its reference which is
118

119
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.330
fine because I'm going to delete that anyway.
119

120
00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:04.670
The base I'm now going to pull before I do anything else that save as and call it the night.
120

121
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.570
Very easy to otherwise lose my chess piece base.
121

122
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.790
So I've got my base there.
122

123
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.600
Brilliant.
123

124
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:09.990
Okay.
124

125
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.660
So let's bring in our knights I'm going to add an image as plane in this case I'm going to go to my
125

126
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:27.070
knight perfect and I'm going to set it's x dimension so scale it down until it reads roughly 4 on the
126

127
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:33.280
scale it down zoom in so I've got a bit more play that's almost there and I suppose it doesn't matter
127

128
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.310
too much if it's not exactly four centimetres let's move this around so I'm going to rotate it's on
128

129
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.430
the X axis by 90 and I'm going to rotate on the z axis by 90 as well.
129

130
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.880
So it's looking forward.
130

131
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.980
Traditionally the y axis is backwards and forwards.
131

132
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:56.860
In fact I want to rotate it on the Z axis by 180 so is facing fully forward and then it's just a matter
132

133
00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.140
of lifting up to the right place.
133

134
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.220
Now of course this was the pawn base so it will need adjusting as well to an appropriate scale so it's
134

135
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.210
scale it's up until it was around four centimeters.
135

136
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.080
So there we go.
136

137
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.520
Perfect.
137

138
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.970
So we've got our base pretty much lined up and ready to go.
138

139
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.250
Let's go and add in our mirror modify so I'm going to hide the reference material for the moment go
139

140
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:28.990
into edit mode go into wireframe and use the z key to bring up this radio dial and go to wireframe.
140

141
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:36.160
Now I can cut through my model I'm going to bring up the tool shelf because I don't have the right tool
141

142
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.700
enabled.
142

143
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.550
I've got a bevelling  tool there.
143

144
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.260
So let's go to, back to our selection box and select half our model brilliant.
144

145
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.510
Now we're gonna make a hole in the top and bottom by doing this.
145

146
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:52.770
That's not an issue we can fix that later and X and we're going to delete all of those faces.
146

147
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:59.410
Now we do have some extra geometry here I'm going to delete that top face and delete the bottom one
147

148
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.220
as well.
148

149
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:00.770
There we go.
149

150
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.160
So you've got this sort of hollow object for the moment.
150

151
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.700
Let's go.
151

152
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.730
Add in our mirror modifier.
152

153
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.270
Now it's about the X axis at the moment which is great.
153

154
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:18.700
I am also as per the challenge going to add in an empty and called it mirror points and make sure that
154

155
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.240
the piece is mirror point is about that.
155

156
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:28.690
Now to be really really accurate what I'm now going to do is I'm going to parents the mirror points
156

157
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.130
to the base itself.
157

158
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:35.020
So if you move the object it stays with its control and P set the parents objects.
158

159
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.590
And there we go.
159

160
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.980
And whilst I'm here this needs to be called Knight.
160

161
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:45.050
Okay let's save the work as we've done so far and now it's a matter of starting to make our model.
161

162
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.680
The bottom does need to be filled in so I'm going to go to edge select mode select this edge loop running
162

163
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.440
around here and press F to fill it in and I'm gonna go back to solid shading for the moment so I can
163

164
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.220
see what's going on.
164

165
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.030
Perfect.
165

166
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.390
Now we've got a hollow model that's absolutely fine with me.
166

167
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.160
Let's turn back on the might.
167

168
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.640
And there we go.
168

169
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.760
So theres a couple of other options on blocking out the model at the moment.
169

170
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:17.380
I'm going to do what I did before which is changing this object here so that it's properties it is wireframe.
170

171
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.500
So I can see through it.
171

172
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.390
So I'm going to go down to display as and change it to Wired then I can see through and then I can make
172

173
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.190
the beginning changes.
173

174
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:33.980
So this first bit of it is actually really really shallow compared to all the other pieces.
174

175
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.470
So that's interesting this scale that's in.
175

176
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.250
And again this is moving things around.
176

177
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:46.690
I'm trying to make sure that they only stay on one axis rather than tweaking it and skewing it around
177

178
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:53.530
lets scale that up to about there and move it down.
178

179
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.860
This is probably one of the pieces that's going to have the most amount of detail on it.
179

180
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.220
So I'm going to move that down as well.
180

181
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.130
So it's approximately the right place
181

182
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.430
Okay.
182

183
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:12.340
So does cut in really deeply there and I'm going to do that by literally shifting it in and then immediately
183

184
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:21.760
extruding up and scaling out again it really does have that harsh transition in and out again.
184

185
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.430
And I can tweak that again later.
185

186
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.420
OK.
186

187
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.090
Some major shapes here.
187

188
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:34.200
We're going up and I'm scaling in and moving and scaling out again and I'm trying to leave at this point
188

189
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:40.940
the mane of the horse to last so I'm going to cut off the model around there as I go.
189

190
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.840
And again we can rotate this as well if it's not right in the right place and then it's just a matter
190

191
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:58.940
of extruded up again rotating that to fit the right place and then moving it a little and scaling
191

192
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:04.760
it's in and then we can add this bulge in here afterwards.
192

193
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:11.240
So I'm going to scale that up slightly and then move it because of course we want the horse arching
193

194
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.070
backwards.
194

195
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:17.360
Now the head is an interesting one because if you followed what's I'm currently doing all the way around
195

196
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.900
what you end up with is this very very tight turn.
196

197
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.300
Of course you don't need to do that.
197

198
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.160
We select this top loop here going to come out quickly to make sure it looks okay.
198

199
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.410
Yes it does.
199

200
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.840
Do remember to do has very easy to accidentally knot and that can get you kind of confused when you
200

201
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.500
go back to your model and it's not like it was supposed to be right.
201

202
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:46.400
So what we can do here is we can actually extrude all the way up to the top here and perhaps scale that
202

203
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:53.180
a little and move it here and there will be something else going on about there.
203

204
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:58.870
I can shift that back slightly widen up and then just shift it back.
204

205
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.270
OK.
205

206
00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:06.330
Because now what we can do is from these I don't know how many faces there are these two here and obviously
206

207
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.830
two on the other side.
207

208
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:14.820
We can bring the the face of the horse forward and look this is why we need to check our model as we
208

209
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.230
go if you can see here we're actually splitting away.
209

210
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:23.630
And the reason it's doing that is because I forgot to check clipping.
210

211
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.610
So it's not kept those lines together.
211

212
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:32.970
So what's I'm gonna do is select the edge running down the model that looks like it's oh no look it
212

213
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.150
pushes inside several times.
213

214
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:40.840
So let's scale it on the X axis by 0.
214

215
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.280
So I'm going to X and X again and go zero.
215

216
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.940
And that's going to flatten it into one particular place.
216

217
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:53.730
And that should have alleviated the whole splitting apart that was going on there.
217

218
00:15:53.790 --> 00:16:00.630
So what that was was was scaling on the local x axis by zero which flattens everything down.
218

219
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.750
We could do the similar to this top bit here if we wanted this top edge loop running around flat.
219

220
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.510
We could scale it this time because it's on the top.
220

221
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.930
On the z axis.
221

222
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.880
But the locals that axis by 0 and it will flatten it out.
222

223
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.890
I don't want to do that but that's a useful tip for you to know.
223

224
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.400
So there will be these eight faces and we're going to move them forward.
224

225
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.510
And this is also going to be where it comes in use again.
225

226
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:34.740
So we're going to go extrude those out all the way over here and we're going to go scale Y, Y zero.
226

227
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:39.940
And that's going to flatten all of those obviously make it very large at some point.
227

228
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.420
And we need to sort that out.
228

229
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:47.340
But it gets us to the part that we need so we need these two edges here and we need to bring them in
229

230
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.790
because that is far far too wide.
230

231
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.830
So let's bring them in there.
231

232
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.540
And the same with these two edges here now fortunately I have to select those as an edge loop.
232

233
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.250
And there we go.
233

234
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.660
That's the start of the horse.
234

235
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.890
Now of course this front bit here can be manipulated as well to bring it out a little bit.
235

236
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:11.100
Now sometimes if you're on the wrong side of a mirror modifier can be very difficult to select the bit
236

237
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.660
that you want.
237

238
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.960
It's actually this edge here.
238

239
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.760
So if I'm on this edge clicking and nothing's going to happen because this is fake geometry it doesn't
239

240
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.130
really exist.
240

241
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.180
This however is real.
241

242
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.340
And then we can pull that forward slightly so with all of that I'm going to scale it in now so i'm going to
242

243
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.420
select those four front edges.
243

244
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.910
I think there's going to be quite a bit of little tweaks here there.
244

245
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:41.890
Try and get this looking a bit right and this top and this bottom one here I'm gonna scale those in.
245

246
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:49.540
Remember this is a 3D object so it can get quite confusing trying to keep track of everything as good
246

247
00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.150
as you're working with it.
247

248
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.400
Right.
248

249
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.150
So now we've got that very can add a loop cut in.
249

250
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.460
Now you notice the loop doesn't always go where you think it might.
250

251
00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:02.980
So it's been pulled up here and it's been pulled up there because of the position of this particular
251

252
00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.850
vertex.
252

253
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:10.960
Remember you compress the G twice to move a vertex independent but moving along the edge and actually
253

254
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.270
changing the overall shape that much.
254

255
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.160
And then when we have a look at this from the side I can select the edge loop I've just made and perhaps
255

256
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.710
shrink it in ever so slightly to start giving the horse a bit more of a head.
256

257
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.030
And this one here especially needs to come back.
257

258
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.910
And by the looks of it needs to come up as well.
258

259
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:35.950
And that's the other thing if you're looking at something from an orthographic perspective in this case
259

260
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:43.320
looking right at it we can move all of these vertices independently and have it stick to the plane that
260

261
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.170
it's in so its not going to wander about.
261

262
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.540
So this is now a matter of moving some bits and bobs about for probably the next 10 15 minutes or so
262

263
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.870
I'll speed up the video here because that's pretty much all I'm doing.
263

264
00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:02.050
And if I find something exciting to tell you along the way then I will let you know.
264

265
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.110
Yes I've got a pointy bit coming out here.
265

266
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:23.010
That's no good at all.
266

267
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.070
Now this is an interesting point so I've just come back here.
267

268
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.900
Now we don't have a quad at the top here.
268

269
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.460
I want to keep a quad.
269

270
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.050
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to select one edge.
270

271
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:39.750
In fact this edge here and then just extrude it roughly in the right direction he says and it's gone
271

272
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.640
horribly wrong but there we go.
272

273
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:48.810
We've now got some geometry that we can use to base the rest of this over so we can then highlight these
273

274
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.610
two edges.
274

275
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.920
Press F to fill and these two here should be joined together.
275

276
00:19:55.050 --> 00:20:02.340
What we will do in order to facilitate that is grab this vertex here turn snapping on make sure it's
276

277
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.400
on vertex snapping and then we should be able to put one on top of the other.
277

278
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.590
And then when we move it they're not independent yet.
278

279
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:18.930
So we need to make sure that both are selected F3 remove doubles in fact we can probably do this to
279

280
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.920
the whole model as well so remove doubles.
280

281
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.490
There we go.
281

282
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.240
So there was only that one on the entire model.
282

283
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:31.650
But now we have a top part of our horse as well somewhere where our mane can come from
283

284
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:21.690
So i've just added the lower part of the mouth and I'm now adjusting some of these vertices to make the
284

285
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:28.820
mouth a bit more in I suppose as into the body and we go.
285

286
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:35.370
And that was quite quite straightforward in order to do that needs filling up the position of these
286

287
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:43.180
so they flow round if you've got vertices that dart left right and center can be quite confusing but
287

288
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.130
I'm liking the front of my knight that's looking really good.
288

289
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:52.960
So this is one of these cases where to make this mane there are several options I could just put a loop
289

290
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.530
cut around and move it really tight.
290

291
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.890
But the problem with that is we've got this extra geometry running around the rest of our model that
291

292
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.770
we don't really want there and we'll have to go ahead and move that.
292

293
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.810
We could also remove a tiny bit of geometry here.
293

294
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:16.700
We could dissolve that edge we could delete only the edge itself.
294

295
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:24.640
That will mean that's the actual geometry itself flows round it starts hazy and then flows all the way
295

296
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.090
round the rest of our model.
296

297
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:34.280
So then we can come to the base and do exactly the same let's say remove yeah let's remove this one
297

298
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.800
here.
298

299
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.180
So X edge.
299

300
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.650
There we go.
300

301
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:46.330
So now we can have our loop cut running just over that bit and then we go back straightaway and fix
301

302
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.640
the holes we made.
302

303
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:52.070
And you'll notice that we get some triangles.
303

304
00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.570
Now I wouldn't worry about those triangles at the moment.
304

305
00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.460
That's absolutely fine.
305

306
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:05.660
So we're going to have one two three four fill that's in one two three four and fill that in.
306

307
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.010
And then these three here as well.
307

308
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.880
Okay.
308

309
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:18.050
Now I can go down and I can select all of these faces running down the model can't select the bottom
309

310
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:23.360
and top ones because they aren't quads and then I can extrude them.
310

311
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.380
Now this is gonna be an interesting extrude because it can only really go in a one way.
311

312
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.260
So we're gonna have to tweak it afterwards but that's okay.
312

313
00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.660
I could look at it from the side and kind of extrude it roughly at forty four oh you know what.
313

314
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.390
That's probably going to work.
314

315
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.650
That's brilliant.
315

316
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.900
I didn't anticipate that working at all.
316

317
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.220
And you know what it looks pretty good.
317

318
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.340
It looks a bit rough here.
318

319
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.530
I think we may have an.
319

320
00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.920
Yeah.
320

321
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:59.870
It snaps in very quickly and I think that's this merged limit causing that because look is under point
321

322
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:09.610
one of a centimeter this square here is a centimeter so let's add a decimal place to that.
322

323
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.360
There we go.
323

324
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.710
Now we should be able to move this freely so that was our main issue.
324

325
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:16.350
Excellent.
325

326
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.330
So that comes up quite nicely.
326

327
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.770
I'm gonna grab this top face here and manipulate.
327

328
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:26.530
Ever so slightly going to move it forward and up.
328

329
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:28.250
Looks good.
329

330
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.700
Perfect.
330

331
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.930
Come down here.
331

332
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.890
How is this bottom look
332

333
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.120
But this looks horrible.
333

334
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.940
OK so we might need to do some reconstructive surgery on this bottom bit going on here.
334

335
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.170
So you've got geometry going through itself.
335

336
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.180
So it comes down looks good until here.
336

337
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.170
So we just need to move that out ever so slightly.
337

338
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:56.740
So G ,X that's the way we're moving it place it and then we should be able to move it back in.
338

339
00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.920
Perfect.
339

340
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.040
And probably the same with this one here.
340

341
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.140
Yeah it's gone right through itself.
341

342
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:09.480
So let's select it the G, X sets the Axis we're moving on sets it in place G, X move it back again
342

343
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.000
And I think the same has happened here hasn't it.
343

344
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.400
Yes sir.
344

345
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.720
G, X make sure it's way out of the way.
345

346
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.790
Then G, X puts it back again.
346

347
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.590
So that looks pretty good.
347

348
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.940
Apart from what ever has gone on here.
348

349
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:34.880
In fact what I'm going to do is I'm going to start deleting a bit of geometry it looks like that is
349

350
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.870
horrible.
350

351
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:44.810
I'm going to hide my stauton knight and then go to vertex select and just start deleting some of the
351

352
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.590
geometry here.
352

353
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.120
There we go.
353

354
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.460
That's where that's where the geometry is.
354

355
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.750
Good.
355

356
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:56.330
This is where it is bad and we get it snapped back into place.
356

357
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.230
Excellence and now we can repair this.
357

358
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:05.270
Now this is quite a common thing when you're working on a model all of a sudden it just goes funny.
358

359
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.990
Whether it's a mirror modifier or something else.
359

360
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:16.160
But then often it's just a case of trying to recognize where it went or wonky and just fixing that small
360

361
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.420
part.
361

362
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:23.720
Sometimes it can be a real pain and you end up stuck basically but I'm I'm happy with that.
362

363
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:33.610
I just need to lower this down so it looks not so in itself so that go G, Z bring that down.
363

364
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.430
I have still a bit of geometry inside.
364

365
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.950
There we go.
365

366
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.030
That's that's what was confusing me.
366

367
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:46.030
I might leave it like that but move this one in slightly because it's still supposed to be a main after
367

368
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.830
all.
368

369
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.660
There we go.
369

370
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.420
Excellent.
370

371
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.040
So there's one final place that I want to add a tiny bit of detail to.
371

372
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.370
We have a look.
372

373
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.990
Horses have ears.
373

374
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.440
If  I hide that  away and their ears come straight back on this particular model.
374

375
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:06.690
So we find a place where they have gone straight back so we could use a loop cut running around here.
375

376
00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:20.110
Place it in and grab this face extrude it out and scale it in and them even maybe in that and push it
376

377
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.940
in here.
377

378
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.250
So there you go that looks like a decent enough ear.
378

379
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:32.050
I don't like the way it's added this extra geometry round here although with the more detail in the
379

380
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.610
face.
380

381
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.310
You know I'm gonna I'm gonna leave it.
381

382
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.920
I think I would be nit picking if I was doing anything else.
382

383
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.360
I don't think there's too much detail there that I need to worry about it.
383

384
00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:52.510
I like the current shape is it is a bit straight down here so I'm going to bring his chest in slightly
384

385
00:27:52.920 --> 00:28:00.460
so i'm going to select this bit and this bit here and go G, X bring that in.
385

386
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.550
Yeah that looks a bit better and the same on the back here.
386

387
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.210
It's modeled after myself a little bit rotund.
387

388
00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.340
There we go.
388

389
00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:12.910
G, x move that back a little so probably this bit here as well.
389

390
00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.480
Oh I don't want to delete it.
390

391
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.910
Dangers of resting your hand over a key you're about to use.
391

392
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.750
Ah there we go there we go.
392

393
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:26.190
I'm liking the look of that maybe puff him out just a little bit more here.
393

394
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:31.430
I would say his main was just a little bit too small at this point.
394

395
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.340
Here I'm going to grab the edge.
395

396
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.020
I think this edge here other thing is too small.
396

397
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.210
I just don't think it follows the curvature properly.
397

398
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.240
So let's move that out and I think we're good.
398

399
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.460
Now I am just nit picking at the moment.
399

400
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.030
I think this bit here doesn't need to be a triangle.
400

401
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:57.560
I think where this next bit further up can be or even the bitterness underneath.
401

402
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:04.230
So I'm going to bring this with snapping turned on again I'm gonna pop it on top of that one and then
402

403
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:10.000
on top of that one that just needs ends up the bits we can see and in fact I think we can probably move
403

404
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.500
this up a bit further.
404

405
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:20.810
Yes that looks that looks fine to me it's now just a matter of tweaking these a little so the faces
405

406
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:28.050
aren't all cut into one another and that one there as well as it is inside itself.
406

407
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:32.720
We've got geometry inside itself so let's make sure we remove doubles.
407

408
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.610
Then when I select that it should move all together.
408

409
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.480
I don't think that needs to be there.
409

410
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.290
Let's move that all the way down to the bottom.
410

411
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:53.200
Perfect so one two three four all of us interesting but we can't merge that Vertex but we can dissolve
411

412
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.900
this edge here.
412

413
00:29:55.030 --> 00:30:02.460
So if I go ahead and dissolve its we get a quad on the bottom one two three four.
413

414
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:03.350
Perfect.
414

415
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.720
I'm asked to do the bottom without any quads.
415

416
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.220
Excellent.
416

417
00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.660
Can we do the same to the top.
417

418
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.150
Got myself a challenge here now.
418

419
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.200
I'm not going to FAF around at the top.
419

420
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.410
I think it looks pretty neat.
420

421
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.290
In fact these is slightly I could no now  I'm starting to play now.
421

422
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.290
I'm really happy.
422

423
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.020
How mines turned out here.
423

424
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.930
Oh and because I've gone into rendered mode this is suddenly stood out to me and I've glossed over it
424

425
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:27.500
before.
425

426
00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:34.850
We have some extra sharp sorry mean increases that have been applied here and they might not want to
426

427
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:35.200
be there.
427

428
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.860
They've just inherited from previously.
428

429
00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:44.100
So I'm going to go ahead here and select all and lower the May increase back down to zero.
429

430
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:49.550
So that's not an issue and I can add them in again if they are an issue later on but for the moment
