00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.390
Welcome to adding detail with sculpting in this video will see that detail can be added to our model

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.420
in various ways.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.330
We're going to use in this case the multi resolution modifier to create derived data.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.770
Now what I mean by derived data is it's implied data is generated by a blender and anything that's generated

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:31.470
for us saves a lot of time whether it's a render of an image or extra geometry of our model using that

6
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.410
derived data is better than trying to produce it manually because it would take forever and we're going

7
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.710
to sculpt the rest of the facial detail that we need.

8
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.490
Now there are other options.

9
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.410
You can manually move vertices Bout's and add more verses that is ill advised.

10
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.170
The more detail you have on your model the harder and harder it is to work with.

11
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.930
That's why the tools like the multi rays modifier exist so or even subdivision modifier that's why it

12
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.060
exists so it's based upon your basic model that you've got with the bare minimum amount of vertices

13
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.690
in it.

14
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.180
And then we can smooth things out with various other techniques and the complete answers of course could

15
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.000
potentially paint the details straight away.

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.770
So once we've got our wrinkle maps and everything else all sorted on our model we're probably not going

17
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.460
to do that in this particular video.

18
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.840
We still got the the main features to bulk out but you could potentially if you were a skilled artist

19
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.810
paint in the details that were necessary.

20
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.570
We're not going to do that at this point.

21
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.540
Okay.

22
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.110
So without any further loop Let's hop straight on over in a blender.

23
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.280
Okay so back over in blender there are a couple of things we need to sort out before Ideally we get

24
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.250
to sculpting this area here is absolutely horrible.

25
00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.270
Now I've got a worry here that's the model itself is going to end up looking horrible.

26
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.610
If I don't sort this out before we get to using the malty rez tool am special in sculpting some skin

27
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.060
to pull that out there try not to create too much of a bump around me eye itself and it just basically

28
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.550
looks like some of the I is not forward enough.

29
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.270
I think it's going to be literally as straightforward as that so I'm going to go into wireframe mode

30
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.080
to see if I can grab the virtex I need and pull that forward and up and over.

31
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.980
Okay that is looking better.

32
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:43.720
I'm not quite liking this huge area here inside there so I'm going to move the I A little bit about

33
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.410
again using a bit of artistic licence here.

34
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.230
And just view it from the side to make sure it's.

35
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.150
No that's that's fine.

36
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.800
That's also not too far off.

37
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.080
The only thing we've got here now of course is.

38
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880
Yeah that's fine.

39
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.640
Is this area at the top where we've got this.

40
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.120
I eyelid.

41
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.020
That's not really over the I at the moment so looking at it from this angle and would turn on proportional

42
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.730
editing that's going to be very useful.

43
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.280
I'm literally going to pull the eyelid up into that roughly the right place.

44
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.960
Now of course one of the issues here is the eyelid is a three dimensional object is a lip over the eyes

45
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:38.150
so we don't really want it intersecting the I we just want it to literally be a lip over the eye so

46
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:46.070
we can play about this about with that for a little bit to try and get it in the right place and that

47
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.100
is almost there.

48
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.620
It's going to decrease the size of my proportional on her didn't have proportional editing turned on.

49
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.540
I thought I did that would have probably helped.

50
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.590
Moment ago.

51
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.230
So that's almost there.

52
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.950
Let's bring this up a little and this one down.

53
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.880
And again tweaking and tweaking and tweaking to you get roughly the right shape for you want.

54
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.330
Okay.

55
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.110
So that's looking better I need to redefine the top of the eye.

56
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.810
But I think I can do that in sculpting.

57
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.760
That's looking much much better.

58
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.470
Let's look at it from the front again and again there's actually a ridge that runs round the I.

59
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.760
Right at the very bottom GRC.

60
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.480
There we can see it.

61
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.720
And I don't have that ridge at the moment.

62
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.010
It would be nice to have it.

63
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.680
So I will model that in due course.

64
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.390
But let's get on with this sculpting.

65
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.560
I'm going to get rid of the subsurface division modify big cars the multi resolution modifier is going

66
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.240
to do that for us.

67
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.380
So let's go ahead we can't apply it in object mode.

68
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.660
So subdivide.

69
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.990
I'm going to go to five times and that's going to give me 2 million polygons to work with.

70
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.970
And I can see a problem straightaway we get a ridge.

71
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.760
This mirror ridge down the middle of our model.

72
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.940
Now that's not a big issue at this particular point because all we need to do is apply the mirror modify

73
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.160
boom it's all sorted now.

74
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.580
One of the issues may be that later on you need to come back and do something to one side of the model

75
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.220
and you want it to be mirrored on the other and not sculpting because when we sculpt when we go hop

76
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.040
into sculpt mode.

77
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.480
Elise you've changed your settings so just a reminder there's a symmetry on the tool shelf mirrored

78
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.920
along the x axis so I'm automatically going to have a mirror going on or out without needing to worry

79
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.380
about that.

80
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.990
But if you need to alter the actual underlying geometry you'll have to reapply the mirror modify it

81
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.540
the easiest way to do that is to hop round to the front.

82
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.860
Go to a wire frame mode put a border select on select half your model and delete the vertices.

83
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.660
And there you go you've now got half a model that you come back in and add a mirror modifier to and

84
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.240
you should be roughly back up to where you were before.

85
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.920
Okay.

86
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.980
Now the other thing that we'll want to do before we really start getting to sculpting is trying get

87
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:19.650
this low poly mesh not to look so cluttered around the high itself because that looks a little bit horrible.

88
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.340
And if this is the mesh that we're going to be applying a normal map to once we've generated it.

89
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.600
This whole mess around the eye itself may cause this problem so I'll cut.

90
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.050
I'll come back to that and saw the how it looks okay once we've actually applied stuff or no it doesn't.

91
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.370
We've got a face crossing over there so are there are a couple of things to sort out.

92
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.620
That's right.

93
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.730
So let's go ahead and apply our mirror modifier.

94
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.080
But we were in edit mode.

95
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.010
We're in now in sculpt mode let's be an object mode and apply that mirror modify.

96
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.660
There we go.

97
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.190
Okay.

98
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.360
So we've got a little bit more to sort out of this.

99
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.850
I hear not to worry we can come back and do that but let's have a look at the nose.

100
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:10.600
Okay so remember when you're sculpting I'm going to knock back the preview before I go any further to

101
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.460
three.

102
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.750
So when we're moving around in the viewport it's not quite as busy.

103
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.260
We're down to a quarter of a million rather than 2 million polygons.

104
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.970
OK so now we've got a decent level when we go to sculpting you may find a little bit of a slowdown when

105
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:30.020
switching between them and just a reminder of your sculpting tool so you got your brush types here.

106
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.540
Feel free to play with them.

107
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.990
I do like Clay strips for instance under the eyes.

108
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.720
Then you can hold down Shift to smooth that out.

109
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.560
And there we go we start to start to get a bit of definition to the skin there.

110
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.900
And let's say the bridge of the nose if I wanted to build that up I could go along and do that here

111
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.080
as well.

112
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.130
I added a bit around the eye there.

113
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:53.710
There we go.

114
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.170
So we can start building that up very quickly.

115
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.670
You've got to control the size of the brush shift and efforts to control the strength of the brush.

116
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.580
We've got radius and strength here as well on the top shelf.

117
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.920
Now one of the things that often gets people is when you've zoomed out like this Your brush is very

118
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.910
very big even though you've not changed it.

119
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:20.950
If we zoom in it can be very very small creating very minor detail.

120
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.470
So there are pluses and minuses to zooming out just bear in mind that the radius of your brush is also

121
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.470
affected by the zoom level you're currently at.

122
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.170
K. A final few things down here.

123
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:37.110
Often it's quite nice to have a texture on your model as well.

124
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.520
And this is a texture for the brushes self we want this texture of texture.

125
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.530
Yes is this texture so we can go ahead and create a new texture and there's nothing there at the moment.

126
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.600
But this new texture will now be available.

127
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:57.030
We can see texture 0 0 1 I presume yep is over here in the texture's tab.

128
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:04.130
Here Okay so there's nothing there at the moment but what we can do here is instead of the type of being

129
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.400
an image if you've got an image great you can use that.

130
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:14.630
But for instance here I can go to all which is the one I had like let's just do marble just for the

131
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.500
sake of it.

132
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:22.580
Now we've got that so you can see that the brush itself is going to have a marbled affect to it.

133
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.760
Sunday is going to smooth that sound along there and let's try something like inflate.

134
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.150
So now when I when I'm actually painting on the model of we got the harp not applied the textureless

135
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.330
apply a texture and there we go we start getting some wrinkles in the skin rather than just a smooth

136
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:41.880
lump.

137
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:49.380
So if you've got I mean this is far too small for here so let's try bumping this up to five by five.

138
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.680
And that should bring out the detail a little bit more.

139
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.870
Oh there we go.

140
00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:02.190
So if you wanted to create veins on the surface or something along those lines you can use textures

141
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.540
to help you do that.

142
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.020
I mean this would be someone with a serious illness.

143
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:14.730
But now we can hold down Shift and start smoothing out that detail so it's not quite what doesn't come

144
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.320
through quite as much then.

145
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:22.020
And of course if you've got I mean that's blurring it's but you can see adding some texture to the skin

146
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.570
can add much more detail.

147
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:32.700
In fact if you are doing a zombie you know having veins or something like that coming out of well that's

148
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.690
that's just brilliant.

149
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.400
Now I mean that could be a burn on someone's face or something on those lines.

150
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.630
Of course if you're into zombies it could be a zombie thing.

151
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.210
Okay.

152
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.200
So now we've explored the different brush types and the starting of the sculpting.

153
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.980
It's time for a challenge.

154
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:54.640
Okay I'd like you to go ahead and add your detail so make sure your low poly mesh is neat.

155
00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:00.930
I've got that problem with my I was moving things about without really thinking and end up pushing some

156
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:06.600
geometry through itself of China sculpt with geometry pushed through itself.

157
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:14.460
You end up with some horrible pinching that even smoothing something out is not going to help with Apply

158
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:20.770
your mirror modifiers he don't get a horrible crease down the middle and set up your malty redd's modifier.

159
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.480
Be cautious of how high triangle count you end up with.

160
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.030
I've gone up to five subdivisions and that's given me two million.

161
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.130
Of course it will depend on the number of polygons you have to start with.

162
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.960
That's fine for sculpting and then lower down at the actual preview setting much lower so you can see

163
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.260
what's going on and in the viewport when you're in object mode much more smoothly.

164
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:52.470
Remember to save your work or even save as the process you're about to do is destructive.

165
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:57.770
You are changing the geometry so it can be very difficult especially with sculpting.

166
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.580
The uh don't rely on the undo buffer when you're sculpting when you're sculpting you're going to do

167
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:09.440
lots of little brush strokes and will very easily go over the amount of underuse to get back from to

168
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.590
wherever you want to go.

169
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.360
Fair enough if you make one or two mistakes but if you decide no I don't like but I want to go back.

170
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:22.380
Well you know kind of stuffed because you've changed the underlying geometry start sculpting your macro

171
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.460
detail.

172
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.240
Okay so were talking about the areas around the nose the lips.

173
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:35.790
Bring out the cheek bones the jaw line etc. start moving those bits about and start really defining

174
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.590
the overall shape of your model.

175
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.220
It's very basic at the moment.

176
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:43.080
We're going to hone in on that detail and then go ahead.

177
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.930
After you've done the macro detail to add in some fine details do you want to add in a couple of wrinkles.

178
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.660
Do you want to add in a fold in the skin.

179
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.950
Perhaps there's lots of different options but we can already see.

180
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.520
Remember the texture brush.

181
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.760
You don't have to do something quite as extreme as the zombie or the burn victim.

182
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:10.710
I've just done a home but you can use less air noise texture to start putting in little dimples in the

183
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.080
skin as well.

184
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.140
Okay.

185
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.260
Share your word in the discussions after you've done this.

186
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.250
They're going to be epic.

187
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.760
They're going to look really good.

188
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.010
So are you proud of your work.

189
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.030
Make sure you share it okay.

190
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.700
Pause a video now and give that a go.

191
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.710
Okay guys welcome back.

192
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.310
Let's go hop back on over into a blender and start applying some detail.

193
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.010
Okay so let's go ahead and start adding some detail.

194
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.890
Now I've got a couple of things to do here.

195
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.440
Number one I need to make sure that the base mesh is good to go.

196
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.160
So let's go ahead and sort that out now.

197
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.040
So I'm going to apply the mirror modifier.

198
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.420
Can't do it in edit mode so we're going to apply that mirror modifier.

199
00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.570
Now one of the things I have to bear in mind I'll just turned off the cage and viewing it in edit mode

200
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:07.500
is that my mesh needs to be relatively clean and needs to be the final low poly version that I want

201
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.840
to go for now.

202
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:15.330
In this case this is quite low poly but the eye itself is a bit of a mess so I'm going to have to go

203
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.550
and sort that out and the inner sticks out quite a bit.

204
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:25.410
Now before I go ahead Russian delete things and do lots of other things that would potentially destroy

205
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.360
what's there.

206
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:34.290
The first thing to do is look at any geometry that's necessary that's important and then start working

207
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.090
from that point forwards.

208
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:44.010
So this in itself I suspect is going to be quicker to delete the what's there and remake it with everything

209
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.000
in the right position including the eye.

210
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:51.840
Because if we look at the eyeball itself note the eyeball is in the right place so I'll be careful when

211
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.920
I move that that's Or I don't move that.

212
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.010
But the rest of the eye is not quite right.

213
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.080
So let's go in here.

214
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:07.860
Okay so the first thing I'm actually going to do is apply a level a sub surface the Vission.

215
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:15.420
So I've got some more geometry to work with and that is going to be about as low a poly as it's going

216
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:15.660
to go.

217
00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.430
This is where the detail is going to be.

218
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:24.480
Now I need a lower level like this because when we get to the details where the eyes are all around

219
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:30.240
the is they're just going to have it's simply going to be too pointy to work with.

220
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:36.570
But I think this I itself I'm going to have to go in and actually do some major surgery so I'm going

221
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.730
to go ahead and do that now and I'll be back in a few moments.

222
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.490
Okay so after doing a little bit of modelling I've read done this.

223
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.990
I hear now we can see what it looked like before on this side here.

224
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.340
So I've actually gone in and removed some unnecessary face loops and I probably do the same around the

225
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.470
rest of this model especially on the fore head.

226
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:05.840
It's going to be too much detail needed on the fore head so I can select a particular face loop and

227
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.770
dissolve the edges and just basically thin it out a little where it's just not necessary.

228
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:17.560
Now the remaining thing here of course is because I've done it after applying that mirror modifier.

229
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.240
I will in fact need to whiz round to the front.

230
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.750
I'm going to go to wire framo to do this with border select and actually select all of those vertices

231
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.170
and delete them.

232
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.860
And because I'm happy with the general layout for the moment I can go ahead go to the mirror modifier

233
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.620
and just click apply whilst in object mode.

234
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.400
And um back ready to start sculpting.

235
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.280
So let's bring a model back round.

236
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.390
I've applied a multi rose here I'd do that again.

237
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.320
So multi resolution modifier.

238
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.020
And I'm going to subdivide it and I'm going to pay attention here.

239
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.930
I'm going to subdivide it four times should take me to just under two million triangles gives me a nice

240
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.280
area to work with.

241
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.890
I look quite sad there at the moment with the expression on the face.

242
00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:11.870
A whiz round into the profile modes and we can use that to work on the shape of our model and I will

243
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:17.560
see you guys back in a few moments after I finish sculpting I'm going to start work on the nose.

244
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.720
So the nose itself is coming along really nicely and I wanted to take this opportunity to just show

245
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.870
you the clay brush itself these clay strips.

246
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:32.140
They're one of my favourites so I'm just going to muck around here do it in more detail later on.

247
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.890
I've applied some under the eye there and then I can literally hold down Shift and smooth that out and

248
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.430
then add a few more and smooth those out.

249
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.550
It's very easy to build up let's say in this case bags under the eyes or things like that.

250
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:52.830
It just helps make detail where you need to build something out or have a crease in the eye line.

251
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.930
And let's say at the top here we want to bring that out.

252
00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:02.150
We could do very easily and of course I'm not going to keep most of those changes I'll go back and sort

253
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.520
them out.

254
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:10.250
But the clay brush itself is very very powerful and the smoothing afterwards just hold now shift will

255
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:16.490
automatically goes over that's moving that enables you to get out rough things or where it's pinched

256
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.360
in too much say on the on the.

257
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.750
I hear I can see this.

258
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.830
This Crisco running down here just kind of smooth that out a little.

259
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.690
Perfect.

260
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.370
Okay so I'm back and this is what I've got so far.

261
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.410
So we've spent a couple of minutes sculpting out here.

262
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:39.410
I've literally skipped backwards and forwards between sculpting level so if I wanted macro detail I

263
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:46.250
could put tahn and then bring it back down in to fine a detail level for I've never gone over Level

264
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:53.300
4 and I've also remember to apply the base which then goes ahead and changes the underlying mesh to

265
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.320
do well to match or sculpting a bit more closely.

266
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:01.880
Now what I have found that did was it ruined my nose it pushed the geometry through itself but that's

267
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.610
not a big problem because it just meant I need redo it any way because it wasn't suitable for the mesh.

268
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.300
So this is our underlying mesh at the moment.

269
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.310
Oh my word.

270
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.740
There's something crazy going on here.

271
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.330
Did I just do that yes I did.

272
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.850
Phew.

273
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.920
I thought I'd sculpted something crazy I just accidentally clicked and moved to town.

274
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.650
Good job of swotted that Skinner saved my work.

275
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:29.090
The final thing I think I'm going to do here is the chest areas not looking too great compare it.

276
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.280
Well it's not had anything done to it yet.

277
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.940
So using some clay strips thinking about where the muscles lie I can add a few bits of detail in here

278
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:44.700
and literally smooth them out as well and that will help with the underlying shape.

279
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.320
Excellent.

280
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.090
How is yours coming along.

281
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.010
Hope it's looking good.

282
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.520
I'm really proud of mine.

283
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.060
I hope you are of yours to remember to practice lots.

284
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:59.020
Share your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
