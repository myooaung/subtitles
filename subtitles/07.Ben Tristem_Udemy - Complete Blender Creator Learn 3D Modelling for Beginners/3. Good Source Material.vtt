00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome to.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.880
Good source material.

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.910
Now what do we mean by source material.

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.370
Well like reference material in the past but this time it's actually going to be used with in our final

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.670
render.

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.690
So this could be a picture a photo a video or even another render that you've done now in a bit we'll

7
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.750
grab a photo and check out its settings.

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.670
Now this is important for both still some photos and I'm going to hammer this point home because it

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.640
really does save you a lot of time with your own video.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.830
Keep notes of the settings as they're often lost.

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.350
So what device you took it on.

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.960
In fact let's get to the essential data that you're going to need.

13
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.740
Now this is a little bit of a white lie.

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.670
You can get by without this information.

15
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.840
However it will take a lot of your time and to ing and fro ing and trying to get the scene just right.

16
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
If you've got the data it can speed up things a lot.

17
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.040
So the resolution of the recorded data the camera sensor size and the lens focal length.

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.520
Now some of these you're going to have to look up for certain devices and some of them are built into

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.050
blender so we can use a combination of research or just a preset that's straightaway available to us.

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.310
Now pictures fortunately often have this data stored with them and you can right click on them and on

21
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.050
a Windows machine you can go to propertys or on a Mac you can go to get info.

22
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.990
And if the picture has this information stored with it then you will actually be able to look at that

23
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.330
and recall it down.

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.510
And then we can set up our camera in the scene with the same settings.

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.790
Now if it's a render that you've already done you have to use the camera settings that were in that

26
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.740
other blend file.

27
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.280
Now things that are nice to have is a way before we move onto that.

28
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.580
I do apologize.

29
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920
Pictures do have this data still with them but videos do not.

30
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.040
So it is a great idea that you know down what device the video of the video was recorded with.

31
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.090
If that's possible now Nice to have.

32
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.530
Well measurements of the area you're working in that's very useful for working at distances and placing

33
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.930
things at a certain scale within your scene position of any lighting.

34
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.110
Now if it's an outdoor scene in the daytime there's usually one prominent light that is the sun in the

35
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.220
sky that will be the source of most of your lighting.

36
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.670
However if it's in endorsing you may have several lights scattered about contributing to your scene.

37
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.940
If you'd taken note of where those are and perhaps the intensity of them or just say they're all the

38
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.590
same.

39
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.100
Then at least you got a good standing to start using that photo or video.

40
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.400
Now in this particular instance we're going to use a photo so the lighting is probably just going to

41
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.200
be the sun.

42
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.080
Keep things simple remember that.

43
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.810
Now a couple of things to look out for.

44
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.540
Light direction and looking for shadows.

45
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
Now the can't go hand in hand in shadows can be both a blessing and a curse.

46
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.600
So you will want to make sure shadows don't cross over where your object will be.

47
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.430
If they do you're going to have to create a nother object to cast.

48
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.950
That's the real shadow on top of your objects.

49
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.950
And of course delete the other one and this entails more and more work.

50
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.660
And we want to avoid getting too nitty gritty at this point.

51
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.510
Certainly there will be instances if you ever go into this fully where you will have to edit the actual

52
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.060
picture or video and cut things out and mask things off.

53
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.230
But we're not going to go quite that deep dive in this section.

54
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.890
Reflections are very similar to shadows.

55
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.030
They can give away the true nature of a scene.

56
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.950
So we do have to be careful with their reflections.

57
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.640
Instances like that could be a glass building or a mirror.

58
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.610
A good reflective surface cars tend to be reflective they're going to reflect the area around them things

59
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.400
that you might not focus on like a puddle on the ground those can reflect and give away the fact that

60
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.420
hang on a minute there should be a reflection of the objects in there as well.

61
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.420
Again if we can avoid those type of things we can get on really well and quickly.

62
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.430
That's the important thing.

63
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.980
Now you also have to watch out for anything in the foreground those foreground objects can cause you

64
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.960
a bit of a nightmare there in front of your object and therefore you've got to work around them.

65
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.870
So at the moment I would avoid foreground objects where possible.

66
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.470
So finally if you were creating your own source material you can have a bit more control over how it's

67
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.130
looking.

68
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.800
So with photos take measurements of the scene that's very important as well as the camera settings that

69
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.540
you currently have.

70
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.700
So remember what focal length you've switched your camera so if it's a fixed length camera you may have

71
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.450
to research if you've taken a video or photo with your iPhone or Android device then you'll want to

72
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:53.850
look up the specs of the camera with videos you can lay down markers especially if your CGI is going

73
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.640
to cover the area in question and that can help massively high contrast is.

74
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.400
Because that helps with camera tracking and we'll see that later on.

75
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.460
Now you will want to avoid sharp and jerky movements.

76
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.210
It makes tracking the camera really really difficult and time consuming.

77
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.400
Now remember this the last I'm going to say this is so many times to store your camera and lens settings.

78
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.320
Make sure you know what they are.

79
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.700
It's going to help you a lot.

80
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.050
Okay so now we've got the ground work sorted for what source material is ideal to be working with.

81
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.080
It's time for a challenge and I'd like you guys to go find a photo now find yourself a suitable photo

82
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.250
to work with.

83
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.570
Think about your projects what you're working on and what you are trying to achieve.

84
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.200
Remember please keep things simple especially if this is your first time doing any visual effects.

85
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.840
Now I'll personally be finding a runway because I'm doing a CGI plane and I'm going to place that on

86
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.250
the runway.

87
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.580
Now make sure your image has camera details.

88
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.520
Now if you've gone off and taken a photo great you're going to have all the details because you've actually

89
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.990
taken the photo.

90
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But if you haven't and your sourcing a photo from online make sure that it does have those camera details

91
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.470
embedded in it.

92
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.080
Go ahead.

93
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.080
Pause video and go find a suitable photo.

94
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.090
Okay guys.

95
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.020
Welcome back.

96
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.080
Let's go see what I found and make sure it's suitable.

97
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.510
Okay so after searching the web for a bit I have found a picture I really like.

98
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.980
We can see where the light sources is the sun and it's just dipping below there.

99
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.890
The mountain top they're just glaring out.

100
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.900
That's going to give us some new lovely warm colours as well.

101
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.980
Going to produce long shadows when it's so low on the horizon.

102
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.330
And now I don't have to actually be this but I will since I'm on the site.

103
00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.140
But before I go any further of course let's just make sure that this particular photo is suitable because

104
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.070
I don't know any of the settings it might just be an image.

105
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.180
Okay so clicking download has just opened up for me.

106
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.410
A nice high res image that's very useful.

107
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.000
Look at lots of detail.

108
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.620
Okay so I'm going to right click and save the image in my downloads for the moment and open it up.

109
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.730
Now you will.

110
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.800
You can right click on the download itself and get to Properties out or indeed right click and go to

111
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.490
get info.

112
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.060
I believe I can get info from preview on a Mac as well so we can see straightaway.

113
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.410
I'm going to go to the file tab first of all we've got there.

114
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.410
Of course we've got a number of pixels it is that's also easy to look up so that's a great start.

115
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.350
I'm going to look under the E X I left later.

116
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.380
Now this should give us.

117
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.790
Here we go focal length.

118
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.280
So we've got the VAT's we need to know what camera it was taken on.

119
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.560
I'm guessing it's taken on a camera yet.

120
00:07:52.610 --> 00:08:00.680
We got the lens model here now that can be very useful if you chanty exactly mimic a real life lens.

121
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.540
Because we are going get the data for that lens.

122
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.150
If it's got any particular distortion but do we have the camera type.

123
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.520
So let's go along here.

124
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.260
Here we go.

125
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.920
A e e o s eleven hundred d.

126
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.080
I don't know the sensor size for that sungura Search for Canon.

127
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.940
E o s eleven hundred d.

128
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.790
Umm let's give a literally go sensor size.

129
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.250
Now I'm I'm a bit of a photographer.

130
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:35.370
I'm going to assume it's there a S P A This one here of that size so it's a width here.

131
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.890
Is going to be 22 point two.

132
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:44.660
So I've written down all of these bits of information making sure that I can go back to them if I need

133
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.050
to.

134
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.160
It's quite an affordable camera.

135
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.880
Excellent.

136
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.350
I really like this photo I am looking forward to working with it.

137
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.490
How did you guys get on.

138
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.260
Are you going to use the photo that I've got here or are you going to follow along with a plane.

139
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.060
You could you could put a car on there if you wanted to as well.

140
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.170
Cars and runways kind of go together.

141
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.750
If you picked a different scene I'd love to see what projects you were going to work on.

142
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.700
Remember to share that in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
