Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,330
In this lecture we're going to go through a quick tip.
2

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,520
We've already discussed this tool once and it's the to sphere tool.
3

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,980
It also works when it comes to flat faces as well as the entire objects.
4

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,740
In fact it will circularise.
5

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,810
Our mesh.
6

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:28,010
So in this case let's pick somewhere that's not uneven one of the advantages of where I've picked to
7

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,420
place these particular faces these new faces here.
8

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:40,160
Well they are perfect as it is if I try and go F3 and to sphere and I change the value of to
9

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,580
sphere to one to make it circular as possible.
10

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,310
It just works so I can't demonstrate it on my geometry I've currently got here unless I pick somewhere
11

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,040
that's going to deliberately give me something uneven.
12

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,310
So we have a look at this area here it's a hexagon that borders our Pentagon just here.
13

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:06,670
So if we were to use these set of triangles when we had bevelled Oh I didn't mean to do that.
14

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,820
Great example there.
15

16
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,640
So let's put this back here and there we go.
16

17
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:16,940
So we've bevelled this you can see that it's uneven it's slightly lopsided I'm just going to reset my zoom
17

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,790
there so I can actually zoom in without clipping too easily if you're finding when you're zoomed in
18

19
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,100
and it's clipping like this.
19

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,980
This is the viewport clipping here will happen from time to time and you can change over in the view
20

21
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,080
we can see that our clip starts and our clip and we can change the options just here.
21

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,920
So if I was to lower my clip starts we can see that then I can get in closer before it starts clipping
22

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,850
the camera also has a similar option as well.
23

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,050
We'll delve into that later but there we go.
24

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,060
I can Now zoom in a bit closer and show you this lopsided hexagon here.
25

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,300
Now if I go f3 and to sphere what we find is if I just type in the value of 1 which means circularize
26

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,280
it we can see actually changes and it makes it is circular as it possibly can.
27

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,840
We try and do it again.
28

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,790
It might push it a little further.
29

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,700
So occasionally you can do this to sphere a couple of times.
30

31
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,900
And there we go.
31

32
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,310
We have got as far as we can possibly go and that's going to make sure that this new face is as circular
32

33
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,450
as it can possibly be.
33

34
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,000
And in this particular case I don't need to worry about it but it is good to know that that option exists
34

35
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,770
for those of you who have decided to place your holes where it is slightly uneven.
35

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,330
But we should now find that this is pretty much a perfect hexagon and that's as close to a circle as
36

37
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,940
we're going to get with that.
37

38
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,490
OK.
38

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,120
So there you go.
39

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,300
There's your quick tip that not only to sphere works on an entire object itself but it also works down
40

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,550
at the face level.
41

42
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,660
So if you've got something like this that you need to circularize you can do it with two sphere and I'll
42

43
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,630
see you all in the next lecture.
