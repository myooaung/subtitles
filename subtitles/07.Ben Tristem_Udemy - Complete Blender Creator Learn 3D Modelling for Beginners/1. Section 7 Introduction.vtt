00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.260
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.310
Welcome to the game.

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.250
Asset packed.

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.370
Now in this section we are going to be mainly focussed on interior modelling and also focussing on a

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.760
level of detail and baking.

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.850
So what is all that's about then.

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.210
Well let's take one of the time level of detail.

8
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.100
So the idea with level of detail is that your models need to be created not just as a single high detail

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.070
model for purposes of a saving your bacon which we'll talk about in a minute and be making sure that

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.200
in the game engine the models are provided at various different levels of detail.

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.600
Yes.

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.090
So the thing can perform properly at a long distance you don't want to can't have 1000 million polygons

13
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.090
on it it wants to be a very simple little block.

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.690
Yes.

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.110
Yeah.

16
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.300
So as the model moves further away you can afford to have less detail.

17
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.310
And then the computer can spend less time rendering it.

18
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.100
So that's the idea of level of detail.

19
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.400
Yeah baking We'll said all about like baking is where you've you've worked your way up to a high polygon

20
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.470
model and you've got all of this detail in the geometry.

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.510
Well some of that detail doesn't actually need to be geometry we can bake it solidify it as an image

22
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.480
has a texture and then apply it to a plain surface and make that plain surface look like it's got incredible

23
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.430
detail on it.

24
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.110
It's a wonderful tool and again is optimized not only for game performance but in blend itself it improves

25
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.180
the render times.

26
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.240
Wonderful.

27
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.320
So these are really useful tools even if you stay inside them.

28
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.050
If you go outside a blender is going to be even more valuable because when you're in a real time environment

29
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.320
both of these things are super vital.

30
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.940
So how's the section laid out Mike.

31
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.180
What are they going to do in terms of building these models are they going to start with a high detail

32
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.390
model and then go down although it is quite easy for you guys to hop in and we'll go into this much

33
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.760
deeper to really focus on these high detail model and that can take hours and hours of work.

34
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.470
What's more important like we've done in all the other sections is to have a place holder in place so

35
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.680
the right size dimensions and overall shape and then build upon that detail and we'll be really focussing

36
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.020
on that making sure it's very much a lean process and not wasting time.

37
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.140
So I said earlier that is going to save your bacon if we think about level of detail the reason is this

38
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.400
you're being contracted by a client to make something say it's a chair or so for whatever let's say

39
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.880
a sofa and they ask you to make a sofa.

40
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.030
If you make a high high poly model of that sofa and show it to them and they don't like it you've just

41
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.460
wasted days weeks who knows.

42
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.270
So you do get a simple place holder for a sofa takes minutes.

43
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.790
Yes.

44
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.360
To get the next level of detail up a little bit more could take tens of minutes maybe now and take the

45
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.960
next level of detail could take days and then maybe weeks to really finish it off right.

46
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.230
So what we want you to do is be sure that the thing is going to be used.

47
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.510
So we want you to provide your client whoever that might be with a model that is low in simple detail.

48
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.240
Get their feedback.

49
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.620
Yes.

50
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.700
Then spend more time.

51
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.850
And then if there is ways to minimize that waste we don't want wasted time.

52
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.200
We've already got enough time waiting for things to render.

53
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.140
I don't want to waste time modelling as well.

54
00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.440
So this part of the Course is currently early access and what that means is it is subject to change

55
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.010
and we very highly value your guy's feedback.

56
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.200
So just in the discussions anything you want to say you'll have a bit of a chance to steer the direction

57
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.360
of this section you might be wondering by the way why there's a Gothics Gothic chirked section below

58
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.630
this part of the course that section is going to disappear from the course a few in a few weeks time.

59
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.940
It's just there because it is older content that's being replaced with this section.

60
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.990
Mike is going to be adding videos how many a week Mike are you going to be adding to this section at

61
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.200
least 10 a week.

62
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.300
So I'm likely going to add 10 videos a week to this section just stay in this section keep consuming

63
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.500
it keep watching it and it's going to be great.

64
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.270
OK guys let's dive in the blender.

65
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.650
He always says that when I say hop on over each.

66
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.170
That's true.
