00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,780
Welcome to the grease pencil.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,490
Now a grease pencil has many many uses.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,910
We're going to go through only a few of them here.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,930
But of course feel free to play with them as you go.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,940
So it's great for making notes on your model is good for sketching and planning ideas.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,610
If you got an idea and you want to as I say quickly sketch it out you can do so with the grease pencil

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,250
roughing out shapes and I'll be doing that using the grease pencil to do that too rough out where the

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,240
eyes are going to go etc..

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,290
So converting two edges is well we can convert the lines we actually draw to a curve and then curve

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,320
to an edge because the grease pencil itself when you draw a line we see in a moment.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,000
It's actually made up of a series of points and those points can be changed and edited.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,980
Much like vertices and edges are connected together.

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,340
It can be used to also create 2D animations.

14
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,110
Just like most things in blender you can animates the grease pencil so I'm sure some of you have already

15
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,210
seen that some people have used the grease pencil to actually make some animated sketches.

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,290
Which is wonderful.

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,290
We won't be going into too many details with that but suffice to say you can do that.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,320
So let's go explore the grease pencil now and hop on over in a blender.

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,850
Okay so we're back over in blender here and one of the first things that I want to do is just show you

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,980
where some of the options are for the grease pencil itself.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,710
So at the moment we've got our head selected here and I've not named it yet so I'm going to go ahead

22
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,320
and name it head because just cool Cube isn't very descriptive.

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,260
Now on the tall shelf itself there is a grease pencil tab.

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,580
You may have to scroll down if your operator panel is quite high.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,280
So those are the grease pen so we can see a couple of options on the tool shelf there.

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,960
We can also see the grease pencil options on the propertys panel so it's not open you can open that

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,310
would be in key.

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,800
I will if I can see it.

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,120
I've got my background image there is scrolled up a little ivory gate grease pencils even turn the grease

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,480
pencil on and off there so like showing it and hiding it again.

31
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,650
And we can see here that we've got layers as well.

32
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,430
So there's a couple of ways that we can add a grease pencil to our scene itself or to an object.

33
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,000
Now in general I would advise adding it to the scene.

34
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,310
However if it is to do with a specific object in your drawings are basically can get in the way.

35
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,060
Is it when you hide that object you can have a link to the object so that wherever you've selected it

36
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,590
we switch this now to objects.

37
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,160
We will see that the grease pens will be linked to the head so that when we start drawing in a few moments

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,880
we can see that it's attached to the head.

39
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,510
And if we hide the head it will also disappear.

40
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,640
So let's have a look and.

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,630
Well there's a couple of ways of starting new we can go and click on draw a line or arrays or poly at

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,710
the top here.

43
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,540
We can have a look at clicking new here as well.

44
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,510
Or you can hold down the key in the d key will start The drawing process.

45
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,060
Now one thing that I've always found useful if I'm looking for a shortcut key and I can't find it in

46
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,040
the menus and places like that.

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:30,240
But I know what the function is called I will go to the user preferences go to the input tab and search

48
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,430
for what we're looking for.

49
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:39,000
If I go and type in Greece it doesn't come up with anything that is not that useful.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,580
It would help if I spelled Greece correctly.

51
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,700
Okay so we can see here we've got Greece pencil jaw now.

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,730
They're not defined with their names here but we can see that we've got the and the left mouse is going

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,200
to do something controlled day and the left mouse will do something controlled in the right mouse or

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,830
do something and control at the right mouse will also do something.

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:08,540
And when we open that up we can see that the and right mouse is going to switch on the eraser.

56
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,830
Every time I open up these other ones here is going to be full of stuff and I don't recommend you ever

57
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,820
go in and play with these but just for information.

58
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,670
Dean left mouse is going to draw freehand draw a straight line.

59
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,830
If you hold down control at the same time draw a poly line as well so there's lots of options and is

60
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,300
going to close that not save anything and that links to these four buttons at the top here so there

61
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,500
is a shortcut for that.

62
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,700
So let's give it a go.

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,850
Let's hold down the key and just oh there we go.

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,330
I've drawn a spiral.

65
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,920
Now the moment I've done that I am on the right hand side on the property panel a new layer has appeared.

66
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,740
Now we can press the plus key here and add another layer.

67
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,240
And of course once we've added another layer I can hold down the the key again and draw a smiley face

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,310
or whatever you happen to be during.

69
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,990
It's entirely up to you and the great thing about using layers it does mean that if you delete if you

70
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,710
want it gone you can just press the minus button and delete it.

71
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,730
You can name it what you need to name it as well.

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,960
There are some further options down here so with the this one squiggled the spiral that we've done.

73
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,930
If we change the stroke call the fill we can actually change the colour of the line itself so you can

74
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,250
make it green if necessary or red.

75
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,640
It would depend on the model because if you're a black might not always be a great colour to use if

76
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,930
the model you're working on is black for instance so we can change the colour there as we go we can

77
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,310
change the thickness of the line and it is pressure sensitive.

78
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,430
By the way so if I go ahead and hold down deep.

79
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,170
Now I'm using my iPad to draw here.

80
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,190
I've actually got a a stylus.

81
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,800
If I press lightly as you can see it's quite thin.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,780
And then as I press heavier it gets thicker of fickleness.

83
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,420
If I can tell that off to a thin line it's by no means an artistic package.

84
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,680
Never using the mouse I just grab the mouse and hold down deep and start drawing.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,810
It's going to be the thickness.

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,020
It that you've got set over here because with a mouse there's no pressure sensitivity.

87
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:16,920
So the final thing here is x ray and I'm going to go for you can turn on the points of course or ever

88
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,710
do volume but points.

89
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,180
Just turn the size down you can see the points that I was talking about.

90
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,250
It's me that's actually making up this line.

91
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,270
I'm just going to turn that back off again.

92
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,940
So we've got these three scribbles that I've made here I'm just going to turn the thickness slightly

93
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,410
back up again so we've got the thick and thin stuff so x ray can be very useful.

94
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,270
Here we see.

95
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,810
I've managed to draw inside our model so if I turn off x ray you won't.

96
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,270
Here we go.

97
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,020
You can see the bit that comes out the back.

98
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,050
So if you're drawing on certain things that you need to see through you can turn x ray on just like

99
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,920
we could with the bones and armatures.

100
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,810
Now you will notice that all of these are lying on a plane and I moved the 3D cursor So it's where the

101
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,720
3D cursor is will be the actual point that the plane passes through.

102
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,870
And then your view where you're looking will be the rest.

103
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,260
Now there are a couple of other things that you may want to do.

104
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,290
So if I scoot around to the front of my face here at the moment you can see if we look on the left hand

105
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,690
side under the grease pencil we can see that it's currently set to cursor.

106
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,810
So the one you're going to be during the stroke at where ever the 3D cursor is.

107
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,920
We can do the view now the views quite use.

108
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:39,650
If we KRIT go ahead here and create a new layer and I put a smiley face up the top here and must remember

109
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,640
hold down day as I go.

110
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,690
Incidentally you can just click on draw and draw away.

111
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:52,020
The problem with just drawing and without continuous ticked on the left hand side is every time you

112
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,820
start.

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,710
Basically stop clicking or holding down the left mouse button.

114
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:05,190
The drawing will just stop so you can actually turn on continuous click draw draw a circle draw and

115
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,800
then draw the rest of your smiley face.

116
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
It's whatever you do.

117
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,110
I personally prefer to just hold down the d key whenever I need to annotate But now we've done these

118
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,260
smiley faces here.

119
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,150
You can see because it's the view it's completely independent of where we're looking at our model.

120
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,720
That's great for making notes or whatever you need to do.

121
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,120
It does mean that when you move your model around that does not disappear.

122
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:36,350
And as I was saying earlier if I now hide the head everything goes because we're linked to the object.

123
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,390
I'm going to read or bring back the head angle switch the scene view.

124
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,140
And you'll notice Oh well where's all my stuff gone.

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,210
Where has it gone.

126
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,940
We need to have the head selected in order to bring it back.

127
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,240
So don't panic if you literally if you select something else it will disappear.

128
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,690
So that's another reason why perhaps having it on the scene view would be a good idea.

129
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,910
Of course once it's on the scene view it doesn't matter what you've got selected.

130
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:12,490
If I go ahead here with it in view and go out of a hole down the right key as well Aaron go.

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,480
So if I go and draw my smiley face that I had earlier it doesn't it now doesn't matter what I've got

132
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,720
selected that smiley face will be there because it's on view.

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,150
I can rotate round.

134
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,180
So the final one I think is very useful is surface.

135
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,850
So if we now move around the front of our model I am going to draw on the model itself.

136
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,070
I'm going to delete the layers that we've currently got on the scene so that one's gone and I never

137
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,980
delete these two layers as well.

138
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,380
Now with its sets on surface it literally draws on the surface of our model.

139
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:56,380
So I go ahead hit deep to start drawing and say I want an eye there and I'm planning on having the nose

140
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,940
being around there and the lips being about here.

141
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:06,820
Obviously I use reference material as well but it's a good way of guiding your well basically guiding

142
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,180
your drawing in your model.

143
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,960
He's looking quite evil you might want to put where the hairline is now because I've drawn light that's

144
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,810
when we scoot round to the side you can see is actually following the model itself.

145
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,160
And that's incredibly powerful.

146
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,330
Lots of fun.

147
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,410
Okay guys.

148
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,920
Now we've learned a little about the grease pencil.

149
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,880
It's time for a challenge.

150
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,050
I would like you to go ahead and sketch some details.

151
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,340
So using your reference image add some grease pencil marks defining where the major features of the

152
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:46,800
face will be and even go round to the side and just mark where the hair perhaps will be or V is as well.

153
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,240
There are some features that we often forget when we're just looking at the front of a face.

154
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,370
Now it doesn't have to be neat or detailed.

155
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,750
Think about them as construction or guide lines and that's the use that I'm asking you to do at this

156
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,230
point.

157
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,620
Of course you can go as detail as you want with the grease pencil at any point.

158
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,270
Suppose a video and give that a go.

159
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,600
Okay guys.

160
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,520
Welcome back.

161
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,310
Let's go get some details on our model and hop on over into blender.

162
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,770
Okay so I'm pretty sure that that will not be where the hairline is and those won't be where the eyes

163
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:30,110
are as you scan to make sure I do sketch my details on the correct side so you can see there.

164
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,890
This left hand side is the one that's mirrored.

165
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,220
I'm just going to get rid of all the rest.

166
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,030
And for the sake of transparency under there make sure that mine's on the scene.

167
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:48,160
I can't see my background image at the moment so let's just make sure that they are there are how I

168
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,060
did a bit of organising and I bet that's broken.

169
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:57,370
So Mikey front profile needs to be selected.

170
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,120
Oh I'm in the wrong folder as well.

171
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,340
That's a great start.

172
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,550
So there we go reference images making front.

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,240
That's looking good.

174
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm back.

175
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,090
The other one down here Mikey right.

176
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,520
Let's see if that's there.

177
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,890
No it's not so.

178
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,330
Let's go here.

179
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,230
In here assets.

180
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,470
Oh no I want to go to this folder just in case I reorganize.

181
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,800
They won't be broken then there again.

182
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,700
So I'll actually start on the side.

183
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,660
So looking at the grease pencil options here I would like to make sure I'm drawing on the surface I'm

184
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,950
happy with that.

185
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,400
Now let's find the grease pencil options.

186
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
And then add a new layer.

187
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,530
So then.

188
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,580
And what colour.

189
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,420
I'm going to leave it black for the moment but I can see here Virts.

190
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,500
We've got some detail around here.

191
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,190
Again this is me drawing with the mouse.

192
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,340
So you can get a rough detail with the mouse.

193
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,190
Of course as I was saying it doesn't have to be detailed So in this point we could actually undo that

194
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:15,560
for instance and go ahead and put in perhaps some detail going there.

195
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:16,990
Here.

196
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,660
Really really quick stuff to try and define where things are.

197
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,970
Just to get a rough idea of what's going on that looks okay to me in terms of is where they are now

198
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,100
something weird has happened there.

199
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:42,210
It looks like it's gripped on to literally this lamp surface has been going around there.

200
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,770
So I'm going to hide that out of the way.

201
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,240
Turn it off and a turn the camera off as well to prevent anything like that happening again.

202
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,280
And then it was back around to the side and just get rid of those of course undone now hiding not great.

203
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,300
So let's pop it there and there.

204
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,070
Which looks good.

205
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,820
And then you've got this bit and then that bits as well.

206
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,660
Okay perfect.

207
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,240
So that's my ear differ almost defines going to put this in a bits in as well.

208
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,350
So there's my ear define and that's actually on the model itself it doesn't have to be any more details

209
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,130
than that at the moment where in fact it probably doesn't need to be any more detail than that could

210
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,820
because it's going to be 3D modelling brings the rest around.

211
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,470
Okay.

212
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,090
So around the frontier.

213
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,340
Let's zoom in and we'll get some details.

214
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,540
So we've got the nose which is going to be around here.

215
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm going to hold down deep and just literally jaw around there.

216
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,650
We're going to have the eyes now the eyes obviously if you're working with your own picture they will

217
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:52,130
vary in size shape and eyes do vary depending on your race as well.

218
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,660
I've got a double eyelid if you're from the Far East.

219
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,340
People don't have double eyelids out there so there's lots of different variations in shape.

220
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:07,870
So and I'd love to see what you guys are doing in terms of making your model come together mean that

221
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,890
so cavour and again these are rough drawings.

222
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,630
They're not anything else.

223
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,450
Now I need to do the mouth area and actually looking at this and with the model behind I can start to

224
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:27,070
see the the face loops all coming together because I can see one that's literally runs all the way around

225
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,350
here if you look at how the muscles lay underneath the mouth.

226
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:39,730
That's a really bad circle or it's certainly not mirrored in any way but I can see here that that grouping

227
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,040
they can see as one object.

228
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:49,470
One group of muscles you've got the lips starting there and the bottom here is going to about there.

229
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,740
And again because it's mirrored I shouldn't really be concerned about the other side so I'm just going

230
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,150
to try out the Erase torso and click on that and get rid of anything.

231
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,720
Now as you can see as I'm going around in erasing it's being quite notchy as it goes.

232
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,350
And of course that's not a particular problem and that is simply deleting the points that have been

233
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,290
drawn.

234
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,840
So there we go if Gotz those bits there the top and bottom side of the mouth the grouping of running

235
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,520
around go up to the top end just sieverts the hair line itself.

236
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:33,790
If I decide to put a hair in will be somewhere starting around there and working its way down and round

237
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,520
and then I can move to the side view.

238
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,800
Well actually that's that's almost perfect.

239
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,870
And here I can draw down here.

240
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,500
To the back of their head.

241
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,400
And of course if I wanted to I could skip round to the back but there is no reference material for about

242
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,810
now.

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,140
This is one of these examples where an x-ray is not useful.

244
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,360
I do not want to see the detail round the front of the model when I'm working on the back so I can turn

245
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,690
off x ray so I can actually work on where this hair will go.

246
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,540
I haven't a clue.

247
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,190
Probably be about balser on those eyes.

248
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:19,000
And at the moment that isn't terribly important because we've and focussed on this part of the model

249
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:19,990
brilliant.

250
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,570
How did you guys get on.

251
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,020
Love to see your sketches and the detail that you've laid out.

252
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,930
The great thing about this now is I've got some detail to work with without having to be smack bang

253
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,670
on the front or side views.

254
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,260
And that is somewhat better than having a plane in your scene.

255
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,400
We could of course import an image as a plane and then view it from there.

256
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,960
That's great when you're using it as a literary to refer to this we are using it's a model too.

257
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,320
So it is is quite important that the details we have them in the right place.

258
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:00,490
Otherwise as we say if you don't make it look if I make it look perfect first time is going to be very

259
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,210
difficult.

260
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,810
But if you don't get it roughly in the right proportions it will look very very odd as great.

261
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,620
How did you guys get on as always.

262
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,180
Please share in the discussions and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
