00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,640
In this video we're sculpting the nose and I'm going to start straightaway with a challenge for you

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,980
to sculpt the nose so using the knowledge that you've got already and the practice that we've been doing.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,860
Have a go at sculpting the nose on your head all on your own without any input from me.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,760
If it gets dark then you can come back and watch as I go through the process of creating the nose for

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,340
my head.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,980
But I love you just to do this on your own and give it your best shot.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,580
Use your reference material and have a go at sculpting the nose of your head so pause the video now

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,800
and come back when you've given it your best shot.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,450
OK.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,950
Welcome back.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,220
If you're really happy with what you've achieved with the nose then you can just watch this very quickly.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,550
Chin up to two times perhaps and see how I go about doing it.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,320
If you got stuck then I'll give you some ideas on how I've gone about doing it for my nose and I'll

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
speed the video up a bunch.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,330
Here we've been through a lot of sculpting now so I know that we can speed things up a little bit more

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,790
and use the crystal as a starting point shift see to get to my crease to just put a little bit of creasing

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,400
to bring the side of the face up into closer into the nose.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,930
Yes narrow narrow.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,200
Good.

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,670
And then there's a couple of really good lines for us to follow and here one is this line that comes

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,370
out of the nostril and the other will go to a side view and some very good side view of God here is

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,580
this line that curves around the nose.

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,550
So there two of the ones that we're going to be paying particular attention to as we go through this

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,240
process.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,950
And I'm going to take a lot of time I think to finesse the placement of the nostrils I find them a little

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,940
bit tricky to get right.

27
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,930
So I'm just going a little bit and grabbing a little bit pulling around and I'll spit out the video

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,100
here.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,220
My goal is just to grab out the shape of the nostrils and the pointy bit of the front of the nose I'm

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,020
mostly bouncing between the grab tool and the crease to crease to make the lines the grab just to nudge

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,590
things around haven't worn out where I want it to line up.

32
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,680
This little of a gap between the nostril and my face here that you see coming up that I was trying to

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,290
fill in with the fill tool just to fill the gap between those two areas the side of the nostril and

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,370
the side of the face.

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,880
The next step is to drill some nostrils.

36
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,170
Let's get in there and do some drilling only use draw.

37
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,770
Make it nice and small and then control to just poke my way up into the nostrils there a little bit

38
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,130
more power on this.

39
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,700
Get up in there and I'll speed up the video a bit as I play with my nostril is just digging out control.

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,330
Plus the draw tool.

41
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,540
And then if I dig it out too much just using the draw tool on the inside just to give it a bit more

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,010
fatness as you doing in this if you just kind of use your finger I know this sounds a little bit weird

43
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,490
and gross.

44
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:34,390
Use a finger to see just how close that lip is from your top lip to your nose.

45
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:41,110
It tends to kind of we don't have so much of a little reach there it's very small that ridge is used

46
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,360
shift to smooth things down here.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,040
We increase told to get a bit of line underneath there a little bit of no separation

48
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,610
as I did before just trying to get the outside of the nostrils right using the draw tool to line the

49
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,850
inside give it a bit more thickness undoing pulling it around just playing until I get it the shape

50
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,540
that I'm happy with.

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,810
So the size and position is fine for now.

52
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,770
Come back to the nozzle is going to be it later on going to crack out the crease to do with a little

53
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,580
bit more of the creasing I'll speed up the rest of the video.

54
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,780
The feedback I get from folks is that they want to see generally what I'm doing but not necessarily

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,680
sit through hours and hours and me babbling about what's going on so we'll speed it up.

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,470
You can see I'm just doing a lot of which tools should I use playing around with the grab trying to

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,010
grab a lot of these nostrils get the shape in their thinking it up because you're your outer nostril

58
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,260
area isn't thin and tiny there's a substance to it.

59
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,110
Just pull the bridge of the nose out to get the shape constantly looking at the front view the side

60
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,470
view rotating around going to make sure that we're rotating around all the time.

61
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,380
Make sure it looks the way we want it to look.

62
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,550
Get some more of this crease in here crease and then smooth crease and then smooth.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,990
If any of your creasing or smoothing is too powerful then adjusting the power of it to make it stronger

64
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,100
or softer just at the end of my nose is a little bit of that give it thing going on so put a little

65
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,690
bit of detail at the front there.

66
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,640
Back over to the wrinkles on the side.

67
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,690
Sometimes when you've got the structure of a thing right.

68
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,810
So you're happy with the nose but you don't have all the lines around it it doesn't quite feel the way

69
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,490
it should.

70
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,470
So it's good to get in those details as you're going when we're working in the broad strokes you use

71
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,140
two broad strokes but now we're into the medium to fine detail.

72
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,300
We've got our Diane topper resolution I've pumped it up to about 60 you could have it lower if your

73
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,490
computer is struggling a little bit with the the higher resolution.

74
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,800
That's totally fine.

75
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,830
This is not something we're going to be putting into a game like this so if we have tons of extra resolution

76
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,940
tons of extra quads and triangles that's not a problem.

77
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,850
It doesn't matter for now.

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,370
This is an exercise in sculpting and practicing sculpting so you can see you just trying to line up

79
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,970
where we are with the nose.

80
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,800
Does it look right.

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,400
I'm really bugging me that side of the nose that you can see the the angle of it doesn't quite feel

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,330
right you can sometimes just see it and feel it but it doesn't quite feel right.

83
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,190
So constantly looking the angles the positions getting a good upshot of the nose there.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,080
Again I think it needs to be a little bit fatter.

85
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,770
This is the sort of finessing that you don't need to necessarily do that.

86
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:13,620
I like to do because it is fun that definitely looks like a nose it's pretty close to that honkin big

87
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,470
nose I've got over there so I'm going to declare that finished and not spend a million hours on it.

88
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,070
So hopefully you went well with your nose.

89
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,810
As always I'd love to see if you'd like to share your progress please do share in the community forum

90
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,140
so we can see how you're going.

91
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,680
I've got a nose that you're particularly proud of.

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,490
Or if you're struggling with the technical detail then please to ask as a question and I'll see you

93
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,150
in the next lecture.
