00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.710
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.590
We are taking a different path.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.410
This is Michael from the future.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.570
And after reading some of the comments and discussions we've had on the course itself some people are

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.210
finding if we do something different with the ears you get a better third distribution over the top

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.710
of them.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.620
So I just want to run through what some of you have discovered as you've been going through this.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.680
And one of the primary reasons for that difference is simply because when I'm doing my modelling you

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.100
don't you're doing yours.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.150
We can end up with slightly different meshes so we will naturally end up with different results.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.290
So we have our bunny.

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.480
As it stands here now what we can go ahead and do is have a look at these is insitu some are going to

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.150
go into edit mode now because we made the is even though they're separately and then we join them to

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.030
this mesh.

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.520
They can still be selected quite easily by using the L key.

16
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.920
It selects all the linked geometry someone to select both my ears now and delete them.

17
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.510
I'm just going to get rid of them completely.

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
And we're going to try making them using a different methodology so I'm going to go ahead and delete

19
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.160
those verses Okay so special thanks here to Alberto.

20
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.270
He's come up and discuss this in quite detail and worked out his own issues when it came to these is

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.910
he was ending up with some very patchy is.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.230
So if I go ahead and add in a euv Sphere just here but I want to make sure I'm in object mode and not

23
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.780
edit mode.

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.920
I'm going to go ahead and add in uv's Sphere.

25
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.720
And we're going to have to do some stuff with that.

26
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.710
But would do that in a moment.

27
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.780
The first thing I'm going to do is go to the object itself and make sure it's named something appropriately.

28
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.000
In this case I'm going to call it is because we're going to leave them as a separate mesh object as

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.400
well.

30
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.800
Now this isn't going to be the model that I will continue through the rest of the lectures we have to

31
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.400
highlight there's always another way of doing something and it's not quite working out for you.

32
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.660
This may be the solution.

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.580
So we have this object is obviously far too large.

34
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.850
Now I'm going to have to remember to apply my scale in a bit.

35
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.730
But if I scale this down an end of place in the head roughly the right place scale in the x direction

36
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.130
they're just to squish it.

37
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.050
That's a reasonable start and I'm going to rotate it around the x axis as well so that the pole at the

38
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.020
very top is facing backwards a little and I'm going to take this moment and this opportunity to also

39
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.210
add a mirror modifier to it.

40
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.970
So I don't have to worry about the other ear as well we're going to be reflecting about the x axis which

41
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.910
is absolutely fine that's what we want to do but of course because it will be going around its own origin

42
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.300
we need to a mirror object.

43
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.150
In this case I'm going to use the rabbit.

44
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.290
There we go we've got that in the right place and now we're going to use proportional editing as well

45
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.780
just to help us out here.

46
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.570
So I'm going to go ahead into edit mode and select this very top vertex on the very top because it is

47
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.090
the very top vertex if I said that once more time.

48
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.500
Right.

49
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.190
I got that and I can go ahead and grab it.

50
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.680
And of course oh I have proportional it's internal but it's to the extreme at the moment.

51
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.530
But I don't want it and you see here with it turned on and just toned down a little I can stretch these

52
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.230
is up perhaps a little bit more than before.

53
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.110
Now it looks a bit odd something to undo that and I'm just going to try again and remember you don't

54
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.950
have to do this in one operation.

55
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.610
In this case I'm going to drag it up on the z axis.

56
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.170
First of all just get them roughly the right height.

57
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.560
In fact at this point it would be very prudent of me to jump into the side view and have a look at how

58
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.250
they're really looking.

59
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.890
Okay they're looking a bit on the small side there.

60
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.320
So I'm going to enlarge that again and lift it up.

61
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.330
Now the bottom bits here I do want them bulging out probably around this loop here so I'm going to scale

62
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.980
that loop out and again with proportional editing turned on.

63
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.700
There we go they're starting to look a bit better there.

64
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.550
So now we can grab this top vertex again and I'm going to pull over this time bringing out.

65
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.480
But once again with proportional editing turned on I can pull it out.

66
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.040
So it's just a bit more dynamic there.

67
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.180
And of course now we can think about where and how are we going to push that in.

68
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.250
Well we've got a series of edge loops that we can go ahead and grab here.

69
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.690
I'm going to actually grab a load of face loops.

70
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.310
I'm going to grow.

71
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.130
Or even.

72
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah that's you circle select in this case and just try and keep it going all the way up to May be there

73
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.770
or so.

74
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.310
And again there's always going to be more than one way of doing this.

75
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.560
I think that's a reasonable selection.

76
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.050
Yeah that looks good.

77
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.420
And then I can move those inwards.

78
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.640
And again with proportional editing turned on I can make sure that it only affects a small proportion

79
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.350
of them.

80
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.960
We've of course got to make sure we don't force geometry through itself.

81
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.340
Let's come out of there.

82
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.300
Switch the whole select everything here and then switch all this stuff to smooth shaving just to have

83
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.910
a different look at it.

84
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.430
So there we go.

85
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.190
There's some other is building up there.

86
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.360
And of course you can do about editing this to your heart's desire.

87
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.120
And for instance here I probably want that just a little bit wider side of scale on the y axis at any

88
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.950
point of course we can hop into cycles just to see what it looks like there.

89
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.570
And I'm not too happy with this edge around here but that may just because it's quite low poly at the

90
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.870
moment.

91
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.110
Again we can add in a subdivision surface modify and see if that smooths things out look so much better.

92
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.920
So that's what I think was going on there.

93
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.270
And you know you can build up this year to your heart's content.

94
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.180
Now the other thing that Alberto did mention is that when he was trying to join everything together

95
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.000
it still ended up being quite patchy so when it comes to applying the air the material the particle

96
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.490
system in a few moments where we set up the hairs when we start getting to that point you may decide

97
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.350
you want to leave the is a separate object and that's absolutely fine.

98
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.140
In this case that's not going to cause us any issues.

99
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.180
In fact in many cases it might make your life a bit easier when it comes to placing the years on here

100
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.600
now.

101
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:57.230
Finally I'm just going to lift all a says lift that's up make sure that only V is selected.

102
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.540
Lift those up and going to lift it up completely above and just finish this off by grabbing the bottom

103
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.000
virtex or thereabouts.

104
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.680
There we go grab the bottom one there and then I'm just going to pull it into the model.

105
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.400
But I'm going to make sure I grab enough of it is as well to pull them in.

106
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.560
There we go.

107
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.690
I like four way that's coming together.

108
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.230
Excellent so I just wanted to share the other option with you guys as Alberto did find it helped him

109
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.110
massively when it comes to the model itself.

110
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.890
Of course let's just have a quick look over our model here.

111
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.130
Just check a few things.

112
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.560
So the scale we could do with applying the scale there so let's go ahead and do that.

113
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.970
And we've got the eyeballs.

114
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.700
Let's have a look at the eyes.

115
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.470
They could also do with this scale being applied to them and the.

116
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.760
Of course we've scaled that initially when we grab the u v sphere and started manipulating them.

117
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.260
So I'll go ahead and apply the scale there as well.

118
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.700
Always remember to do that nice and early because if you go ahead and do it later on it can cause you

119
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.460
some issues.

120
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.670
And here just looking at it we can make these just a little bit wider.

121
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.670
There we go that looks a bit better.

122
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.480
Perfect.

123
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.410
Of course you can move them in position them out and do.

124
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.250
Oh that was forward position them out ever so slightly.

125
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.030
There we go.

126
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.980
Excellent.

127
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.080
Looking forward to seeing how you guys are getting a wanted to share this with you and I'll see you

128
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.180
all in the next lecture.
