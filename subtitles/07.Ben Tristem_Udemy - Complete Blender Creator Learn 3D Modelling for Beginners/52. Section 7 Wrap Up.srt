00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,280
Congratulations you have now completed this section.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,910
The game ascent pack.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,170
Now there's still lots lots more that you can do to reapply the knowledge you've just learned.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,880
And I suggest that is one of the things you do almost immediately is jump straight in and do a another

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,400
asset.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,060
Now I must impress.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,920
Make sure that you make your challenges as small and succinct as possible.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,750
To make things that are simple to make.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,980
I know we all want to jam now and make a spaceship or make an aircraft or make a fast car.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,390
I mean all of these things are noble goals.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,000
However they are monumental.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,870
A car is made up of what.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,120
Oh hundreds of pieces.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,140
So you don't want to start with something that's made up of hundreds of pieces.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,170
Start with things that are made up of one maybe even two or three pieces at most and see if you can

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,650
get those imported into your assets and that is one of the best things to do with any modelling as you

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,120
develop your skills is to make sure you can actually achieve your goals in the first place.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,090
So congratulations on getting this far.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,850
So of course after this we're moving on shortly to modelling a human head.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,640
So if you feel that you've absolutely mastered everything in this section and if you say yes immediately

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,340
you're an absolute pro.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,950
If you're saying yes otherwise then perhaps you've got to go back and try some of things.

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,650
And of course don't forget you could go back to some of the earliest sections of the course and reapply

24
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,470
your knowledge.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,560
A lot of the time we find that students that have done that have learnt even more because they're no

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,330
longer thinking about the lessons they were taught in taught in that particular lecture.

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,300
They're actually now focussed on other more advanced things and work out different ways of doing things

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,950
with simple models.

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,390
We were doing early on in the course.

30
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,980
Now of course once you're ready hop straight back into blender get onto the next section and carry straight

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,190
on and I will see you in that next section.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,110
Take care.
