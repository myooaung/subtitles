00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.590
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.770
By the end of this lecture we will have created a bevel modifier and adjust the settings so it looks

3
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.120
even better than it did before.

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.080
We're going to sharpen up these edges the ribbons of the lampshade itself.

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.960
It's really going to make it look much better.

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.480
And we'll also have a look at some of the pitfalls that will happen when you do use the bevel modifier.

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.920
Let's go find out more okay.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.360
So we're over in a default scene for the moment.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.950
We're going to start with our cube.

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670
And we're also going to do the same thing.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.090
But this time two AUV sphere.

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.560
The reason why we're picking the U V sphere is because it's a curved surface and it's made up of single

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.300
faces and we'll see what happens when we apply the bevel modifier to that surface as well.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.170
I'm going to shade it smooth and I'm also going to shade smooth our cube because in a moment we will

15
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.350
see that adding the bedroom modifier solves some issues when it comes to shading like this.

16
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.060
Why are we using a bevel modifier.

17
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.690
Well we already know that we can go into edit mode and bevel and edge which is pretty useful.

18
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.560
However that's adding extra geometry and much like the solidify modifier that we're using before adding

19
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.780
levels to your model without actually changing its underlying geometry is a really neat thing to do.

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.320
So let's go and add in a bevel modifier so against add modifier we generating additional geometry.

21
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.070
It's going to be a battle and there we go.

22
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.840
Now if I turn onto wireframe mode you will see what's actually happened.

23
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.560
We've added in a single Bevel and as you can see its width is 10 centimeters and one segment if I was

24
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.030
to go ahead and add two segments you can see it smoothes off.

25
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.220
And three four five etc just increases it.

26
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.910
Now if we have a look back at it in shaded we see that we've got a much softer edged cube than we had

27
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.440
before.

28
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.240
And of course we can narrow the width of that.

29
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.330
So we went to nought point nought one.

30
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.250
You'll be a much tighter cube.

31
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.500
Plus again it looks more realistic because very few things in real life have a completely sharp edge

32
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.100
adding the bevel modifier can just add a little bit of X to a model.

33
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.400
However they can fall apart when you go to curved surfaces.

34
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.310
Why would you want to have a bevel modifier to this.

35
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.610
Well let's say it was our lampshade and had a hole in it.

36
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.890
So let's go ahead and do that.

37
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.180
I'm going to select my vertex on the top.

38
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.010
Press Control and plus to go out a little and delete those vertices.

39
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.400
Okay.

40
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.260
So we've got hold of our model here.

41
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.000
But we can't really add Bevel to anything that doesn't have geometry to it.

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.210
So let's go ahead and first add a solidified modifier.

43
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.690
We're going to make that point one thick.

44
00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.750
And you can see here it looks a bit mushy as it goes around the edge looks very smooth but doesn't quite

45
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.820
have the right look as far as I'm concerned.

46
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.480
So what we can do is we can add a bevel modifier which will tighten up those edges as you'll see it

47
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.830
all types of them up everywhere.

48
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.810
So let's increase the number of segments so it gets really tight around the corner.

49
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.950
And this width Well we can lower it down but we can also raise it up but it will only go so far and

50
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.910
we adjust the width.

51
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.660
You will see that we don't have much room for movement.

52
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.550
And if we increase the segments it just gets tighter and tighter.

53
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.120
Now you will notice at this point that we start to hit an issue.

54
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.590
I'm going to set that down to point one again.

55
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.640
We've got the rest of our our sphere and its face is being shown live we go into wireframe mode we'll

56
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.140
see exactly what's happening.

57
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.640
For each one of those original edges that made up our sphere Well we've now got a bevel on them.

58
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.630
Is there any way we can limit that.

59
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.260
Well yes if we have a look down at the limits method we've got a couple of options and the best one

60
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.500
to go for here is the angle.

61
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.650
If we go ahead and select that's all look that's much better straight away.

62
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.380
We can actually see that we've lost a lot of extra geometry.

63
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.780
That's perfect.

64
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.120
Let's have a look around this top edge as well whilst we're in wireframe mode and we'll see why the

65
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.790
number of segments coupled with the width why we can't make it any larger.

66
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.350
Well it's going to eat into what's already there.

67
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.310
I'm not quite sure how wide this is below point not five yet.

68
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.170
There we go.

69
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.380
So if I hold down shift I can slowly bring that up and make those edges really really tight and you

70
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.820
won't be able to do that without holding down the shift key.

71
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.500
There we go.

72
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.990
Point nought not nine.

73
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.670
That is quite small.

74
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.220
I won't go into solid shading.

75
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.870
You can actually see that as well.

76
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:56.070
Now because we've got the bevel modifier applied we can then if we want it to go in and add a subdivision

77
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.010
surface modifier it's a really smooth out the end results as you can see here.

78
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.950
Creates a really nice sharp edge and that's the main reason for creating the bevel modify really does

79
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.860
help us out with objects like this one here.

80
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.250
And of course our lamp.

81
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.990
So now it's time for your challenge okay.

82
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.220
So your challenge.

83
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.600
Use the bevel modifier to tighten up the rims of your lampshade.

84
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.140
And on top of that you sit on the rest of the model as well.

85
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.010
If you think it suits it.

86
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.590
If not then don't go ahead with it.

87
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.730
So go ahead pause a video now and use your Bevel modifier

88
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.550
Okay everybody Welcome back let's go and hop on over its blender and use our before modifier.

89
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.770
Okay so this should be quite straightforward to do with my lampshade selected I'm going to add the bevel

90
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.760
modifier doesn't seem to have been done to much yet and we've got this faceted look over the surface

91
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.220
of our model so we're gonna have to have a closer look at that in a moment.

92
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.110
First of all let's have a look at the number of segments.

93
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.630
I don't want it to be a little bit sharper.

94
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.530
Around the corner at the top adding those extra segments is going to do that.

95
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.100
However if we take a look at the wireframe it's gotten a lot more complex.

96
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.840
In fact we've got three segments per original edge which is ended up with a ton of geometry that we

97
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.270
just don't need Yeah far too many if we have a look at our triangle count.

98
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.420
So I'm going to limit the method by angle.

99
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.960
So basically unless it goes over a certain angle it will not Bevel and the angle is currently 30 degrees

100
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.250
my lower that down to five we start to get some extra geometry keep creeping in.

101
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.050
If I go all the way out to 45 or even further because really only really want the battles at the end

102
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.180
here and at the end at the top here.

103
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.620
So I said that's something like 70.

104
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.710
That's pretty much going to make sure that it only happens around this edge.

105
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.560
That will give us a nice clean crisp edge around our model which is nice and without being hundreds

106
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.120
of thousands of triangles.

107
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.390
OK.

108
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.530
That looks really good.

109
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.290
Now the width isn't going to make too much of a difference for our particular model in this case if

110
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.200
you look at it it isn't very thick.

111
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.350
So having it point one is absolutely fine.

112
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:27.160
But the number of segments that is critical as we go round this edge also I think that is done and dusted.

113
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.280
OK.

114
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.130
So that's looking pretty good.

115
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.880
The next thing I want to do is just have a quick look at the other parts of our model so I'm going to

116
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.910
turn on the overlays again I'm going to hide my armature I'm going to select.

117
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.460
Well we're not in object mode so it's an object mode.

118
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.820
I'm going to select the first part of our model and add in the bevel modifier.

119
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.910
I can see straightaway.

120
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.440
That's too much I'm going to keep it like that for the moment just up the segments go turn on smooth

121
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.460
shading one more.

122
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.670
Yeah.

123
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.400
Yeah I'm going to leave it three and let's play with the whip.

124
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.620
I think it's going to have to be a lot lot lower

125
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.400
bout their thing that looks pretty good to me.

126
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.850
I'm now going to just add in a subdivision surface afterwards to see if that has a different effect

127
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.720
on the surface of our model.

128
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.450
Mm hmm.

129
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:31.390
Yes it is having a smoothing effect on the model because this large area here is not reflecting or do

130
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.270
want solidify subdivision surfaces is not reflecting quite how I'd expect it to.

131
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.820
So that looks pretty good.

132
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.460
Oh that's interesting.

133
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.550
I'd completely forgotten that when we extruded this out and pulled it up.

134
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.780
That's what it looked like underneath.

135
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.440
That's pretty cool.

136
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.310
I'm going to leave that notch there.

137
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.310
That might come in useful if I decide to add something like that spring we talked about earlier but

138
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:02.000
now what I can do now I've got that roughly how I want it is I can select these other parts then select

139
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.630
the upper arm last control and El and then we can link modifiers that's gonna save me having to do all

140
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.040
of this work.

141
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:19.360
However as we've just seen it's destroyed the mirror modifier for this one but that shouldn't be too

142
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.920
difficult to add back in.

143
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.740
Let's add in the mirror modifier we're going to select the x axis that's fine.

144
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:34.470
Mirror objects and if I type a mirror here I've named it appropriately so it appears straight away.

145
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.130
Now I'm going to put the mirror modifier at the top of the stack.

146
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.620
Generally that's a good place for it.

147
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.130
Then everything else can come off that.

148
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.510
Now this is the only area here.

149
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.210
I think I have to watch out for.

150
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.440
Look it looks horrible along the bottom here.

151
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.080
So if we come down and then limited by angle that bottom bit's a lot smoother and everything else looks

152
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.380
okay.

153
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.170
There's something funny going on with these joints here.

154
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.760
I think I might have to have a look at the subdivision here instead.

155
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.860
Let's try simple.

156
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.280
Yep.

157
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.060
There we go.

158
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.720
Now we've got a nice transition between them.

159
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.100
Okay.

160
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:17.330
So I'm going to go ahead select the top one here and inherits from it's against the stems select the

161
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:23.250
upper arm control El link modifiers so that let's come in said.

162
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:28.220
That's a simple that looks much much better under the bevel modifier.

163
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.400
I'm going to go and set this to angle.

164
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.520
A lot lot smoother and I probably because of the number of changes going across need to increase the

165
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.290
limit angle.

166
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.990
There we go.

167
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:45.560
Pops out around 50 degrees looks brilliant Okay.

168
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.040
Brilliant.

169
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.330
There we go.

170
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.890
How are you guys getting on.

171
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.420
I've added the bevel modifier to the arms and the stem and I'm thinking it looks pretty good.

172
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:59.780
Is and it just a little bit of softness to those really harsh edges.

173
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.080
Please share your work over in the discussions.

174
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:07.040
I'm really looking forward to seeing how your lamps are coming on and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
