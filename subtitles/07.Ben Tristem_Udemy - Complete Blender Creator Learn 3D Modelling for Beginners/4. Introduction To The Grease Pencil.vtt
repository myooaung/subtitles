00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.610
Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.550
So first of all let's whiz round to the side view and delete our cube.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.360
We will not need the cube in this particular lecture as we're going to be drawing.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.910
So we need to add a new object.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.140
We can use the ad menu at the top or shift in age as always and then go down to grease pencil.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.890
Now there are a couple of options but we're going to pick blank because we cannot create our own drawing.

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.410
Well we've done that.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.120
Almost nothing changes but you can see in the outline and now we've got a new type of object called

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.620
a grease pencil.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.110
Okay let's try this out some more.

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.930
What happens if we go into edit mode and we start editing it gives us some options and tools over here

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.860
on the left.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.230
And it must be noted at this point in time that on the right if we press the end key to bring our properties

14
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.420
panel there is a tool's tab now and obviously at the moment we've still got the select box.

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.940
That's the tool we're using.

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.770
And if we go down here and select something different it will change what the tool type is that become

17
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.970
important in a moment when we go from edit mode to drawing mode.

18
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.460
And now if you look on the right it gets quite interesting we've got a brush type.

19
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.120
What does that mean.

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.050
Well now we can click and we can scribble on blender which is really really cool and we can switch over

21
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.550
to different types of drawing which I think is pretty awesome.

22
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.530
Now depending on the style you're going for and what sort of technology you have.

23
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.680
I've also got a whack on tablets so I can draw things a lot more easily than perhaps someone with a

24
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.150
mouse.

25
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.800
But there are tools you can employ with the grease pencil that will help you massively.

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.030
Now one of the things I will quickly do to get rid of everything that I've drawn here is go back to

27
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.540
edit and then just press a to select and you can see the way that these lines are made up.

28
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.850
They exist in 3D space and because we were looking at this in an awful graphic perspective it's it's

29
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.780
flat it's on one plane but it exists in 3D space which means we can rotate things around and match them

30
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.380
up later on or move them as well.

31
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:18.190
And just like when we were selecting linked vertices before the vertices that make up these drawings

32
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.270
we can also press the L key on let's just clear the selection first select one press L and we can move

33
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.160
this bit of the drawing individually so we can modify things afterwards so if we don't get it right

34
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.650
first time it's fine you can move things around or if you're drawing something and then need to move

35
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.740
it into position that can be really useful.

36
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.400
Okay let's go and select all again and just press delete.

37
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.900
There we go.

38
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.770
I'm going to look background from the side and go back to draw mode.

39
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.840
So when it comes to drawing we've obviously got different pen types that we can pick.

40
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.020
How about actually making sure we can draw something that's sensible.

41
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.870
Well there are a couple of options you can do if you hold down the old key as you're drawing it would

42
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.110
lock the grease pencil to vertical and horizontal lines that can be very very useful but it can also

43
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.010
be very restrictive.

44
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.770
How do we draw a straight line from one place to another.

45
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.340
Well you've probably already guessed there are tools down the side for this.

46
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.980
So I can click the line tool.

47
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.250
I can go from this corner here to that corner there.

48
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.820
Now it doesn't automatically set it at that point.

49
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.750
You have to apply it and we can do that live of the Bedell mouse button to confirm that line or the

50
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.840
enter key.

51
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.840
And this gives you the option to just rearrange it and position it's a bit more accurately.

52
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.950
One of the things that does cause us a few issues in this case is unfortunate we cannot zoom in and

53
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.250
out using the scroll wheel whilst we're in this view.

54
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.380
You'd have to actually be zoomed into the correct level from the very beginning.

55
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.880
So if I go ahead and press enter to confirm that we can see that it's not quite a line but for a sketch

56
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.650
that's absolutely fine.

57
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.090
If we go back to the drawing tool we can just change how this behaves when we're drawing with it.

58
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.260
So if we hold down the shift key whilst withdrawing this can be incredibly useful for those using a

59
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.070
mouse.

60
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.320
It will add a delay to the drawing.

61
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.650
Now it may look like you can't make sharp corners but you can you go back to the line and come back

62
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.020
again.

63
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.650
And what this enables you to do is make much smoother lines.

64
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.770
If I tried to do the same shape with just the mouse you can see here it's just not happening.

65
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.700
It's so much better using that tool even if I pick up my stylus and try and go along there you can see

66
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.510
it's it's better but I could still benefit from having this.

67
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.590
I can then trace around much much quicker.

68
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.270
And that is one of the key things.

69
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.250
Anything that improves your speed and workflow it's got to be a winner so one final thing that will

70
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.810
help you in the upcoming challenge and using the grease pencil in general.

71
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:07.260
Let's go to edit mode and delete everything again go back to draw mode and let's draw a straight line

72
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.730
are along the bottom here that's absolutely fine and I'm just using the mouse at the moment I've got

73
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.870
a stylus in front of me but during most of this I'll try using a mouse.

74
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.320
Let's let's just sketch up a very quick scene.

75
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.670
So I've already said I think my lamp is going to be jumping onto a box or something like that.

76
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.120
So we've got that part of it done.

77
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.010
If if we come out and we need to confirm that shape first back into object mode we can add another grease

78
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.290
pencil now if we go into draw mode on that and just draw something really quickly let's say this is

79
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.590
are our entity that we're going to use and confirm that we've now got a group to grease pencil so you've

80
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:55.030
got a scene itself and a character and of course what that enables us to do is now in object mood mode.

81
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.860
We can move these individually.

82
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.020
Now remember all of these objects have an origin point as well so at the moment this would rotate by

83
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.540
default around its origin points and not in the middle of it.

84
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.690
And that's something to just bear in mind when you're creating objects away from where you originally

85
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.740
create the grease pencil object.

86
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.780
You may want to create everything in the center or later on like this area.

87
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.530
Here we may decide that we want it to pivots around different place and just like before.

88
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.640
Let's say we wanted it here we could select the 3d cursor place in the middle here and of course it

89
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.750
will be smack bang in the middle any way.

90
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.580
And then we can right click set the origin to the 3d cursor or even geometry if it was separated out.

91
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.670
So this one here for instance.

92
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.340
So if we go ahead select the selection tool again and select here.

93
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.140
I want the origin to be at the bottom on this particular object because then when we look at the item

94
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.160
it's location z equals zero.

95
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.250
I know that I can place it smack bang on the floor let's say we jumped over here I can make sure that

96
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:02.040
that reads zero and it's in the same position vertically as it was when it was over here and the great

97
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.630
thing of having the separate objects is it means we can move them individually as well.

98
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.400
Pretty cool huh.

99
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.290
And if we did want to put it together into one scene we can select both of these and go control and

100
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.950
J.

101
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.820
And it will move all of that data into one grease pencil object or if you've accidentally managed to

102
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.400
put your drawing all in one object which is easy to do in your focusing if you're in edit mode remember

103
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.120
you can select one of the vertices press the al-Qaeda select linked press the p key to separate and

104
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.780
we can do the selected points when we do that we get a separate grease pencil object that we can then

105
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:47.560
name appropriately now bear in mind here you can see that it wasn't complete we've not completely selected

106
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.880
all the items.

107
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.650
Something to bear in mind but it's not important at this point.

108
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.420
Okay.

109
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.530
With that in mind it's time for your challenge okay.

110
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.710
So your challenge is to go ahead and draw your scene and lamp in Blender using the grease pencil.

111
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.860
Now one of the things I would recommend that you do is separate the lamp from the rest of the scene

112
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.050
so that it is its own grease pencil object.

113
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.600
And that's gonna enable you later on to move the lamp independently.

114
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.950
And if you don't do that whilst you're drawing it Remember you can always separate that geometry or

115
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.980
the lines that you've created later in edit mode.

116
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.510
I'm also going to try and make my lamp more three dimensional so I'm not just going to draw it from

117
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.140
the side.

118
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.990
I'm going to whiz round and draw it from the top and from the front as well which will give our objects

119
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.760
a bit more three dimensionality a bit more presence in the scene.

120
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.410
It's going to enable me to change the direction later on.

121
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:49.470
The lamp is facing and will also require me to go into edit mode and move those lines individually to

122
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.270
the right place.

123
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.840
Because when you're looking from the top the bottom etc. is just going to draw where the 3D cursor is

124
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.140
from.

125
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.460
So you could put it there first or just move it there afterwards.

126
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.150
The choice is yours but go ahead pause a video now and give that a go.

127
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.110
Okay everybody Welcome back.

128
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.220
Let's go ahead now hop on over into blender and draw the scene and lamp OK.

129
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.760
So I've opened up my animated lamp scene.

130
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.080
I've currently been working on so everything's all set up there.

131
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.870
I'm going to look at it from the side and I'm going to add in a grease pencil.

132
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.190
I'm going to go into draw mode line.

133
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.000
I'm going to open up my tools and make the line a dark line probably a bit thick.

134
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.660
I'm going to use draw ink as the one I'm going to use here and I'm going to make a platform maybe five

135
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.550
either side of this.

136
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.830
So one two three four five One two three four four roughly around that.

137
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.100
Okay perfect.

138
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.770
And then I need a box.

139
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.070
So fortunately we already have a box here.

140
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.800
Let's pop this one just there.

141
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.440
Perfect.

142
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.380
So that's the scene set up so I'm going to cool that scene.

143
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.470
And then we need the lamp itself.

144
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:05.250
So let's go ahead and create a new objects object mode and create myself a new blank grease pencil and

145
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.170
I'm going to call it lamp straight away.

146
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.880
Okay brilliant.

147
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:15.510
Now I'm going to add a bit more detail to my lamp than perhaps necessary but I do think it's quite fun

148
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.030
to do some confetti for anyway.

149
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.140
I'm going to hide my scene so I can work on my lamp independently.

150
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.500
Now what are we going to do here.

151
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.330
Well I'm going to start off by just drawing it face on and then I'm gonna make my lamp a little more

152
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:33.030
3-D so that I can manipulate it a bit more later on when I'm putting together a storyboard.

153
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.890
So the first thing that I want to do here is obviously being draw mode.

154
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.360
And let's go ahead.

155
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.150
I'm going to make it five in the side.

156
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:47.230
I can't see my big squares there is it's gonna be quite a chunky lamp but that's okay.

157
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.250
I'll accept that.

158
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.190
You can have this arch going over.

159
00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:02.070
I want to come out to maybe here and then I'm gonna come back again and having it Central is quite important

160
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.560
because it's going to enable us to do certain things later on that perhaps we would not be able to do

161
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:14.980
otherwise so there we go that's that's a good approximation of what we want the lamp to look like I'm

162
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.200
not gonna draw a vertical bit down here because I wants to make this a bit more 3D and I really use

163
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.820
a couple of circles to do that.

164
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.870
So let's do the base first of all we know roughly how big the base is going to be.

165
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:31.840
I can hold down shift to make sure it's the right proportions.

166
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.900
So it's not too squished either way.

167
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.590
And we can move that before we confirm it as well which is really really useful.

168
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.330
So that's the base that I want to get rid of that middle line going through so I'm going to select it

169
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.220
and delete the points so that already looks a ton better.

170
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:53.740
And if we have a look at it from the front go back into draw mode I can make an arch going across here

171
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.850
as well.

172
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.610
And then that looks pretty sweet.

173
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.150
So we can also add a circle to the front here.

174
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.630
Let's go ahead and do that.

175
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:06.640
I think it's out there we need to make sure we got circled who selected.

176
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.080
Now this is quite difficult to work out of course because we can't really see the other bits.

177
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.590
Now if you've already solidified it that's not a problem we can come back later and sort that's out

178
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.960
in edit mode.

179
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.610
So here's one of the points.

180
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:28.780
Press the El key for length and move it to approximately the right location and then scale it in slightly.

181
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.600
Now we should find that that's done everything I need to.

182
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.230
And then all we need to do is from the top link these two together so we can go back into draw mode.

183
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.680
I can get my straight lines and straight lines.

184
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.790
By the way they're not cheating.

185
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:48.570
Straight lines are a great way of being able to draw things quickly if you're using the mouse.

186
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.900
Now we go we've got the top bit of the lamp.

187
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.050
No not quite.

188
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.750
It did look good for a moment.

189
00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:01.690
We need to go and grab those bits and move them up so we'll press select one from each of these two

190
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:07.970
lines that we made and press the elk was round to the side press GZ and lift them up.

191
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.860
And there we go.

192
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.250
We've got our lamp made and done.

193
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.790
Essentially we've now sketched in the three dimensions.

194
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.950
Now if you've not gone quite this far that's absolutely fine if you just stuck with 2D it has no problem

195
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.320
with that.

196
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.260
So let's bring scene back in.

197
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.670
See how we sit.

198
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.590
Excellent.

199
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:33.420
Let's go back into object mode with round here and let's place our objects over here.

200
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.800
Now the great thing of the origin for this grease pencil because we built over the center of the scene

201
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.290
we now can make sure that it's sat on the ground exactly every single time.

202
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:50.200
If the origin was elsewhere then that would be more of a problem and I would recommend for something

203
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.780
that we're going to move like this and place on the ground just like we did with the chess set.

204
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.210
We make sure that the origin is at the bottom.

205
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.360
In this particular case.

206
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.820
So we can align things properly.

207
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.530
Okay.

208
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.190
I think we're done for this particular lecture.

209
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.650
Great.

210
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.410
How did you guys get on looking forward to seeing your scenes sketched out and ready to go.

211
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.520
Did you go for a more sketchy look.

212
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.010
There's nothing wrong with that at this point in time.

213
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:19.060
This is all about setting up the scene ready to make a storyboard with.

214
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:24.010
Share your scene set up over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
