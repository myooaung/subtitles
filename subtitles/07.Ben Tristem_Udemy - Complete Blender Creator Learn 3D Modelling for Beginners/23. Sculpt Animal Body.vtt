00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.460
Once again, we're cranking out these sculpting tools, we are going to be putting some shape to the

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.000
body of our animal, not the head just yet, the head or the ears will do that later.

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.100
But for now, we're going to do some sculpting of the body.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.780
First step is to convert to a mesh.

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.980
So I'm going to select all of my metal bowls and then find the object menu.

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.750
Slide on down until we see convert to.

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.810
And you see in their curved slash mass mesh at Central.

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.460
Click on that.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.030
Have a look at the wireframe just to make sure all looks hunky dory, which I think.

10
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.050
Yes, it does.

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.270
In fact, I think I'll add a little bit more detail to my mesh song and jump over into sculpt mode and

12
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.220
just use my scrolling wheel to scroll long and my menu are gonna find remeasured, which is right next

13
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.110
to Dion Topper.

14
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.080
Click on that.

15
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.680
And then from within here I will change my voxels size two point o five and then click on the Ramesh

16
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.100
button.

17
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.870
That will add a little bit more detail.

18
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.220
Just so as we're going around and doing our sculpting, we're working from a more detailed mesh.

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.930
And that's a good point to show you your challenge, which is to fire up your sculpting tools and shape

20
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.980
your animal's body.

21
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.330
Scott, with symmetry on if appropriate and if you want to do that, I'm not doing that with mine,

22
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.720
as I've mentioned before, because I'm doing the legs a little differently.

23
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.350
And you can see I've got add already posed.

24
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.860
That's why I'm not using symmetry.

25
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.560
Probably we'll use symmetry for the head when I get to that point.

26
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.560
And remember that your animals covered by hair or fur.

27
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.740
So think broad shape, not just fine details, because we will be covering a lot of that upsy.

28
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.910
You won't see those fine details.

29
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.000
So there's a challenge.

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.380
Jump in.

31
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.930
Take that on.

32
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.040
I'll see you back here when you done.

33
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.150
And I start by turning on Diane Toppo and looking at the values.

34
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.240
I think I'll have the constant detail and I'll set this as a starting point or in about 20, I'll definitely

35
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.940
be turning this up higher when I'm getting to more detailed areas.

36
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.070
Starting on 20, using the crease, told us to go in and put in some of the creases to get some definition

37
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.100
around the the legs and the muscles.

38
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.860
And as I've done before, I want to speed up the video here.

39
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.590
Just change my smooth tool a little bit so that it's not so aggressive, just starting off with some

40
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.230
clay strips.

41
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.960
I really like clay strips to use it both to add and to subtract, to be kind of scraping out holes.

42
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.820
So here I'm scraping Samarian, the shoulder blades, just adding in some creases, trying to give myself

43
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.510
a little bit of that.

44
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.950
A reference point on my own animals so I can see.

45
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.210
Aha.

46
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.120
This is where the poor should bend.

47
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.010
This is where the knee should bend.

48
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.140
I'm here having a little bit of difficulty, I think on the front paw, the one that's bent a little

49
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.150
bit of a weird way just going around the animal.

50
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.600
I tend to work in a fairly random just flow to here.

51
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.130
The moon takes me approach.

52
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.150
So if I'm working on one leg, I might see something that's really bugging me on one the other legs.

53
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.830
And then I jump over there and I jump back again rather than trying to get one particular aspect to

54
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.070
100 percent done.

55
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.450
I tend to float around a lot and just work on the different areas.

56
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.880
So just adding, subtracting, adding, subtracting.

57
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.260
You can see here I'm using a lot of the clay strips, which I quite like, and also playing around in

58
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.570
the grab tool to move things.

59
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.670
Also playing around with the inflight tool.

60
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.600
I use that a little bit.

61
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.090
I think I'm going to use that on the tail.

62
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.480
I reckon will be a good place to see if I can deflate and inflate that.

63
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.520
And just finessing it, getting it to the point where I'm happy with the the thickness of the leg.

64
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.360
It's a little bit tricky with the legs because we will have hair or fur on top of them.

65
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.060
So it's hard to know how skinny to make them.

66
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.230
So they end up looking the right thickness that we've got in our reference images.

67
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.370
So here I'm playing around with having them a little bit thinner and I might need to just fatten them

68
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.760
up a little bit later on if they look too thin and then just finding spots where I can, I guess, get

69
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.630
that shape of the muscles or the bones, particularly in those shoulder joints.

70
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.930
I think that's a really important part of the cat to have those shine through.

71
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.750
Just going around, doing a lot of smoothing standard workflow, just add down some clay strips or draw

72
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.680
or or do an inverse of the draw sharp and then straight away to smooth that so that we get rid of the,

73
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.070
you know, the sculpting tool mark as we go.

74
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.770
So I'm starting to work on the tail here, just experimenting with the pose tool, which I find quite

75
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.280
interesting.

76
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.290
But to be honest, I haven't had a lot of success with it.

77
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.720
It tends to rotate things I find in a very aggressive way and see if I rotate the leg, then it really

78
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.100
can really mess it up.

79
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.940
You've got to play around a lot with the size of the tool and exactly where you grab it.

80
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.110
That's something good to experiment with, I think, to see if I can get it working for your particular

81
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.420
structure and not getting weird rotations.

82
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.160
I find that often the grab tool does just as good a job if you make the grab tool, the right size that

83
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.660
you can see.

84
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.460
He very interestingly, when I'm using the grab tool, it has squashed the tail and doesn't hasn't given

85
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.230
a very good effect playing around with the inflate or the reverse of inflate, which is the deflate

86
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.020
tool as I go to see if that gives us a good effect on the tail so I can fatten it and thin it out and

87
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.040
then just having a look at it.

88
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.460
I don't think the reference image is exactly doing with the tail.

89
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.260
Would I'd like to have the tail do so.

90
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.870
I'm just practicing with a shape here, not worrying so much.

91
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.700
If I mess up the geometry itself I can just go and refat in that and reshape it later on.

92
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.390
But I'm just trying to get the overall broad flow of the tail.

93
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.190
Should it go straight up or straight down.

94
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.820
I think when a cat is hunting, the tail doesn't stick straight up in the air.

95
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.580
If you look at videos of big cats when they're hunting their prey, they're trying to stay as low to

96
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.390
the ground as possible.

97
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.920
If they had this big tail waving up out of the grass, then the creatures they're stalking will see

98
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.090
them.

99
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.190
So here I am playing around and having the tail be fairly straight in line with the cat, but have a

100
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.360
little bit of flow to it.

101
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.110
So goes down and then picks up a little bit at the end to, you know, to show that the cat is engaged

102
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.800
in stalking.

103
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.930
But it's not, you know, when we're not in the middle of the savanna where it's hunting a wildebeest

104
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.340
or science, just kind of doing what cats do.

105
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.430
So that that was what I was trying to sum somewhat with the tail.

106
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.360
They're going around the paws, just trying to reshape them fat and the mat a little bit.

107
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.190
I've said before, the paws will be hidden probably by grass, but I want to make sure that the shape

108
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.800
of them is at least the the shape that I'm looking for.

109
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.010
And then I'm also moving my camera around to see what's a likely camera shot, our camera position that

110
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.390
I'm going to have for this pose.

111
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.790
And somewhere around here, I think front on the cats walking past the camera, I can see the shape.

112
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.950
It's that that shoulder at the front that I really want to accentuate and have that pop through.

113
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.240
And the the shape of the head, I think needs to match as well.

114
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.090
And the head is precisely what we'll be working on in the next lecture.

115
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.880
So when you're done sculpting with your body, I will see you in the next lecture for us to work on

116
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.270
the head.
