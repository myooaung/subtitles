00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,170
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,520
In this lecture we're going to have a look at making our ages just a little bit sharper.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,180
This is what we've got at the moment and we can just sharpen everything and make things much more defined

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,610
and especially at the very top.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,370
You can see we've got much defined much more defined edge and around the model itself.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:34,020
It just brings everything together and makes things much more defined especially around this area where

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,970
our STEM comes out.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,770
It looks far far better.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,190
Let's go over into blender and find out more

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:51,510
OK so let's have a look at our lamp base first for let's focus on this area where the stem enters the

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,080
rest of the base selecting the base itself.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,480
Let's go into edit mode and let's have a look at what we want to adjust.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,980
Well the first thing I'm going to do here is I'm just going to make sure that we're no longer following

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,330
the actual subdivisions.

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,850
So we're not allowing the cage to follow the modifier results so we can see where things really are.

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,110
And having a look here in fact being out of rendered mode would help here we can see that is very very

17
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,620
close this edge running around here.

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,650
We can see is going to potentially be an issue if it is inside.

19
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,670
And I think it's just the right size actually.

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,250
So what we can do here is let's have a look very closely.

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,790
Just make it slightly slightly bigger.

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,020
OK.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,110
That's a good start but it hasn't really affected any of the rest of our model.

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,830
What we need to do with that hedge loop selected.

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,080
So if you use edge or vertex select to select it with the old key and once you've done that open up

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,590
the property side bar with the end key and go to where it says mean crease.

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,120
If we increase this high we get it's almost to the point and there we go.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,230
You will find that at some points it just snaps into place.

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,250
And there we go we've got a sharp edge now running down every turn back on our cage as well we can see

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,480
it flows smoothly out and we can do the same to other edges around our model as well we can just do

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,120
things like scale in an ounce to help increase.

32
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,830
We can add additional geometry so we can add a loop cuts in in order to make things a bit sharper.

33
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,390
That's all valid.

34
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,120
All we can grab the edge that we've got maybe scale it in slightly and increase the mean increase and

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,180
that will add in a very sharp transition between the two.

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,470
I don't like it cutting under there so I'm just going to move it out slightly.

37
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,200
OK.

38
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,020
We could work on the rest of the model there.

39
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,570
But let's have a look at this stem.

40
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,550
Now the stem itself doesn't have a subdivision surface modifier on it.

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,240
So adjusting the main increase is not going to make any difference.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,470
We can come in here we can select this top it may increase one still looks exactly the same.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,340
So how do we get it.

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,030
So it looks nice and sharp along the top.

45
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,000
Well let's try just Beverly.

46
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,400
So control and be a bevel along.

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,450
Yeah looks pretty good.

48
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,950
What other options do we have.

49
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,390
So let's undo that.

50
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:30,080
Let's add a bevel modifier when it kind of does the same at the top but then ruins everything else further

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,560
down.

52
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,570
Okay.

53
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,230
Are we okay with it being a nice sharp edge at the top.

54
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,390
Probably.

55
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,030
How do we get that to conform then.

56
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,370
Well let's undo the bevel modifier added in this subdivision surface modifier and it looks like this

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,070
which is no good.

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:57,170
As a couple of ways around that we could inset the top face ever so slightly and you see that adjusts

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,230
the top here.

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,450
We still have an issue further down we'd have to do the same thing there but it all it's really Dallas

61
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,000
it's shifted the problem to somewhere else.

62
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:13,460
So if we could cover that up and I think we will end up covering it up we could potentially get away

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,780
with that.

64
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,960
But you know what.

65
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,460
That's not ideal in this situation because this is a cut bits of metal.

66
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,210
Yes ideally it would have an edge to it.

67
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:30,020
But what we can use is something called the Edge split modifier by putting that on and making sure that

68
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,240
we adjust the angle appropriately.

69
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,520
If we lower all the way down to zero you can see we can see all of the edges coming back again.

70
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,370
We don't mind about that so we just continually turn up anything over 20 degrees seems to be fine for

71
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,020
this.

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,690
And we've got a lovely sharp edge along the top.

73
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,150
We can then combine that with a subdivision surface modifier and without the inner edge.

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:01,580
So let's dissolve edges and we go up and we get a nice smooth looking object much much better.

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,630
Okay.

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,370
So nice quick challenge for you.

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,700
I'd like to finish off adding the sharp edges to your model.

78
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,440
Video now and give that a go

79
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,630
Okay everybody Welcome back.

80
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,370
Let's go ahead now and hop on over in splendor and finish off our sharp edges.

81
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,180
Okay so this stem looks pretty good at the moment but the rest of this model just needs a bit of tightening

82
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,420
up.

83
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,330
I'm going to adjust this edge here and you don't have to go all the way to one you can pick somewhere

84
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,360
in between.

85
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,060
Yeah that looks good.

86
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,780
Now this edge here I think it's this one here I want to make it come out slightly so we've got a much

87
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:49,070
more defined rim around the model and of course we can adjust things like that if we wanted to.

88
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,810
It's not a chess piece so we don't have to be too silly about it.

89
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,950
This one here.

90
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,670
What's I'm going to do is I'm actually going to move that down ever so slightly as well to give it a

91
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,310
tighter edge.

92
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,840
I'm going to set it as one for the moment.

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,460
Yes that looks pretty good.

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,500
Let's bring it down.

95
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,810
I don't want it to be quite strong.

96
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,380
There we go.

97
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,300
That looks much better now.

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,580
We've got a bit of an oddity here.

99
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,310
Well I think it looks odd anyway.

100
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,350
It's nice and smooth on the inside of this lip and tight on the outside.

101
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,520
What can we do to sort that out.

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,170
Well we can go to this edge here and increase the mean crease.

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,850
I'll make it look much better around the inside loop.

104
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,110
Okay.

105
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,070
So I'm I'm liking the look of that.

106
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,880
Let's have a look at what it looks like in rendered mode.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,670
And look through the camera in this particular case Yeah that's looking really good.

108
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,420
I might actually make the material on here.

109
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,110
A dark orange still more of a scarlet type red.

110
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,770
Yeah I prefer that red.

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,080
Okay.

112
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,120
Looking good.

113
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,530
Let's go to our object just here and I might add a manual beveled just along the top edge here.

114
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,800
So I'm going to go out and select the edge loop running round and just Bevel it's not by much but but

115
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,440
just enough and it will still end up with a nice sharp edge along the top but it looks more like a machined

116
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:23,420
edge and the other thing I want to do here is I do want to lower the roughness maybe to point to.

117
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,650
Yes that's better.

118
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,930
I wanted to be a little bit more shiny I like my shiny things.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Okay so let's just save our work and I'm gonna go ahead and press F 12 and see how that is looking X.

120
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,570
That's looking really nice.

121
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,520
I like how this is turning out.

122
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,190
I do press F 12 to render every now and again because it's good practice because sometimes something

123
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,020
in the viewport looks good.

124
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,680
You render it out and it doesn't look good anymore but it looks absolutely fine for the moment.

125
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,060
I'm happy with that.

126
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,280
And of course this also gives me the opportunity to get image save as and export it and I'm going to

127
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,920
call it the lecture code.

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,400
Okay.

129
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,060
Let's go ahead save that and then we go ready to share with people.

130
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,350
I'm really looking forward to seeing your work.

131
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,150
Do remember to continue sharing your progress as you go through these are these are all baby steps.

132
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,740
But as you go through your projects it's brilliant being able to look back and seeing everything.

133
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,150
So even if you're just doing this for yourself as a record that's brilliant.

134
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,810
If he's sharing with everybody else that's also brilliant.

135
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,580
I love seeing it as a teacher being able to see develop and especially if you're not following along

136
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,650
exactly with what I'm doing but creating something epic of your own.

137
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm really looking forward to seeing it.

138
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,620
Please share your work in discussions and I'll see you all in that next lecture.
