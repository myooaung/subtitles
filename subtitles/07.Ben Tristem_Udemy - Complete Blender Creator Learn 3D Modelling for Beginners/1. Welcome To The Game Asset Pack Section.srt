Hello everybody and welcome to the section where we're going to create game assets.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,910
Now it's not just for people who want game assets it's for anybody who wants to be able to export their

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,550
model and understand what you can and cannot export from blender.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,720
We start off with the very basics we'll do some modelling as we've done before but we'll model in such

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,030
a way that's good for game assets and not necessarily good for maybe 3D printing.

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,320
There are two different requirements.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,610
So we looking very specific Lee at game design document what we wanted to get out of it.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,130
We'll talk about how we can mesh things together properly making sure you have modular assets is key

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,320
to creating environments quickly.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,330
You don't want to have to build your entire environment and have it unique having your level designer

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,480
be able to pick up components and put them together to make an awesome level.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,930
That's just what you want to have.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,910
Now you may be your own level designer in which case is going to save you a ton of time.

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,020
Of course game engines wouldn't be great without some texturing so we're going to throw that in there

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,490
as well not just the standard color map but we'll also talk about normal maps.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,030
There were a few maps is the color map.

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,460
We'll talk about glossy maps or speculum maps or metal maps.

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,800
It does depend on the workflow you're going for but that will all be unveiled as we progressed through

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,630
this section.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,980
I'm really looking forward to it.

21
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,090
And this is one of these sections where you will have the opportunity to actually diverge from the course

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,710
content itself.

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm going to be focused on making a gothic style church.

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,120
Now if you don't want to do that then by all means take the lessons that we that we go ahead and learn

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,390
and apply them to something that you like perhaps you like more of a steampunk or cyberpunk or whatever

26
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,860
sci fi environment then apply what we learned to those type of worlds rather than a Gothic church.

27
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,740
That's absolutely fine.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,360
And you will get the most out of this course when you do things like that.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,050
Anyway enough of me rambling on.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,910
Let's dive into the first lecture.

31
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,450
See you soon.
