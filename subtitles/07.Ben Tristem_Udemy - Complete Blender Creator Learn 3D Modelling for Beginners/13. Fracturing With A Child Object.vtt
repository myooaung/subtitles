00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.810
Welcome to fracturing with a child object.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.880
So this again is all about manual destruction taking control over our model.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.750
So this is a great way of adding some dynamic fractures to a model fracturing we use the children's

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.840
geometry as a reference point and we'll see that in more detail in a few moments.

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.230
We're going to experiment with different children to see if they give different results.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.730
And finally a good example of this use is the splintering of wood.

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.950
And I'll show you how to do that too.

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.350
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
Okay so we're starting over now with Edie Falco you've been going to make it a lot flatter more like

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280
a plank than anything else.

11
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.910
I'm going to go ahead here and say that on the x axis make it quite thin.

12
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.040
Scale it by point one on the x axis.

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.580
They just scale up on everything but the x axis by maybe far no for all not forty four for Alex to me

14
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.630
and materne Snapping onto increments so I can just move it to one side and pull that up.

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.840
I'm going to duplicate that.

16
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.410
Moving along the y axis so we got two next to each other that we can look at and we can see the big

17
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.080
or the cube.

18
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.970
So I'm going to add in.

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.560
That's to say something right on the edge here because on a see what happens right on the nose I'm going

20
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.090
to add in a UV sphere there and I'm going to add in another yuryi sphere here.

21
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.160
Excellent.

22
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.380
I'm going to go to this one here an ad in a cube mesh cube.

23
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.600
I will do the same stober here mesh cube and about.

24
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.530
A final one in here but I'm also going to scale that down as well.

25
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.830
So you just got a few different options that I'm going to select everything and just apply the scale

26
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.210
to everything because I've been moving things about if I am just going to add a tiny

27
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.210
sphere just here's a scale that down and then just apply the scale there as well.

28
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.990
Okay so we've got some objects there.

29
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.850
Now we really need to make them children of these planks behinds select all of these spheres and have

30
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.270
gun control and P along with a select B.

31
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.590
Yeah.

32
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.060
Object That's fine so they're all now children of that plank and the same here so controlled MP object.

33
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.960
Okay so we've now got two objects with children.

34
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.600
Let's see what happens if we go and use the cell fracture till the start of the spheres themselves going

35
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.380
hit the space bar type in cell phone bigger cell fracture.

36
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.100
And now we get the options along the top and we want to use child vertices.

37
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.830
Now obviously charred particles which is the fourth option along would be if these individual objects

38
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.900
the children had a particle system applied to them we're not going to deal with particle systems at

39
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.500
the moment.

40
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.410
Some of the check select here childbirths vertices and aren't going to up the level here of shards that

41
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.730
are created or the maximum number of shards that can be created from 100 to 300.

42
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.590
So there's plenty going on here.

43
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.980
I'm going to click okay I'm going to change anything else and we can see here as it's as asset as it's

44
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.670
making it how it's shattering a part.

45
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.900
Our particular model here I don't know how long this is going to take.

46
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.100
Hopefully three hundred isn't too many.

47
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.950
No that's done.

48
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.830
Perfect.

49
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.160
And of course this was been put on to Layer two.

50
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.520
Now I'm actually going to move this one here and it's children.

51
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.480
So I'm going to move that to Layer three.

52
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.200
No go to lay a three.

53
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.990
And I'm going to now run the cell fracture tool again with exactly the same settings so we can compare

54
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.800
the two.

55
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.240
And that was a lot quicker.

56
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.760
So let's have a look at what happens with the spheres themselves.

57
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.150
Now the sphere itself has lots of vertices in it compared to those cubes.

58
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.780
So I'm not surprised that we've got more asrs.

59
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.520
Select everything.

60
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.020
Now we've got more detail than we would do otherwise.

61
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.270
And it is concentrated around here.

62
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.920
Now one of the things that would be a good idea check is going and turning gravity off.

63
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.440
Now it's fighting gravity there is turn it off.

64
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.100
And add a rigid body to all of this and just make sure it's not flying apart.

65
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.060
You know before we do anything else is this just going boom all over the place.

66
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.590
Now one way of just checking to make sure that is working how would expect two is to little she grab

67
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.130
one of the pieces press Escape when you finish doing it and we can see that that can shatter into quite

68
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.540
a few pieces.

69
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.400
Brilliant.

70
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.380
I love that.

71
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.410
Let's go have a look at how the other one has behaved so that's on labour force or with over there.

72
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.840
Let's to see what that looks like that selects everything.

73
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.720
Okay so that's been broken into far far fewer peep people pieces.

74
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.490
And well let's just run the physics effect on Matt and just see.

75
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.720
Okay.

76
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.240
So it's all to do with the number of little clues in the name the number vertices.

77
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.180
The children have this and that looks pretty awesome.

78
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.080
Now because of move that they're placed in a different position when it starts they're actually intersecting

79
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.580
one another so they're forcing each other apart.

80
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.250
So I'm just going to spoors that.

81
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.350
Go back we can see I have moved the piece.

82
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.100
I'm just going to undo until it's in the right place.

83
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.380
So that is a warning to you guys.

84
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.630
Although it's fun to grab things and move them about and knock.

85
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.870
I don't think this has got physics applied to it.

86
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.250
You can very easily end up breaking stuff.

87
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.300
Ah this one actually flies apart by itself.

88
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.930
Or is that me Mike removing things.

89
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.520
So I'm just going to undo a couple of times.

90
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.700
There he goes to that point then just press play.

91
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.040
A case of that is flying apart so we would need to work on that.

92
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.650
In fact there's one last thing to just try here.

93
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.250
Right.

94
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.560
That's before reapply and play.

95
00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.180
Okay so that's definitely got some problems there so we need to work on the margins in order to sort

96
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.890
that out.

97
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.550
I'm not gonna play too much in terms of detail.

98
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:11.320
So figuring out how to break this one apart sensibly of course we could just enable animation when it

99
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.330
comes to something hitting that and it breaking up.

100
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:22.150
Okay so something like wood is a bit well it's a bit more difficult bit more complex than that and I'll

101
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.520
show you the rough idea behind what you can do because we just use primitives at the moment but we need

102
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.770
something a bit more exciting a bit more jagged in order to do that.

103
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.880
So I'm just going to start up a new blender faster have to worry about that I'm going to scale this

104
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.270
on the z axis by five among this scale it not on the z axis by point two so that's very thin.

105
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.690
That looks good to me almost like a wooden chair leg or something along those lines.

106
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.570
Okay.

107
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.560
So now we've got that I'm going to add in their plane and this is going to be are child objects so I

108
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.310
might as well parent them together now.

109
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.540
Okay so this charred object here needs to create some jagged edges.

110
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.390
How do we do that.

111
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.820
Well there's a couple of ways of doing that so the easiest that I've found so far and I'm going to scale

112
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.480
this up at this point and scale the plane back down.

113
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.580
Okay.

114
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:19.860
So now we have the plane there we are actually going to go in to edit mode and subdivide it into lots

115
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.450
and lots of little pieces.

116
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:28.710
So I'm going to go up to maybe 20 it's going to seem a bit much at first but bear with me.

117
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.580
If we scroll down when we subdivide this is fractal option.

118
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.280
And if you go a bit crazy it does go a bit crazy so don't go too high you don't want them crossing over

119
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.870
one another.

120
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.810
But we want them a bit jagged.

121
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:46.710
Once you've done that you can then scale that on the z axis to make it even more exaggerated.

122
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.960
And we can just make that really big like splinters and just going to scale that in.

123
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.060
So it's kind of just popping out so I'm not losing any of the detail there.

124
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.090
That is really good.

125
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:03.630
Okay so we've got this all set up so we can go straight to this object that we want to splinter that

126
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.670
we want to use a child of colour cell fractures we've done before macia Selected on child.

127
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:14.730
Now because we're actually breaking apart slowly with lots and lots of pieces wood tends to splinter

128
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.360
lots.

129
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:21.720
And when we go to this area here the source limits and set that so all five hundreds that's got plenty

130
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.790
of opportunities to splinter.

131
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.860
Now as we go down here there's something else that you can work on and that's the scale.

132
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.560
Now this goes from zero to 1.

133
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.600
This is X Y and Z.

134
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:42.930
Now we're only really dealing in the z direction and we want to emphasize the actual said all that stretchiness

135
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.240
and the zigzag that we've got there we want to make sure there's a splintery and as sharp as possible.

136
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.480
So in this case we want to turn this down in order to exaggerate.

137
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.570
I'm not quite sure how low I need to go.

138
00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:01.020
This is one of these cases where practice and also just trying out settings if you're doing this on

139
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:06.390
a big project you just go off to one side open up a new file and just play with the model append it

140
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.020
in to your heart's content you have muck around with it and not ruin the main model.

141
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:16.680
So I'm trying to click okay here and pray it doesn't crash Blender's it might take a while to go through

142
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.230
and use the child vertices.

143
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.320
There we go is starting to go through and sort it out.

144
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:29.790
Now one of the issues that you may come across excuse me is the shards being too big and clunky.

145
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:35.490
And again that's something you just have to work on you have to adjust settings and just try out different

146
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.060
ways of basically breaking apart the model.

147
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.000
Now we may have actually ended up with too many shards here nope they've come back in.

148
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:50.990
Occasionally when you do this type of tourney with a bit more complex a model it can go a bit wonky.

149
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.310
Okay I think that's now done.

150
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.230
So I'm going to.

151
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.190
All right.

152
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.790
We've got lots.

153
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.770
How many did it break into in the end.

154
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.500
Almost all 500.

155
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.710
Wow lots of lots of things to break into.

156
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.930
So let's go to the second layer.

157
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:12.570
And again I'm just going to turn off gravity we can see this top and bottom bet almost intact compared

158
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.230
to the rest of it.

159
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:19.140
Now going to turn off gravity once again just to make sure that when we knock it into things and play

160
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.360
with it we're actually seeing it work as is.

161
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.510
So that's Pressplay.

162
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.310
And it doesn't throw itself apart.

163
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.050
Brilliant.

164
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:27.550
Okay.

165
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:34.710
Let's just play again and see how many pieces we've splintered that in so all quite a few and if we

166
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:40.060
just pause that there if that had used the right key that had a wood texture on it.

167
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.530
Of course wood doesn't quite blow apart like that.

168
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:49.100
So we've got some other things to play with but you get the idea that now it's shattered in the middle

169
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.800
around where we had those splint and that those splinter rings happening.

170
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.110
And the other thing you can do at this point of course is let's just undo all of that no undoing all

171
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.160
the hard work.

172
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.650
And this is before the splinter happened.

173
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.090
Yes.

174
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:10.560
Now I can take this splintering child and of course duplicate it move it up rotate it round by maybe

175
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.930
on the ball would we want the x axis by 180s that's the other way up.

176
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.510
And it is still be a child and using They'll create a different type of break.

177
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.670
Again we can go in and using the selfridge's I'm not going to set it at 500 this time we're going to

178
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.870
lower it down as an idea of what can happen just clicked okay.

179
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.090
Now this is covered up of course by what's going on here.

180
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.050
In fact the higher level might have been a bit better higher source limit has now got to places that

181
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.390
are being fractured and you can end up obviously to have these a jagged thing like this you could use

182
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.730
a plain slicing through it if you wanted.

183
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.120
So let's just go and have a quick look at how that's going to behave.

184
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.820
Let's add an active to that.

185
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.440
I don't.

186
00:11:53.490 --> 00:12:00.150
Yeah we have Undun gravity so that put gravity off again and let's play it's not coming apart but you

187
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:05.250
can see there how it's splintered in the middle but further raap on this particular angle of pause it

188
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:11.540
there further up the splintering is a bit like wood it's split apart pretty awesome.

189
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.680
Hey excellent.

190
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:21.240
So this is a bit of a zero gravity example but if you're doing slow mo it's almost good to have gravity

191
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.300
off or at least a very low value of gravity so that pieces aren't falling way quite as quickly in your

192
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.230
scene.

193
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.970
So that has come out pretty well.

194
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.700
I love the splintering effect that's come up here.

195
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.280
Now this particular lecture is not having a challenge because I'd like to go straight in and show you

196
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.860
the same tool.

197
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:46.110
But this time using the grease pencil to control it and then once we've mastered the fracture tool will

198
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.460
be very close to the end of section challenge.

199
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.910
If you played with this a little further and come up with something pretty awesome which I'm sure you

200
00:12:53.910 --> 00:13:00.060
guys can do remember to share with us so we can see your efforts over on the forum and I will see you

201
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.110
guys in the next lecture.
