00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to relinking blend files in this video you will make a commit.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:13,820
Trust me at this point there's a possible day to frustration almost inevitable if you don't make some

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,470
sort of go back point.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,500
So whether it's a commit whether you're zipping up your data folder your current working folder.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,480
Just make sure you've got a backup before you do anything like this because it's potentially highly

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,880
destructive.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:36,120
I understand the ordeal you need to do things in if you wish to change a linked file or its data blocks.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,700
And we'll also see what happens if you change a link.

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:49,370
Sir first of all moving or renaming blend files make a commit so that if something does go wrong you

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,030
can go back to its copy the files to a new location.

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,540
Even if that means they're in the same location or an entirely new folder that doesn't matter.

12
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,780
But what does matter is we do not remove the originals at the moment.

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:12,870
They must stay there rename the copied files appropriately so we've made a fundamental change.

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,670
Then obviously you can rename them.

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,570
Or in my case I am about to go through.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,970
I just want to shorten the names and make them a bit neater.

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:31,220
Doing it in any other order will break links and any links broken when you save the blend file will

18
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,920
be lost forever which of course will result in more work reconstructing.

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,760
And as we've seen with the.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,810
Was certainly with my Gothic church so far there are a lot of parts that are reused there are only about

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,310
eight in total that do the whole building.

22
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,520
Certainly the window parts and the blank wall paints.

23
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,010
If those links were broken I'm going to have to pour a lot more parts back into my model.

24
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,110
I don't want to do that.

25
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,630
There we've got moving or renaming data blocks.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,380
This isn't so straightforward as a completely different method to preserving them.

27
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,870
Should you want to move or remain them remember.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,670
Make a commit so you can roll back at any point.

29
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,980
Copy the files.

30
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,630
Then open up that copy and make your data block adjustments so you might want to change the mesh name

31
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,800
of an object or even the object name.

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,490
Or perhaps you want to change the mysterious all name that you've assigned.

33
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,150
Perhaps it was an appropriate but you need to make these adjustments in the copy.

34
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,270
Then we'll go ahead and link the new file into the scene.

35
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,980
Make links to the new object replacing the old one and then finally you can go ahead and delete or archive

36
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,820
the old blend file and that's as we will shortly see will happily remove that link from Blender any

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,220
way.

38
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,560
By the act of doing that on the next save.

39
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,980
So let's go experience all of this and hop on over into a blender.

40
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,480
Okay so back in blender The first thing this I'm going to do is demonstrate what happens if we do something

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
to an existing blend file that's linked into our scene.

42
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:19,220
So let's go ahead and go to the file system here and I'm going to do the front door because it's one

43
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,670
of the least use pieces so something goes wrong at least then I can sort it out.

44
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,920
So I've got Church front door here.

45
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,150
If I go ahead and delete the numbers at the end of it which is one of the things I want to do because

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,660
I think I'm going to go for a more of a standard format with these underneath except that they're going

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,480
to be two by four or two by two or four by four and a thickness a stick.

48
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,920
Kurtz OK again point to zull maybe even multiples or point two but as long as I know there's a standard

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,440
across the building that's undoing I shouldn't have to put in all these extra details.

50
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:02,180
Okay so now that I've renamed that if we get went ahead and re opened our church there we go the front

51
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,300
door has disappeared and I think it's used over here as well so that one has also disappeared and we

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,080
can have a look in the outliner itself we can see that the parts there's actually an empty there now

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,320
in the parts and that no doubt will be the church door so here we go.

54
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,800
Having a look in the outline of the church door is now an empty where it used to be.

55
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:34,040
Now if we go ahead and save the blend file at this point in time we will destroy that link forever we'd

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,000
have to read link the church door into the scene which is not always a bad thing but imagine having

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,570
to do that for something is repeated a couple of hundred times.

58
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,270
Not sure how often.

59
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,770
In this scene so far the blank wall piece is used but it's used an awful lot and I wouldn't fancy having

60
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,540
to reconstruct it all because I had made a silly mistake with moving something.

61
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,880
So instead of doing that's what we can do is go back.

62
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,880
I am just going to highlight those numbers.

63
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,040
Fortunately the naming convention meant I can just do that because we named our file the same as we

64
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,400
named the mesh data and the object data.

65
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,490
So now that I've renamed that fact should restore the file.

66
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,770
The important thing is that you don't go ahead and save.

67
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,750
That's easy to do.

68
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,290
For instance you may not notice that a wall piece.

69
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,760
Sorry you will notice Civil War pieces missing.

70
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,250
But if you've got a small let's say a candle or something in the scene and you'll look into it from

71
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,100
the outside and you're making some changes from the outside.

72
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,340
You might not notice that disappearing.

73
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,160
So now that we've reverted in we've changed the name back we've got the door back there so if we wanted

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:57,140
to move our object the first thing to do is make sure that we are using relative or absolute paths.

75
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:04,120
Now by default it's using a relative path which basically means that it's not reliant on whether or

76
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,540
not you're in the exact use a directory on a particular computer.

77
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,950
What it does mean is as long as all of the stuff is grouped in a similar way on every computer.

78
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:22,060
So in this case I have my project folder and meshes as long as and the other folders that are associated

79
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,400
there.

80
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,110
As long as that folder structure still exists on another computer it will work.

81
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:33,070
So let's go ahead and just check what we've got so when I go in link a file there or where the operator

82
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,730
panel usually set on the lower left hand side.

83
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,800
We've got relative path ticked and that will be ticked by the phone and we will also want to leave it

84
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,080
ticked so we will leave it teched have a click Cancel to come out of there we check that.

85
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,890
So the first thing that we'd need to do if we wanted to move information about or rename and rename

86
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,370
things what I'm going to do.

87
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,540
So I don't have to type too much.

88
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,130
Let's go to the file system and copy the blend file.

89
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,000
Now that we've copied the blend file we can just rename it and for speed purposes.

90
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,980
I'm going to call it church front door C F D.

91
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,810
Lower case they have case does matter it is case sensitive.

92
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,810
What we don't want to do is invert the break some think by not getting the case right.

93
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,500
So I've named it cft hopping back into blender.

94
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,130
I can then go to the data blocks in the outline.

95
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,450
Once I'm in the data blocks will need to go and find the libraries.

96
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,280
Now this is going to look a bit messy.

97
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,100
We think we've named everything and in fact we've missed something.

98
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,950
These libraries alas okay because they're hidden away.

99
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,360
But since we're here we can actually go in and name them.

100
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,410
Now I've gone into the section a few times so I know straight away mind.

101
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,610
Library 0 0 4 is the door and we can see the file path down here.

102
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:02,110
Links to the door itself now because the data blocks are in the file itself have not changed.

103
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,390
All we've done is moved the file position.

104
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:10,750
We can update this to the new name or even the new position if we moved it to a nother folder.

105
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,870
The first thing I'm going to do is actually call it front door on the library so that I know what it

106
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,550
is just by looking at it so if I need to come back later I know where it is and we can see here is a

107
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,470
relative path.

108
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,570
It's got the two slashes Dodderer meshes and then we've got the file name there so one of the reasons

109
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:34,870
why I wanted it shorter is sort of this area and a few other areas in blender you get I can't widen

110
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,570
that so it's just too long so we had it church front door and I'm just going to go back and make sure.

111
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,370
Oh no that wouldn't work you do have to make sure this is named perfectly so if it does mean you look

112
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,830
here and then you hop back and go see if they don't blend cft or blend lowercase etc..

113
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,740
It's in the meshes folder will have not changed anything there so that should be absolutely fine.

114
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,790
What we can now do is go ahead and save the blend file.

115
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:08,740
Don't make a mistake and don't make a mistake try to do double check for it you've got this right before

116
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,610
you click save and then go ahead and let's reopen the file again.

117
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,290
Then all should be okay.

118
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:21,560
If you're doing things like this for your own sake do them one at a time and commits.

119
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,880
In between each one so that if you do make a mistake you'd know where you've made the mistake and you

120
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,600
can just go back to that point.

121
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:35,140
If you got to change all of these pieces out or just move them all to a new folder and you're doing

122
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:41,530
this to keep it nice and sane for you then of course you will need to make that commute in between is

123
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,880
what you will want to do is do the whole lot again.

124
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,030
So now that we've done that the other thing is if we knew a data block.

125
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,120
Now that's something slightly different.

126
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,300
Again we need to take a copy of the file.

127
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,840
So let's take a copy of the C.F. the file.

128
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,130
In this case.

129
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,400
So then take a copy of that file and it's going to be called See if the two.

130
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,300
Really really deep and I'm going to rename the mesh data here.

131
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,700
Actually what I want to call it so instead of going down this route I'm going to rename the blend file

132
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:24,280
in the moments I want to call this level of detail at E Since it's a lower poly mesh it's a very basic

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,050
mesh and I want to call this then the front door.

134
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,650
I know it's a church because that's what I'm building.

135
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:38,860
You may call it whatever is appropriate for your particular model but French Church.

136
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,480
That's great.

137
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,170
Now say the word church I type it elodie Acres is the basic model.

138
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,460
Front door.

139
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,500
Don't need any more details than that.

140
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm going to go in and update the meche data as well to reflect on the same name that at the moment

141
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,690
is important.

142
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,470
Now see if the two is not the right name at all.

143
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:05,160
So I'm going to go ahead here and go save as an I'm just going to call it front door again.

144
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:13,290
It is explicit that's an put underscoring there is explicit though it's going to be a church that I'm

145
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,020
working on.

146
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,700
I can even move it into a church folder of that was at all necessary.

147
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,340
So I'm going to save that and go back to my file system quickly and do a tiny bit of clearing up.

148
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,670
I'm going to deletes the C.F. the two that I created.

149
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:36,340
Okay so now when I go back into the scene itself the Gothic church scene I'm going to have to link that

150
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,540
new file in.

151
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:48,740
Meshes and front door object elodie a front door and then we could pick left higher levels of detail

152
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,860
if necessary so we're going to pull that in.

153
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:58,240
It's come in and we're going to make it a proxy and it's on layer 2 here which is absolutely fine.

154
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:05,060
The ground is not on the appropriate layer so that's move too and how one sets all together.

155
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,470
Again grounds back on.

156
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:13,580
So in order to take that object data from that newly imported object what we need to do is first select

157
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,570
the ones that are going to receive that data.

158
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,900
Which is all we don't on that corner piece.

159
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,960
Which of these two front doors are not doing very well selecting.

160
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,230
There we go.

161
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:33,020
Now I have selected those two unlive turning this other layer which Scott the last door on has selected

162
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:40,820
So the active object has to be the one giving the data and then we can go to objects and make links

163
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,760
and we can see the shortcut there is control and L..

164
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,230
And this is where we go object data.

165
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,160
Now nothing will have really change because they're both the same actual mesh and the knife edge is

166
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,500
called something different.

167
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:06,670
If we go ahead and save the file now and come out of blender completely and say let's go here now that's

168
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,970
named at cft SOME going to the leads and take a punt here that are done that correctly Unger the least

169
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:20,370
churched front door and c f d completely from my archive I can do it safely because I've made a commit

170
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,200
and then I'm going to make sure it's saved and revert.

171
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,140
And there we go.

172
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,320
It's still there.

173
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,750
They haven't disappeared.

174
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,490
Now you can use this for other things as well.

175
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,230
So say I wanted to replace this war piece at the very top because they're modular.

176
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,050
They're all the same size.

177
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:49,490
It means that I can then select the door down at the bottom go control in L and do the object data.

178
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:55,530
And when I do the object data you can see it replaces it and that is incredibly powerful allows you

179
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,310
to modify your project very very quickly.

180
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,040
And as you saw in that list there are some other things you can do as well.

181
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:11,910
So say we came up with a an awesome colour for the church itself so unethically create a new material

182
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,940
on this wall piece here.

183
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,370
Now it's going to apply to every single wall piece that that has inherited which is the rest of the

184
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,810
wall pieces in the model.

185
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,600
And let's.

186
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,000
That's to say we've we've made it an awesome orange and let's call it awesome orange.

187
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,080
It's my new favourite colour.

188
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,900
Awesome orange.

189
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,850
And I'm going to hop into materials just to make sure that's applied quite bright and say we wanted

190
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,450
that on all of the vaults that saqi forgetting what these things are called.

191
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,750
We would select the vaults first.

192
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,650
All of them if we wanted it on every single one.

193
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,830
And then and only then we would click on the donor and then we go control an L..

194
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:06,410
And select materials and there we go it's inherited those materials very very powerful and can save

195
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,070
an awful lot of work having to assign those individually.

196
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,050
Brilliant.

197
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:19,940
Okay guys I'd like you to check your naming and filing so ensure all the basic building blocks are named

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,390
appropriately.

199
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:28,880
I'm going to be using the prefix elodie underscore a for mine which means it's the lowest level of the

200
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,180
Tel model I'll be working with.

201
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,620
Make your names as concise as they need to be.

202
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,070
So I have personally decided that I don't need the prefix church since the whole project is going to

203
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,180
be about church.

204
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,940
If you're doing a different type of Interior maybe kitchen or something like that.

205
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,230
Name your project folder appropriately rather than having the individual name tag on the beginning of

206
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,580
file is entirely up to you.

207
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,680
This is one of those things that's at more of a personal taste and I've decided the numbers at the end

208
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,360
might just be a bit clunky So I'm going to cut those off as well.

209
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,450
I know that all of my building blocks for this particular scene are going to be four by four or four

210
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:13,940
by two or two by two so they are going to fit together nicely and I'm going have to stick to that standard

211
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,010
width four point two.

212
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,510
Unless it's some sorta special part in which case it's probably not going to be modular any way it's

213
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,440
going to be a special part.

214
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,170
The method for data blocks.

215
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,630
By the way works if you're renaming a moving the whole file too.

216
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,440
So if you're going to be doing both of those tasks and not just an organizational task then you will

217
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:44,960
probably be better off doing the second method but do them one at a time and remember to commit or backup

218
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,910
your work before you do any of this because it can be very destructive.

219
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,340
What I don't want you guys to do is obviously have to repeat a load of work because you made a tiny

220
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,030
mistake in naming something.

221
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,080
And this is going to be another one of those lectures where I'm going to leave you to it.

222
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,280
I'm going to go off and rename all of my files and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
