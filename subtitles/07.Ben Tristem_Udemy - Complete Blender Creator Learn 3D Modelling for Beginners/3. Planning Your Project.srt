00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,110
Welcome to planning your project.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,330
In this video you will plan your project defining its scope and your goals.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,530
It is important to make sure we prevent scopes lepp.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,910
We're going to gather your reference material now if possible.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,450
Explore real world locations to get a feeling of the environment.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,690
Scour the web for your reference images as well.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,920
Now will be focussing on building blocks and modular thinking now going to be thinking about the ways

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,030
that you make parts reusable and modular so they connect together easily.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,760
So you don't have to make bespoke parts every single time.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:47,090
If you think about Lego that great kids and adults toy there's a lot of modularity with it you can make

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,990
pretty much anything.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:54,360
Your imagination has parts it does have some restrictions too obviously is quite blocky.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,960
Fortunately with Blender we're not we don't have quite that restriction.

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,230
Now realize that this gives you very quickly serrations cause you can put things together and take them

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:10,670
apart because they're made of modules and it's great for prototyping from only a few parts so you can

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,140
build up a building very quickly with a couple of squished cubes.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,280
Now if you're a supplier of assets to a level maker or even if you've got multiple hats on yourself

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,560
you're going to love the way that they can redesign a level with your assets.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,370
If you give them one building completely constructed they're going to struggle modifying it.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,470
However if you give them all the pieces to construct any room then they'll be able to make any other

21
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,400
room from those assembly.

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,700
The same when you're modelling inside blender itself it means that once you've made let's say a wall

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:54,140
section you can use that repeatedly rather than making different shapes and sized walls.

24
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,310
So I've got a challenge for you to kick off this section Unlike to you to plan your building or room

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,950
that you're going to be working with.

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,250
So go ahead and gather lots of reference material.

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,900
Go ahead take photos look around you if you're in a in a building with lots of different things I'm

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,990
looking around me right now and I can see an interior environment that's got a sink water jugs a couple

29
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,110
of plants cupboards there's lots of things that you can include and remember of course things like walls

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,370
and windows and doors.

31
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,470
They're very important of course I don't want to go over the top at this point in time because we're

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:37,400
not focussed on micro detail so focus on the main items at the moment the big things that support everything

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:45,530
else the walls the ceiling the floor doorways even to chair and table level as well so we can start

34
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,260
fleshing out a room as well.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,880
Then I'd like you to go ahead and list at least 10 models.

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,830
You want to include in your interior design.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,230
Now remember that I'm going to be focussed on this gothic church style building.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,880
However you can just model the one you're sat in right now now be a good challenge and remember you

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,640
need at least 10 individual models that you're going to be making lists them not done.

40
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't go ahead make them just yet.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,180
We've got some other things to cover first that you want to include inside this building sketch your

42
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,730
design and share your goal in the discussions Bozzo video now and give that a go.

43
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,020
Okay guys welcome back.

44
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,970
How did you get on.

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,630
What did you decide to go ahead and model what type of Interior are you going for.

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,450
This is my rough sketch of where I'm going.

47
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,970
I've got the stained glass windows perhaps at the end.

48
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,520
I've got a rough shape of a building with some pillars chandelier's perhaps candles hanging down there

49
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,770
lots of different options that I can go for here.

50
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,880
But this is a rough sketch to get into my head.

51
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,360
The rough plan of course this is subject to change as we go through as it is a beginning point.

52
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,760
It gives me an idea and a direction to travel in.

53
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:13,150
Okay so finally the list of components and items that I'm going to be why I think so far putting into

54
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,110
my goffey Church so I've got a blank wall or the window wall of doorway a bench an altar an altar twice

55
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,850
apparently but a large windows.

56
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,600
Floor tiles archways candle sans carpet etc..

57
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,460
Just to bring this place to life.

58
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,650
Now what have you guys got.

59
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,650
I'd love to hear your suggestions as to what you're going to including your scene.

60
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,050
In fact Are you going to go along with me and make a gothic church.

61
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,930
Or are you going to make another indoor environments.

62
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,950
Please share that in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
