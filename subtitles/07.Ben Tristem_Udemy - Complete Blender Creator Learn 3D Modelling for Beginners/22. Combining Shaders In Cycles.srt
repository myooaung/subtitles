00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,820
Welcome to combining shaders in cycles.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,260
In this video you give the eye a material that is a combination of different shaders using the node

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,950
editor.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,700
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,750
So I've got my two eyeballs here.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,980
Remember they're a mirror of one another so one of these is real.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,240
And one of them is essentially a reflection of it.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,780
As I mentioned before make sure if you get a flat shading that the eyeballs are facing outwards from

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,020
your rabbits.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,020
I'm going to go straight into this eyeball here using the number pad full stop.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,440
That looks like it is the one.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,160
Yes it is.

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,110
When I hop into edit mode it's just going to remember to turn smooth shading back on.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,090
Eyeballs are quite smooth.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,100
So with the whole eyeball selected we're going to assign it's a material.

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,870
So let's go to the materials tab.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,900
To make this a bit bigger.

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,040
And I'm going to create a new material and just call it a ball.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,330
Now we're going to see too much of this eye ball.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,200
But it's still worth getting this bit.

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,400
Right.

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,410
And just leaving it as it is at the moment I'm going to set the colour to bright white and those who

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,180
assign it to the ball.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,740
Excellent.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:20,470
Now it's not going to be just a diffuse colours going to be a mixture of that plus a glossy colour his

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,080
eye balls are slightly glossy.

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,910
So let's go ahead and do that now.

28
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:30,160
So when he opened up the note editor so going to create a I'm going to go at the top here.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,590
Well first thing we've had to do something here I'm just going to press the plus here and I'm just going

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,280
to name this something else.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,850
I don't know I bought for the moment because that's what the workspace I'm using for I'm going to generate

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,210
a new workspace from here.

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,050
The reason why I've done that is I don't.

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,710
I know that going through this process I'm going to ruin my default layouts.

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,790
And of course this is going to be specialists for just this one case anyway so we're going to have to

36
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,390
open up the node editor.

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,000
There we go.

38
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,380
Wow.

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,520
That's small so I'm going to zoom in and we can see the way it's set up.

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,970
We've got a diffuse shader.

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,010
And the outputs is what it looks like something to turn on rended mode here.

42
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,900
So we can see what's going on and not so Lofts at the moment.

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,970
That's probably because there's no light in our scene some just going to turn the lamp on as well.

44
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,370
Much better.

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,570
So you've got this the fault shayler here.

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,310
I'm going to change the lamp type to a sun.

47
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,430
So we've got.

48
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,100
Ah I hear.

49
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,430
And let's go back to it.

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,640
We have a diffuse shader going into the output which is what it looks like.

51
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,160
Now I'm going to go down here to where it says add and go to another shader and it be a glossy shade

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,180
up and I'm going to place that here.

53
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:03,770
Now the next thing I need to do is mix these two shaders into one before they go to the surface in order

54
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,220
to do that.

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,410
Im going to use something called a mix shader.

56
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:14,030
Now there are two ways essentially of combining these shaders ones ever a mix shader or an add shader.

57
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,560
They have to be careful with an ADD shade because it literally adds the values together so you can end

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
up with something that is incredibly bright.

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,750
But in this case we want a mix shade because we want to be able to control the ratio between fuse and

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,030
glossy.

61
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:36,110
So I'm going to add this time in a different way with shift in a like you used to when adding a a primitivo

62
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,690
or something like that in the 3D editing mode.

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,060
And I need to add a shade of type mix.

64
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,790
Now another way of doing that is if you know the name is you can click on search here and I've obviously

65
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,980
previously searched MC shade up the moment you type in mix.

66
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,160
It's one of the options there so I'm going to click MC shader.

67
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,570
Now I can immediately place it on top of this line here and you see it goes orange.

68
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,310
And when I click it's going to link it in.

69
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,990
Brilliant.

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,740
The final thing we need to do is go from whereases be STF on the cross he showed up.

71
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,910
Plug it in to the shader down here.

72
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,640
And now we can see we've actually got a bit of speculative bit of gloss to our eyeball.

73
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,530
The final thing with the MC shader is of course there's this factor here.

74
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:36,210
And so we can make it 100 percent diffuse completely ignoring the settings we've got on glossy or we

75
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,490
can make it 100 percent glossy.

76
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,360
We don't want to either we want it somewhere in between and we can always go ahead and alter this later.

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,040
But the default value of about point two or thereabouts is perfect because it gives us a little bit

78
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,430
of a gloss to it.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,580
Perfect.

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,360
So I feel a challenge coming on for you guys.

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,430
I would like you to create the rest of the materials so go ahead and create and assign the following

82
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,880
additional materials.

83
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:12,840
The iris and pupil use the eyeball material as the starting point remembering to make it unique for

84
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,520
each material.

85
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,470
Then finally use the reference material.

86
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:25,850
If you find that necessary to make sure that the eye has the pupil and the iris in the right proportions.

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,670
So pause a video now and give that again.

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,870
Okay guys.

89
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,780
Welcome back.

90
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,880
Let's hop over into blender and assign the iris and pupil materials.

91
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,570
Right.

92
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,790
So the first thing I'm going to do and you can do this in any particular order that you want so I'm

93
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,700
going to create the two new materials first.

94
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,600
Or at least the slots for them.

95
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,910
And I'm going to click here and pick up.

96
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,830
I bought.

97
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,840
And then I'm going to click the number two here to make it a single user copy.

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,850
And I'm going to call that Iris.

99
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,410
I want to do the same to this one underneath.

100
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,280
I'm going to click here select eyeball.

101
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:15,630
Make it a single user copy by clicking the number and naming that one pupil.

102
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,200
Now depending on which one we're on.

103
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,950
We obviously are going to be changing the materials.

104
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,100
If we had not made them unique when we change one material it will change the original eyeball mature

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,580
and we don't want that to happen.

106
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,010
So with the pupils selected I'm going to go down here to diffuse and change that to black and just going

107
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:42,730
to have my pupil completely black on both of these that the colour of them blacked out for the time

108
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:49,890
being I'm going to make my iris probably an orange brown colour to match the iris we were making earlier.

109
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,680
But that would just be for reference because shortly the colour itself would be overridden by a texture.

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
But that's in an upcoming lecture.

111
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,580
So finally we need to assign these new material some of them.

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,150
Squeeze this one down a little or if I pick up the right thing.

113
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,850
Let's pull this down.

114
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:15,210
Skip bring the head of barback with this little Plus down here and change this to solid Hopkins edit

115
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,330
mode and let's just have a look from about here.

116
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,210
So these select everything I'm going to you circle select because it's going to be the easiest thing

117
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,950
and of course I can make this circle bigger and smaller and I'm going to select everything here.

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,600
And assign once the select there in a sign that that's of course you won't be able to see these assigned

119
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,140
materials into urine material view.

120
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,550
So I'm going to leave it like that for the moment.

121
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:52,420
Now finally the actual pupil itself now rabit pupils are quite large.

122
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,630
So let's go ahead here and again.

123
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,790
These select everything circle selects bout that much I think.

124
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,680
Ang Let's go to pupil and a sign.

125
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,250
Excellent.

126
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,210
With that in mind I'm probably going to make the iris slightly bigger as well so I'm going to use a

127
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,520
loop select here.

128
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,540
So we got face in a select loop around there go to Iris and sign.

129
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,090
So we've got all of our materials now assigned to our model.

130
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,740
Of course we can very quickly check that and see how this is looking.

131
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,170
So let's go ahead and render the image.

132
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,010
I believe I've got it all set up to render correctly.

133
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,990
So what have we got here.

134
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,470
There we go.

135
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,340
So we've got our bunny.

136
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,760
It's looking good.

137
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,210
Excellent.

138
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,630
How did you guys get on.

139
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,060
Please share your eyeball in the discussions.

140
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,740
And see you in the next lecture.
