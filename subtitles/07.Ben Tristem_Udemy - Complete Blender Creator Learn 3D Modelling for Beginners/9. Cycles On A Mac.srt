Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,000
In this lecture it's purely for those using a Mac because cycles is just a little bit different now.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,520
I have a Mac Mini so it doesn't have a dedicated graphics card but some Macs do have.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,290
And if you've if you're fortunate enough to have one of the older ones that has an end video graphics

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,320
card you should be okay still but the modern systems even you if you attach an external graphics card

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,310
to it it just won't play nicely with any video graphics cards and the other thing that's sad at the

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:42,400
moment but unfortunately GPA accelerated cycles isn't going to be problem free.

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,460
Back in April issue Apple dropped support a Mac OS for open JL open C.L. pushing more towards their

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,780
metal too.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,420
And what's that's called is a few issues when it comes to using blender and cycles.

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,900
So blenders actually finished downloading here which is good.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,600
So I'm going to go ahead and open that upsets blender 2.8 and this will be a sort of a little bit of

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,370
an overview of how to set it up and use it on a Mac.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,990
We'll delve into a bit more details in the upcoming videos which you can follow along on whatever platform

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,300
you are.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,750
But of course this is going to be purely Mac based.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,200
Okay.

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,460
So on the Mac the first thing I'm going to do here is go to edit and preferences and I'll do a couple

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,110
of things.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,710
The first thing I'm going to do is go to interface and turn the resolution scale up to one point two

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,380
five.

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,090
Just it's a bit easier to read.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,890
And with the preferences open if we go down to system we get a couple of options under the cycles render

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,000
devices.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,490
So we've got none CUDA and open CRL.

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,340
Now unfortunately what you tend to find with CUDA and open S.L. if you don't have a compatible GPA which

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,220
this computer doesn't it's only got a built in one.

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,860
It won't actually give you any options there but you may also find that if you do have an option here

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,770
it doesn't render as quick as your CPA does.

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,860
That's something to bear in mind when you're rendering and would talk about assessing rendering speed

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,480
in a bit in an upcoming lecture.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
So on this particular computer I'm going to make sure that none is ticked in there.

33
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,480
And what that means is when we use cycles we're going to use our CPE you add in general Max certainly

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:32,940
at the moment at the time of recording which is May 2019 you're likely to when you're using a Mac have

35
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,040
to use the CPSU rather than a graphics card accelerated experience.

36
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,810
So that just means that when we go into rendered mode which you can very easily do here if we go to

37
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:53,750
our render a tab and switch that from rendering engine evey two cycles we'll be using the CPO now.

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,600
If this changes at some point and I haven't caught it please do reach out to me even in the Q and A's

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,210
or over on the forum or over on the Facebook group and let me know that blender is now working with

40
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,630
dedicated graphics cards on Macs I've not experienced that yet I've played with a couple of my friends

41
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:18,290
and colleagues Max as well and unfortunately they don't support GP you accelerated rendering without

42
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,570
multiple issues.

43
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,900
So that's it for this quick lecture on cycles on a Mac.

44
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,360
Hopefully things will improve over time but for the moment the best advice I can give you is to set

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,120
your device to CPSU when you're working on a Mac and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
