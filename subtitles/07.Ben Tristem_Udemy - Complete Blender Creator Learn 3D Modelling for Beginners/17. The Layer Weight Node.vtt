00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.230
Welcome to the label wait node.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.820
So what does the lay awake neighbourhood do.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.180
Well it's usually used for controlling the weighting of its shaders via the mix shader noted.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.860
Now is not to be said that it can't be used for other things as well if you want to get creative but

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.200
that is its typical use.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.470
And here we have just a simple no structure set up here we've got to shaders going into a make shader

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.330
and out to the material outputs and we've got the laser weight no sat there and we have two outputs

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:41.640
from the layer wait for now not Fresnel But for now and facing and we'll just explain those two outputs

9
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.190
and those would plug into the factor in order to control it.

10
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.790
So what does it do then.

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.640
Well the friend Nell output has a very sharp fall off and we'll see that in action in a few moments.

12
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.040
The facing output blends from one shade to the other in a more linear fashion.

13
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.240
Both do depend on the angle of incidence of the surface in relation to either the viewer or the camera.

14
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.770
When you're doing a rendering So let's go explore the layer weights now and hop on over in a blender.

15
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.310
Okay so we're over in blender here and the first thing I'm going to do since we're going to be using

16
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.020
three different set ups is create three objects to apply to.

17
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.620
So I got one kubal ready I'm going to duplicate that cube.

18
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.030
And I actually want snapping turned on with increments so I can literally just move it along the y axis

19
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.450
very easily.

20
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.230
When you duplicate that cube again and move it this side.

21
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.270
Finally I want to see what it looks like over a smooth surface as well so I'm going to add in a sphere.

22
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.530
So mash or just off I want to uv's Sphere.

23
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.040
Oh miss that they're so uv's Sphere.

24
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.760
There we go.

25
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.370
And I'm going to move that one back slightly and turn on smooth shading and then duplicated a couple

26
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.910
of times as well.

27
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.650
Okay so I've now got six objects and they're going to be ampere's with a mic shader a waiting for an

28
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.100
L and a waiting with facing.

29
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.160
Okay so let's go ahead and start setting that up sampling to switch this view or duplicate it and switch

30
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.520
over to rendered mode so I can see what's going on with shift and Z and I can see that the light isn't

31
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.950
uniform and we don't want any lighting effects on them Go here to the lamp properties and switch it

32
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.460
to a sun.

33
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.910
I'm going to click on use node saw it can increase its intensity too or maybe even three.

34
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.570
There we go.

35
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.030
Nice and bright.

36
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.620
Okay.

37
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.420
So we've got our six objects here.

38
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.560
And when I switched this top one over to a node editor and zooming.

39
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.450
So even I can't read that.

40
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.770
And we can see here we've got a mission.

41
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.750
We're on the lamps so let's click on one of the cubes and I'm going click use nodes here.

42
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.140
I could use the materials properties over here but I'm just going to click on use nodes and I'm going

43
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.170
to make one of these a pure green.

44
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.900
So that one there is pure green.

45
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.390
I'm going to duplicate that and make this next one a pure red.

46
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.900
Now in contrast to the last lecture where we were talking about absolute colours being a bit of a problem

47
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.370
in this case they're actually going to be a bit of a solution because they're going to enable us to

48
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.600
see what pure mixes end up doing.

49
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.940
For instance I would expect if I mix these two together with a 50/50 waiting it would be like having

50
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.580
red and green channels at 100 percent so we should end up with yellow looking just like this.

51
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.880
Let's see if that is what happened so let's turn all the red all the way back down the thread he says

52
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.380
not deciding which one.

53
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.050
So let's go ahead and add in a mix shade up and mix these two together.

54
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.000
And what do we get.

55
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.480
We get a yellow.

56
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.800
It's not quite as bright as the last one but it's a yellow which is what we were predicting.

57
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.930
So I'm going to minimize all dimming to get rid of the head a bar there.

58
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.400
I meant to pull this down a little longer to minimize these two shaders.

59
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.410
Now one thing to bear in mind when you minimize their licence small like this I'm going to move them

60
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.560
out of the way.

61
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.300
Now if you wanted to go back in and edit those at any one point if we expand this one here we can see

62
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.820
all.

63
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.410
It just covers up the one underneath it which is not so great.

64
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.130
So I'm going to keep the minimized any way and just bear that in mind if you do ever minimize them.

65
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.150
That if you maximize them again so you can see what's going on you may cover other ones up.

66
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.730
If you move them in they're minimized format to the funnel then we're going to do here is actually add

67
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.680
in a layer weight which is under the input menu layer weight.

68
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.730
And we're going to see that there.

69
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.380
Now when you're going to connect it at the moment because this material is just the mixing material

70
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.180
and I'm going to name it such so I know what's going on.

71
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.610
So that's mixing.

72
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.180
I'm now going to select the next Q belong which was the original cube and I'm going to make it unique

73
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.330
by clicking on the little three on the head of barnet's to mixing and I'm going to call this friend

74
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.210
Nell.

75
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.140
I want them a plug fat in as well to the factor.

76
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.930
And there we go.

77
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.770
Changed.

78
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.450
Now it looks more green than anything else but will mix be explore with that in a few moments time.

79
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.820
And this final one here we're going to make it unique.

80
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.190
Plug in the face seeing and call it facing as well.

81
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.250
So we know exactly what's going on.

82
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.200
So now we've named those we can see that it's had a different effect on all of these three cubes.

83
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.200
We're going to apply these materials now to these spheres as well so I'm going to click on the sphere.

84
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.990
Click on the materials here and change it to mixing.

85
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.190
This one here for a nail.

86
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.310
This one here I'm gonna set it to facing.

87
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.730
Now of course we could have done that all through the materials properties over here as well if we wanted

88
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.420
to see.

89
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.410
Okay so now we've got these three set up we can see hats.

90
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.150
It does look different depending on what's going on.

91
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.410
So let's start with the facing because that's the easiest one to understand.

92
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.060
If you're looking at it 90 degrees or as we call this zero if you're looking straight at the face you

93
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.060
get the bright green you get 100 percent green.

94
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.130
If you look at it from 90 degrees which is actually impossible.

95
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.730
If you look here from eighty nine point nine degrees and let's switch to orthographic projections huge

96
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.920
knots perspectives mucking around with us.

97
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.790
We can see the that's gone red.

98
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.960
You see that here in the spheres.

99
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.400
Most of all where the edge which is close to 90 degrees it falls off.

100
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.460
We get more of a red than the green.

101
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.040
And to put that in shader perspective if we look at the nodes themselves I think Green was the top one

102
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.310
and expand it to have a look yes.

103
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.700
So greens the top.

104
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:04.210
So when you're facing the surface you get the top shade and when you're at 90 degrees to the surface

105
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.990
you get almost the full bottom shade.

106
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.300
All the forborne shader of which are shooting facing now for a Nells not quite like fat let's make this

107
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.650
window bigger again.

108
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.980
Therefore a nail has a much sharper fall off and it doesn't go to 100 per cent either way so we can

109
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.760
see looking down directly around 90 degrees in fact just press a number pad 7 to do that we can see

110
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:34.270
there's a slight tonal difference in these greens and if we look at it from the side that side this

111
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.930
side we get a similar source of effect.

112
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:44.470
Now if I start rotating round ever so slightly You can also see that it's not it's not really red it's

113
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.550
more of an orange at that stage as well.

114
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.740
So there's never a 100 percent mix.

115
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.240
But the other thing that it does is now watch as I start to move around so that zoom in slightly so

116
00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.120
we can see this in more detail as I start to move around you'll notice that it falls off very quickly.

117
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.540
So let's go back again.

118
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.690
So it's almost almost hundred percent red there but not quite.

119
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.820
And as we move around it falls off incredibly quickly.

120
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.380
There's lots of use for this like.

121
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:19.460
How specular resurface happens to be when you view it at a certain angle so this is a great thing to

122
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:25.790
know when it comes to water because water is just like Fats if you look at it from one angle you can

123
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:31.200
almost see straight through it all or if you look at it from 90 degrees you can almost not.

124
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.110
And of course we can play with this.

125
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:38.450
It doesn't have to be diffuse shaders it could be a gloss shader it could be an emission shader try

126
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:45.520
mixing an air mission with a glass shade that produces some really cool effects.

127
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.920
And now we've explored this layer wait now.

128
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.920
It's time for a challenge.

129
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.670
Okay I'd like you to go ahead and have some fun.

130
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.360
Try different shades setups using the layaway.

131
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.640
No.

132
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.360
To control them.

133
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:07.490
One of my personal favourites is the glass and emission combination and also diffuse and transparent

134
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.160
can give some lovely soft edges.

135
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.390
Now once you've finished having some fun with the lay away.

136
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:13.920
No.

137
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:21.530
What I'd like you to then do is go ahead and finally apply this to your head between the rest of the

138
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:27.160
nodes that come through all those MC shaders and the final gloss shader itself.

139
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.100
Pause a video now and give that a go.

140
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.950
Okay guys welcome back.

141
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.570
Let's go have some fun over in blender.

142
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.900
Okay Sahib.

143
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.700
Want to show you.

144
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.090
That's really quick.

145
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:47.760
My favourite combinations so I'm just going to hijack all the work I've done so far.

146
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.270
Here an add in to shaders.

147
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:57.380
I'm going to add in the emissions shader and I'm going to add in a glass shader as well.

148
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.200
Just make this a bit bigger so I can see what's going on.

149
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.530
Or grab the wrong area.

150
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.430
Never mind.

151
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:11.100
Okay so let's add in these just as their standard glass and emission and I've got them wrong way round.

152
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.790
Let's swap them back.

153
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.160
Excellent.

154
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:19.230
So this is what it looks like when it's plugged in with facing this is what it can look like with the

155
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.960
for an L.

156
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.740
Pretty awesome.

157
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.780
And of course with the emission you can change the colour so whites with glass is going to be see through

158
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:33.490
of course but the emission itself we can have a really cool blue we can back off on the blend itself

159
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.460
up the top here and have well a glowing or.

160
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.670
How cool is that.

161
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.270
All look we can look through at the other optics or some stuff.

162
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.710
OK.

163
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.380
So let's go and play with my head.

164
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.160
Literally my head in my case.

165
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.430
Okay.

166
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.880
And I don't think I've applied any of my no jets.

167
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.540
I'm going to have to go ahead and set those up.

168
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.410
Oh no I haven't.

169
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.800
Case let's go ahead and sort that out so I've got a few space there and that will be use at one point.

170
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.170
We're going to have a girl losh shader lost CBS to air.

171
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.630
There we go.

172
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.730
And I don't want to pluck them together like this.

173
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.840
Bring that out.

174
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:28.660
We're going to want a couple of serf's sub surface scatterings as well so we're going to have a couple

175
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.530
of layers of those silhouettes duplicates.

176
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.940
That's popping up they're going to have another one mixed together.

177
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.080
Then we're going to have another one and then we're going to have a glossy as well so we're going to

178
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.250
have one two mix mix mix mix.

179
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:51.220
So quite a few mix shaders here so let's add one and blend them together amphicar going to have all

180
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.930
mccommon ones on.

181
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.380
Stop a moment.

182
00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:00.190
I'm struggling with screen space here so bear with me a few seconds when I saw that out.

183
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.520
Okay.

184
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.540
Let's get rid of that and move this across the wonders of working with a small screen.

185
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.500
Okay so we've got two subsurface scatterings.

186
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.220
They're going to be mixed.

187
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.040
Spot the mix at the top I think as we go each way.

188
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.880
Of course we could use the laser weight at various stages as well if we wanted to.

189
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:28.220
I am not going to do that however and duplicate them makes shader and duplicate the Make shayler and

190
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.130
duplicate the make shader.

191
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.990
That should give us a nice flow as we go through.

192
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:42.320
It is important when youre mixing things together that you do have a good idea of where they're coming

193
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.680
from and the flow with your notes as we can see here.

194
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:53.180
I've kept all the mic shaders on the top and all of these are mixing down as we go the glossy one we

195
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.560
want control the factor here with a layer weights node so let's go and do that.

196
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:05.260
Plug this into the outputs as well and input layer weights and pop that in as well.

197
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:11.000
Now which one of these I choose will depend on how it looks so ominous split this window now I've got

198
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.860
that roughly sorted out and I'm aware I need some colours don't I.

199
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.690
So will I need a deep dark red here but not 100 percent.

200
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:26.860
80s fine that's a bit of other colours to it and make it a little bit darker.

201
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.280
Let's make this one a little bit lighter.

202
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.000
I'm just going to pick some random colours.

203
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.640
This one even more.

204
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.160
Kate.

205
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.970
Perfect.

206
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.640
Now we've got these running through and I got a few sleigh of air as well.

207
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:47.140
That's absolutely fine for and might lighten that up as well because that's the real top of the skin

208
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.780
so that's not going to be very dark at all.

209
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.700
And again I'm not playing with these.

210
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.790
I'm just getting them roughly right and trying to get a perfect set up here.

211
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.660
I do need to adjust my radius so.

212
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.790
Not going to have 100 percent.

213
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:07.050
I'm going to have maybe 60 percent of the red coming through and the rest of it being absorbed.

214
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.990
So this is saying that most of the scattering will be the red lights.

215
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.870
The rest will be absorbed more readily.

216
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:22.370
And this is going to be similar but less so so this is what I would click on the right areas radius

217
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.860
here.

218
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.700
Some of them I have maybe 40 and 20 and 20 just using tap there to skip through them.

219
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:34.880
This last one is not going to be very much scattering ator as can be absorbed very quickly and point

220
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.670
1 and point 1.

221
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.860
Okay so that is coming through.

222
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.760
Absolutely fine to Vista there.

223
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.690
And let's hit the render button and see how this is looking.

224
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:53.780
So it's pretty glossy at the moment because it's a 50/50 gloss mix with the rest of it and I don't want

225
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.100
let's try for a nail to begin with.

226
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.910
Let's see how that looks.

227
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:05.660
Should now be glossy in only places that are facing is that right facing the camera.

228
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.800
Let's take the gloss out completely.

229
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.370
Kate's look Ashley that looks pretty good.

230
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.660
That was a good rough guess going around there.

231
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.910
Okay.

232
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:23.760
Glass only on mellops Try facing and of course we can change the factor as well.

233
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.940
Takes a couple of moments for these Sir runouts.

234
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.050
This is quite shiny.

235
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:34.980
Of course this glass will be mapped soon using basically a u v map with showing us where it's glossy

236
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.540
and where it's not raavan just having the whole thing glossy.

237
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.130
Okay.

238
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.590
And let's just try for an L again.

239
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.610
I've got a feeling that fanelle is going to be better for our application.

240
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:54.210
And I'm just going to knock this down to a point too so it's not so much of the gloss coming through.

241
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.050
I'm a little bit more actually.

242
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.410
Types in point two again.

243
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:11.300
Okay some going to have a look about through the camera and render that out so I can just see how it's

244
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.400
looking fully now for my render settings here because it's going to be a bit more detail I'm going to

245
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.750
up.

246
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.710
That's two hundred and of course here F 12 and let that render out.

247
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:28.190
Now because the resolutions are relatively low it's going to give us a rough idea of what's going on

248
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:28.910
now.

249
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:36.470
I like that that's a good good bit of sheen in places but not overpowering coming together really nicely.

250
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.890
How was yours getting on.

251
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.030
I hear you done a bit more modelling than I have done here.

252
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:45.170
So looks a bit more humanoid rather than mannequin at the moment.

253
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.800
We'll get there.

254
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.490
Worry.

255
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.680
And remember to share your work in the discussions.

256
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.690
Let's see how you guys are getting on.

257
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.510
And I will see you in the next lecture.
