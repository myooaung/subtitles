Hello everybody and welcome to this section where we're going to make a bowling ball and pins using
1

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,230
one of many methods you could do to do so.
2

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,200
Now we're going to start off by using a curve object to trace the outline of a pin and then convert
3

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,390
that curve object into a mesh object to finish off making our pins, We will play with a couple of material
4

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,830
properties as we go through to make sure that our pins are nice and shiny as they would be in real life.
5

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,550
We'll also stress the importance of reference material throughout this particular section, we're dealing
6

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,800
with real world objects.
7

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:42,040
It's important that we get them pretty accurate otherwise people spot the mistakes.
8

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,060
Now after we've made our bowling pin we're going to do our bowling ball and we're going to make that
9

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,540
using some new modelling techniques as well.
10

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,040
Now we're going to put those two blend files together into one.
11

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,020
We'll talk a little about scene management at this level and also then play with the blender physics
12

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,880
engine and smash that ball into those pins.
13

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,980
So I'm really looking forward to.
14

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,330
Hope you are as well.
15

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,970
So let's dive in and hop on over into blender.
