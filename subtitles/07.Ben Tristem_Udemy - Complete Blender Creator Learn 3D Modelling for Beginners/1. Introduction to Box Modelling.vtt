Hello everybody and welcome.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.690
It's a section two in this section it's one about box modelling which is very basic modelling and what
2

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.910
we're going to do unlike the last section where we're just playing around with moving primitives around
3

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.070
squashing and stretching them in this section we're actually going to go into those primitives and edit
4

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.120
them and create new geometry which will allow us to create unique shapes by the end of this section
5

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.020
we're going to make something along the lines of a Mayan pyramid so that you can practice those skills 
6

7
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.150
and we'll learn lots of neat little tips and tricks along the way.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.280
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.100
So let's go ahead and hop on over into blender.
