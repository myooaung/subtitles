00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,910
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,770
In this lecture we're going to learn a few know techniques to add a bit of where to the edges of our

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,070
lamp.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,940
As you can see here where it's a sharp edge it looks like it's been rubbed up against and is a bit worn.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,380
Now as a bit uniform but this is the start of experimenting with nodes and adding a bit more finesse

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,330
to your model.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,450
Let's go find out more Hello everybody and welcome in this lecture we're going to have this very simple

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,150
Warne effect working and in order to test it out we're going to do something slightly more complex than

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,900
a cube.

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,260
We're going to go and grab Suzanne once she's in the scene.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,780
We can start working now.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,060
I'm just going to split my view here so I can work with my shaders very quickly.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,690
There we go.

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,080
The shader editor I'm going to hide that's away.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to create a new material that will apply to Suzanne and then I'm going to change the material

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,900
name to warn.

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,130
Now that's I've done that I'm going to move these nodes just over to the right.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,800
So I've got this area on the left that I can play with.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,910
Now before we continue doing anything else there are a couple of things that we need to make sure that

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,580
we've got working.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,020
The first thing is the render mode needs to be set cycles.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,500
What I'm about to show doesn't currently work in TV.

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,070
It might do soon but it doesn't.

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,520
At the moment and then I'm going to change mine to GP you compute.

25
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,070
So doesn't slow down the recording and then finally we're going to add in the nodes that we want to

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,940
use.

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,720
So we're going to add in the geometry node and place that there.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,950
This is what's going to drive where we're detecting things being sharp vs. them being smooth.

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,920
And with that we can color it in.

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,270
So we do need to put our view over here of Suzanne into rendered most of the press the Z key because

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,480
I can't see the tools at the top and pick rendered now annoyingly the lights of our scene is not in

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,060
a great position so I'm going to look at this from above find our lamp and pull it in front of her for

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,930
the moment.

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,960
And now let's go back round.

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,520
Zoom in and because she's the only thing in the scene she's rendering quite quickly so I don't need

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,510
any render borders.

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,470
Now we've got that sets out.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,530
Let's plug in points in and see what we get.

39
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:14,780
OK.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,280
It does change the color but not in a meaningful way.

41
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,850
And the reason why we're plugging this straight into the base color is just to see what's going on.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,320
There are a few other ways more advanced ways later on that will look at previewing how things are working

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,340
but at the moment this is a great starting point.

44
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:39,190
The next thing that I want to do is add something between the geometry node and our shader node in order

45
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,140
to manipulate the data that we're getting out of the point in a sockets.

46
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,160
So let's go ahead and add in we've got a couple of choices.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,460
I'm going to search for brightness and contrast.

48
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:51,880
Here we go.

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,240
Let's go ahead and add that in and see what we get as increase the brightness.

50
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,960
We should expect it to go white.

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,530
But then you notice the insides of her ears and mouth and parts of her eyes are actually whiter than

52
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,210
others.

53
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,640
So this increase the contrast significantly.

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,300
Look at that.

55
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,050
So this some of these areas are getting darker than others.

56
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,830
So let's continue playing our look at that.

57
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,880
So now only the outside edges here the ones that are sharp enough have actually got any highlights to

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,750
them.

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,870
And that means what we can do is take the output from this brightness in color and use it to control

60
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,420
something else we can say where it's white.

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,860
We want this color and where it's black we want another color.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,390
And of course there's some blending it will be a mix in between.

63
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,640
That's a make this just a little bit more realistic especially since we're going to be working with

64
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:52,270
our lamp which has a higher poly count only to quickly subdivide our Suzanne's head here and you can

65
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,530
do that with her selected.

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:00,070
You can go control on one for one level of subdivision control two for two levels of subdivision etc..

67
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,480
And in this case I think that's enough.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:10,210
And I'm going to shade smooth now the first thing you'll notice here is that where we were before unfortunately

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,200
what we've currently got sets up no longer works.

70
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,760
And this is something that's really really important.

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,030
What I've just shown you is not the settings for it to work on every model.

72
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,790
You pretty much have to set this up either per object of a model or on the model as a whole.

73
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,280
If it's roughly proportional in terms of how sharp it is in various places.

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,270
So now we need to come back and we just need to tweak these settings a little until we have what we

75
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,670
want.

76
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,420
And I'm going to leave it quite broad like this and this is quite typical where the edges would naturally

77
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,980
be a bit more worn than somewhere that would come in contact with the outside world.

78
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,250
What can we do with that.

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:58,120
Well we can use its control a mixed node but before we do that I'm going to unplug from the base color

80
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,770
and just leave this over here.

81
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,470
We know that setup is roughly working.

82
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,070
I'm going to add in an input node of argy bargy.

83
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,500
We've already done that and I'm going to duplicate that for two colors among the set them as really

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,250
bright colors.

85
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:21,840
So maybe green and pink and now pink is going to represent one color and green is going to represent

86
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,540
another color and then we're going to mix them together.

87
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,190
So in order to do that we're going to have to mix and then we get two types of mixing.

88
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,370
We've got a mix shader and the mix are G.B. and in this case we do want to mix colors together not mixing

89
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,960
shaders together so we can put these in a logical order.

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,790
I'm going to bring them down here.

91
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,260
So we've got green on color one pink on color too.

92
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:52,900
And let's plug that in and we'll get a horrible murky gray and that's simply because of how when we

93
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,160
mix these together using the blend type just mix.

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,450
That's a it's the middle point basically of where these two are.

95
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,810
If I was to move this one round slightly would see or turn yellow.

96
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,830
If we move it towards the blue it'll turn cyan.

97
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,430
So there we go.

98
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,520
I'm going to leave it as pink vote because this will really stand out.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Let's set the factor which is what we will be controlling in a moment to zero.

100
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,350
So when it's zero.

101
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,630
So where it was black before we will have green and where it was white.

102
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,460
We should have pink.

103
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:36,240
Well let's plug in the output from our control into the factor and boom we've got exactly what we predicted.

104
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,490
Now obviously these are quite garish colors.

105
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,820
What you would probably want to do is change.

106
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,140
So say this was a painted bits of wood.

107
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,610
The pink wouldn't be great.

108
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,390
That's changed to a more wooden color.

109
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,800
And then let's not have green have a red or an orange or a yellow.

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,250
You know something else that really helps highlight sets.

111
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,530
And now of course this is when you can start tweaking as your is going to be looking different from

112
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,090
how it was previously you've now got the colors applied.

113
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,010
We can come in.

114
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,330
I'm going to hold down shift here.

115
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,840
I think that's important to make sure that you can change these settings very slowly and perhaps have

116
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,490
it just a little less worn.

117
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,520
And that adds to the rest of the model reasonably well it's hot.

118
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,400
Yes he is a don.

119
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,620
Yeah.

120
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,190
I'm liking how that's turned out.

121
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,230
So armed with this knowledge we've got to all G.B. notes the setting the different colors.

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,490
And we've got this controlling how the colors are applied to our model.

123
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:45,310
And this is the start of something that's incredibly powerful and can end up very very complex as you

124
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,370
can see the possibilities here are literally endless but without getting too carried away it's now time

125
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,860
for your challenge okay.

126
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,370
And I straightforward challenge for you add one edges to your lamp.

127
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,300
I'm only going to focus on the lamp shade and lamp base material.

128
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,470
However if you want to look at the other parts of your model as well.

129
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,650
Feel free to do that.

130
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,940
Paul's video now and give that's a go Hello everybody and welcome back.

131
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:19,510
Let's go ahead now hop on over into blender and create all worn edges Hello everybody and welcome back.

132
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,490
So let's go ahead and add a bit more interest especially to this bass part here looks a bit too clean

133
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,750
and a bit too new.

134
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,860
Let's make it a bit more.

135
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,820
Beats up says come out of here and go into the shading tab.

136
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm going to go into this one here and rename it again shading small because I forgot to do that last

137
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,640
time.

138
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,090
Here we go.

139
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,850
Shaving small.

140
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,610
And let's focus on our lamp.

141
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,880
I think it's already selected.

142
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,520
It is.

143
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:50,490
Bring this area up close down the properties panel and let's have a look at our model.

144
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,360
Go and select one of the areas that we want.

145
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,730
So at the moment we've got an R G.B. node controlling the color and we want a worn Archie B as well

146
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,560
so let's go ahead and duplicate that and say well where it's worn it's going to go through to the base

147
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,800
coat.

148
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,700
So those are two different colors that we want to use.

149
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,690
I'm going to minimize those and get them out of the way make them a bit smaller.

150
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Now what we want to do is mix these two together.

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,050
So we're going to need another type of node a mix.

152
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,590
RG B that we've explored R G B.

153
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,540
And here we mix Archie B.

154
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,530
Now I'm going to hold over the top of this one so automatically plugs in the top and then we've got

155
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,510
this bottom one as well.

156
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,980
Now at the moment it's only going to show us the color.

157
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm going to go into rendered mode here which is really important and zoom in on our base.

158
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,450
And I'm also gonna go control and B and just focus purely on the base itself.

159
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:46,850
There we go.

160
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,200
So it's gonna be nice and quick to render we need to control with this factor.

161
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,430
How much of the lower one which is a factor of 100 and how much of the upper one we want coming through

162
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,900
in order to do that.

163
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,430
Yes.

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,810
We've already explored it.

165
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,170
We're gonna go to another type of input now called the geometry nodes.

166
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,640
It's going to have a look at the geometry of our model.

167
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,790
When we've done that we want this one at the bottom.

168
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,360
The point in us now because our model isn't normal.

169
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,600
Rather doesn't have a lot of sharp edges to it.

170
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,790
We're going to have to adjust the points in a simple we just plug it in straight to the base color.

171
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,530
At the moment you'll see that we don't really get much variation over the surface so we need to add

172
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:33,460
a another node in between to make sure that we can control how these edges are displayed and we're going

173
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,690
to use that as a mask.

174
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,570
We're going to say whether it's white or whether it's whiter.

175
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,370
We're gonna have one color where it's black or darker we'll have the other one.

176
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,820
So let's go ahead and add in under the color menu a brightness and contrast.

177
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,950
That's probably the easiest one to play with.

178
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,990
There are several other ones that you could also use the color ramp springs to mind but we'll explore

179
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,670
the color ramp later on.

180
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,930
So now we've got that in place.

181
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,650
We can play with the brightness.

182
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,590
So we see we've made it all white.

183
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,630
And then we can up the contrast and see what happens.

184
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay.

185
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,500
So here we've got something coming through we've got areas of black and areas of white.

186
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,800
This is looking good so far but there's too much whites in this.

187
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,080
In this particular scene.

188
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,680
So let's see what happens if we take the contrast the other way.

189
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,480
That's kind of looking better.

190
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,830
Now we've got black around the edges.

191
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,110
By the looks of it.

192
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,890
Yes that looks pretty good.

193
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,120
So this is the important thing.

194
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,730
We're just playing now it doesn't look quite right at the very top pair.

195
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,860
We've got an entire surface that's gonna be what was going to end up essentially being worn.

196
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,430
So let's see if we can just tweak these figures here.

197
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:43,670
Now I'm using the shift key to control that so we can add a little more on the top here.

198
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,430
So that's looking a bit better.

199
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,800
Well let's see what this looks like when we plug it in to our mix.

200
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,060
No.

201
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:54,610
That's the important thing so let's plug the color output here into the gray factor.

202
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,650
So this is one of these moments here where we're actually plugging different colors together.

203
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,460
It's going to take the average of all of these.

204
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,230
When we plug it into a single value and then we can come out again.

205
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,640
Well first question is yes.

206
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,000
Here we go.

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,950
We've got our nodes the wrong way round.

208
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,860
So what simply we need to do here is click this top one put it into color 2 instead.

209
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,770
Well he says put that in color too.

210
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,770
And they will automatically swap around.

211
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,630
And here we go who starts to get somewhere on the edges.

212
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,570
Let's have a look at the top.

213
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,710
Ashley you know why I don't think tweaking this too much is going to make that much of a difference

214
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,930
if we lower the brightness there which just gets a bit too much Yeah I'm liking that.

215
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,300
There are some other things we can do to control it.

216
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,970
I do want to make sure we get some of the red coming through at the top here.

217
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:49,440
In fact one of the things we can do is open up this RG being node and actually add slightly redder form

218
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,180
of our gray.

219
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,220
So it looks like it's still got a bit of paint on it rather than just being this white a color that

220
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,420
we had before.

221
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,070
We have that looks much better now that we've got that in place.

222
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,270
I think we can actually increase the amount that we've got on the rest of our model.

223
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:19,750
Yeah that looks really nice.

224
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,970
Now one of the trickiest things about getting this right I'm almost there as far as I'm concerned with

225
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,900
a model is one of these this edge along here.

226
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,470
If we go into edit mode on that this particular edge loop here is just a bit too shallow to make it's

227
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,860
a tight weathered edge.

228
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,600
So if I scale that out ever so slightly.

229
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
Yes it's a bit more exaggerated there.

230
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,640
And now go in.

231
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,450
So we get an edge because it's sharper.

232
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,830
That is more worn.

233
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,360
And if we just scale that back in again you can see that the effect gets lost.

234
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,710
Now I can manipulate that so that we start to get a worn edge which is great.

235
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:04,510
And then perhaps on this part here make that less of an angle and then have the inside edge here worn

236
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,160
rather than both of them.

237
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,460
That is looking much much better.

238
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,180
Let's come out and have a look.

239
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,770
Yes.

240
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,710
I think that looks a ton better instead of having that really dark area at the top.

241
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,640
So a bit of a geometric change there to make our model look better but I'm happy with that overall now

242
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,040
because we've affected this material you know what it's also affected the lamp itself.

243
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,550
Brilliant.

244
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,810
It really does help highlight that edge that we've got inside our model.

245
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,920
Awesome.

246
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,560
How did you guys get on really looking forward to seeing your worn edged lamps please share your work

247
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,010
over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
