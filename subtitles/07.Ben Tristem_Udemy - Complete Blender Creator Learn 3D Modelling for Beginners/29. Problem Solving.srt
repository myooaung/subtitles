00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,400
A guy's welcome to problem solving in this video.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,640
You will realize that starting again is sometimes the best option.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,910
So a little background story here.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,790
I was busy reorganizing my parts.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,010
I accidentally did something and the whole scene just fell apart on me.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,490
And I had a choice at that point do I try and fix the problem or do I just put all the pieces back together

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,010
again.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:38,010
It turns out that after I made my changes to my nave that I had a problem with the scale and position

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,550
of a lot of the other bits of my model.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,480
So in essence starting again was actually the best option because trying to move everything else subtly

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,200
in between was just not an option.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,830
So we're going to see that even the well prepared scenes can be broken by subtle changes.

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:03,580
Now we're going to get help with problems that you may have run into when making your building as well.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,370
So what we'll do now is hop on over into a blender and just go through some of the annoyances that I

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,950
had during the construction of my building especially with modular parts.

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,860
There won't be a specific challenge in this section but I would like you to share the challenges and

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,370
production methods that you've gone through so we can all share our group knowledge and help each other

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,630
out when it comes to constructing more complex items from individual parts.

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,970
So let's hop over into a blender.

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,960
Okay so I have started a brand new blender far here and reimported all of my pieces.

21
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,410
What happened that made it go horribly horribly wrong is that at some point during the construction

22
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:57,460
I had hopped into edit mode on my pieces and the origins had moved and the alignment was no longer working

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,030
as it should have done.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,920
And when you hop in to edit mode and move your piece you're moving it in it's own local space which

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,620
of course means that when you hop out of edit mode all of the other pieces that are linked to that one

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,980
also move and your whole scene falls apart rather than trying to fix that problem.

27
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm going to build myself a new church with my new pieces and put it all together whilst we're thinking

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,110
about how it's constructed.

29
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,180
One of the things we need to take into account is how the pieces actually interact.

30
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,540
You can see here yes they are still only linked models haven't made them proxy yet but we can see where

31
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,210
the corner piece intersects with these other pieces.

32
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,160
We've got a graphical glitch going on.

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,370
Now one of the ways of making sure that you avoid graphical glitches like the one in front of us and

34
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:55,330
tiling problems in general is to either create parts as a whole which is difficult because I like the

35
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,180
idea of having modular.

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,680
One of the other things we can do is force the issue.

37
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,050
And what I mean by that is making this corner piece an action bigger slightly.

38
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,790
Then the pieces joined to and that introduces a natural break in the image in the actual geometry itself.

39
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,930
And we don't end up with any overlapping which means if we do need to push apart inside another part

40
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,720
for whatever reason that it's not going to cause a graphical corruption.

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,340
So for instance this one here has this funny hash here some scanner save the file that I'm working on

42
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,850
now in the corner pieces of I got a short cut to it.

43
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,710
No I haven't.

44
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,920
Let's go to the corner.

45
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,880
What I can do here.

46
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,000
Is hop into edit mode and actually pull these faces out slightly.

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,670
So I'm going to extrude.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:01,390
I want both of those faces and group strood here by point one doesn't have to be much.

49
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,440
Now this is speculation of how it's going to look but I'm going to be mean about it and try to extrude

50
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,690
this way by point one.

51
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,550
Okay so now the kormos ever so slightly bigger than anything that surrounds it.

52
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,140
I haven't changed the origin or anything else of this model.

53
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,900
Hop out.

54
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,820
That looks okay so far.

55
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,100
And let's go ahead and save it.

56
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:30,770
Now when we hop back in to our Gothic church in new we see that it's all somatically creates this little

57
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,490
ridge.

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,930
Now I can see straight away of it matched up in that way it's going to ruin the door because we got

59
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,670
the door in the window on top of one another there.

60
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,110
But this piece itself is now if we push another bit of geometry into it like a plain wall piece is not

61
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,590
don't complain at least not on this side.

62
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,660
Now we've got to think about the other side which is also going to have some graphical corruption.

63
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:00,350
Of course we want to make these changes subtle and not make them so they stand out too much.

64
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:07,610
So one of the other things we can do here and it will vary from model to model is opening up our corner

65
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:15,340
piece again this is one of our structural pieces is actually taper these outer edges in.

66
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,100
So it's.

67
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,400
So there will be a slight warp in me in the surface itself.

68
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:30,840
So if we grab this edge here and we're snapping turned on let's and merge vertices turn on and all.

69
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:38,750
If we snap to a vertex I should be able to bring it all the way in and then that will look like that

70
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,380
from the top.

71
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,680
This is its profile and I'm hoping that's going to look at and again this is all about lean production

72
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,150
We've spotted a problem.

73
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,660
We're going to try and fix it in creative ways or useful ways.

74
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,920
So we've also got the issue on the inside as well.

75
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:03,950
Now I am going to grab the face here extrude by point one I'm using Point one here as an example it

76
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,640
doesn't have to be of course.

77
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:14,400
And I'm going to push that corner back into itself so I'm going to move it to there and do the same.

78
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:22,160
This face here in the extrude it will have hit by mistake and then extrude it by point one and then

79
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,000
push this edge that we can't see if I can select it even through a model.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,810
Note the Happer hop a wire frame to do that and then try and get the right one so that one there.

81
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,140
All this is this is more tricky when you've got it are going to have to do the whole operation in wire

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,080
framed so that sume in here and see if we can find the right one.

83
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,780
We're going to move it to that point there.

84
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,820
Okay so now let's have a look around our model in object mode.

85
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,900
It looks okay looks slightly wonky from the top but that's okay.

86
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:59,750
It will be slightly one key and that should help us when it comes to corner pieces.

87
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,310
Now I don't know how it's going to look it might look absolutely atrocious in which case back to the

88
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:10,730
design board and we'll remodify it but this will stop me having too many artefacts.

89
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,860
Of course if I push something in into this model so I want a shorter corner piece.

90
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,880
The issue will still be there be there that there will be a tiny ridge here so that doesn't quite solve

91
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,450
that issue.

92
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,270
So anyway enough of me speculating let's see what it's like in action.

93
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,670
So back into here and that looks fine from the outside.

94
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,030
And looks fine from the inside as well.

95
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,620
It's no longer going on top of one another in fact that way it looks like I've skewed it the wrong way.

96
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,570
I wasn't thinking Oh no this is why hopping backwards and forwards is very powerful.

97
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,610
I've put a lip in when I didn't want to let.

98
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,350
I've moved them in the wrong way.

99
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,370
Silly my silly silly silly.

100
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,730
So of course we can go back and correct that and I'll go and do that now and then I'm going to reconstruct

101
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:06,500
my model because of the fatal error I did earlier where I moved one of these in edit mode and it caused

102
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,220
the whole scene to fall apart i literally destroyed my church in a few clicks.

103
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,010
The other thing that changed the fundamental design of the church was the vault itself.

104
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,980
I didn't realise quite how this would modify the scene that I'm working on.

105
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,200
As you can see here it's slightly wider than the other one.

106
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,980
This is where the pillars of the church are going to be sat.

107
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,500
And because of the width of it's changing ever so slightly it cause the rest of the model to need to

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:43,010
be have a rebuild anyway compounded with the problem that I created last pose I created the vault as

109
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,290
well.

110
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,990
But compounded with that problem it's going to be far quicker to just reconstruct my church in a very

111
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,160
similar manner to how it was before.

112
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,090
So welcome back.

113
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,500
And I'm in the middle of constructing my tower piece at the moment I just want to show you a really

114
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,230
quick way probably already know about this but might not be doing it.

115
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:09,600
So I'm going to hold down g and Z and then hold down Shift and move that up to a micro blender unit

116
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,520
so then point ten of a blender unit and I'm going to duplicate this again and move it up on the said

117
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:23,870
axis and then up another two and obviously I'm doing some micro adjustments here as I go just to make

118
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:31,550
sure that everything is aligned properly or it's got to duplicate it to GZ up to their GZ.

119
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,550
I didn't need to do that twice.

120
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,370
So I'm happy with that being four stories here.

121
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,580
I can select this and move it down so it's covering up the right.

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,590
There we go that's roughly in the right place.

123
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

124
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,150
So now that's constructive.

125
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,780
But that looks well silly.

126
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:53,900
So now I've got all the basic pieces in place and you can do this not only with these are used blank

127
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,300
walls and then put wind where I used blank walls I could put a door in here and windows down here.

128
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
But now I have done that I'm going to select my blank wall piece which is over here and make sure it's

129
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,120
the active object and of course go control L and make links to the object data and they go replace all

130
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,860
of those parts very quickly.

131
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,940
So you can build up a basic building block very quickly and then just substitute the parts in providing

132
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,050
they all match.

133
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,630
Brilliant.

134
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,620
Now just got to make the rest of the church.

135
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,550
So you guys in a bit.

136
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,350
Okay so finally after moving lots and lots of bits about and making sure they're looking nice in this

137
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,970
hierarchy over here.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,290
So then I can turn off individual parts of the church as I am when it's necessary.

139
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:48,050
It's all come together rather well and much better than the first attempts at it.

140
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,140
And it's taken a couple of hours to get to this point with all the tweaking and moving and the additional

141
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:01,210
parts I've utilized a right angle triangle to make a roof section going along there and here and over

142
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,560
on this side.

143
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:08,740
I've got a right angle triangle just there so that when we're inside the church let's go to fly around

144
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,720
mode.

145
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,200
We can actually have a decent line coming in and not a square like it was just using a wall piece previously

146
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,710
