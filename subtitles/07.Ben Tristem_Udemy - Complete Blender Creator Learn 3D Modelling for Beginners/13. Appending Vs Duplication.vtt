Hello everybody and welcome.
1

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.560
In this lecture I'd like to have a look at appending versus duplication and see about the implications
2

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.450
when you're building up a scene made of multiple models.
3

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.400
Which one you should go for.
4

5
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.540
And of course there's always going to be more than one way.
5

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.630
So basically we have two main options.
6

7
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.700
We can either have separate files or everything in one blend file.
7

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.860
We don't really want to mix up the two concepts in this case.
8

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.770
So we're gonna pick one or the other.
9

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.140
And of course if you decide to pick a different one to what I'm doing in the course that's absolutely
10

11
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.520
fine.
11

12
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.220
Well one of my big questions is where are the materials stored.
12

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.900
So at the moment we haven't even touched textures.
13

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.400
However our models this time round will eventually get textures on them.
14

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.560
But the question is how are those textures applied.
15

16
00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.550
In this case they're going to be very simply applied rather than being UV mapped to our model.
16

17
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.690
We'll talk about that type of mapping later on in the course.
17

18
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.350
But for the moment we just want our models to look a little bit better.
18

19
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.700
So one of the big questions is where are material stored my thought on this is to have it in the final
19

20
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.890
file so when we start assembling everything together we have everything all in the final file.
20

21
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.720
Now that's a good way of looking at it because whether or not you've got your separate files or everything
21

22
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.410
in one blend file that will be your final file when you bring it all together whether that's in an individual
22

23
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.720
file or those separate objects.
23

24
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.940
So one of the big questions here.
24

25
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.190
Let's hop on over into blender. Okay.
25

26
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.460
So here we go we're over in the chess piece base it's coming together relatively well and I think the
26

27
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.670
base is pretty much complete and we just need to change it for every other model it's currently called
27

28
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.490
cylinder now slap on my wrists for leaving it as that but I'm just going to call it base for the moment.
28

29
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.170
There we go.
29

30
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.110
And the camera and lights I'm going to remove that from the scene altogether.
30

31
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.840
I'm not going to render out my stuff any more until we get to a final scene.
31

32
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.640
And I'd like to stick to modelling to begin with and then come back and texture them later on.
32

33
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.970
And I think that's looking pretty good.
33

34
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.570
The only other thing that I would say at this point is that the base is not low poly it's very much
34

35
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.120
high poly at the moment before we progressed any further is the subdivision surface modifier.
35

36
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.620
So we have the modifier over on the left and we can turn it off during rendering, we can turn it off
36

37
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.450
in the viewport, we can turn it off in edit mode on and off in that mode and this adjust cage to modify
37

38
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.110
a result if we go into edit mode we can see we can turn that on and off and also adjust the bounds the
38

39
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.190
original shape.
39

40
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.570
So it sucks a bit closer to this one.
40

41
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.930
And of course if we do turn it to low poly you see there's an immediate problem there that we've currently
41

42
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.660
adjusted our model as if it was a high poly model.
42

43
00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.850
So with that in mind when we turn it off suddenly the model goes out of bounds and ends up being Well
43

44
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.590
if we look at that.
44

45
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.780
That's not how we want the piece looking.
45

46
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.240
It needs to be closer to that and we will need to do that before we either start duplicating this or appending
46

47
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.820
it into new scenes because if we just leave it as it is.
47

48
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.040
Well we've got a problem on our hands because we're going to have to undo and change a lot of things
48

49
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.430
in multiple models and we want to make sure that this base is right from the word go and I'm going to
49

50
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.400
do that now rather than leaving it and forgetting about it.
50

51
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.830
So I'm going to grab my base here and I'm going to delete the subdivision surface modifier.
51

52
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.230
I'm gonna go ahead and grab this edge loop here and bring it into the right place and I'm going to do
52

53
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.070
the same to this one but there needs to be brought in a lot.
53

54
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.030
And then this one as well.
54

55
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.670
Okay so a few tweaks later I'm going to lift that one up and scale it out slightly.
55

56
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.550
Yeah I'm happy with some of these changes bring that in.
56

57
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.030
There we go.
57

58
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.150
So I'm happy with everything now I think my base is now ready to do whatever I want to do with it.
58

59
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.720
So I got to make sure I save my work.
59

60
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.110
This is the base and then we've got to think about starting to create the other pieces that are based
60

61
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.250
upon this base.
61

62
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.660
And for that it's time for your challenge.
62

63
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.380
Okay.
63

64
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.980
It's time for your challenge consider how you're going to make your project, individual blend files?
64

65
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.890
That's one option we've discussed, all in one file?
65

66
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.990
That's another possibility.
66

67
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.650
Where will you store your multi-user material.
67

68
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.000
So if you've got a material for the white pieces and a material for the black pieces, How are you going  to make
68

69
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.580
sure that if you update one of those it's going to reflect across multiple objects?
69

70
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.380
Does it even matter at this point if you're going to assign them in the end file when you put everything
70

71
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.460
together?
71

72
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.300
These are questions that you will ask on a per project base all the time and there is no right or wrong
72

73
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.060
way.
73

74
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.630
And perhaps discovering a mistake if you've chosen one way or the other during this particular lecture
74

75
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.950
will be a great learning experience moving forward.
75

76
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.650
And then you've made these decisions whether it is a new file or within the same blender file create your
76

77
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.520
pawn piece and what I'd like you to do is go all the way to a full creation so take that base piece
77

78
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.870
duplicate it append it into a new blend file and then from there create the low poly pawn piece.
78

79
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.770
It doesn't have to be precise at this point there's some fine tuning that we're going to do over the
79

80
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.170
next couple of lectures as well.
80

81
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.870
And then finally I'd love to know why you decided to do it that way so please do share in the discussions
81

82
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.360
your methodology how you felt about the project and why you've done it in the way that you've done it
82

83
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.420
often explaining the process to other people helped solidify in your mind the process you're going to
83

84
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.790
do pause video now and give that a go
84

85
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.510
Hello everybody and welcome back.
85

86
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.710
Let's hop on over into blender and start making our pawn piece. Hello and welcome back over into blender.
86

87
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.270
So before we do anything else I do want to make sure that this is ready for duplication because what
87

88
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.530
I don't want to do is have to redo a lot of work on multiple pieces.
88

89
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.260
Now what I am going to do is I'm going to keep these as separate files because I wants to be able to
89

90
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.010
append them all in and practice that skill.
90

91
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.320
You could just duplicate this as a new object within your scene.
91

92
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.000
Ah that's the other thing I haven't done shade flat.
92

93
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.450
Okay.
93

94
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.840
Because I want this faceted look and now that I can see that it's flat.
94

95
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.190
I'm going to come in and make this just a little bit narrower as well save my work.
95

96
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.620
Brilliant.
96

97
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.480
So I have my chess piece base ready to go.
97

98
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.140
I'm gonna go file and save as.
98

99
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.040
And I'm gonna call it the pawn.
99

100
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.290
So P A W N there we go.
100

101
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.600
And chest piece base.
101

102
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.850
Okay.
102

103
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.790
So we've got the board the chess piece base so all of these things can be brought in later on into one
103

104
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.930
scene.
104

105
00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.530
Right.
105

106
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.070
So we've got at the top here it's called pawn.
106

107
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.600
We know that that's there.
107

108
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.250
So it's now time to start going into edit mode and going to select my face at the top.
108

109
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:17.430
And once that face is selected whizz round to the side and just extrude up now I could extrude up scale
109

110
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.990
in extrude up scale out slightly or I could put some loop cuts in and then scaled that's up later on
110

111
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.350
I'm going to go all the way to the top here and I am going to loop cut this slightly lower down and
111

112
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.680
make it wider.
112

113
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.410
So there we go we've got the the basics going on there.
113

114
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:43.380
Now this top piece here I'm not going to try and extrude a sphere that's gonna be crazy but what I can
114

115
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:49.830
do is whizz round to the side bring up my tool shelf with the tool shelf open I'm going to click on
115

116
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:56.070
cursor and place it roughly in the right place and then go to my side bar over here and put the X and
116

117
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:04.320
Y coordinates at zero, I'm then going to add a new bit of mesh data UV sphere it's going to be huge
117

118
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.130
and I'm going to open up the operator panel because these segments and rings are important I'm gonna
118

119
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:15.320
make this eight and I'm going to make my rings probably eight as well.
119

120
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:21.240
The radius is currently one metre it's probably more like 10 centimeters so let's type in 10 C.M. and
120

121
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.110
press enter.
121

122
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.490
Okay.
122

123
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.820
It's gonna be smaller than that.
123

124
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.170
Let's try.
124

125
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.730
Oh blimey.
125

126
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.400
Yes of course its 2cm, almost one?
126

127
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:30.890
Okay.
127

128
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.090
That's close enough that we can now tweak it.
128

129
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.430
Now the reason of course I picked eight segments and I'm not going to move anything yet so I can still
129

130
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.600
tweak these things.
130

131
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.980
But why I've picked eight segments.
131

132
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.330
You'll notice it aligns with the rest of our objects which is gonna be really important.
132

133
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:52.420
So it looks like it is part of the same object four I think is a bit too low five or six.
133

134
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.900
I'm going to go for six and finally I'm gonna hold down shift whilst I click and move.
134

135
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.610
So I can adjust this accordingly.
135

136
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:00.910
Okay.
136

137
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.020
That looks pretty good.
137

138
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:10.970
I'm going to bring this edge down slightly I think I think I need to bring this up just a little bit
138

139
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.440
further so if I select the face on the top here.
139

140
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:20.000
If you leave the 3D cursor selected on and you click everywhere and move the 3D cursor you know you've
140

141
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.210
not turned selecting back on so let's turn on selection.
141

142
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:32.680
You can also use the W key for that and I'm going to extrude this up by a little on the Z axis, whizz
142

143
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.030
round to the side and just scale that in there we go.
143

144
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.140
Something along those lines I think.
144

145
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.440
Perfect so it's not a perfect join as it comes together here but we can sort that out shortly.
145

146
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.470
I'm going to hide my image at the back so I can have a good look around my model looking pretty
146

147
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.810
sweet.
147

148
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:58.190
We've also got these edges that have been defined as well that they're not important at the moment but
148

149
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.320
we might have to redefine them later on the reason why they're these and these and that one and that
149

150
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.960
one are all pink is because we used that information when extrudeing.
150

151
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.590
So it's something to bear in mind when you are extruding.
151

152
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.120
If you've already got an edge.
152

153
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.200
Go to the edge select here.
153

154
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.720
That's got a crease applied to it when you extrude it.
154

155
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:22.880
The new geometry will inherit that crease as well and obviously other options were applied to those
155

156
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.560
edges.
156

157
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:29.150
So I know we wouldn't need it here necessarily so it might be worthwhile turning that crease down although
157

158
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.800
if we're sticking with a low poly model it probably doesn't matter either way.
158

159
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:42.980
Okay so that is my pawn pretty much sorted ah naming and we need to make sure that the object itself
159

160
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:48.460
the name is a pawn and we've got the image it's fine.
160

161
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.690
I think we're done and dusted in it's the right size and scale in everything so we just save our file
161

162
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.250
and there we go.
162

163
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.860
Brilliant.
163

164
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.100
I'm happy with the results of mine.
164

165
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.010
Are you happy with how you also coming along really looking.
165

166
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.110
Please share your pawns over in the discussion and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
