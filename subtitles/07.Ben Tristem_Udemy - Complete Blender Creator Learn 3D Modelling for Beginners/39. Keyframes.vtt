00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.820
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.710
In this lecture we're going to talk about key frames key frames are going to enable us to create an

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.480
animation very similar to this.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.730
I've got a few other tweaks in here as well.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.880
And you can see it runs with Look Dev as well.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.240
And it will work kind of with cycles but we can't really play about that back in real time.

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.270
So when we're assessing animation will often use something that's a bit quicker to see even though we

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.170
won't see the full final render as it would be in cycles.

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.970
So let's hop over and find out more okay.

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.800
So we're starting in the default scene at the moment because I don't want to ruin my current lamp setup.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.230
I know I can revert back.

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.300
But also this is a much cleaner environment to work with if you don't have your timeline at the bottom.

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.030
You can make it appear that make it disappear by just describing one of the lower corners and perhaps

14
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.670
bringing up a never throw the editor and switching it across to an A.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.360
It's in the animation column the timeline.

16
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.700
There's also an animation section at the top here workspace that you can switch over to if you want

17
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.180
to.

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.170
Now because we got well because personally I have very minimal space on my screen I'm quite happy using

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140
what I've got in front of me here.

20
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.250
So key frames what are they.

21
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.720
Well they're a recording of where something is at a moment in time.

22
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.450
So for instance if I was to open up the properties sidebar here we've got our location our rotation

23
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.410
and our scale.

24
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.120
But key frames aren't just limited to that.

25
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.000
Pretty much everything in Blender can be key frames.

26
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.320
There are some limitations though it won't affect everything but nearly everything can be.

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.400
So for instance here if I wanted to add a key frame to the location to say this is where the cube starts

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.320
when we press play well we can hover over this area and press the Iki or we can right click and insert

29
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.280
key frames and underneath we have a little extra so we can insert a single key frame so I right click

30
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.900
on The X column I can insert a single key frame.

31
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.950
So what happens if I just hover over this section here and press I the whole lot goes yellow.

32
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.450
Now the moment I move the cube elsewhere you notice it will go orange indicating that the information

33
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.900
there is different from what it is on the current key frame.

34
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.920
So if I was to move the play head to somewhere else and come back again it won't remember where it was

35
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.940
previously.

36
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.490
And that's something that will catch you out from time to time.

37
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:46.470
You'll move that say to frame 40 you'll move your cube to somewhere else that you want it to move from

38
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.500
and to and you'll go Oh yeah that's good.

39
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.510
And then you'll click elsewhere and it will snap back to the beginning.

40
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.060
So it's incredibly important.

41
00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.570
Just bear in mind that's when you move your cue ball rotate it or scale it.

42
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.950
Let's do this now let's press G move the cube.

43
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.240
Then we go over to the area that we want to key and press eye.

44
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.920
And there we go.

45
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.920
That is now key.

46
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.480
Then what happens when we play this back.

47
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.840
Well let's go back to the beginning.

48
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.940
We're going to jump back to the very beginning of the animation and press play and there we go.

49
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.530
We've started to animate something.

50
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.360
Now one of the things that often catches me out is let's say on frame 40 we wanted to rotate it on the

51
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.900
y axis by a number 61 degrees.

52
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.660
There we go and we go in key that's in.

53
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.960
The problem is we never keyed in a starting frame.

54
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.420
So when we go back to frame one it's not going to automatically rotate round.

55
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.680
So that's something just bear in mind that's if you're planning on doing a rotation a location in the

56
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.810
sky or even any of the other parameters we have in blender that you can key in and you can also do this

57
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.940
with materials and so many things.

58
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.230
It's incredibly powerful.

59
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.500
You can get up so it's always good it's a key in the starting value before you start tweaking anything

60
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.280
else.

61
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.670
So for instance in this case I knew it was 0 0 0 7 I can key that all in and then when I press play

62
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.480
is going to both rotate and move at the same time.

63
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.830
So that set basically and you can add more and more keys in.

64
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.040
Now ideally you don't want a key.

65
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.040
Every frame that would make your animation quite jerky you'd see here placing key frames at specific

66
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.130
points will make your animation very smooth.

67
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.260
However what can happen is you might end up with pieces of your model passing through others because

68
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.290
you're not explicitly controlling it between these two points you're literally saying between here and

69
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.890
here interpolate between these two positions.

70
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.060
And we'll talk about the graph editor in a bit which says how it makes that movement.

71
00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.420
And at the moment we're dealing with the timeline and shortly the dope sheets as well where we really

72
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.820
are looking at when things are happening.

73
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:12.090
Finally here on the timeline itself if you wanted to let's say this is the cube cube object transformations

74
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.220
faster the left click on those I can move them earlier or later.

75
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.410
That's incredibly useful because what that means is I can adjust the speed of an animation as we get

76
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.840
to the lamp actually jumping.

77
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.310
You will find that where you thought things should be you might need to make it a bit shorter.

78
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.090
Let's say you're jumping up you go up in that arc.

79
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.850
He reached the high point you slowed down at that point then you come back down again and you're probably

80
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.020
going to get the timing of that wrong the first time round.

81
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.210
But armed with this knowledge of inserting key frames it's time for you to make your first pass at animating

82
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.680
your lamp and your challenge is to animate your lamp.

83
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.230
Now we're not going to do a full animation at this point.

84
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.580
I want you to focus on broad movements not focusing on detailed movement at all.

85
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.230
Focus on those major movements.

86
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.880
Where's your lamp going to be.

87
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.770
How is it going to jump up.

88
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.140
Remember we're animating impose mode when we do this except sliding and passing through other objects.

89
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.750
If that happens that's going to be tidied up as we start processing the animation as we go through the

90
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.950
next couple of lectures Paul's video now and give that a go

91
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.630
Hello everybody and welcome back.

92
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.630
Let's go ahead now hop on over into blender and start the animation of our lamp.

93
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.080
Okay so let's go ahead and open up our animated lamp.

94
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.240
So this is where we left off before.

95
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.240
And I want to make the broad movements to the base.

96
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.230
I'm going to make sure that that's selected.

97
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.090
Of course we do want to make sure that we're back at frame one.

98
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.500
It's very tempting to go all the way back to zero.

99
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.710
Now there are a couple of ways of getting all the way back that you may have noticed if you hover over

100
00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.950
here.

101
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.390
You can shift and left arrow and it will take you there.

102
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.900
You can also just type in number one here.

103
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:13.950
Now I'm going to do the broad movements here and I'm probably not going to have these markers that that

104
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.230
to me doesn't feel right.

105
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.740
The landing is probably going to be much closer and the crash landing may be a bit closer as well.

106
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.600
I don't I don't know at the moment and the jump we're going to crouch down we're going to jump up I

107
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.450
think and take it from there but I'm going to look from the side and I'm going to say well start with

108
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.760
let's set the location and the rotation.

109
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.630
I'm definitely not scaling.

110
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.370
So that's okay and I'm going to work just on the base for the moment.

111
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:46.400
So let's say we were going to jump we might ROP ords or backwards would we might rock backwards.

112
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:53.630
So I'm going to rotate this round ever so slightly just a bit subtly and I need to make sure that I'm

113
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:59.330
going to go g z the press said twice to just lift it up says rocking on the back here.

114
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.910
Now there's a better way of doing that.

115
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.690
Let's just keep those in because I'm going to rock to the front.

116
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.050
Now I'm going to use the 3d cursor to do so.

117
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.110
Although now we're in the middle it probably be absolutely fine to just go like that.

118
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.030
Okay.

119
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:21.350
So I was just thinking that if I had said to the 3d cursor I could have easily pivoted it up but then

120
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.290
moving the 3d cursor back might not have worked.

121
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.220
It would have only worked at the moment because I'm in the center of my scene.

122
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:36.110
I did accidentally key in quick turning on then so I'm going to right click and delete that key frame

123
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.540
clear key frames.

124
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.280
By the way we'll clear all key frames that you have used.

125
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.690
So do be careful with that one.

126
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.780
So at this point we're going to rock forward.

127
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:53.360
See is flying at that point so that is an issue as it's going across here really needs a mid point where

128
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.010
we're back down on the ground.

129
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:01.240
So jeez that said the lower that back down key that's in and keep the rotation as well.

130
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:10.090
So now we're the back foot and then we're going to jump up and I don't know jumping around here and

131
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:16.630
we're going to make an arc something like that to land if we probably do with it being a bit closer

132
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.950
but we'll run with what we've got at the moment so we can to lift this up.

133
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.260
I'm going to put it all the way up there.

134
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:29.740
We're probably going to be a bit more tilted forward and key those in than the landing let's say it's

135
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.690
going to be about their move it down for a tight round.

136
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.970
That's key those in.

137
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.750
And again this is rough and ready at the moment.

138
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.580
And then of course we're going to rock forward.

139
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.700
That's probably going to be a bit of sliding here.

140
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:50.190
But that's that's also OK because this is something that is going to be sliding isn't it because we're

141
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:58.420
going to suddenly I'm going to slide this off ever so slightly so and I do that it's going to take a

142
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.090
little longer to get to the edge.

143
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.150
And I know exactly what the pivot point will be

144
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:12.840
about their as you can see this this process is a little bit repetitive.

145
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:21.240
And then the crash landing it's going to fall off hit the ground for a tight round come up a little

146
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.030
yes something like that.

147
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.470
So that's a reasonable stance.

148
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.500
Let's just play that through and see how we're looking we're going to jump up land.

149
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:37.440
Now obviously there's a bit slide in that and then we're gonna fall off and that's a really subtle falling

150
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:37.760
this.

151
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.190
That's not very quick at all so let's see if we can just drag that back.

152
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:47.760
So get to the edge and improve it too quick so we can start tweaking now and moving these key frames

153
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:54.930
about now I'm trying to do the rotation and the movement in one go if nothing else for my own sanity.

154
00:10:54.930 --> 00:11:01.040
So not not got tons and tons of key frames to move around they're all happening at the same time.

155
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.090
That's not necessarily the way you would do all animations.

156
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.600
It's just cutting corners at the moment.

157
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.760
Right now we go through and we can do the top bit of the lamp so we grab the control bone and then we're

158
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:22.810
going to animate that now we've lost the other markers here but we can run through that is fine because

159
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.150
this is going to be an independent.

160
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.770
So we've got it shifting back so we're going to key in our starting position because if we don't do

161
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.900
that we'll lose the information.

162
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:39.010
So we've got a moment here if at this point we've got all of the other key frames where happening so

163
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:46.420
I'm going to press G and just move this back saying we press the Y I think that can go much further

164
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.550
back actually because of the limitations we put on it.

165
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.590
So that's fine.

166
00:11:52.930 --> 00:12:01.140
And then here I'm going to skip the other key frame and I'm going to start to stretch this out maybe

167
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:06.950
and tuck up ready for the jump yes we get.

168
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.120
And then the jump itself.

169
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.380
We're going to stretch out at this point.

170
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.890
Key that's in.

171
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.860
And as we start just going through the process against it we're going to land here.

172
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:26.960
Obviously going to be back that's key that's in here.

173
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.450
We're leaning further back.

174
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.220
I'll keep pressing a lots of keys here and we don't want it twisting through itself.

175
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.310
This is one of the issues if he popped your controls a little bit too close to the model you can end

176
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.840
up with it flipping round.

177
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:47.000
In fact I don't mind it flipping round because it's going to look at us at this point.

178
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.710
So let's go jump up land that's too quick.

179
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.460
You notice it snaps across.

180
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.450
So we just need to watch out for that.

181
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.710
The way that we can start sorting that out is making sure it's not inside it.

182
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.310
So if we go Gee X and then it's definitely looking at us.

183
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.110
So also pulled it towards us as well which I'm not sure I want but let's see what it looks like when

184
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:18.480
we animator land help me at this point.

185
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.540
I think the lamp should be looking to its doom.

186
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:31.860
So let's bring this back round and probably down as well at this point so let's just run that through.

187
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:40.520
That swings round and now at this point we don't want it just splashing on the floor and going through

188
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.260
the floor.

189
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.590
So can I grab this out pull it out.

190
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.980
It's going to be around here I think.

191
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.310
Make sure we keep that in.

192
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.960
I almost skipped back then.

193
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.310
We've got this.

194
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:57.410
This is because the I'm going to add in just a little bit of a bounce here.

195
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.490
Let's see what that looks like as it comes off lands.

196
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.890
It's okay.

197
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.080
These can probably be a bit closer together.

198
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.870
Give it the appropriate focus.

199
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:08.200
Yeah.

200
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:08.600
Okay.

201
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.880
I'm going to leave it like that.

202
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:18.040
I did say to you guys didn't I do not concentrate on detail and off I go I'm going to clear my annotations

203
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.000
for the moment but I've got on the screens.

204
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.490
It's nice and clear.

205
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:29.000
Let's just have a look at what it looks like when I press play jump up land on the block.

206
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.130
Scared fall off and splat.

207
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.030
Okay.

208
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.840
I think that's a great start.

209
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.720
Awesome.

210
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:44.030
Let's have a look at it in sort of a semi rendered mode as well make it full screen we Awesome.

211
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.560
Okay.

212
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.960
I hope you guys are starting to have lots of fun with this.

213
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:53.550
And don't just stop at one animation try a couple of different animations and see which one you like

214
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.280
the best.

215
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.760
Obviously I have my storyboard where I've imagined jumping up like this and then falling off but really

216
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.370
do take the time to just try outs and different moves perhaps half the lamp jumping on the spot with

217
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.240
excitement.

218
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:12.590
It's entirely up to you how you go about making your animation look forward to seeing them.

219
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.540
Please share them over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
