00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.130
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture.

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.960
We are going to learn about vertex groups and how we can use them in the context of animation.

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.370
In this particular case we're setting ourselves up so that our model works universally both inside blender

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.290
and outside itself.

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.660
When we go ahead and export it's the first thing we need to do of course is learn all about vertex groups

6
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.190
and how we go ahead setting them up.

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.670
Well if I draw your attention to the properties panel on the right hand side and let's scroll down on

8
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.470
these tabs until we get to the icon that looks like an upside down triangle it's the object theta properties.

9
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.990
And this is where you can see vertex groups.

10
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.160
If I go ahead and click the plus we get a new group.

11
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.560
We can double click that and rename it.

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.840
In this case I'm going to name it base.

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.160
Now it doesn't really matter.

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.610
The order in which you do any of this.

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.130
This is just the way I'm doing it at the moment but you can do any of these steps in any order you want.

16
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.190
The next day I am going to do is turn on overlays so I can see what's going on.

17
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.460
I'm going to select my base and you go all the vertex group has gone so order does matter.

18
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.040
Make sure you've got the thing that you want to add to avert this group selected first.

19
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.640
And if we click on our plane on the back again we see that base is attached to that plane.

20
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.920
Let's undo that.

21
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.190
Let's come in.

22
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.200
Select in object mode first of all the base then go to vertex groups click the plus and let's call it

23
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.690
base.

24
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.190
Now is that done.

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.630
Do we need to do anything else.

26
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.940
The answer's yes.

27
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.880
Yes we do.

28
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.630
If we go ahead and select base it won't do anything at the moment because we're not in edit mode.

29
00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.460
Now we get a few other options appearing now in order to assign a vertex to a vertex group.

30
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.040
You need to have them selected someone to press the A key to select everything.

31
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.360
And I'll turn on my screen capture keys there so you can see as well.

32
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.610
So with the achy pressed we know that we've selected all of those vertices and then we can go ahead

33
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.700
and assign those vertices to this base group based upon what is selected.

34
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.390
So just to make sure that that has worked I'm going to go Alton.

35
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:37.150
I declare my selection and then with base selected in the vertex groups panel I'm going to go select.

36
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.830
And there we go.

37
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.760
It's selected all of the vertices I had before.

38
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.970
So I'm happy with that selection so I'm going to lock it out of the way.

39
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.570
Now the next bits is the stem.

40
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.460
So once again you can go ahead.

41
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.720
Oh it's tempting to do that.

42
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.630
Isn't it just click plus to add your vertex group straight away.

43
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.380
No we don't want to do that.

44
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.050
We want to select the lamps them.

45
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.560
Then we can come back to our vertex groups and create the stem.

46
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.760
Well we've done that we can go in edit mode if everything is selected.

47
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.490
Great.

48
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.130
We can click a sign at these select read select looks good to me.

49
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.910
Of course then we lock it down so we're not going to accidentally make any changes to it.

50
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.700
And it's as simple as that to add things to a vertex group.

51
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.260
You can add things manually and much more precisely.

52
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.750
However for the level of control that we need this is absolutely perfect.

53
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.460
And now comes your challenge your challenge I'd like you to assign vertex groups to the rest of our

54
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.840
mesh objects join those mesh objects together where necessary name them appropriately as well.

55
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.650
In this instance what I'd like to do is keep the number of mesh objects the same as the number of bones

56
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.380
that you may even choose to name things the same as well just keep things steady.

57
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.670
So even though that we've got our base there and so far we've done the base and the lamp stem.

58
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.450
So there's a few more to do on top of that.

59
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.050
So go ahead pulls over here now and give that's a go okay.

60
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.090
Everybody welcome back.

61
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.140
Let's go ahead now and assign the rest of our vertex groups okay.

62
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.040
Welcome back.

63
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.550
So the next one is probably going to be the lower arm here.

64
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.600
So with it selected I'm going to go in straight away select all my vertices and call this lower arm

65
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:46.020
and I'm going to assign it select to select excellent working and we just repeat this for the rest of

66
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.950
what we have here.

67
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.500
Add a new call this upper arm and now we get the lampshade at the very top.

68
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.620
This is where we can start combining things together so upper arm.

69
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.460
That's fine I'm going to assign that these select select that's all working or I'm going to put locks

70
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.570
on these it's easy enough to unlock from later on as well.

71
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.900
But for the moment I'm happy so a couple of things to think about here before we go ahead and join things

72
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.730
together.

73
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.360
Anything that is unemployed so any unemployed transforms.

74
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.400
And it's also going to name itself whatever the active element was.

75
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.880
So since the lamp shave shade is basically what we want to work on.

76
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.830
I can come forward select each one individually and then the lamp shade last night I know I definitely

77
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.480
have the right things selected.

78
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:46.310
Now I can't make a busy curve straight into a mesh object if I try and join those things together.

79
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.230
It just doesn't work out so if I look for join it doesn't do anything.

80
00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:00.180
We cannot join these two mesh objects to this curve object so we can convert it because obviously we

81
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.730
want to use it.

82
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:09.110
So with it selected we get EF 3 converts to and we're going to convert it to a mesh object.

83
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.390
And now we should really name it something.

84
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.530
So I'm going to call it lamp shade with a called lampshade.

85
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:24.230
I'm going to select my ball joint my SO going to select my ball joints my bulb and the lampshade control

86
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.500
and Jay enjoying them all together.

87
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.960
They're all under lampshade.

88
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.920
Excellent.

89
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.500
I'm going to go into edit mode and select everything.

90
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:41.530
I'm going to give myself a bit more space here and add a new vertex group called lampshade so let's

91
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.870
have a look at what we have here.

92
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.260
I'm going to open up the outline are a bit more in fact I'm going to hide this area for the moment so

93
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:54.400
I can work clearly so we've got our area lamps you armature and part of that is the lamp base looks

94
00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:03.800
like we're using a path for that let's turn on and off yes then we got our lampshade lamps them lower

95
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.570
lower from an upper arm.

96
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.120
Now in this particular case we could almost apply that mirror when it came to the lower arm but I'm

97
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.840
gonna leave it where it is at the moment.

98
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.650
Okay brilliant.

99
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.110
So let's go through and just double check everything here that's maximize the space.

100
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:29.480
We've got one two three four five and we've got one two three four bones but we've also got this bone

101
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.150
on the bottom.

102
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.860
But if we think about it this bottom piece doesn't really move.

103
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:42.840
So what I'm going to do to make our model even simpler is join these two things together okay.

104
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.280
Brilliant.

105
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.820
Let's go ahead now and just make sure we've got the final.

106
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.140
But we she's just counting all the elements.

107
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.710
So if that car lampshade all combined with a bone we've got our upper arm with a bone which is great

108
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.450
we've got our lower arm with a bone as well.

109
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.440
And then finally we've got this stem and the base itself.

110
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:08.150
Now the question is whether or not we want to keep those as separate items I do otherwise we cannot

111
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.280
swivel around.

112
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.530
We can make it look like it's moving around.

113
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.250
Sure.

114
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.270
But the moment that you texted this or added something to it that made it unique.

115
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:23.420
The illusion that we've currently got will fade completely and it will just look rubbish but we'll cover

116
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.210
more of that in a later lecture.

117
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.010
I'm liking how my lamps coming along.

118
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:34.760
I've got all of my vertex groups sorted so we're one step closer to being able to export a single individual

119
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:42.620
model out of Blender that's animated into third party programs and we'll get to that really soon and

120
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.810
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
