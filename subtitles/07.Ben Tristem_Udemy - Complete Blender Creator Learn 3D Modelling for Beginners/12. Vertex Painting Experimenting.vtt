00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.690
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.830
In this video we're gonna be playing around vertex painting and I'm going to be creating what I would

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.190
like to call a very ugly egg head kind of thing.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.460
So let's jump in and start talking vertex painting our sculptures super high resolution if I go to wireframe

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.740
mode you can see this much detail in here I've got 140000 vertices down the bottom of my screen you

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.370
can see it tells me that there's tons and tons of detail because of that we can get a lot of nuance

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.250
detail by painting right over the top of our sculpture using vertex paint so we go to the mode selection

8
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.730
and select a vertex paint Nancy over on the right hand side I've got draw brushes brush settings underneath

9
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.190
brush settings I can choose from my color we'll say will choose a pink.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.480
Now if I move my brush over the top of my face I can paint directly on top of my sculpture which is

11
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.000
a really organic way of coloring and painting our model I'm going to do is just undo that because it's

12
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.110
looks cool but not exactly what I'm going for I'm gonna save up my work here and start a new scene so

13
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.450
that we can experiment and have a little bit of freedom to make some mistakes so save file new I'm going

14
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.530
to go for just general myself with our cube Let's delete the cube I'm going to shift a to add a mesh

15
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.420
we'll start off with you this fear now that these fears go a little bit more detail then I want to illustrate

16
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.390
the point I want to make I'm going to open up my selector turn this down to say 10 segments and 10 rings

17
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.150
Okay that's looking cool now same deal again I'm going to go up to where it says object mode I'm going

18
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.850
to select vertex paint I'm going to show exactly what's going on here because it's literally painting

19
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.600
the vertices click on our tool settings scroll down we'll find we'll do that pink once again.

20
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.440
Now as I move around if I'm in the middle if I'm on a face and not near a vertex nothing happens if

21
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.800
I go up near a vertex then boom you can see that it colors it and it's blending between the color that

22
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.990
we have on this vertex and the color of the other vertices around it.

23
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.220
So if I paint this vertex here there's quite a strong line because it's going from pink to pink and

24
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.250
it says everything in between is going to be pink if I change too I will say blue for this vertex over

25
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.050
here you can see there's a blending from blue to pink between those two.

26
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.270
It's pretty interesting effect it's not a great look because we've got very low number of vertices so

27
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.340
it would look okay if I wanted to paint this whole thing blue so if I paint that paint that then you

28
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.470
can see that the faces in between those vertices become blue and purple that's not too bad but if I

29
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.480
wanted to do any sort of nuance here wanted to paint a face on top of this for example then that would

30
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.500
be near on impossible to do so if you're following along just have a little of a play around so you

31
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.460
get familiar with what's going on here as you move your brush around it's painting over the top of the

32
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.600
vertex Yep cool.

33
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.290
Good good.

34
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.890
Now that's demonstrating that if we have low poly vertex painting is not going to work so well if we

35
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.330
don't increase the number of vertices on this I'll go to my modifiers and add a modifier will add a

36
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.980
subdivision surface increase viewport Bank point blank blank up to 4.

37
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.660
See how that looks.

38
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.870
Click on apply.

39
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.230
Now I'm still in vertex paint mode so I can go to my tools scroll down find a color we'll find a red

40
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.860
color.

41
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.740
Now as I paint around there's a lot more detail a little bit more like my head at the start of this

42
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.310
video.

43
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.660
Okay.

44
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.240
And so that becomes a lot more interesting we can paint on top of this and get some pretty cool effects.

45
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.240
Now while we're in this mode while we're just experimenting let's have a look at the tools that we have

46
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.950
access to drag this out a little bit so we can see the words as well draw which is what we're doing

47
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.430
blur which allows us if we play around with it just softens the look of it and merges what's on top

48
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.170
with what's underneath or it blends between the two so you can see it's becoming more white.

49
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.330
If I merge between a blend between here this is going to become a little bit more purple because it's

50
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.560
the merging the red and the blue and softening it as we go.

51
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.530
That's a nice way of kind of softening the edges.

52
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.580
If you wanted to get that sort of look particularly if you wanted to say a skin tone then we could jump

53
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.330
over back to draw to get a color will choose a skin tone is sort of color put that skin tone on and

54
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.990
then if we choose another slightly different skin tone kind of color put that over the top as well then

55
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.860
we could blur between them okay.

56
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.630
Another way to do that is by average.

57
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.060
So the average will take if we increase the brush sizes shows it nicely.

58
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.770
It will say what are all the things within the brush and paint back down the average.

59
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.930
They say if I click here you can see it's painted the average of the red and the blue.

60
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.270
If I find my yellow and click in around about here it's giving me an orange sort of color and as I paint

61
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.860
here it's kind of smudging it around a bit as that average changes a little bit to being incorporated

62
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.200
inside the brush.

63
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.430
It gives us a little bit of a textured look where it's blurring between the different colors.

64
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.720
So you can see the color there's not just one solid color and you can't see a distinct oh there's the

65
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.360
lighting there's a dark but allows us to merge between them which I think gives a nice kind of very

66
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.530
textured look to it and if you do a whole bunch of these painting in here you can push it all up and

67
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.900
get some you know some nice unique colors with a little bit of texture detail in it and then smear that's

68
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.170
a good one to know it just decrease the brush size here that just grabs what we've got and drags it

69
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.090
along there's a little bit more of a wet brush feel if you will if you've got you your watercolors or

70
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.740
your oils and you wanted to smudge the colors together to see how it feels then that will give us a

71
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.910
little bit more of that effect I could have chosen a few colors here a little bit at random I'm going

72
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.810
to go back to draw if you find yourself saying we're on Earth and my colors where are they gone then

73
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.130
it means you're not clicked on draw you have to click on draw to get our color picker also while we're

74
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.110
in draw you can right click that will give you a color picker for some quick selection bump and then

75
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.020
we can put that straight on what I'm going to do is open up the color palette tab just here and click

76
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.110
on new from there you can see a plus button and when I click on plus it will add to my palette the color

77
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.970
that I'm using at the moment so if I go and choose blue and click on plus it will add blue to my palette

78
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.890
green plus it'll add green.

79
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.390
This is a really nice way of not losing track if you've been doing some painting you are pretty happy

80
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.550
with that you don't want to have to try to remember what that particular particular color was so this

81
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.960
is a way of building up a palette for later use with brushes very handy so after you've clicked on the

82
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.760
plus you then click on the particular swatch just here's that what they called swatches that used to

83
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.070
be a cool watch back in the back in the day a Swiss watch if I remember correctly a swatch I didn't

84
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.410
have one but I think I saw some ads for swatches random thought so you click on the swatch or the panel

85
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.090
or the card whatever these things are called down here that allows you to change your color.

86
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.900
Now you might say that's exactly the look I was going for which is kind of I wanted to make a model

87
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.250
and that's exactly the look I wanted I want to render that out.

88
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.220
Take an image of it.

89
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.990
That's beautiful.

90
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.090
That's going to be the front page of my web site.

91
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.930
See you jump up to random mode and you look at it and you think that's well that's a little bit disappointing

92
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.350
isn't it.

93
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.680
OK.

94
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.670
So what do we need to do.

95
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.390
Let's go through the steps so that we can visualize this.

96
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.130
I'm going to go and drag out another window so we can have two going at once.

97
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.280
The first step here is for us to.

98
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.860
Well let me see you.

99
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.410
I'll ask you a little mini quiz question here.

100
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.480
What he thinks the first step in spinning out of visualize this when we render it the first step for

101
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.580
me is to come down to materials look on material property add a new material.

102
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.910
It's going to rename this to marbled marbles fine marbled material.

103
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.680
Name it whatever you want.

104
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.010
You have a blue or red or pink or face and the other important fact that we have a material now.

105
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:46.710
But we need to say use this very artistic layer that I'm putting on top of my object here.

106
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:53.260
So use the vertex painting the way we get that is we say we find the object data properties click on

107
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.660
that and you can see if we scroll down under vertex colors the tab there open that up you'll see it's

108
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.870
created a layer called CIOL for color.

109
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.380
I'm going to rename that because it does make a lot of sense to me.

110
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.200
I'll rename it random.

111
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.930
That's indicating that as random colors I've painted on here you could call it whatever you want to

112
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:17.590
call it main layer or you could call it colors whatever takes your fancy just so long as you remember

113
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:22.040
it for the next step because we need to make a reference to that in our shader Ed..

114
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.460
So this is why we've got our second we know jump over in the very top left you can see Ed type open

115
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.680
that up and I'm gonna change to shader Ed. That should have brought in some information already if you

116
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.270
don't see this then that might mean you haven't created new material yet it might mean that you're not

117
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.790
clicked on your sphere or it might mean that you are not in the correct view which is the shader Ed

118
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:50.380
view now that we have this I'm gonna hit shift a input vertex colors and random so random is remember

119
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:57.340
over here my vertex colors for my vertex coloring I was doing so shift a input vertex colors random

120
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:06.190
put that next to my principal be SDF dragged from color to base color emblem we've connected it up now

121
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:13.670
what I can do is click on my rendered viewport shading I'll take a moment and then show me what I can

122
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.890
see as a render now feel free to use whichever render and an engine takes your fancy I'm going to switch

123
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.720
this over to cycles so we can see how cycles looks because a little bit of wobbling as we move around

124
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.280
but pretty quick indication what's happening but the important thing to do that I wanted to make note

125
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.020
in this video while we're experimenting is make sure that you've got a view where you have the proper

126
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.070
lights going on in your scene because if you have a look at the difference between what we're playing

127
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.050
around with it looks like this and then the way it's going to look when it's lit is going to look like

128
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.890
that is that the way we want it is that that particular look we're going for.

129
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:51.920
So I'm going to do just a very basic crude three point lighting jump in object mode click on one of

130
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.900
my lights or the only light shift D Move it over a little bit shift again move it backwards and hop

131
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.170
in the side view they're all a little bit high move that one down a little bit my other view they're

132
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.590
all the front I'm gonna make one of them at the back it's backlit zoom around a little bit.

133
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.550
Make sure that they're bright enough.

134
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.880
They look super bright.

135
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.550
You've got to change the brightness on the lights.

136
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.190
Then you find your light bulb and you can change.

137
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.960
Currently there are a thousand watts.

138
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:31.840
I don't know if I want them a thousand watts that seems a lot of Watts might make this 200 and the other

139
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.980
one two hundred and the other one two hundred

140
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.000
near enough is good enough what we're doing now just experimenting.

141
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.390
Just wanted to show you that the light has a big impact.

142
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:51.050
So what I would do is over on the left hand view I'm going to change this to 3D viewport.

143
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.300
I will use my mouse wheel to scroll along so I don't have a lot of screen real estate so going to scroll

144
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.310
along and find random view.

145
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.460
Get the view that I want maybe it's going to be with the lights at the front where that little green

146
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.000
rubber ducky looking thing is.

147
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.020
I'm now going to close up my tools.

148
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:12.580
So we don't have the writing on there okay and hey presto we're ready to do a little bit of a challenge.

149
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.990
But first I want to show you one little trick.

150
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.420
Make sure we're clicked on sphere.

151
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.120
Jump over to vertex paint.

152
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.880
When when when vertex paint mode.

153
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:27.150
If I've clicked on my tools scroll down find the color that I'm interested in it might be say this color.

154
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.180
Just see more of a yellowy color.

155
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.430
If I want to just paint everything in one hit there's no fuel per say but we can go up to paint and

156
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.910
set vertex colors or shift case.

157
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.650
But that would just make everything that particular color and it change this over to my other solid

158
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.240
shading so that I can work on it more quickly okay.

159
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.750
So we've got back to kind of a yellow egg looking thing here and now is a good time for me to give you

160
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.530
a challenge and this is going to be one where I just want you to be silly and crazy and play around

161
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.690
with a tool and experiment and the challenge is to create a quick me.

162
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.740
If you remember the avatars you could make for your Nintendo we will let's make one of those.

163
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.670
If you don't remember I've just gone in search for em I which is a me and you can see this is what they

164
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.840
look like if you're not familiar with them well then that's what they are always gonna paint that directly

165
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:21.370
over the top of our of our egg and have it look something like me if you want to go that step further

166
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:27.820
and do a little bit of sculpting you can but this is just a quick and dirty exercise so you can see

167
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.280
how to go about doing vertex painting and also see that it's not necessarily the most efficient way

168
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.620
of painting this sort of thing but it's a fun little exercise to see what you come up with so there's

169
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:44.160
the challenge posed a video take that on now see you back here when you're done okay I hope you had

170
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.940
fun doing that please do Sheriff you've come up with something that you think's a little bit nifty I'm

171
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:53.910
going to start by just darkening my color making my brush smaller let's have a look at my reference

172
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:59.700
over here okay just eyes nose over to here I'll just go in and put a little bit of hair okay just zing

173
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.930
zing I'm going to do this pretty quick I'll speed up the video I'm not precious about how it's gonna

174
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.220
look

175
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.130
actually you know it's something I didn't mention apologies for not mentioning if we'd scroll down you

176
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:22.010
can find symmetry click on the mirror x axis sorry for telling you that as part of a challenge solution

177
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:28.430
but that allows me to find the midpoint and do a little bit of mirroring popping and I wrap up a popup

178
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.070
okay and there we go it's pretty bad it's pretty ugly but I just wanted to do something super quickly

179
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.800
just to show you the process of going about this you can see the first thing the most noticed noticeable

180
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.380
thing here is that we don't have enough vertices because it's getting all this jagged i.e. blurry stuff

181
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.240
around the outside.

182
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.210
That's a good thing to know when it comes to vertex painting you just need to have enough detail in

183
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.020
there in order to get this done so I hope you enjoy goofing around with that I'll see you in the next

184
00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.350
video.
