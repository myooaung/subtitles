00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.550
Welcome to the introduction to the image editor in this video.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.470
You will make the iris for our bunny.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.150
You'll learn how to export an image with transparency.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.770
Only use Blender.

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.070
So there will be some limitations and understand that there are better programs for image creation and

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.820
editing such as Photoshop gimp et cetera.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.770
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.020
So previously on blender we had our eyes that we just created here.

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
Now I just want to highlight one thing before we go any further because we won't be working on these

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.940
guys directly at the moment but if we go to flat shading in the tall shelf here you'll notice that I've

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.290
actually angled these eyes facing outwards from the bunny.

12
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:57.540
So we've used a u v sphere and this will act as the centre of our eye of our pupil and then the Iris

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.270
will go around here.

14
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.350
So it's worthwhile if you haven't done already rotating your eyes around so they're actually facing

15
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.730
outwards from your rabbit.

16
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.510
Of course if necessary turn the rabbit mesh back on unhide it so you can do that.

17
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.310
And then once you've done that we can hop into a brand new blender file so let's go ahead and open one

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.870
now.

19
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.360
Now just before we get going a few of you may be wondering well why are we just creating the geometry

20
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.690
we need straight away on the eye rather than going ahead and creating an image to put on the eye.

21
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.770
Well it's all to do with the level of detail required and the processing power required to make a realistic

22
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.450
Iris.

23
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.770
As you're about to see is going to add lots and lots of polygons to our scene.

24
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.640
If we were to make it real and have geometry to it.

25
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.410
But what we are going to do is create the geometry that we need to create the effect we want and we

26
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.140
go to do what's called baking.

27
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:08.890
We're going to solidify that into a picture and then use that picture by texture with in our model itself.

28
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.090
So let's carry on now and go ahead and make that Iris.

29
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.360
Okay so with a brand new start let's go ahead and create an iris.

30
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.030
So what is an iris Well it's a circle so let's get rid of our cube.

31
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.020
And what we're going to do here is add a circle in to our scene.

32
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.960
We're going to have to fill it.

33
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.140
Now it's entirely up to you.

34
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.970
But be as artistic if not free rein basically you can make this how you like but we do need to fill

35
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.900
it.

36
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.170
And I'm going to fill it with a triangle fan and I'm only going to fill it with 16 32.

37
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.080
The first is fine and I'm going to make the radius of three so that's quite a big circle and we're going

38
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.540
to look at it from the top.

39
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.240
Now I've got an option turned on I briefly mentioned it before.

40
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.890
When I go into topside front etc. It automatically switches to orthographic projection and that's just

41
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.850
to remind you guys is under user preferences interface and hear auto perspective very powerful.

42
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.770
I find it incredibly useful.

43
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.940
You may or may not like that turn on and off.

44
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.150
Do experiment with it.

45
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.870
Great little tip there.

46
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.590
Okay so now we've got our circle Let's hop over into edit mode and just have a quick look.

47
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.400
It looks pretty good so far.

48
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.100
I'm going to subdivide it's a little so I'm going to go down here on the tool shelf and father might

49
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.420
as well make that a bit bigger.

50
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.140
Oh no argument.

51
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.730
The operator panel in a moment.

52
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.230
All choices choices can have just hit some of the viant Twice there.

53
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.700
So you've got this wiggly pattern going round and I'm going to increase the level of fractals round

54
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.300
here so this makes it a bit more jagged.

55
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.350
Excellent.

56
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.320
So now that I've done that.

57
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.400
If we just render obviously the camera's not in the right position at the moment when wherever we render

58
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.590
something it appears here in the image editor and we will need to do this.

59
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.120
This is going to be our image that's going to become our texture shortly.

60
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.420
This is what we're going to be working on so we can see straightaway by going through to the end be

61
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.260
in line about it that the camera's not in the right place.

62
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.880
So let's go ahead and shift the camera to the right view.

63
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.360
Now where you see something here.

64
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.390
I'm going to hop back to the 3D view.

65
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.450
We'll give you something here that we've done in the past and that is switch to the camera.

66
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.110
Change the view to the camera as well.

67
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.850
And once we've done that I'm going to open up the propertys panel here and lock the camera to view once

68
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.740
we've done that.

69
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.150
I'm going to use the manual options here to position the camera right above our object as Z cordiant

70
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.660
head doesn't matter and I'll tell you why it doesn't matter in a second.

71
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.230
The rotation.

72
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.100
0 0 and 90.

73
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.940
Okay.

74
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.780
Brilliant.

75
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.000
So this is how we would view it.

76
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.930
Otherwise it's facing directly down on us seen at the moment.

77
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.450
Now before we do anything else the next thing we need to do is go to the camera properties and then

78
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.270
change it to orthographic.

79
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.920
And that's why this distance here the z coordinate doesn't matter because in orthographic projection

80
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.900
there is no zoom level.

81
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.230
It's all the appropriate signs.

82
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.620
We will also need to go over to the render properties here and change the resolution.

83
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:41.320
So I'm going to change the resolution here to 1 0 2 4 by 1 0 2 4 0 of mistyped something they're 1 0

84
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.940
2 4.

85
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.560
There we go.

86
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.540
So is Kred a square around our circle that we've made.

87
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.040
Finally I'm going to give our circle a bit of colour so I'm going to remember to unlock this option

88
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.850
down here on the properties because I'm going to move around in the moment and I'm going to go to circle

89
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.660
add a material to that circle and make its orange in this case.

90
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.150
And let's go and render and see how that's looking.

91
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.960
That's looking pretty good so far.

92
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.050
Probably need a few more highlights and things like that in there.

93
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.180
I'm actually going to use Blender render in a moment but I want to show you now before we go any further

94
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.140
how to make this grey background actually transparent because it's different in cycles and it's different

95
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.840
in blender render some and she cycles first since he's actually on the screen.

96
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.640
So we need to go to our render tab over here.

97
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.850
And when we scroll down there are two sections to be aware of.

98
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.010
First of all I'm always going to be rendering as a p engy it's a lossless format.

99
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.690
I'm going to make sure that it's r.g. be red green blue and a it will be like that by default.

100
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.780
But if you've changed it for some reason in the past it will need to be that way because we need this

101
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.200
final one which is the alpha channel which tells us the pasty of something or the opacity of something

102
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.060
which eventually of its set.

103
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.720
Zero means it's see through and transparent.

104
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.190
But of course there's no transparent option in this area here.

105
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.050
Under the outputs However further down under film there's a button that says transparent.

106
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.940
If we tick.

107
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.080
That's and then do the render.

108
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.370
We get as we can see here a transparency on the background.

109
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.700
Finally once you've done that with your rendering what you will need to do is save it so you go down

110
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.340
here to where it says image.

111
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.180
And we could save as image.

112
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.370
And when you do that I'm not in the right area at the moment someone close to my fluffy bunny folder

113
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.160
which is this one here.

114
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:46.560
Yeah.

115
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.530
And I'm going to call it Iris cycles.

116
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.650
And click save.

117
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.640
Now if I was doing the same thing in blender render then of course I would need to do slumping slightly

118
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.620
different song and switch to blend render at the top here.

119
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.860
I'm going to click render and is not going to work talker's the materials are different.

120
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.920
So let's go and add a material I'm still on circles.

121
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.490
I'm going to remove the material that was there.

122
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:20.970
I'm going to create a new material and again make it orange and just see how that comes out perfect.

123
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:26.580
There we go we've got ourselves another Iris but it doesn't have a transparent background.

124
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:33.060
So back over in the rendering tab over here there's a nother option it's on the shading So all of this

125
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.330
you still need r.g. be a.

126
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:40.070
And up here and the shading under.

127
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.430
And you need to change that to transparent.

128
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.890
And then if we go and render again we've got a transparent background.

129
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:53.380
And once again you can go to image and save as an image and go to Iris.

130
00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:02.040
And I'm going to call this not cycles but be are short for blend render in this case and save the image.

131
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.500
Now a couple of other things when you do your final image of course you can change its resolution at

132
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:14.430
the moment it's 50 percent of one to four by one to four pixels so you could up that for a higher quality

133
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.780
play about with this.

134
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:22.320
Obviously I've gone from this jagged thing here you could make yourself a ball as I type I if you wanted

135
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.100
to add a couple of other things to consider before you finish off the rendering.

136
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.100
So let's talk about the image editing itself.

137
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.210
So it's down here.

138
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.740
You ve an image editor just there that's where it is.

139
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:41.190
And this is the view we've got now further along we've got our render result here we've got a series

140
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.170
of slots.

141
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:52.620
So if I switch to slot 2 and let's say change the material here from this orange to more of a read let's

142
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.290
say and render the image again.

143
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.620
I can now directly compare things because in slots one we're going to have our orange one in slots two

144
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.990
we're going to have our red one.

145
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.790
So it's a great way of doing lots of different renders very quickly and seeing which one you'd like

146
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.050
for most.

147
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.070
So that's great.

148
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:18.750
I think it's time to give you guys a challenge and your challenge is to create this texture using our

149
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.310
geometry to go ahead and create an iris.

150
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.060
I've gone through one particular way you can choose another if you want.

151
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:31.920
Now once you've done that you need to save your render with an image that has transparency so make sure

152
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.960
you pick the right file type.

153
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.530
And then finally be creative.

154
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.010
That is incredibly important.

155
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.920
Don't just follow along exactly what I'm doing.

156
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.860
Go ahead and create your own Iris.

157
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.060
Perhaps use different colours.

158
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.260
That's a good first step.

159
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.960
Or even a slightly different shape.

160
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:53.450
Share your results in the discussions and boer's the video now and give that a go.

161
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.390
Okay guys.

162
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.780
Welcome back.

163
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.290
Let's go ahead and create an iris.

164
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:08.170
Right so the first thing I want to do is looking at my model there are some sharp divisions here.

165
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:14.800
When I in-between these areas here so I don't mind that so much but I really do what I'm going to do

166
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.200
mine in blender render by the way I am.

167
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:22.810
I don't want those sharp divisions so and I want a bit more of a shadow as it goes in.

168
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:29.970
So in order to do that shadow I'm going to hop into edit mode only use these select everything hit the

169
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:36.520
C key and I'm going oh I don't want virtex selects I probably won't face select for this and select

170
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:43.570
those in areas there and I'm literally going to drag them down to create more of a dip.

171
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.010
I'm going to do circle select again.

172
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:52.030
Oh no I'm not I'm going to clear my selection first then I'm going to do circle select and select this

173
00:11:52.030 --> 00:12:01.370
middle area hop around to the top view yeah that's the right area an owner and a extrude that downwards.

174
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.750
By not much but enough.

175
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:11.870
Yes there are some faces left up here which we could deal with but let's see if it adds or detracts

176
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:12.740
from our rent.

177
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.680
So let's go to render image and see how it looks.

178
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.660
Yes it does make it look a bit a bit worse for wear when that comes through.

179
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:29.030
I think I'm going to have to apply a subdivision surface modifier to our circle and it's going to render

180
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.870
it straight again.

181
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.400
All that much better.

182
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.640
I do like that.

183
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:39.230
It's not so jagged any more bit more natural but of course I'm going to have to deal with these nasty

184
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.570
edges racing up here.

185
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.520
So let's go to the 3D view and go to here.

186
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:53.150
Do circle select again and I'm going to change the z coordinate here of the things I've just selected

187
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:59.180
appropriately sangam a set it let's try minus point 5 initially.

188
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.140
Global setting of minus point five.

189
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.480
See if it moves it.

190
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:11.670
No that hasn't worked so let's go in and manually select these edges here and pull them down.

191
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.330
Let's go back and render and see how that looks real.

192
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.210
Actually thinking about it I don't care too much about this middle because theres going to be a black

193
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.330
pupil there.

194
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:27.990
So really this outside edge that I really care about have a let's just need to add it up ever so slightly

195
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.680
and those black lines aren't a bad thing.

196
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.890
So back to the 3D view.

197
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:40.040
There are few other bits sticking up shouldn't concern ourselves too much with them.

198
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.080
There we go.

199
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.930
How's it all looking.

200
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.380
Would be interesting to see it from the other side actually raised rather than lowered.

201
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.590
I'm liking the look of vatter with a select.

202
00:13:53.590 --> 00:14:00.400
It's all I'm just going to add another subdivision's surface another subdivision here and render that

203
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.230
out.

204
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:07.640
In fact I need to do the render one not just the one we're looking at render that's much better much

205
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.030
more smooth.

206
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.670
I dont like this red colour.

207
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.630
So was a circle still selected here.

208
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.120
I dont have to go back to the 3-d view.

209
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.910
I can actually do it here when a name my material Iris am not sure which colours go for I quite like

210
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.160
the orange from earlier actually.

211
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:30.110
So let's just try that and render the image only play with the specular colour here and make that a

212
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:37.130
red rather than a have it starting to look a bit better and then each increase the intensity.

213
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:41.810
And of course you can play with this to your heart's content and just go backwards and forwards and

214
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.760
t get what you want out of it.

215
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.370
It's obviously different for everybody.

216
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:55.970
Now I'm quite liking that texture of there so what I'm going to do is going to go file and save as an

217
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.450
image and I am going to name this one.

218
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.910
Iris final There we go.

219
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.430
And save the image.

220
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:11.390
So great if you've not done already please share your iris in the discussions and I will see you guys

221
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.870
in the next lecture.
