00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.850
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.260
In this lecture we're going to learn about inverse Kenneth Mattox.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.820
Now despite the lamp looking like it's having a bad time actually going through itself you can see the

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.950
possibilities here are pretty awesome.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.040
It's going to enable us to move our lamp pretty naturally if we want it to lean forward and have a look

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.820
at something.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.670
You can see the rest of the mechanism goes with it.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.770
However there is a downside to this.

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.150
And as you can see when we're moving this is actually pushing geometry through itself even though we've

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.410
set up some constraints to try and prevent that.

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.010
Now of course as we go through this we'll learn how to constrain it even further so that doesn't happen.

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.860
But this is a pretty cool start that you agree Mr. lamp.

13
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.020
Yep.

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.990
Let's go find out some more okay.

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.590
So we're back over with our lamp and what we will do is we will start setting up our lamp so that we

16
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.430
can use inverse Kenneth Mattox.

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.190
There are a couple of things that are important.

18
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.640
You can only set inverse cinematics whilst were imposed mode.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.030
So the first thing we need to do is turn back on our armature select our armature and then go into pose

20
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.650
mode.

21
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.160
Once we're into pose mode we can open up the side bar with the end key and then go to tool when we're

22
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.480
in the Tools menu.

23
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.740
We've got also i k the moment you put a tick in that box we can go ahead grab that bone and start moving

24
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.280
it around and the rest of the model will follow.

25
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.920
How cool is that.

26
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.530
Pretty awesome right.

27
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.460
There is a problem with this of course.

28
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.620
Let's hide the tall shelf for the moment and that is we're pulling everything else around with it.

29
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.760
So what we can do here is start adding a few constraints to our eye.

30
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.580
Okay first of all if we have a look at the bottom button we can select that and at the moment we only

31
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.540
really want it to rotate left and right so with the bone select if we can go to the bones properties

32
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.360
the screen button over on the right hand side scroll down and there's a section here called inverse

33
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.300
Kana Mattox.

34
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.720
If we open up that we can then go down further and then we can lock its axes.

35
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.290
Now you may be tempted to use the world axes but remember we left these bone axes on for good reason

36
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.200
we left them on so we know that if we wanted to rotate but not tip forward and back according to the

37
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.770
i k we can still tip it forward and back.

38
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.790
That's absolutely fine.

39
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.240
But not through either.

40
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.870
So we can turn that off on the x axis or lucky on the x axis and the same with the z axis.

41
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.690
And what we should now find is when we grab that and move it around look at that nice the rest of the

42
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.210
body is absolutely fine.

43
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.440
Or look around and as we're moving it you may notice that it snaps into different positions.

44
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.910
That's absolutely fine for the moment that's a conflict with our other constraints that we've got applied.

45
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.300
The downside of IPA inverse Kenneth Mattox is that it ignores your existing bone constraints.

46
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.740
So generally you either have forward Ken Mattox at one time or you have inverse Keenum at six.

47
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.220
Now you can switch between the two.

48
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.860
There's no right or wrong way but often is a lot easier if your lamp or your hand or your arm is reaching

49
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.000
out for something.

50
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.870
If we can just get the rest of the model to conform to that movement.

51
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.230
So we get it to reach out and everything else moves with it rather than the other way which should be

52
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.230
moving each individual bone to kind of look right now.

53
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.960
There is one downside one dark side to invest kind of attacks and this is the same with anything that

54
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.710
seems like it's a shortcut.

55
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.000
And that is quite simply that's at some point it won't do what you want it to do and you'll just have

56
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.540
to do it manually anyway.

57
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.150
But what we can now do is we can grab the bottom one we can move it along you can see we can have the

58
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.860
lamp dancing around which is pretty awesome.

59
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.050
And of course you can do lots of other things like that as well once we start getting going.

60
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.960
And I think armed with that knowledge you're ready to constrain the rest of the lamp.

61
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.950
Okay so you're challenged turn on inverse cinematics if you've just been watching.

62
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.990
That's the first thing you need to do after you've done that.

63
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.990
I'd like you to lock the relevant axes to prevent the IAEA moving our mesh objects through themselves.

64
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.940
So at the moment of course if we turn and rotate it is not going to work as expected.

65
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.970
However with a few locking of axes we're going to make sure that works.

66
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.710
Paul's video now and give that to go Okay everybody Welcome back.

67
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.390
Let's go ahead now hop on to blender and finish constraining the inverse cinematics on our lamp okay.

68
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.920
So let's have a look at the bones that we've got so far this top bone here has complete free movement.

69
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.260
I think we need it to have that that will give it a lot of dynamic movement.

70
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.230
That's really the face of our character.

71
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.450
And with that we can have it look inquisitive.

72
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.890
We can have it move towards objects but the rest of this needs to be quite rigid because that's the

73
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.580
way it's been made.

74
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.790
It's not a bendy lamp it's got joints in it.

75
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.390
So we need to be respectful to that setup that we've got.

76
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.760
So this top bone here is the x axis.

77
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.830
In fact it's X on all of these by the bottom one.

78
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.650
So let's go ahead.

79
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.890
We need it locked on Y and Z and the same for this bone.

80
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.970
Is that all we need to do.

81
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.230
Well it's.

82
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.200
Go ahead grab this top one and have a look.

83
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.430
Excellent things are moving as we would expect them to.

84
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.970
That is looking pretty useful.

85
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.700
Now the one thing that we've got going on here is the lamp can go through itself and that's going to

86
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.130
cause us a few issues.

87
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.830
So we're happy to look at some finer controls of constraints in a few moments but to be honest that

88
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.120
is pretty much spot on.

89
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:47.150
I'm not sure which way round our lamp is at the moment but remember at any point we can go all tar algae

90
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.190
and it will put things back to how they were previously.

91
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.760
So there we go.

92
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.610
That's a quick way of resetting everything.

93
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.540
Of course you can set everything to the rest mode if you want to but with everything selected we're

94
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.940
really focused on rotations so we can rotate the top round.

95
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.020
So our lamp can look what is there around here and of course if you want to have a bit more fun you

96
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:14.360
can turn it onto Look Dev mode and under this dropdown we can use the scene lights and the scene world

97
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:21.110
which will make us a lot darker but then we can do this sort of real time almost eevee like movement

98
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.120
which is pretty awesome in itself.

99
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.520
But if we need to we can also switch over to cycles to see how it's actually looking and I think this

100
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.650
is coming along really really well.

101
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.410
And if you really want to have a bit more fun we can click whilst we've got this top one selected we

102
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.380
can click to turn off our overlays and then we can still have it look around our scene which is pretty

103
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.500
awesome.

104
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.020
Okay.

105
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.190
How are you guys getting on really looking forward to seeing your lamps coming alive.

106
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.060
Now if you have the capability of recording a little video of what you're getting up to it would be

107
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.710
brilliant to see how your lamps are coming together at the moment.

108
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.030
We're looking at rendering this out as an animation but we'll have to learn about that in a few lectures

109
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.930
time.

110
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.780
I'm really liking how this is coming on.

111
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.320
Please share your lamps over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
