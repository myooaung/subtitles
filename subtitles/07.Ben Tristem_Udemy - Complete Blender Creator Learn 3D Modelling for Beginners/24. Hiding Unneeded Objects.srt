00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,390
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to hide all of the other pieces that

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,690
are on the board so we can focus just on the board itself.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,660
OK so let's just have a look at our scene here.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,340
Now we can go ahead and hide things by just pressing the H key.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,980
Now you'll notice when you hide something its effects on the scene disappear.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,660
So if I've hidden our porn there I can no longer see its reflection.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,500
If I zoom out slightly select my lamp and press H.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,170
It will hide the effect of that lamp on the scene.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,010
I'm going to undo that but not just by going control and Z to undo.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,500
I'm going to go alternate H.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,570
That's brought back everything that we've hidden in the past.

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,260
Now to go through all these places and press H would be annoying.

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,020
We're not gonna do that.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,130
What we are going to do is hide things with a bit more intelligence.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:03,510
First of all I'm not happy that my lights are called light and I'm not happy with how they are not linked

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,810
to the camera in any way.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,240
So I want to change my view back to view layers over on the outline.

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,410
And let's have a look.

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,410
Where are my lights at the moment my lights are actually parts of the black pieces.

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,410
That's very bad.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:22,630
So let's go ahead and select them so we've got this lamp here and the other one is while the other ones

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,070
right in the way of that camera piece but there we go.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,240
Selected them both and the press the M key and move them in with the board camera and lights.

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,450
And I'm also going to name them appropriately as well.

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,790
So this one over here is the blue light.

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,890
We can see the outline.

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,990
It's highlighted orange so I can come in and I'm going to go lamp blue.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,810
And the reason why I've named it lamp blue and this one over here will be lamp yellow or lamp orange

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,190
whatever you want to call it is because then lamp gets put together.

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,610
Same word at the beginning.

31
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,410
Okay.

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,510
So now what we can do is we can intelligently hide things using the outline.

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,320
So we have all of these eyes.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,910
We can literally click and drag to hide and UN hide objects.

35
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,550
Hi guys.

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,080
UPDATE This lecture as some of the methods have been changed.

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:16,400
Coming up if you cast your eyes to the outline and hover over the chessboard you can see that the options

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,480
the old and control are no longer available.

39
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,920
You hold up a whole variety of the collection.

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,990
You can see sorry control and shift are available.

41
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:35,450
So if you hold control and click it isolate everything else apart from that board camera and light collection

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:44,060
old however will do the opposite and isolate that from everything else.

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,400
This no longer works for anything underneath.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,640
So if you want to hide anything in the viewport what you have to do is click the whole shift page to

45
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,860
isolate that and remove everything else and you bring that all back by old and hake as well control

46
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:07,930
and Haiti will allow you to isolate entire collections so if you press control and age you can isolate

47
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,460
which collections you would like.

48
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,310
You can isolate the port and the camera

49
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,970
being careful with that because old and hate will not bring that back.

50
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:25,670
You have to go back over here on the outline and turn those collections back on additionally.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,740
You can also hold the shift key and over and the outline collect the eye of any parent and it will turn

52
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,080
off any of the children as well and shift collect to bring them all back again.

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,450
With that in mind I hope this helps you through the lecture and back to my case we can use control to

54
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,330
isolate things.

55
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:50,170
If I just wanted the board being shown I could hold down control and then click the eye and it will

56
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,760
isolate that one object.

57
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,410
It was so low it's now if I hover over we can see we've got a couple of different options here.

58
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:05,440
So control isolate visibility old to disable for all view ports that can be useful if you're working

59
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,970
across multiple viewpoints.

60
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,380
If you want to undo that control clicking the chessboard again doesn't bring things back.

61
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,340
So let's go alternate an unhealed everything again.

62
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,000
Now we're going to be focusing on our board itself.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,240
So what we need to do is hide the black pieces and hide the white pieces.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,150
And because we're on The View layer all we need to do is hide the black pieces and then select the white

65
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,450
pieces and hide those as well because we're hiding the collections.

66
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,710
Everything else just disappears as part of that collection.

67
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,860
That's one of the beautiful things of organizing things in these collections.

68
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,770
And then finally I don't want the camera interrupting our seeing so I'm just gonna hide the camera itself.

69
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,330
The camera still works by the way and we can still render something out.

70
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:56,070
Now you will notice that even though we've hidden things they appear when we render them.

71
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,370
If you didn't want that to happen there's another option that we have to look at.

72
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,860
So let's go ahead and get a press escapes come out of that.

73
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,200
And if we have a look here there are these camera icons as well.

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,370
If I hide the camera icons they go from this White camera to a camera of a cross in it.

75
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,680
Then when we go ahead and render There we go the objects no longer appear at render time either.

76
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,980
Okay.

77
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,430
That's everything hidden and out of the way.

78
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,280
I hope you've enjoyed this quick tip on hiding objects out of your way.

79
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,340
It's gonna be incredibly useful whenever you've got a complex scene that perhaps a part is blocking

80
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,510
another or indeed if you've got something complicated in your scene.

81
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,460
If you've got a high poly object in your scene and you're not working on it at the moment it's not crucial

82
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,170
to what you're doing then you might as well hide out of the way and get the performance benefits as

83
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,880
well.

84
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,710
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
