00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.380
Welcome to knowing your subject in this video you reinforce the importance of reference material.

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.750
You will see what happens when you just plough forward without consulting your reference material or

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.020
not have any.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.440
Like I started to do so.

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.930
Bit of background here.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.050
What happens when you're not watching me in the lectures.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.540
Okay so on the screen at the moment I plonked the Suzanne monkey in a field of grass and I thought oh

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.260
that's a bit wispy so I improved upon that and made the grass look a bit more rigid but something struck

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.010
me as odd.

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.190
I mean it looked like very very fine grass.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.910
The fact is if grass gets bigger it gets bigger.

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.160
It doesn't still retain is very thin type Strand.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.040
And I tried different aspects of it.

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.250
This is a bit of a taster of what's to come in the rest of this section.

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.140
So I went out and actually got some reference material to is to be quite honest.

16
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.530
All these iterations here that I went through I did not have reference material I thought I know what

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.700
grass looks like it's that green stuff outside is fine I'll get on with it.

18
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.920
No as you can see the real grass doesn't look anything like that.

19
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.700
First of all the colour obviously we can probably boost the saturation.

20
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.560
This image matches the bright greenness of this one but that's what real grass looks like.

21
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.270
That is still a bit too uniform maybe even a bit too dense in terms of how many strands of grass or

22
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.150
how many blades of grass there are there.

23
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.980
And I went out on a walk today and I took a picture of something in long grass to give me a better understanding

24
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.680
about how the grass would be around it.

25
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
So I cant stress enough the importance of going out and taking.

26
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.180
These are some other pictures that I went out today and did taking as many pictures as you can to get

27
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.600
a good idea so when youre back at the computer youre not scratching your head thinking oh what is this

28
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.540
going to look like what what am I trying to achieve.

29
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.540
And I really like this one here.

30
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.750
Im actually going to probably set up my scene as close to this as possible.

31
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530
I do like the tree in the background.

32
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.740
I love the grass in the foreground and going to make that little longer in our scene.

33
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.720
And of course we got the background stuff going on there as well.

34
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.700
Probably not going to make it that clutter to try and keep it a bit clean and clean of that scene so

35
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.970
theres not so much going on in simple thing for that is I want to draw attention to the rabbit not the

36
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.860
rest of the scene.

37
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.880
Having a look at a couple of other types of grass you can see they tend to grow in tufts so we can see

38
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.340
in the background over here that you get these tufts of grass growing up.

39
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.870
So that would give us a clue of how to construct our grass and make sure it is more realistic.

40
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.120
Now obviously we're not shooting for ultra realism in this scene but it's still got to be convincing.

41
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.890
And here's what long grass looks like at the blades get much much thicker.

42
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.870
And of course because they're longer and bigger they are heavier and they flop over more.

43
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.520
So really big grass does not stick up in the air vertically.

44
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.350
Weeks might do that when it's got a really thick stem.

45
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.390
But the normal grass that are Bunny's going to be sat in does not do that.

46
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.100
So it's very important to focus on reference material.

47
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.510
So bearing that in mind we've got a bit of further planning to do just so I know that you guys are actually

48
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.450
thinking about this fully and not just going at it at a whim.

49
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.990
So there are going to be three or four main items in our scene three or four main objects.

50
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.020
Do you know what they are.

51
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.060
How important are they to the scene and do you actually know what they look like.

52
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.360
So pause a video now and try and go in answer these questions.

53
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.950
OK guys.

54
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.900
Welcome back.

55
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.140
Well looking at our scene itself.

56
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.180
Do you know what they are.

57
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.130
Well let's see we've got the bunny.

58
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.660
That's going to be the main focal point of what we're going to be working on.

59
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.550
Then we've got where the bunny's immediate environment which is going to be the grass.

60
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.590
Okay.

61
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.030
Next we're going to have a background object.

62
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.170
We're going to have a tree in our scene.

63
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.730
Now depending on how we actually set our scene up the tree is obviously less important than the grass

64
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.420
that the bunny sitting on and the grass is less important than the actual subject of the whole thing.

65
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.480
The bunny itself and then of course you got the far background.

66
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.140
If we have just this grass and tree in isolation there's going to be a background something in the distance

67
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.120
so that it's not going to be just a boring scene.

68
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.900
And of course do you actually know what they look like.

69
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.310
Well if not make sure you've got reference material with you whether that means you've got a phone with

70
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.020
the images.

71
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.230
I mean for all of my images that I need for this course in a folder that I can reference all the time.

72
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.390
If I go out and take photos like I did day I make sure I store them in a specific folder so I've got

73
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.700
exciting things on my computer.

74
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.860
I have a folder named grass which in all intents and purposes is boring to show your family and friends.

75
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.390
But it's very useful when you need it for reference material.

76
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.890
So guys I hope you've got a good sense of where we're going with this project what we're going to be

77
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.040
focussed on.

78
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.950
And if you found some exciting photos if you've been out and about or you've found something very interesting

79
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.260
on Google perhaps something you want to incorporate in your Seen it be great to see that do share anything

80
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.420
exciting you find in the discussions.

81
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.950
And I will see you in the next lecture.
