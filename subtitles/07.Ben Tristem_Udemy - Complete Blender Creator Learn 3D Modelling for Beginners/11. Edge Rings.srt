Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,670
In this lecture we are going to learn about selecting edge rings.
2

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,930
We already know about edge loops that flow around our model but these ones running down we can select
3

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,910
them by selecting edge rings.
4

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,310
Let's find out more in this lecture.
5

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,690
Of course we're going to select these edges running down here.
6

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,880
Now you could do it manually like I'm doing here and then dissolve and just work your way round.
7

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,570
But there is a quicker way of doing it if we have a look under the Select Menu selecting loops.
8

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,410
It's kind of a part of that we also end up with edge rings and you can see there with those edges selected.
9

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,360
It's selected all of the edge rings running round.
10

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,710
Now that is pretty awesome and we can go round and deselect the ones that we don't want.
11

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,650
The first thing that I thought when it came to this is ooh I could do.
12

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,290
Checker deselect and just change the amounts.
13

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,980
That would be quite easy.
14

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,770
So again I went to select went to checker deselect and it didn't do what I thought it did.
15

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,460
It just went down on this original one and did nothing else.
16

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,700
However when I selected an individual edge ring going round which I can do by selecting one edge going
17

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,760
to select going to select loops and edge rings it will select everything around that.
18

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,050
Now there is a shortcut for that whereas edge loops you hold down ALT and it does the edge loop if you
19

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,040
hold down alt and control at the same time.
20

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,420
It will do the edge ring.
21

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,720
So now that we've done that we could go in and go select checker deselect and you can see it's turned
22

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,100
off every other one.
23

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,970
So if we have 32 edges running down here I can now reduce that to sixteen and I can change how many
24

25
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,460
are being checker deselected in the operator panel we've got how many to go round so we can change
25

26
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,330
that we can tell it's a skip a couple and you can see here it selects a multitude of them.
26

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,070
So unfortunately you can't just select all of these and go round but you could select them individually.
27

28
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,680
However with what we've got planned with cutting this down it is quite easy to go round and just select
28

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,850
the ones that you want to dissolve by holding down alt and control and selecting the edge loops you want
29

30
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,170
and of course as you're going round and doing this you realize you need to add to your selection.
30

31
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,120
So if you hold down shift as well as control and alt you can add them in.
31

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,030
And once you've done that you can hold down shift and alt to turn them on and off as you want.
32

33
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,390
Now if we were chopping this up into smaller pieces say every other one what we could do here is 
33

34
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,350
deselect them every other one going round.
34

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,690
Now what I would recommend is that you align any of the ones you decide to keep with some of these axes
35

36
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,460
if you make them off center that can cause some issues later on.
36

37
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,130
If we start using something like the mirror modifier so make sure if you do cut things up that the geometry
37

38
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,660
itself aligns with the world axes it just makes your life a lot easier if you can do that.
38

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,380
So you can whizz round and you can take these out as I'm doing now and it doesn't take much time at
39

40
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,250
all and you'll be writing saying or even suggesting oh how about just starting afresh because we seem
40

41
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,160
to be doing a lot of deconstruction work here.
41

42
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,610
Well part of that is because I want to teach you some new skills not necessarily a workflow and I would
42

43
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,950
agree with you if you suddenly realized that you'd made something really high poly and it needed to
43

44
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:42,300
be low poly perhaps starting again would be an optimal solution but since we've got the opportunity
44

45
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,610
here to learn how to cut down geometry where that might not be possible in reality.
45

46
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,500
So if you had already made a high polygon model and you wanted to come back to it later and just cut
46

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,270
down the amounts of geometry this may be the only way of doing it because you're not creating it from
47

48
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,620
scratch at that point.
48

49
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,540
So now if I press X and dissolve those edges we end up with 16 separate segments instead of 32 and it
49

50
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,630
looks a lot sharper now.
50

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,340
So there we go that pretty much covers all we need to know about edge rings which is a series of edges
51

52
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,150
are not directly connected but share the same face.
52

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,550
And now it's time for your challenge okay.
53

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,050
So your challenge is to create a base with eight segments.
54

55
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,300
We're already at 16 so eight shouldn't be too hard to do whether you're starting with 32 or the 16 that
55

56
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,410
we've just made.
56

57
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,080
You should end up with eight segments so the profile will be octagonal and there will be a lot easier
57

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,320
to work with a base that is that simple.
58

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Pause the video now and give that a go. Okay everybody, Welcome back.
59

60
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,970
Let's hop on over into blender and create that base with eight segments.
60

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,450
Okay.
61

62
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,220
So for this challenge I'm going to assume I had not already gotten halfway there.
62

63
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:08,010
So I'm going to revert back to how it was previously and so I need to keep these vertical edges that
63

64
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:15,360
run along the axes and it could be just as easy to select all of these edge rings as we've been doing
64

65
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,610
before and then just remove the ones I want to keep.
65

66
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,770
So they'll be eight to remove.
66

67
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,940
That's a better way of doing it than adding the other 24.
67

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,950
So we'll do it that way round for speed.
68

69
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,580
So I'm going to hold down alternate shifts so I can start these selecting.
69

70
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:39,350
So we want the ones that lie on the axes that will make ourselves a square if we just dissolve them.
70

71
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,160
Now let's just try that dissolve edges.
71

72
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,920
We get a square and that might might be the type of piece that you want to do.
72

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,160
That is probably as low polygon as you really want to go and preserve the shape.
73

74
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm not doing that though we're doing octagonal so we need to do three.
74

75
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,160
And then one three and then one three and then one two three.
75

76
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,640
There we go.
76

77
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,130
And then the final one is there.
77

78
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,340
So now that I've got all that sorted out I can just go X and dissolve edges and we should have an octagonal
78

79
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,720
finish which we do.
79

80
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,820
Perfect.
80

81
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,320
How did you guys get on.
81

82
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:21,470
Can you see the power of being able to take a high poly mesh and drill it down to its basic components
82

83
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,540
and then the next lecture we will actually have a look at some alternatives to the bevelling that we've
83

84
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:34,190
just undone and ultimately having this low poly model as the base for that makes our workflow so much
84

85
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,530
easier because we only have let's see how many of we gotten down.
85

86
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,350
So we have 92 polygons to play with and 48 vertices.
86

87
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,290
That's a lot less geometry than we had before.
87

88
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,430
And that gives us many many more options and flexibility when it comes to controlling it.
88

89
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:59,390
But the downside is we don't have such precise control as we might do if we can control each individual
89

90
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,980
vertex.
90

91
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:07,330
So of course like most things it has pros and cons it will be quick to work with but won't be so bespoke.
91

92
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,540
That's it for this lecture.
92

93
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,390
Show your work so I can see how you guys are getting on and I'll see you all in the next one.
