00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,560
We are going to have a look at linking across multiple blend files so referencing other blend files

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:18,210
is incredibly useful it means you don't have to repeat yourself which when you have maybe an arsenal

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,730
of materials that you can access or a series of measures there's no point in repeating yourself time

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,930
and time again if you have the information available to you.

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,900
And the great thing is that any change in the source files will update the link theta.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,690
This also means if you're working in a team so you're working on a character and someone else is working

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,220
on the gun or a backpack or an ax something that the player will be holding in your game.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,100
Now the great thing about this is they can be modelling those other objects and any of the changes will

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,250
update when I read load my character or suddenly when I save it and then come back again and that is

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,670
really really useful it separates the actual parts from one another and enables a team to work on one

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,200
project.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,010
So there we go it enables multiple people to work on components of a scene.

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,500
Now we can use a relative or an absolute file structure.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,320
These are very simple concepts.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,380
Basically in general you're probably going to be going for a relative file system.

17
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:24,030
That does mean that if you've got everything stored in a certain directory structure it doesn't matter

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,860
what computers it's on.

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,100
However an absolute file structure doesn't make much sense if you're working in a team unless you all

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,990
share exactly the same file structure that's so prone to falling apart.

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,420
So I would avoid using that.

22
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:45,630
Now one of the things I will warn you about nice and early on when you're linking breaking a link can

23
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,120
be an absolute pain to fix.

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,910
Now what do I mean by breaking a link not breaking it within blender but say you go ahead and move some

25
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,190
of your files out on the desk.

26
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,920
So you go into File Explorer and you decide to rearrange some stuff that will break and it can be a

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,950
real pain effects.

28
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,190
It's very difficult to just find all of those things again.

29
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,300
Now I say difficult because I'm assuming your projects rather large if you've only got two things in

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,250
there of course is going to be easier to read link them all but obviously we need to avoid doing that

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,910
if possible.

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,340
So in general this is why when you've decided on a file structure and we'll talk more about that in

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,640
a couple of lectures time it's important actually stick with it and you'll find that sometimes there

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,040
are legacy file structures in larger organizations and bigger projects.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,900
And that's because changing something will break the projects.

36
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,430
It's better that it doesn't look quite right as a file structure if you're not going to spend hours

37
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,120
re linking things now linking should also be one way.

38
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,810
So let's say we've got our master seen here that we're building up I know I've got all of my files within

39
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,210
one blend file at the moment which is great.

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,600
Solves a lot of these linking issues but if I wanted something else this I wanted my chess set to be

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,030
within my scene itself what we would want to link it and I wouldn't want to have to recreate it in the

42
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,210
scene itself.

43
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,600
And of course any updates I make so I may want those to come across as well OK.

44
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:23,120
So let's go over into blender now and have a look at the different ways we can link our blend files.

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,660
Okay so now that we're over in Blender let's go ahead and create a fictitious object with some materials

46
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,830
on it that we could bring into another file.

47
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,240
So I'm going to call this cube here cube to link because that's what we had to be to link to link because

48
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,800
that's what we're talking about here we're going to link this cube into another blend file.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,480
Now of course you can go ahead and grab any of your other projects that you've worked on but I'm just

50
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,820
going to very quickly create something that's make it red so we can see it.

51
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,730
Let's turn the roughness all the way down and if we have a look in the shaded view is a very shiny cube.

52
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,990
Excellent.

53
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,910
Let's add in one modify and make a very shiny ball.

54
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,410
Here we go.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,150
And I'm going to right click on it and shade it smooth.

56
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,050
Would you look at that.

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,960
I'm going to go ahead here and add one more subdivision just to smooth s so that all looks good.

58
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,860
Okay let's go ahead and save that and I'm going to call this.

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,140
Make sure I'm in the right folder.

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,950
Let's call this cube to be linked and it's actually a ball rather than a cube.

61
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,470
There we go.

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,380
So we've set up that blending file with the material in it that we can bring across.

63
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,210
Okay.

64
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:47,690
So now let's go ahead and craft selves a new file and I'm going to get rid of my default cube as we

65
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,350
always do.

66
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,540
Now let's go ahead a file and we've got two options.

67
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,130
We've got link and append now append is one form of linking that takes a copy but it does not link back

68
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,920
to the previous file we're focused on linking.

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,680
So go ahead and click on link.

70
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,590
Let's go to where we've sold our file and go to the cube to be linked.

71
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:15,000
Now it doesn't open it up at that point it actually opens up a series of data blocks that we can go

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
ahead and access.

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,020
Now we could go into material and just get the material.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,510
Now we didn't name it.

75
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,710
So it's not a particularly good name but that's okay for the moment for our practice.

76
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,730
We've got material here.

77
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:33,510
Let's go ahead and grab that ad Suzanne the monkey into the scene and then under my materials I can

78
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:39,960
select that and we can see here it says l 0 material and so is this where it is.

79
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,480
Now when it goes in again extra icon we can see we have the chain icon there.

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,550
And if we hover over that you can see you can actually break the link and make it local.

81
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,310
At that point.

82
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,870
But we'll talk about making it local later on.

83
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,670
And now we've got Suzanne the monkey with that material on which does mean and I want to demonstrate

84
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,180
this for you.

85
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,960
Now we're going to save this and I'm just going to call it Suzanne linked and now we can go ahead back

86
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,380
into our cube to be linked.

87
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,800
Change the color on that.

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,500
Let's change it from this red to a green just for an example file save.

89
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,180
Then when we go back into our other file Suzanne linked it automatically updates what we had before.

90
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,340
Pretty awesome being able to do that.

91
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,600
Now notice that the material is great out.

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,240
It means that we cannot edit it at all.

93
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,290
We try and rename it.

94
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,780
We cannot do that as well.

95
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:41,710
Now interestingly the warning I gave you about breaking links earlier if we renamed our cube to be linked

96
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,200
file then it would definitely break it.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,430
I'm not going to say if I want to come back in here.

98
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:56,000
However if we go ahead and change the material and call this shiny green paint which could be a valid

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,930
name save our file and go ahead and open up Suzanne linked are it also applies.

100
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,850
So this is one of the things that you need to be careful with because that's broken that link.

101
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,030
So I wanted to get that in there nice and early because it's really infuriating if he didn't realize

102
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,730
that renaming it will break the link of course that's a very straightforward fix.

103
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,450
But if he did that to many things it'd be a real pain to do so so I'm going to close that down there.

104
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,140
I can go straight back into here file link and this time instead of the shiny green paint you see it's

105
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,180
updated there we can go.

106
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,480
Upper level and go to the objects.

107
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,330
Now what the object would do if we select the cube to link is it would also inherits all of the extra

108
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,560
bits below it.

109
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,350
So not only the mesh but the material as well.

110
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,230
Now over on the right there's a couple of options here we've got relative path.

111
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,620
This is important I think in general you're going to have that text.

112
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,530
It just means that when you have a certain file structure on a disk it's not reliance on it being exactly

113
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,300
like mine is up here.

114
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,250
It'll be all based upon the relative path based on where you've stored your data.

115
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,610
So let's go ahead and select link.

116
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,220
Excellent.

117
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:17,720
We've got our ball in the scene but we can't move it out there and look our cube to links come in with

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,030
the chain icon there as well.

119
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,590
Now let's go down to Suzanne and go ahead and add on the shiny green paint.

120
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,080
We've got another material in here are material to be linked.

121
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,250
That's not going to happen at this point in time.

122
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,290
So a couple of things we can do we know it's got a zero on there which means if we go ahead and save

123
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,660
and revert it will disappear

124
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,950
there we go.

125
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,460
It's gone.

126
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,820
And so's the other material that we had in our scene so we can move Suzanne around because she is local

127
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,960
to the scene.

128
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,560
However the bull that we've imported we cannot move at all.

129
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,300
And if we go to our modifiers tab we can see that we can't add any additional modifiers to this either.

130
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,170
That's locked out.

131
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,090
We cannot rename the match data the object eight.

132
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,080
We can't add new materials on either.

133
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,620
This is completely locked and completely linked to the original object including its position in the

134
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,320
world.

135
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:26,060
So if we were to go ahead and go to file and open up a cube to be linked which is now really a ball

136
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:34,550
and shift it GZ for Clay sits for units on the z axis up save our file and go ahead and open up Suzanne

137
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:40,160
linked it's moved there as well so you can see this is incredibly useful if you're bringing something

138
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,560
in all the parts in a certain position and you don't want the other person working on your team to be

139
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,810
able to move things around.

140
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,950
Perhaps the sets up as a very intricate system and by moving them you could break things.

141
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:59,730
That's especially true later on when you have perhaps drivers changing how another object is working.

142
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,830
Being able to move things around can screw around with that setup.

143
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:09,530
Now one final thing I want to talk about before we go and start being able to edit some of the properties

144
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,130
of our objects that we've linked to is that even though the chain exists here and it says it's a direct

145
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,880
library link it's a block that we can make local.

146
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,320
We cannot actually make that local at the moment because the material is further down the hierarchy.

147
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,500
We'd have to make everything above it local first so there we go.

148
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,100
That's how we go ahead and link to external data blocks.

149
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,170
Now you may be thinking well this is great Mike but I can see the use of importing materials I can have

150
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,290
a materials library and a blend file that I can keep referencing to and storing more and more materials

151
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:50,410
in.

152
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,000
That sounds fantastic.

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,720
I can just append new materials into that whenever I want.

154
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,660
But what use is this when I can't even move it and with the exception of that very specific case where

155
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,760
it has to be in a certain order.

156
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,090
Well in the next few lectures we'll talk about how we can make this editable and how we can go ahead

157
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:17,440
and use it in Blender and we'll start by talking about proxies and I'll see you in the next lecture.
