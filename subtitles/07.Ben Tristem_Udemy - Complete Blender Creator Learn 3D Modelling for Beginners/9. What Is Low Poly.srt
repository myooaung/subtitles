Hello everybody and welcome.
1

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:11,690
In this lecture we're going to have a quick look at the terminology low poly because it can mean different
2

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,740
things to different people.
3

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,200
It'd be clear if I was to talk to you about what it means to me and of course I'd like to hear what
4

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,570
it means to you as well in the discussions.
5

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:27,590
So first of all in the last lecture we made a base piece and it starting to get quite detailed.
6

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,440
It was starting to look quite smooth and not what I would call low poly.
7

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,390
So we're going to go ahead and fix that in a moment but before we do I want to discuss what low poly
8

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,330
is is two things really.
9

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:47,240
First of all we've got the style now low poly is a kind of a retro look back to the days of old but
10

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,590
not only that it's also a way of rapidly generating assets to use in a game or perhaps in a scene itself.
11

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,190
It does facilitate much more rapid model making.
12

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,270
That's just part of it.
13

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,250
The less detail there is often the easier it is to make your models.
14

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,470
The other thing that it is, is it's a relative term.
15

16
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:13,640
So these two things can be used interchangeably as they are often low poly assets i.e. less polygons
16

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,450
in a simple mobile game for instance but low poly does change over time and that's something key to
17

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,290
understand.
18

19
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:29,900
So what we will call high poly back in 1990 would now be horrendously low poly and the same is true
19

20
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,220
now in the future.
20

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,910
I'm sure things will be different yet again.
21

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,750
So one of the things we need to first do is have a look at our model and make sure it's meeting the
22

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,300
criteria of being a low poly chess sets.
23

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:48,110
Now there's another reason for making sure things are low poly are that is low polygon count in case
24

25
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,310
you've been wondering and it just means it's a simple shape.
25

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,650
There are other types of workflow that ensure that the base geometry that you're able to edit and tweak
26

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,310
is as little as possible and as much as necessary.
27

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,640
So a couple of things that we can do and we'll look at very very shortly is alternatives to using that
28

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,460
bevel.
29

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,770
You may find that you want to use the bevel and it's ideal for your circumstance.
30

31
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,010
You need to make individual tweaks to that part of the mesh.
31

32
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,040
But if you can overall smooth out an object without having to use the bevel tool that could be a big
32

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,710
boon and there are a couple of ways that we can do that.
33

34
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,310
But for now rest assured we are about to make our model low poly again and we're going to do some subtracting
34

35
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,330
methods in order to do that.
35

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,160
And I'd love to hear what you think about low poly over in the discussion.
36

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,900
Do you like the style.
37

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,500
Do you loathe the style or always go for realism.
38

39
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,080
It's entirely up to you it's your choice and there is no right or wrong when it comes to it.
39

40
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,860
And if you're just going to cross your arms go Mike you know what I am going to do this a high poly
40

41
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,420
chess sets and I don't care I'm going to follow along the lectures I'm not going to make it really really
41

42
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,330
awesome that's also fine.
42

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,360
I encourage you to do so and I'd love to see them how they turn out.
43

44
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,790
So that's it on the discussion of low poly.
44

45
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,500
Let me know what you think it is over and the discussions and I'll see you all over in the next lecture.
