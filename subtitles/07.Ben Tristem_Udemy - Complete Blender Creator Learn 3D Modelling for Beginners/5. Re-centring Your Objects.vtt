Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to do a quick tip about recentering 
1

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.960
your objects.
2

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.190
Now at the moment we've got a situation where our origin is all the way in one top corner of our model
3

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.200
whereas realistically we want it somewhere else.
4

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.320
Now depending on how we're going to use our model will depend on where the origin goes.
5

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.110
But typically I would say if we go round to a top view here that will want to place it somewhere in
6

7
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.930
the middle.
7

8
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.370
There are a couple of ways of doing that.
8

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.010
You could indeed hop into edit mode and start moving your geometry around until it was accurate.
9

10
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.840
And because we know the size of our squares we could pretty much align it perfectly.
10

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.130
However that's not what I want to do.
11

12
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.370
That's that's not precise enough for me at this point in time.
12

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.020
It could be more than enough.
13

14
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.300
And there you go finished.
14

15
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.220
But what we want to do in this particular case is we can access the quick contextual menu by pressing
15

16
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.580
the right mouse button when we get that we get a series of options appear one of which is setting the
16

17
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.070
origin.
17

18
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.310
So one of the things that we can do is move the geometry to the origin which can be really useful.
18

19
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.150
But since the origins are already in the center of the scene that would be the one that we would pick.
19

20
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.800
So in order to really highlight that let's go ahead and just move this out of the way so it's really
20

21
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.030
really far from the origin.
21

22
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.380
So if we right click and set the origin geometry to origin so we know that the origin.
22

23
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.240
Well it looks like it's in the middle of the scene.
23

24
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.230
Let's go in check that's.
24

25
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.970
Let's go.
25

26
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.190
Whilst we're in object mode.
26

27
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.760
Bring open the sidebar.
27

28
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.140
And here we can see the location is 0 0 0.
28

29
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.210
So the location of the origin is smack bang in the middle of our world where we want it to be.
29

30
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.490
Okay.
30

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.800
So the next thing we need to do now we know that the origin is in the correct location is decide how
31

32
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.230
we're setting our origin.
32

33
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.970
So in this particular case because the geometry is not centered about the origin we can move the geometry
33

34
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.120
to the origin.
34

35
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.150
That's exactly what we want to do.
35

36
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.540
But whilst we're here let's have a look at those other options as well.
36

37
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.380
So let's undo that and do the origin to geometry.
37

38
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.000
You probably already guess what that one's going to do but we can see here now the origin is in the
38

39
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.470
middle of our geometry.
39

40
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.600
That's really useful because if our geometry was in a certain location and if we wanted to rotate it
40

41
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.660
around that geometry it will do that easily.
41

42
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.690
It wouldn't do that easily if it was elsewhere like so.
42

43
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.500
That's far far different.
43

44
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.420
Okay.
44

45
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.400
So the next one.
45

46
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.860
Let's just have a look.
46

47
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.620
What is the next one origin to 3D cursor.
47

48
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.480
We switch over to positioning the cursor.
48

49
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.810
All you can do that will shift and right click as well.
49

50
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.720
Then we can move the origins wherever the 3D cursor is so we can right click set origin to 3D cursor
50

51
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.170
again not that useful in this particular case but quite useful where we need to set a pivot points to
51

52
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.440
a very particular position.
52

53
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.620
And then finally, the final two come hand in hand with each other.
53

54
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.810
So we've got the center of mass according to the surface and the center of mass according to the volume.
54

55
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.900
And this is all to do with calculating physics and using the origin as that center of mass.
55

56
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.330
In this particular case that will do exactly the same as origins geometry because our geometry is infinitesimally
56

57
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.270
small so we don't need to worry about that.
57

58
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.980
But for the moment what we need to do is position our location of our origin to 0 0 0 right click set
58

59
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.800
of origin and move the geometry to the origin.
59

60
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.710
Perfect.
60

61
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.360
And there we go that's all aligned and set up and that hopefully gives you an idea about how we can
61

62
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.210
go ahead and move things around the origin and move the origin as well.
62

63
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.640
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
