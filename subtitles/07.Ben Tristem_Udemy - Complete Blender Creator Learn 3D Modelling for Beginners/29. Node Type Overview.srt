00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,830
WELCOME TO THE NO TYPE overview.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,330
In this video you will look at the nodes that are created for the textures we'll learn about the different

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,810
types of connection points and what the coloured dots are and which ones beat can be connected together

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,700
and what they would do.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,660
So let's hop straight on over into a blender.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,720
Right so over in blender.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,490
If you've not caught one already I'd like you to open up a window.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,380
That is the No.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,200
ED see using this selection tool on the head a bar of any of the other windows.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:41,130
I'm split mine in two just here and I'm going to switch it to the node editor.

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:47,680
Once you switch it to the node editor on the outliner itself you'll want to select one of the grass

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,530
blades that we've been using.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,840
And over in the node editor itself you should see three items.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,280
Now they're very small at the moment you can zoom in and out just like you can your 3D model.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,130
In fact a lot of what you've done before will apply to here.

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,900
So if you need to duplicate something you can if you need to move it around you do exactly the same

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,530
thing as you would do with your model and geometry.

18
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,830
So let's explore these nodes we have in front of us we have three nodes here all doing different things

19
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,790
and there are quite a few notes to pick from.

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,550
So first of all let's talk about the colours these dots that are based on all of the nodes and they

21
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,400
all do slightly different things.

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,550
And one important point to make here as you can see the image textured node is highlighted orange at

23
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,990
the moment.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,530
That's the selected node.

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,700
So the properties panel on the right hand side are going to shut it down in a moment to give me some

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,240
space or some more space anyway.

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:56,230
Now I do notice that use Alpha is ticked on the image and that is important because we need to use the

28
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:03,890
alpha channel to make sure that the background eventually of this grass blade becomes transparent.

29
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,220
So I'm going to give myself a little bit more space here.

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,940
By shutting down the properties panel of the node editor and you can use the N key to do that all the

31
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,180
little plus that exists here.

32
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,710
So there we go.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,400
We've now got a bigger view.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,030
And at the top here come scan to make this a little bigger.

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,190
So we can see what's going on.

36
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:32,420
And I'm going to view the thing we want to view which and then have to scroll down here and view selected.

37
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,550
And I'm going to switch into material mode an hour I'm not not selected on the layer.

38
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,370
So now I'm selected on the right layer now I can go view and view selected on a number pad full stop.

39
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,330
If you've got a number pad attached and here we go here's our our texture that we're working on.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
So what do all of these colours mean.

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,690
Well let's have a look at the colour one first of all.

42
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,860
So the colour ones are all yellow.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,480
And you can see that one is on the right hand side and one is on the left hand side.

44
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,330
And when you're connecting nodes you would generally only connect ones on an output side to the right

45
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,060
hand side of a node to the left hand side the input side of a node together.

46
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,450
So here we can see the colour is going from here to here.

47
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,920
So what does that yellow colour indicate.

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,170
Well it indicates that there are three values coming out of it's a red a green and a blue there.

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,830
They make up the colours.

50
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:37,690
So if we plug a yellow into a yellow it can receive all three bits of those colours without any loss.

51
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:45,070
Now if we were to plug it into a grey node those three values would be averaged out because a grey node

52
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,390
is just a single value.

53
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:56,740
Finally purple node is also three values and they usually do vectors or coordinates.

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,560
Now all of these things can be plugged into one another but sometimes it makes no sense to do so.

55
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,600
But we're going to explore how they're all connected together.

56
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,810
So just Siri iterate there's so a grey node like this alpha node here contains one value.

57
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,300
So let's play for a little bit let's plug the alpha channel into the colour instead.

58
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,260
So there's one value coming out of here and we can see that the image is turned into black and white.

59
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,000
And I'm in material mode at the moment.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,630
If you were in rended mode it would look black and grey.

61
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,200
But that's because the lighting is determining the level of this whiteness here.

62
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,280
So I'm going to switch back in to material on the viewport shading so we can see that this is coming

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,440
through to the colour.

64
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,170
And because Alpha only outputs a value per pixel by the way.

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,400
So each one of these pixels has an individual value.

66
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,580
And this is 1024 by a thousand and 24 so there's a lot of information coming through there but that's

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,300
a single value coming through and being plugged into a colour channel.

68
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,200
And what that will do is set all three values in the colour channel to one single value so if the Alpher

69
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,910
was black as it is here a value of zero all of the red green blue channels on the colour would be also

70
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,070
set to zero.

71
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,950
If the alpha channel was one i.e. white then what we will or have is the red green and blue all at the

72
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,050
value of 100 percent and that would make it white.

73
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,190
And that's why we're seeing it here.

74
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:34,420
Now when we plug the colour to the colour we get all of the R G B Red Green Blue values coming through.

75
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,140
Now you can do some very strange things when you're linking them together but in general you will not

76
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,560
always want to connect the same colour time together.

77
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:49,960
It will depend on what you're doing and the final colour that we've not dealt with yet is these green

78
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:58,540
blobs here now that they represent a shader Now that represents a description of how light will interact

79
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,210
with the surface or volume.

80
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:07,570
Now this in general should only really be connected to other green sockets but there are certain cases

81
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:14,680
where you may not want them so yellow and purple can be connected together without any loss of information

82
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:21,380
because they both contain at least three values r.g. B and probably X Y Z.

83
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,950
So they're pretty much the same under the hood.

84
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,820
Now Grey now that can be connected to yellow or purple without any loss of information because all three

85
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,410
values will be the same value as we've discussed when you play the Alpha Arin you get rgv of 1 or 0

86
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,810
in this case and the yellow and purple can be connected to grey.

87
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,830
But they will be averaged out.

88
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,200
So that's worthwhile knowing that connecting a yellow or purple to a grey node will average it out and

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,970
thus be losing some information.

90
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,010
Now it all depend on the application you're using.

91
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,600
But that can make a great difference.

92
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,870
Now interestingly when we link the owl for channel to the colour we will see that it does go black and

93
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,250
white.

94
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,700
And this enables us to create what's called a mask we can cover up certain parts of our image.

95
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:24,690
So that will allow us to make the background that was currently being shown as black transparence.

96
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,510
So in order to control the node editor itself you can use a lot of your prior knowledge that you have

97
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,900
using the 3D editor window.

98
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,270
So for instance if you need to add something.

99
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,080
We do have an ADD menu down here or you can use Shift A brilliant.

100
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,380
There's also a powerful search tool as well.

101
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,440
If you know what something is called.

102
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,020
Now when you go to add a node I will just go and add one.

103
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,940
Now let's go in.

104
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,680
Add anything at random colour mix.

105
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,810
RG And let's see what we get there so we can have as you can see it's got three inputs someone output

106
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,300
it outputs a colour based upon a value and two colours coming in.

107
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,560
Okay so it could be two textures coming in and then something else coming out.

108
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,060
Brilliant So that's a great way of mixing things there if I didn't want that.

109
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,160
I got the wrong thing.

110
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:18,290
I can press X and it will delete it's just like you can delete things in the 3D window.

111
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,880
There's also a search function as I just mentioned which allows you to search for things that you might

112
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,150
want.

113
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,570
So when we type in makes we get the mix.

114
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:32,880
RG be that we've just seen again and I can select that and add it in to our scene again and I'm going

115
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,270
to delete that again with the x key.

116
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,240
So a very powerful way of finding what you want.

117
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,990
Unfortunately some things are hidden away.

118
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,190
So for instance I know there's something called a multiply.

119
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,040
So if I go in and type multi nothing comes up.

120
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,310
Now the reason for that is it's hidden in another node and it changes the title of that node so under

121
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,640
converter there's something called maths.

122
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,010
And when we have that you can see at the moment it's called ADD.

123
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,810
But if we change it to something else it changes its name based upon this value here.

124
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,640
So as worthwhile bearing in mind sometimes you have to know what the shader is called in order to search

125
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,140
for it.

126
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,830
But it's not always going to be called the function you're using it for a okay.

127
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,310
So armed with those few bits of knowledge I've got a small challenge for you.

128
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,270
I would like you to add some notes.

129
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,940
So we need to tell blender that when light hits a black part of the image it needs to treat it as transparent.

130
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:43,050
So that's how light interacts with the surface at the node you'd use for that.

131
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,030
Then add a node that would mix the two different shaders together.

132
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,090
Clues in the name.

133
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:58,730
Use the alpha channel of the texture image control control the mix between the shaders.

134
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:06,490
And play with the connections and see how it effects the image to gain a better understanding of what

135
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,430
is happening.

136
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:16,580
Finally expect it to take a few minutes of linking things together and playing to work out the connections.

137
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,400
Hint very important here you only actually two additional shader modes supporter video now.

138
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,080
Challenge yourself and give that a go.

139
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,320
Okay guys.

140
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,620
Welcome back.

141
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,080
Now the solution to this one is going to be in the next lecture because I'm going to do a bit of playing

142
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,320
and a bit of further expansion on what you've done so I'll see you guys shortly in the next lecture.

143
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,120
Take care.
