1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,180
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,590
Let's jump straight into a challenge.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,430
Now this is going to test some of your basic knowledge here shouldn't take you too long to do this and

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,980
we're not looking for anything super high poly unless you're really going down that route.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,860
You need to decide on a scale at this point is a good time to finalize what you've been working on with

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,100
your planning.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,860
Now I am going to go on a four by four meter basis for my pieces.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,730
A church is a rather large building.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,760
I think if we make the pieces much smaller than that it's going to cause an issue when it comes to fitting

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,330
them all together and create a blank wall piece.

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:47,090
This is gonna be are so template piece that we're going to use for other parts in our scene and create

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,830
a doorway as well.

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,070
Now I'm gonna go ahead and use the boolean modifier to make my doorway and it's just gonna be a cutout

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,950
and archway in my wall piece.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,540
Now you may not go that approach and if you use a different approach that's absolutely fine.

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,260
In fact sometimes using the building modified can create horrible geometry just remember there's no

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,040
right or wrong here but I'd like to see your first modular pieces.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,800
Remember we're trying to make things that we can stick together here finally.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,360
I'd like you to go ahead and move the objects origin to the lower corner of your pieces.

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,630
So by default when you add a default cube it's right in the center.

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,400
If you were to lift that default cube up in edit mode it would be at the middle of the bottom which

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,950
is fine for some game engines.

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,230
But when we're snapping things together we can snap them together really quickly if they're actually

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,160
on the origin point itself where we wants to do that snapping.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,410
So if you put it in one of the lower corners then all of our pieces that we generate from the template

26
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,980
piece will also inherit the origin placements who don't have the FAF AROUND TOO MUCH.

27
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:57,210
OKAY SO GO AHEAD pause video now and I'll see you back in about five or ten minutes okay.

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,060
Everybody welcome back.

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,100
Let's go ahead and hop on over into blender and create our doorway okay.

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,920
So let's start building our doorway.

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,550
I want to start with you probably guessed it the default cube.

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,220
Here we go.

33
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,230
Okay.

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,860
Let's at this end and I'm going to go into edit mode so don't have to apply those transforms or you

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,140
scale on the y axis by point 1.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,890
Make it nice and narrow and then we have to consider the origin.

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,240
Now most game engines you won't want the origin being in the in the middle like that maybe at the bottom.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,270
So if we went GZ 1 we've now got the origin at the bottom but that's in some game engines is going to

39
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,540
be what you want or for a particular component.

40
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,230
However for modular pieces especially with unity and unreal you'll typically wants your origin of your

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,950
object being in the same corner on all of your pieces.

42
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,960
And I'm going to pop it on this corner here.

43
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,030
So we've vertex select selected.

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,310
I'm selecting that lower vertex.

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,460
I will go shift an S and move the cursor to selected go back into object mode right click on our object

46
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,190
and set its origin to a 3d cursor that's fine.

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,910
And then if you've not got this window open you can do it over in the object properties as well but

48
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,090
I'm going to set that to zero.

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,320
Now this is basically positive x positive y going off here at the top of the screen.

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,610
So all of our pieces that fit together should be like that and then we won't have any or even many problems

51
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,540
when snapping them together externally.

52
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,820
Okay.

53
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,610
Final issue here is it's called cube let's call it a wall which is fine and it's currently two meters

54
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,800
by two meters.

55
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,540
I think I'm going to want it larger than that so I'm going to go into edit mode.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
Now we could scale it from its origin point.

57
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,240
So we go out and scale it and you see there it's going to actually scale from there which is exactly

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,750
what we want.

59
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,610
We could just get it by 2 and apply that but I also want to take this opportunity to show you that I

60
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:00,120
could go and change the pivot point to the active element which is that lower corner and scale it and

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,430
then select everything making sure that's the active selected and then scale everything as well.

62
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,190
So two ways that do exactly the same thing.

63
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,540
One of them keeps you in edit mode.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,300
Okay.

65
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,680
This map of what we want to create I'm going to scale it up by a factor of 10.

66
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,840
I'm going to apply that scale and then I'm just gonna hide it out of the way with the.

67
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,960
OK.

68
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,250
We have a wall piece here.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,170
Let's go ahead and duplicate it and then our duplicate let's call it a doorway.

70
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,410
Absolutely fine.

71
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,860
And we see here that we've got two objects in our scene.

72
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,730
That's a part of the same category but not collected together into that category.

73
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,750
So let's create a new collection with the doorway selected.

74
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm going to hold down control and select the wall over in the outline.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,860
Once we've done that we press the M K for mother on the keyboard and a new collection and I should call

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,460
this building so a window will go in there and other pieces as well.

77
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,890
Okay brilliant.

78
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,490
So the next thing that I want to do is make a cutout in this doorway and to hide my wall to do that.

79
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,520
And you may notice as I go ahead and click the icon I've missing a few icons that I had before.

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,680
I've recently done a little upgrade on my computer so we've got the standard installation here so I'm

81
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,550
going to go into my filters and just turn back on whether or not it's showing in view ports and the

82
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,770
camera icon there for the render whether it appears in renders in fact the image that I've got I never

83
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,860
want it to appear in a render so I'm going to turn that's off.

84
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,950
Now there are plenty of ways we can make a doorway.

85
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:41,370
You could use the mirror modifier and just literally put together a series of edges and faces together

86
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,690
to make that objects.

87
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
That's absolutely fine.

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,420
I'm going to go for the boolean modifier.

89
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,760
I don't think I'm going to have any issues with it making a mess of my mesh.

90
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,240
Now there are a couple of ways of doing this.

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm going to add a cylinder in as my base cuts and then I'm going to do a bit of manipulation so that

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,500
cylinder.

93
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,670
So let's go ahead add in a cylinder.

94
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,690
I'm going to have to rotate it round so rotated on the x axis by 90.

95
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,630
I'm going to place it in the middle of my objects which is which is on the x axis too but not the y

96
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,220
axis too.

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,130
Let's make that zero.

98
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,640
Okay so that's cutting all the way through.

99
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,100
That's absolutely fine.

100
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,560
And we can just check what we're doing with the doorway selected.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,860
I want to go to my modifiers boolean modifier and a different object will be the cylinder and we can

102
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,440
see it's cutting through absolutely fine.

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,650
Let's grab the cylinder and I'm gonna select all of the top edges there.

104
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,940
So I'm going to use control and plus to expand my selection and that failed miserably from there so

105
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,910
let's go ahead and manually select all of these.

106
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:51,030
Now you could use the circle select tool with the C just whizzed down there but we don't want the one

107
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,160
that's at the bottom there because we want to pull this up before we do anything else with it.

108
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,760
So we've got a straight bit of our door first.

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,440
Okay I'm gonna go g.

110
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,450
Oh I need to right click to get rid of circle selectable GZ and I'm just gonna lift that up.

111
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,840
There we go.

112
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,320
We've got some street corners that's what I wanted so no lift out by one to begin with and then I'm

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,560
gonna grab this top bit and I'm gonna scale it up from there and I want it to go to about three meters

114
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,190
tall I think.

115
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,590
Okay let's go G.

116
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,980
Z and pull that up and we get a spike.

117
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,830
Do we want that.

118
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,850
No we don't.

119
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,180
Let's use proportional editing.

120
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,160
So at the top here we've got proportional editing.

121
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,200
I'm gonna leave it's set to smooth.

122
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,220
I think maybe inverse square we can play with these settings and see what we get but smooth usually

123
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,630
is pretty good for this type of thing there we go.

124
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,240
And I can just bring that out.

125
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,060
So I'm going to put in three.

126
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,050
Oh no I don't want it to go up by three meters.

127
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,790
I think it's just one meter that is going up.

128
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:50,960
Yep.

129
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,110
There we go.

130
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,710
And then it's a matter of using the mouse wheel to just adjust how Archie are archway happens to be

131
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,650
I think that looks pretty good.

132
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,500
Okay.

133
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,040
The final thing I'm want to do here is apply that modifier.

134
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,060
We could just hide the out the way so we can edit it later.

135
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,560
It's a good way to check it first.

136
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,010
And I think that looks that looks absolutely fine.

137
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:22,030
Now one of the things here is if you have vertices that are lining up between your boolean cuts and

138
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,360
the final piece you end up with it being hollow.

139
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,040
We're going to have to fill that in in a moment so that select this apply a boolean modifier.

140
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,250
Get rid of our cylinder.

141
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,310
You may want to keep yours if you've come to this approach.

142
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,220
I'm quite happy getting rid of it and carrying on.

143
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,550
Now in order to fill this in I'm going to go into edit mode.

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,170
I'm going to select this lower edge.

145
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,570
Oh no I can't do edges first.

146
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm going to go to vertex select and select the four vertices that make up this area.

147
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,580
Here I want to fill in and fill it in.

148
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,160
Then I can go ahead and select this edge and watch how cool this is.

149
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,510
If you just press the f k it will just continue to fill in.

150
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,030
Perfect.

151
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,310
Okay.

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,490
I'm almost done with my archway here.

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,340
The final things that I wanted to discuss with you are the fact that this looks pretty symmetrical so

154
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,780
there is an argument to be said that we should cut it in half.

155
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,120
Certainly this way a mirror modify it.

156
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,070
And here as well.

157
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,900
Now I'm not going to do that at the moment there and I can't cut it in half because there's a big end

158
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,050
gun here says a topology we might need to sort out in a bit but we can cut it in half.

159
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,410
Both along its x and y axis and then mirror it.

160
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,920
But first of all let's have some more detail to mirror.

161
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,450
Otherwise there's no point at this point in time we're just doing extra work for nothing.

162
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:43,770
Okay.

163
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,380
Brilliant.

164
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,490
How did you guys get on.

165
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,070
What did your archways look like.

166
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,010
What sort of sort of scale have you gotten for be interested to see.

167
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,480
Please show your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
