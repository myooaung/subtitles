1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,818
As part of this course, I provided you with a starter template.

2
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:10,266
It contains all of the non-Spring Batch dependencies and configurations.

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:15,217
This project will be the foundation for configuring a new Spring Batch job.

4
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:17,924
Let's see how you can get the project locally so that you

5
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:21,246
can follow along with the demonstration.

6
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:25,104
The application template can be found in the demo files for this course.

7
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:32,527
You can also retrieve the latest code from my GitHub site at github.

8
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:35,972
com/michaelhoffmantech/patient-batch-loader.

9
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:39,013
I've tagged the initial template with the name Start.

10
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:43,111
I'll be showing you the retrieval of this project from GitHub shortly.

11
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,422
There are several prerequisites you'll need to follow along

12
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:47,556
with the demonstrations in the course.

13
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:52,351
First, you will need the latest version of the Java Development Kit, 1.

14
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:52,677
8.

15
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,945
Note you can use version 9; however,

16
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:57,427
there will be some additional modifications needed to

17
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:59,620
support dependent modules like JAXB.

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,077
I won't be demonstrating installation of this in the course.

19
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:07,863
Next, the application uses Gradle for its build tool.

20
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:09,271
I've included the Gradle wrapper,

21
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,488
so you should not have to download anything to support it.

22
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:17,422
I'm using the latest version of Git for supporting the project in GitHub.

23
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,696
I'm using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE; however,

24
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:24,095
please feel free to choose the IDE of your liking.

25
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:29,043
This project is leveraging the release version of Spring Boot, version 2.

26
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:29,455
0.

27
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:30,256
As version 2.

28
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,192
0 was just released at the time of writing this course,

29
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:37,672
it's recommended that you upgrade to the latest minor version as it's released.

30
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:41,197
Finally, this course will focus on Spring Batch version 4.

31
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:46,990
0, which is the latest as of the writing of this course.

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,385
I'm going to show you where you can download the project from if

33
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:51,810
you would prefer to retrieve it from GitHub.

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,676
I'll be displaying the Releases page of the project found at the URL shown.

35
00:01:56,676 --> 00:01:59,682
Let's look at that page now.

36
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:02,680
Here I'm showing the project page on GitHub.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,985
Again, the URL is github.

38
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,246
com/michaelhoffmantech/patient-batch-loader.

39
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,373
I'm on the Releases page.

40
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,925
From here, you can download assets.

41
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:20,530
Depending on your OS, you could either download a Zip file or a Gzip file.

42
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,712
Now once that download's complete,

43
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:25,005
you can move it into whatever folder you want for the project.

44
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:30,566
Now, let's look at a description of the project contents.

45
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,708
While I don't plan to review every line of the template application,

46
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,740
I do want to give you a high-level overview of the files in the structure.

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,138
Let's start with the root directory of the project.

48
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:46,038
The data folder contains a few sample files of dummy patient data.

49
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:51,091
These data files will be used for testing during the demonstrations.

50
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:55,623
The gradle folder includes additional scripts that extend the main build script.

51
00:02:55,623 --> 00:03:00,057
There is a script that supports build tasks specific to a Spring profile.

52
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:05,711
Also, there's a script that is specific to Liquibase database schema management.

53
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:06,555
As you would expect,

54
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:08,666
the src folder contains all of the main and test

55
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,815
source code for the application.

56
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,674
The build.

57
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:16,869
gradle file contains the build script and dependencies for the application.

58
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:18,525
And finally, the gradle.

59
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:23,031
properties file contains externalized properties for the Gradle build scripts.

60
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:26,356
Next, let's look at the resources folder.

61
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:30,989
Under the folder src/main/resources/config are several

62
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,106
properties used throughout the application.

63
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:37,647
The liquibase folder contains the database schema

64
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,946
management files used by Liquibase.

65
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,899
If you're not familiar with Liquibase,

66
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:44,641
it supports schema management and versioning for databases.

67
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:50,143
We'll be using it to prepopulate database objects when starting the application.

68
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,554
The file application.

69
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:55,315
yml provides the base properties for the application.

70
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,938
It includes properties such as the application name,

71
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,621
JPA settings, and management configuration.

72
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:02,648
The file application-dev.

73
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:06,109
yml contains properties that are only used when

74
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,868
running the development Spring profile.

75
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:10,930
This includes the development data source configuration,

76
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,157
H2 configuration, and Liquibase configuration.

77
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:15,735
The file application-prod.

78
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:20,338
yml contains properties only used when writing the production Spring profile.

79
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:25,982
The final item I want to cover is the DatabaseConfiguration class.

80
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:28,419
One of the primary goals of Spring Boot is to be opinionated out of

81
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,690
the box and then back away as requirements dictate.

82
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,591
With Spring Batch,

83
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:36,322
it's been my experience that it's best to overwrite Spring Boot's

84
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:39,410
database configuration right from the start.

85
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,596
By configuring Beans for the EntityManagerFactory,

86
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:42,775
DataSource, and TransactionManager,

87
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:46,894
you get visibility and gain control over these dependencies when

88
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:50,325
they are wired into the Spring Batch configuration.

89
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,922
We're going to see more of this as we go along.

90
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:55,357
With this overview of the application template complete,

91
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:57,471
you should have everything you need to continue with the

92
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,612
demos for the remainder of this course.

93
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:02,234
In this module,

94
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,515
I showed you the steps needed to get started with the

95
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,206
remaining demonstrations in this course.

96
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:11,110
I started by showing you the location for retrieving the project template.

97
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,199
I also provided you with the prerequisites needed to get the

98
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,255
project up and running in your local environment.

99
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:22,001
Next, I walked through the structure of folders and files in the project.

100
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:33,000
You saw the location of key aspects including configurations and properties. Now let's get started with configuring the project for Spring Batch.
