Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:08.805
My name is Michael Hoffman, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:10.234
Getting Started with Spring Batch.

4
00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:12.595
Along with being an author here at Pluralsight,

5
00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:17.701
I'm also a Senior Technical Architect at NVISIA based out of beautiful Chicago,

6
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:18.200
Illinois.

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.117
Processing data in batch is one of the oldest concepts found in technology.

8
00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:23.207
Despite its maturity,

9
00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:25.763
getting started with batch processing can present

10
00:00:25.763 --> 00:00:28.022
you with a variety of challenges.

11
00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:31.330
Just understanding the terminology for batch processing can be daunting.

12
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.359
How can you overcome these challenges to start building out your own batch jobs?

13
00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:36.075
In this course,

14
00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:38.462
I'll show you how to get started with batch processing

15
00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:40.055
using the Spring Batch framework.

16
00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.757
Spring Batch is one of the oldest and most mature

17
00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:46.211
open-source libraries for supporting batch.

18
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:49.455
Some of the major topics that we're going to cover include an

19
00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:51.490
overview of Spring Batch's concepts and features,

20
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.634
the configuration of a Spring Batch application,

21
00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:58.281
and the creation of a Spring Batch job that includes reading from a file,

22
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:02.134
processing data, and then outputting that data to a database.

23
00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:03.528
By the end of this course,

24
00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:06.052
you'll gain an understanding of Spring Batch while creating

25
00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:08.690
a foundation for your own batch jobs.

26
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.851
Before beginning the course,

27
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:13.786
you should have some familiarity with Java and the Spring Framework.

28
00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:16.876
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Spring Batch with

29
00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:25.000
the Getting Started with Spring Batch course, here at Pluralsight.
