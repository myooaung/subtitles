00:00:02.413 --> 00:00:04.485
To complete the discussion on the ItemWriter,

2
00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.657
I'm going to demonstrate running the full batch job

3
00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:10.055
using the fully implemented ItemReader, ItemProcessor,

4
00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:10.874
and ItemWriter.

5
00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:16.090
I'm also going to use the full test file to verify functionality.

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.542
Note that I'll be following Demo 22 found in the DEMOS.

7
00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.139
md file in the root project directory.

8
00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:27.786
With the ItemReader, Processor, and Writer in place,

9
00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:30.248
let's try to execute the full batch job.

10
00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:31.131
In the toolbar,

11
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.982
make sure the PatientBatchLoaderApp is selected and run your server.

12
00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:40.772
With the Batch Application running successfully, I can open up the REST client.

13
00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:43.397
I'm going to once again use the method of GET,

14
00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:48.219
the host and port as localhost:8080, but I'm going to change the path.

15
00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.581
Instead of using this path, I'm going to instead use test.

16
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:52.977
csv.

17
00:00:52.977 --> 00:00:54.601
Let me change that now.

18
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.550
This will run the full file.

19
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.131
If the job is successful, we're going to again see a Success message.

20
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:03.628
Let's try that now, and we see Success.

21
00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:06.251
Now let's check the runtime log.

22
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:09.474
Verify that you see a line noting the start of the job and a

23
00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.837
line that denotes success for the job.

24
00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:15.512
To complete the verification, let's open up a browser.

25
00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:20.076
I've once again navigated to the H2 Console at localhost:8080/console,

26
00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:25.038
and I've entered in the default settings for the form.

27
00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:28.179
I'm going to click Connect, and once I connect,

28
00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.122
I'm going to select the PATIENT table.

29
00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.363
This added a query to the SQL console,

30
00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:35.930
and it's going to select all of the patient records for me.

31
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.781
Let's run that.

32
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:38.483
If I scroll to the bottom,

33
00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:42.179
I'm going to see that the job processed successfully and I have

34
00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:50.000
a total of 1000 rows in the database table. This completes the execution of the full batch job.
