1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:06,496
With the PatientEntity type in place, I can now implement an item processor.

2
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:10,957
Note again that I'm defining the processor as a Bean and annotating it with

3
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:14,872
StepScope in case I wanted to access the step context.

4
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:19,291
Unlike the stub implementation, I'm now returning a Java function.

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,961
For our simple transformation, this works well; however,

6
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,384
more complex transformations may take a different strategy for processing.

7
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:31,337
Oftentimes this includes the implementation of chain processing,

8
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:33,769
which is outside of the scope of this course.

9
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,390
Note that this processor method will return the PatientEntity

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,855
instance transformed from the PatientRecord instance.

11
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,629
With the exception of the birthdate,

12
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,123
all fields map directly from the input to the entity.

13
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:49,920
I've included a transformation of the birthdate as I wanted

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,545
to save it as a date type in the database.

15
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:57,301
Now let's add this item processor to the project.

16
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,393
I'm going to add the new item processor logic to

17
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:02,621
the BatchJobConfiguration class.

18
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:05,479
This also requires some clean up of the stub processor,

19
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,238
as well as update of the job step configuration.

20
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:13,094
Note that I'll be following Demo 16 found in the DEMOS.

21
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:16,910
md file in the root project directory.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,911
I'm going to implement the full item processor for this demo.

23
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:20,881
To do this,

24
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,793
I first need to remove the stub implementation and

25
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:27,150
update the job step configuration.

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,943
Open up the BatchJobConfiguration class.

27
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:34,263
I'm going to scroll down to the existing processor method,

28
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:36,273
and I'll simply just remove it.

29
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:41,453
Now I'm going to drop in the updated item processor code to the class.

30
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:44,587
The item processor simply returns the Java function.

31
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:48,639
I'm mapping each field of the PatientRecord to a PatientEntity attribute.

32
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:49,999
For the birthdate,

33
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:55,228
I've converted it into the format that it's expected by the database.

34
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,867
Now I need to wire the new processor into the job step.

35
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,305
Let's scroll up to that.

36
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:06,275
I'm going to replace the existing job step Bean with updated code.

37
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,333
I've made a few updates in the step.

38
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:12,254
First, I'm now passing in the processor as an argument to the method.

39
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:15,797
I've also updated the chunk call to use the

40
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:18,565
PatientEntity type in place of PatientRecord.

41
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:18,907
Finally,

42
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:23,369
I've updated the processor call to use the processor passed in the method.

43
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:26,577
Since I've changed the type for PatientRecord to PatientEntity,

44
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:29,574
I now have to update the writer.

45
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:31,625
I'm going to scroll down to the writer method now,

46
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,546
and I'm going to replace it with updated code.

47
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:38,203
I simply switched all references to PatientRecord in

48
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:40,480
the writer with PatientEntity.

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:51,000
When I execute the job, it will now output the PatientEntity data on write. That completes the demo for creating the item processor.
