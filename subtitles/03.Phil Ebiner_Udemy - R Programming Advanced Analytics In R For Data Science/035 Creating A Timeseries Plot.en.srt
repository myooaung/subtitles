00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,810
Hello.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,240
Welcome back to the advanced course in our programming.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,430
Today we're finally going to get to the fun stuff.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,670
We're going to build the time series plot.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,190
So let's dive straight into it.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,560
If you do not have G-G plot 2 installed on your machine then please run this line.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,590
Install packages and then in quotation marks G-G plot 2.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,550
If you do have it no need to run the Slyne.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,180
Just make sure that you connect this package just by running this line of the library.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,390
So if you don't have Did you plot to first try this and then run this line.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,000
If you do then just run this line.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,510
There we go.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,970
Now we've connected G-G plot 2 and now we can start building our plot.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,760
So once again if you haven't done the basic course on our programming then I hope you're familiar with

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,690
the plot too.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,820
If you have then this is all going to be very simple stuff that we have discussed in the basic course

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:12,120
so p is going to be G-G plot and we are going to specify the data as you tell because we want all of

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,600
the machines right in our plot not just the one.

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,850
And here we go to say maybe let's make some more room right away because it's going to be quite big

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,110
.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,320
OK we can say P plus genome point.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,500
Actually not we don't want to point to on line.

23
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,520
Jim line.

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,610
And now we are going to create some statics aesthetics on the X-axis we want POSIX time and this is

25
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,630
how you create a time series plot.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,570
It's that simple and why is utilization common.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,910
Well it's just start of that so let's see what how that looks while right.

28
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,970
That's a lot of.

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,150
Can't see anything there.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,460
Let's see if we can make it a bit prettier.

31
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,470
OK let's say we want color equals machine.

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,830
Let's try that.

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,080
OK very very thin.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,510
And they're kind of covering each other up so first this make them a bit thicker so we going to add

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:06,970
size.

36
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,830
But just a quick reminder this inside aesthetics are really doing is where a mapping variables.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,930
So when or we're mapping aesthetics when we have an aesthetic like X Y and color we're mapping them

38
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,990
to variables inside odorata or frame.

39
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,450
Now we want to add size.

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,450
It's not going to be mapped.

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,650
It's going to be actually just set to a certain value.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,900
That's why it has to be outside of this static function.

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,840
So here we can say size equals one point two.

44
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,100
Let's have a look at that fire on that.

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,310
OK so it's a bit thicker now but there still overlapping What do we do in stuff like this happens.

46
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,910
What do we remember from the basic course.

47
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,050
We add a facet grid.

48
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,490
Right.

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,630
We want to separate all of these colors into separate charts.

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,630
Facit grid.

51
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,790
And what are we separated by a machine.

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,510
Tilda Daut ants run this.

53
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,800
OK.

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,010
Looks much better now right.

55
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,660
Looks much better and by the way if you've done that bonce course on Tablo you might be quite familiar

56
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,640
with this chart already.

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,550
And now we're going to say plus here we're going to go over and above a little bit.

58
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:25,110
We like this chart is pretty much ready but what are we going to do is we going to add a horizontal

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,490
line at zero at the 90 percent mark over here.

60
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:29,940
Why.

61
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,140
Well that is because that is our threshold right.

62
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,220
The low threshold and we just want kind of highlighted for the user.

63
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:46,170
So we'll just say Jorm underscore horizontal line and then here what we need is y intercept and that's

64
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,980
going to be nine t commom colorless.

65
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,260
Give it some color.

66
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,720
Oh well let's let's forget about the color for now.

67
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,230
Let's just run this and see how this goes.

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:06,300
Since it's very dark is black Let's make it a bit lighter color gray and then we'll say size as well

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,340
.

70
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,630
Equals one point two.

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,240
All right let's run that before I show you the next shrink.

72
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:19,460
So far on that is yoga is looking better right but now so that it doesn't look like so important because

73
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:26,090
he can even confuse it with the bottom of the axis here as opposed to like these white lines which are

74
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,450
separated which are the actual separators.

75
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,550
What I would do is say a line type equals three.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You can look up line time for G.G. plot and you'll see that here it tells you one is solid.

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,080
Zero is blank one assaulters dash three started on we're going to be using for his dot dash fives long

78
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,330
dash to six to dash and plus then you can use other combinations if you like specify quotation marks

79
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,940
.

80
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,830
We won't get into that we'll just say a line type 3.

81
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,580
So let's run that.

82
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,850
So here you can see that now it's a bit more subtle.

83
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,400
It's a subtle line and right away like somebody who is analyzing the report will be able to see.

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,590
OK so this machine has dropped below 90 percent utilization.

85
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,680
This machine hasn't this machine hasn't this machine kind of.

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,660
Hasn't this machine has tried so very very easy to quickly analyze it and all we had to do is just altogether

87
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:31,420
that's you know six seven seven lines and lines of code to bring this beautiful plot to life and to

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,700
finish off what we're going to do is we're going to save this plot so we'll just say take this and put

89
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,760
it into a object.

90
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,400
Let's say my plot like that and you will see why we're doing it right.

91
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,280
Just in a second.

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,180
So there we go.

93
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,050
So that's the plot.

94
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:56,260
Now we've saved this actual plot into my plot so if I run that that creates my plot object.

95
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,200
And now we want to add this to a list.

96
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,380
So if I go a list on the score of.

97
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,390
And yes we can add even a picture into a list or a plot.

98
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,490
So I'm creating a new component which is going to be called plot and I'm going to add my plot into the

99
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,330
list if I run that and I look at list and the score of one is going to be interesting so if I run that

100
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,150
all right let's just look at that again.

101
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,990
See like it's printing out everything.

102
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,120
It's printing out all component 1 2 3 4 5 which is our daughter frame and even our plot six.

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,500
But the plot is kind of like empty here why.

104
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,700
Well that's because actually printing this blood so I can prove that to you I'm just going to delete

105
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:49,080
all the applause from my our studio and if I run just this last line you'll see that the plot appears

106
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,450
again.

107
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,510
Right.

108
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,070
So that means that when you actually print the plot it prints a plot here.

109
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:03,480
And moreover if I look at a summary of list underscore all one you'll see that here it's added the plot

110
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:11,630
line nine and that is because when we look at the next item you'll see why it's length 9 Klaas's G.G.

111
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:20,430
and it's it's actually plots are stored as lists them selfs or the mode of this is a list so let's just

112
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,110
quickly look at the SDR faade going into too much detail on that.

113
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,600
Let's look at it as C-R.

114
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:32,700
You'll see that we've got this new item added over here which is just huge.

115
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,300
So there's that machine component that's low threshold.

116
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,430
Unknown hours then our daughter component and it ends and so we're here.

117
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,950
So this is everything we had before.

118
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,860
Once we've added the plot as it gets it's actually also a list of nine but we won't go into detail on

119
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,470
that because that's the inner workings of G-G plot how it stores its plots.

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,910
And that's that's something you can explore on your own if you're interested in that.

121
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,450
But basically this is all the information about the plot.

122
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:09,840
It's stored here so basically anybody who gets access to this list that we've created will be able to

123
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,150
recreate the plot and that's exactly what we wanted right so now we have this beautiful list which is

124
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,750
called list.

125
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:24,090
Underscore are all one and if we want to pass it on to anybody then they'll be able to extract all of

126
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:30,560
the information all the insights that they have been after or they were after which are Allium the sheet

127
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:37,920
name the stats for that machine that are a low threshold test the unknown hours the data for that specific

128
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,500
machine.

129
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,140
And moreover they'll even get the plot for all of the machines everything is included in this one list

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,940
as you can see lists are extremely convenient in terms of even just arranging your analysis just organizing

131
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,530
your workspace and how you analyze your data.

132
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,240
Very very convenient tool to have.

133
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,740
There we go.

134
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,140
That's how you add a beautiful plot into your list.

135
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,280
And I look forward see you next time.

136
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,710
Until then happy coding

137
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,890
.
