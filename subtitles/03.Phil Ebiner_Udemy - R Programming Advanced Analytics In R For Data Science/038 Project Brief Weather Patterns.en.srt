00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,230
Hello welcome back to the advanced course in our programming I hope you enjoyed the previous section

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,290
.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,700
And today we've got another exciting challenge ahead of us.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,750
We're talking about weather patterns.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's dive straight into it.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,230
You're working on a project for a meteorology bureau.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,970
You have been supplied with a daughter for four cities in the U.S. Chicago New York Houston and San

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,830
Francisco.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,770
You are required to deliver the following output.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,400
Before we jump to the outputs Let's have a look at the data set because otherwise it's going to be hard

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,320
to understand the outputs.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,540
All right so let's quickly proceed to the data center and we'll come back here.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,860
All right so where is the data set as usual.

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,930
It's at super data science dot com slash are of course one word HIF and advanced.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,480
If you scroll down here you will find a section for Applied family a function the challenge and then

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,560
the weather data that's what you need to download and this time it's a zip file.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,250
So there's a few files in there and that's why they've been zipped together.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,390
And once you download it and open it up this is where to look like.

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,370
So it's got eight files in total four cities and two files for every city.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,690
So let's have a look at them like this we won't even open them because on a Mac you can do this which

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,930
is quite convenient.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:26,280
So for instance there's Chicago with Celsius all the European system so the metric system not the empirical

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,040
system we've got Celsius Celsius millimeters days of precipitation and hours of sunshine so we've got

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,860
five metrics that are being observed.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,510
And then we've got every single month of the year.

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,860
So what is this actually before we describe what it is.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,470
I'm going to show you the Fahrenheit one so this is the empirical system we've got the aincha inches

28
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,440
here and we've got Fahrenheit in terms of temperature.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,680
And even though personally I'm used to Celsius in this section I'm going to switch around because all

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,500
the time in this course in my course as we talk about Celsius and we talk about millimeters and so basically

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,610
the metric system.

32
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,860
And I thought you know what this time I'm going to do a favor to those students who are from the US

33
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:18,050
because you know they've had to cope with all of these metric terms all the time so maybe for once we're

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,010
going to work with Fahrenheit and inches so and the tutorials I'm going to use the Fahrenheit versions

35
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,440
feel free to use either just stick to one which have on issues either Celsius or Fahrenheit and just

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,190
use that.

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,480
But if you want a full to follow long and tutorials exactly like I am doing it then use the Fahrenheit

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,000
ones.

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,680
And good news for those who are from Europe.

40
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,720
You'll be in the same boat as me where I'm not that comfortable with these terms anyway.

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,070
But still we'll be able to do that.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,810
Alisyn.

43
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,110
All right so let's discuss this file for instance.

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,680
This is Chicago and it's got Fahrenheit.

45
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,060
The average high right.

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,090
So what does that mean.

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:03:02,080
That means that within many many years which is I think from memory it was from 1962 2010.

48
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:08,490
So three of these data sets all three of them so choose Chicago Houston and San Francisco are measured

49
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,730
or was 19.

50
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,720
No it was in 1982 2010.

51
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,160
So that 30 year period and New York was 1962 to 1992.

52
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,790
So also a 30 year period.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,400
But basically what they did is they measured the highest temperature in January for those 30 years and

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,810
then they said OK so what's the average of the highest temperatures in January for those 30 years.

55
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,440
And it turned out to be 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,290
So be careful.

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,320
Fahrenheit here it's not that hot.

58
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,880
It's about zero in Celsius.

59
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:47,790
So then they did this in February March so every time in those 30 years it took July of 30 July months

60
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,610
and out of them they said What is the highest temperature every time in July and then they said OK what's

61
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,320
the average of that.

62
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,000
And that's how this number came to be.

63
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,860
Same thing for the next row.

64
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,290
Oh they took for instance here they took May it took 13 months of May they said what's the lowest temperature

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,360
every time in May.

66
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,170
And then they took the average of those.

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,370
So you kind of see how on average the temperature changes throughout the year.

68
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,840
So the maximum temperature per month and the minimum temperature per month then precipitation in inches

69
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:16,860
.

70
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,570
Same thing.

71
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,700
So what was the average What was the precipitation.

72
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,260
How much rainfall was there in every one of those that say August 30 times.

73
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,510
They took three months of August in a row.

74
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,100
How much per station was there and then they said again what's the average.

75
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,440
The same thing with days of precipitation how many rainy days were there.

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,000
This one is easier on how many rainy days were there in October in Chicago over 30 years.

77
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,250
Right.

78
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,230
And then they said on average how many it's about 10 rainy days and on average in October so if it's

79
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,410
October in Chicago right now and you're watching this then expect to have about 10 rainy days hours

80
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,220
of sunshine.

81
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,480
Same thing how many hours of sunshine was there in February.

82
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,590
So 30 February's in a row.

83
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,170
And then what's the average 36 hours.

84
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,590
So that's how all of these data centers are structured propitious often like this.

85
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:13,500
So there's there's Chicago there's Houston right so you can see right away where more sunshine and also

86
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,090
a lot more precipitation which I was not expect.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,100
Never been to Houston but interesting new york.

88
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,400
While New York's got the record for precipitation out of all of them or for the rainy days something

89
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:33,830
some were there and then also you've got San Francisco with the most shiny or sunny days.

90
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,150
So we got 330 hours here which is probably the maximum and we'll we'll get all of these things throughout

91
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,790
this challenge.

92
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,770
All right so hopefully now you're a bit more comfortable with the data sets that we have.

93
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,860
And now I'm going to go back to the challenge so that now we're there we can look at what's required

94
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,840
of us.

95
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,110
All right.

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
So what is required.

97
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,950
You're required to deliver the falling outputs at table showing the annual average as of each observed

98
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,800
metric for every city.

99
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,150
So we need to average out you know how we have the monthly metrics although we have the metric split

100
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,210
by month we need to average them out for every city.

101
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,930
And so we'll say for Chicago the average days of precipitation out of the ones that we saw is this.

102
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,460
And then we need to create a table.

103
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,230
So we'll have metrics and we'll have the cities in that table so it'll be like kind of a matrix see

104
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,320
.

105
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,620
It's interesting how they say how they say how Kyrle road here table and not a frame or matrix so we're

106
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,080
going to have to actually decide that for ourselves a table showing by how much temperature fluctuates

107
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:41,020
each month from minimum to maximum in percentage terms take minimum temperature as the base.

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,140
This might sound a bit confusing but basically what we know the minimum so we know the average minimum

109
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,820
for January we know the average maximum for January.

110
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,570
So what's the difference between them and divide that by the minimum because we take the minimum as

111
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,560
the base.

112
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,100
Right.

113
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,430
So we'll we'll discuss this more in the clause.

114
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
But it should kind of make sense.

115
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,660
So basically what's the relative fluctuation in temperature for every city between the minimum and the

116
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,120
maximum throughout the year.

117
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,930
Next a table showing the annual maximums of each observed metric for every seat.

118
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,480
So it's pretty much the same as the first deliverable.

119
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,080
But here it's maximums there's averages and the fourth deliverable is annual minimums and you'll see

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,340
why they comes third and fourth instead of second and third because it's harder to get to them.

121
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,540
It's there's pre-built functions to do this.

122
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,640
We'll do it very quickly will be very easy.

123
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,710
But then this it'll take us pretty much till the end of this section to learn how to do something like

124
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:43,230
that and not that that is the goal of our section to learn how to drive these maximums and minimums

125
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,770
.

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:52,410
It's just that the techniques that we're going to be learning about apply functions only quite sophisticated

127
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,190
techniques will allow us to get to these values.

128
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,490
And finally a table showing in which months the annual maximums for each metric were observed in every

129
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,240
city.

130
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,770
So and this is going to be a very advanced tutorial you'll see that it's actually towards the end of

131
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:14,940
the section actually has a label advanced because in this specific case we're going to need to use quite

132
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,280
a lot of different combinations.

133
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,690
And if you get to that tutorial if you successfully completed then my congratulations to that means

134
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,930
you've mastered this section in its entirety.

135
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,180
But you know it's quite a long way away.

136
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,990
We've got a lot to learn before then.

137
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,540
So I'm looking forward to going through this section and it's going to be a lot of fun and definitely

138
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,740
we're going to learn a lot of new techniques and tools which are very powerful in our.

139
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,270
And on that note I look forward to seeing you on the first tutorial.

140
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,100
Until then happy coding

141
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,330
.
