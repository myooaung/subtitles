00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:04.004
we're going to take a look at two more GitOps practices

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.005
using Azure Arc.

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.006
The practices we'll look at our infrastructure as code

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.009
and using an operator for continuous deployment.

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.000
Within the Azure Arc their support for an operator

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.004
called flux that allows us to deploy workloads

8
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.002
on the cluster with a GitOps approach.

9
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:26.009
You can see that Microsoft is excited about GitOps.

10
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.005
Let's go ahead and click on this button

11
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.006
to start our flux setup.

12
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.005
The first thing that we'll need to do is click on the add

13
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.002
configuration button.

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.008
That's going to open a form that allows us to provide Arc

15
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:43.002
with the information it needs to deploy an operator

16
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.002
into our cluster and to sync that operator

17
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.007
with the desired system state found in Git.

18
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.005
So, we need to give the configuration a name,

19
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:56.003
I'm just going to use GitOps-Foundations.

20
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.001
And then for the instance name,

21
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.003
I'm going to use Arc-example.

22
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:05.005
We then need to specify a namespace

23
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:09.006
and that's going to be Arc-exercise.

24
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:13.001
And from here, go ahead and select the cluster option

25
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.003
for the operator scope.

26
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:18.005
Now at this point, I'm going to jump down on the form

27
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:22.003
and we can provide the repository URL.

28
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:25.003
This is going to be the URL of a git repo

29
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.005
that holds our systems desired state.

30
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:32.004
Now for that, we can navigate over to GitHub

31
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.006
where we have forked the environment repository

32
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.002
that holds our infrastructure code.

33
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:41.004
You'll recall in that repository we have a folder

34
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:42.004
for each tool.

35
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.009
And there you see the folder for Arc.

36
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.004
It holds Kubernetes manifests that we would like to deploy

37
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:49.004
on our cluster.

38
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.008
So, just keep that directory in mind.

39
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:56.004
But we can now go to the code button, click on that.

40
00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.006
And then copy the repository URL

41
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:03.000
for our environment repository.

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.008
Once you have that, just navigate back to Azure

43
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:10.003
and paste the URL into the text box.

44
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:14.007
Then we need to specify that it is a public repository

45
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.004
and there's just one last thing we need to do.

46
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:21.004
We need to provide some parameters that the operator

47
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:24.007
will use to find those Kubernetes manifests

48
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.009
within that repository.

49
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:31.006
So the first one is the Git-branch parameter

50
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:34.004
and we're going to point to our main branch.

51
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:39.009
And then the second is the Git-path parameter.

52
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.003
And this is going to be that Arc directory we mentioned

53
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:46.002
that holds our Kubernetes manifests.

54
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.006
All right so, everything's in place here,

55
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:50.007
but before we add the configuration,

56
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.005
I want to do one more thing.

57
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.004
Let's navigate over to a terminal

58
00:02:55.004 --> 00:03:00.003
and here I'm going to use kubectl to watch the pod services

59
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:05.009
and deployments within the Arc- exercise namespace.

60
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.004
If we look at this command,

61
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:10.001
you'll see that currently no resources

62
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.005
are deployed within our cluster.

63
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:18.000
So, let's navigate now back to Azure and we can add

64
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.002
the configuration into Azure Arc

65
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:24.006
and you'll see that the operator begins to setup.

66
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.002
Currently it's pending.

67
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:29.007
Now let's hop back to the terminal and here

68
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:34.007
we can watch the state of the cluster.

69
00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:38.003
So it looks like flux has started to place the Kubernetes

70
00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:41.003
resources on the cluster.

71
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:45.007
And there we can see that the pods and services are up.

72
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:47.009
All right, let's do one thing from here.

73
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.007
We're going to access the application.

74
00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:54.008
So for that, we're going to need the IP of one of the nodes.

75
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.007
So we can use kubectl to get the nodes.

76
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.003
And then we'll use the wide format.

77
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:04.002
There's the internal IP of one of the nodes.

78
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:07.004
Go ahead and grab that.

79
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:09.004
I'll just copy that.

80
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:12.002
Then I'm going to head to a browser

81
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:16.008
and I have a new tab where we can go ahead and paste in

82
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:18.003
that IP.

83
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:22.004
And then we're going to use the node port of 30,000,

84
00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:24.001
like we did previously.

85
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.008
Okay, if we hit that, there we can see the application

86
00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:30.002
is up and running on the cluster.

87
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:34.000
It was deployed there by our operator flux.

88
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.009
All right.

89
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.005
So, we successfully established an operator in the cluster

90
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:42.004
that deploys our containerized workloads based upon

91
00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:45.005
the infrastructure code in our Git repository.

92
00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:49.006
So, that's continuous deployment and infrastructure as code.

93
00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:53.001
With these practices established we'll look at how to run

94
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:57.000
a change through the entire workflow in our next lesson.
