00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Let's take a high-level look at GitOps

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.005
and start to impact what it means.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.000
At a very high level, you can think of GitOps

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.002
as an iteration of DevOps that is

5
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.006
centered around source code management.

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.002
And for most developers source control means using Git.

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.009
It's pretty much the de facto standard.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.004
So let's start with this idea

9
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:24.001
that DevOps is the foundation of GitOps.

10
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.000
DevOps is a mixture of principles, practices, and tools

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.001
that allow teams to deliver higher quality software

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.007
at a faster pace.

13
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.009
DevOps starts with culture.

14
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.008
Teams embrace principles like breaking down silos,

15
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.002
continuous improvement, automation,

16
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.008
and frequent communication that improve

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.002
how they deliver software.

18
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.005
These principles change the way people

19
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.002
in an organization think about developing

20
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.000
and operating digital products.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.008
This influences how they work and they adopt practices

22
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:02.004
that rapidly deliver small incremental changes.

23
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:06.003
Tools are needed to automate and support these practices,

24
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.009
so you'll find teams that embrace DevOps using tools

25
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.007
that enable practices like frequent communication,

26
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:16.001
CICD, and containerization.

27
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.001
So you kind of get these two sides of DevOps,

28
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.004
the concepts and the execution.

29
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.002
Okay, so what about GitOps, right?

30
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.005
GitOps applies a Git-centric approach

31
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.004
on top of some common DevOps principles,

32
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.006
practices, and tools.

33
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:36.002
So we mix these principles centered around Git

34
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.008
in with our DevOps workflows to get this new way

35
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:43.003
of operating and managing software.

36
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.003
The principles established by the GitOps community

37
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.009
stem from the idea that all system changes are made

38
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.000
through source control, like Git, and from there,

39
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.007
they're automatically deployed.

40
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:57.008
Developers have been doing this forever,

41
00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:02.004
however, GitOps shifts this practice to the operations side,

42
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:06.007
where infrastructure configuration is stored as code.

43
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:09.003
So you wind up with all your system changes

44
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:12.002
described in Git as commits,

45
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.004
and those commits in their entirety

46
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:18.008
make up the desired state of your system.

47
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:21.008
That desired state then needs to be reflected

48
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.005
in your running system,

49
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.008
which is done via a GitOps concept known as a control

50
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:28.009
or a reconciliation loop.

51
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.006
Don't worry, we're going to talk about that more later.

52
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:33.009
But that's the core of GitOps.

53
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:37.007
Commit all of your systems desired changes into Git,

54
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:40.004
and that's what runs on your system.

55
00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:41.007
There's more to it than that.

56
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:45.003
You have the principles which are generally agreed upon.

57
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:49.007
However, the practices can vary differently across groups

58
00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:53.000
and in some cases they're tough to put in place.

59
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.003
Throughout the course, we're going to dive deeper

60
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.002
into the principles, practices,

61
00:02:57.002 --> 00:03:00.000
and tools as we explore GitOps.
