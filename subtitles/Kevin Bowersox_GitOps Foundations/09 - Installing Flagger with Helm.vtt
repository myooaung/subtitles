00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] To work with flagger,

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.004
we'll need to install it and some other components

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.009
that it depends upon.

4
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.003
Now before we begin, I just want to caution you

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.007
that there's many technologies in the stack

6
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.005
when you're working with flagger.

7
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.005
So, there's going to be quite a few things

8
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.003
that you'll need to setup if you want to follow along.

9
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.004
To help with that, you can use the read me file

10
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.009
inside of the flagger directory

11
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.007
within the environment repository.

12
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.004
Inside of that read me file,

13
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.004
you'll find all of the instructions of what needs

14
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:35.000
to be setup before you begin the exercise.

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.002
Once you've completed all those items,

16
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.000
you can navigate into a terminal where you can begin

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.003
the installation.

18
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.007
We'll be using flagger with the nginX ingress controller.

19
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:48.000
So, let's start by installing the controller.

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.005
The controller is installed using helm.

21
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.001
So, the first thing we'll need to do

22
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.005
is add the helm repository.

23
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.004
We're going to install the ingress controller

24
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:01.005
into its own namespace within the cluster.

25
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.004
So, let's go ahead.

26
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.003
We'll use kubectl to create a new namespace named

27
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:10.002
ingress-nginX.

28
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.008
After we create the namespace,

29
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.001
we can install the controller into it

30
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.007
and configure the controller to share some metrics

31
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.001
with prometheus.

32
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.008
Okay, we're almost there.

33
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.009
We just need to start the flagger installation.

34
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.006
Flaggers also installed using helm.

35
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:28.007
So, let's go ahead.

36
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:32.002
We'll add the repository for flagger.

37
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.009
And then from there we can use the helm chart

38
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.002
to install flagger and to set up some configuration

39
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:45.003
with prometheus and the nginX ingress controller.

40
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.006
Okay so, there you can see that flagger has been installed

41
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.006
and all of these components should be deployed

42
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:54.005
onto our cluster running in Azure.

43
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.004
Let's head out there to take a look.

44
00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.001
So here within our cluster,

45
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.004
the first thing I'm going to do is take a look

46
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.008
at the workloads.

47
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:07.004
There you can see that flaggers running on the cluster

48
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:12.006
and we also have our nginX ingress controller, excellent.

49
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.001
If we take a look at the services and the ingresses,

50
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.009
I want to point one thing out.

51
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.005
You'll notice that the ingress controller

52
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.004
has an external IP.

53
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:26.005
So we can use that to access the controller.

54
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:31.002
Now we can associate that public IP with a DNS entry.

55
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:34.004
To do that, navigate to the resource groups

56
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.005
and then head into the MC underscore

57
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.005
and then your cluster name.

58
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:41.002
Within this resource group,

59
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.005
we'll find a lot of the networking for the cluster.

60
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:47.005
You'll notice there is a public IP address.

61
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.006
Go ahead and select this item.

62
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.005
And inside of this item,

63
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.004
we can add a DNS name to the public IP address

64
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:57.009
for the cluster.

65
00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:01.004
To do that go ahead and click on configuration.

66
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:03.009
And then inside of the configuration,

67
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.005
you can apply a DNS label.

68
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:10.002
Now here use your Docker hub ID.

69
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.009
So mine is Kevin Bauersox teach,

70
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:18.000
and then you can see it's going to suffix the remainder

71
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.006
of the domain onto that DNS label.

72
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:25.001
Okay so, let's go ahead we'll save it.

73
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.000
And then if we navigate back to the overview,

74
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.008
here we can see the domain.

75
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.006
Go ahead and copy that.

76
00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:36.003
And then what we're going to do is navigate to a new tab.

77
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:38.001
And within that new tab,

78
00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.004
we're just going to paste that domain name

79
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.001
and we can hit the ingress controller to make sure

80
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:46.004
that it's up and running.

81
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:50.004
Okay so, we don't have anything running yet on the cluster

82
00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:52.008
that the ingress controller would serve up.

83
00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:57.001
But here's a confirmation that it was successfully deployed.

84
00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.001
This sets us up for our next lesson

85
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.000
where we're going to perform a Canary deployment.
