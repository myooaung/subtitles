00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] Let's get started with Flux, to do that.

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.006
We'll need to bootstrap the operator

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.000
into our Kubernetes cluster.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.008
To help us, we can use the getting started path

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.003
on the Flux website.

6
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.003
And here, I want to draw your attention

7
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.002
to the prerequisites.

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.000
First you'll need kubectl installed,

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.004
and it needs to be connected to our Kubernetes cluster

10
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.001
running in Azure.

11
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.008
Now, we'll also need a personal access token from GitHub.

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.005
Here you can see two commands.

13
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.004
One establishes a variable with the token,

14
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.009
another establishes a variable with our account name.

15
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:42.001
These are used by Flux to create a repository on our behalf

16
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.006
that it uses to manage its configuration.

17
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.008
Let's navigate over to GitHub,

18
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.009
and we can start to create a personal access token

19
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:54.001
by clicking the drop down next to our profile,

20
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.006
and then selecting settings.

21
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.002
Inside of the settings, if we scroll down,

22
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.007
you'll find the developer setting section.

23
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.009
Here, we can select personal access tokens,

24
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.004
and then click on this button to generate a new token.

25
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.003
We'll need to give the token a name.

26
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm just going to call mine booth,

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.002
which is the name of my machine.

28
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.006
And then we need to grant the token

29
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:19.009
all of the repository scopes.

30
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.004
These are the permissions that Flux will need

31
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.002
to create the repository for us.

32
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:29.003
Once you've done that, go ahead and click on generate token.

33
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.000
This is going to cause GitHub

34
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.003
to give you a new, personal access token.

35
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:34.006
You can see it there.

36
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:38.001
Go ahead and copy it and then place it someplace safe.

37
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.002
You're never going to see it again.

38
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:43.009
I've created a text file where I'm going to place my token

39
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.006
into the two commands we saw.

40
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.000
So I'll just paste the token there.

41
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.001
And then I'll put my GitHub user ID.

42
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.001
Let's go ahead and copy these commands

43
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.000
and then we'll take them over to a terminal

44
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.004
and establish the variables.

45
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.002
All right. So that setup,

46
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.004
let's go back at this point

47
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.009
to the Flux getting started guide

48
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.009
and here's where we'll find the command to install Flux.

49
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.004
Now I'm using Linux.

50
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:17.002
So I'm going to select this version, I'll copy it,

51
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.000
take it over to my terminal and then once again,

52
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.009
paste the command and execute it.

53
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.008
Whoops. It looks like I missed a C on that.

54
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:27.009
All right.

55
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:32.006
So, there we can see Flux begins to download and install.

56
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:36.005
Let's just check it out to make sure the install went well.

57
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.006
Yup. It looks like it's installed.

58
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.009
Now, I want to draw your attention to the bootstrap command.

59
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.008
It does two things.

60
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:47.002
First, it establishes that configuration repository

61
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:50.000
in GitHub that we talked about.

62
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.005
In that repository, we're able to store things like

63
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:58.006
custom resource definitions that Flux uses to manage itself.

64
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:03.000
Now it's also going to deploy controllers

65
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.002
into our Kubernetes cluster running on Azure.

66
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:09.005
So when we use this command,

67
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.003
it's typically used for your particular

68
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:15.009
source control management system in our case GitHub.

69
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.003
And with the GitHub approach,

70
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:22.009
you can use it for an organization or a personal account.

71
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.006
Now I'm using it for my organization.

72
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:29.008
So here you can see the owner is my organization name.

73
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.008
There's the name of the repository

74
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:33.009
that's going to be created.

75
00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:38.005
And then this path will be created inside the repo.

76
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:41.004
And that's where we're going to place those custom resource

77
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:42.008
definitions we talked about,

78
00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:45.006
things like our sources and customizations.

79
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:48.008
We'll talk about those later.

80
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:52.007
Okay. So it looks like Flux has finished bootstrapping

81
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:56.002
and you'll notice these controllers that were deployed

82
00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:59.001
on the cluster here at the bottom of the command.

83
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:03.004
Let's head over to Azure and we can take a peek at those.

84
00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:07.002
So here's our Kubernetes cluster, we'll navigate into that.

85
00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:10.005
And then if we look at the workloads on the cluster,

86
00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:13.000
you're going to see those controllers

87
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.004
that make up the Flux system

88
00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:19.000
and that perform the actual GitOps work

89
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.006
that needs to be done for all the reconciliation.

90
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:25.005
All right. We just have one last thing

91
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.004
that we need to do.

92
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:29.006
Within GitHub, you'll notice

93
00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:33.007
that the configuration repository has been created for Flux.

94
00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:36.001
Here's where those CRDs go.

95
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:39.002
I'm going to go ahead and clone this repository.

96
00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:43.000
Now, I use SSH so I'm going to leave that option selected

97
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.007
and just copy the link and then head back to the terminal.

98
00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:52.001
And here I can go ahead, use git clone,

99
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.004
and then make a copy of the repo.

100
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:58.000
We need to clone this repository locally,

101
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.007
so that as we build those custom resource definitions,

102
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:04.007
we can commit them and push them

103
00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:09.000
to that configuration repository for Flux that's in GitHub

104
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.005
because you got to remember, Flux uses a GitOps approach

105
00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:15.000
to manage itself.

106
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.004
Okay. So that's how you bootstrap Flux

107
00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:19.002
into a Kubernetes cluster.

108
00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:22.004
Next, we're going to talk about those controllers we solved

109
00:05:22.004 --> 00:05:27.000
and how Flux uses them to manage its approach to GitOps.
