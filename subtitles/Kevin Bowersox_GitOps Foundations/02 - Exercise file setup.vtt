00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.003
- [Instructor] To make it easier

2
00:00:01.003 --> 00:00:03.001
to follow along with the course,

3
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.000
I've placed the working files into LinkedIn Learning's

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.009
GitHub organization.

5
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.004
So inside of the organization,

6
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.006
just go ahead and search for gitops

7
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.003
and you'll see these two repositories,

8
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.003
one for the application source code

9
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.003
and another for the infrastructure code

10
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.000
that's going to drive our operations.

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.009
In gitops, it's common to keep the app

12
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.006
and the infrastructure code in separate repositories.

13
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.003
That allows us to apply distinct security

14
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:34.007
for each repository and to maintain

15
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.000
some separation of concerns.

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.008
Now, if you're going to follow along

17
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.002
with the demonstrations,

18
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.002
it's best to fork these repositories.

19
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.009
So to do that, click on the repository,

20
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.003
we'll start with the app repository.

21
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:49.004
And then from here,

22
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.005
you just want to click on the fork button

23
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.006
in the upper right-hand corner.

24
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:57.007
You may be prompted to select an account or an organization.

25
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:02.004
I've created one for the course, so I'll select that one.

26
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.004
That's going to start the process of the fork.

27
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:09.000
So let's navigate back to the LinkedIn Learning organization

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.007
and we can begin the fork of the environment repository.

29
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:16.009
So I'll just select that repo, and it's the same process.

30
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.006
Just click on the fork button,

31
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.000
select your account if necessary,

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.008
and then the fork will start.

33
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:26.004
Now, once we have forked these repositories,

34
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:30.007
we're going to clone them down to our local workstation.

35
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.001
To do that, just click on the code button

36
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.003
and then copy the link to the repository.

37
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:41.009
We'll take that over into our terminal

38
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.002
and here I can just use git and clone that repository.

39
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:50.001
There it was pulled down and then I'm just going to

40
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:57.005
adjust the command to pull the app repository next.

41
00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:00.004
All right, so if we take a look,

42
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:06.004
we have both repositories down on our local workstation.

43
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:08.004
So to get started with our setup,

44
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:12.008
we're going to navigate into the application repository

45
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.007
and inside of this repository,

46
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.001
I want to draw your attention to a few things.

47
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.003
First, it contains all of our application source code

48
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:22.000
and you'll notice the Dockerfile.

49
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.007
It contains the instructions to package the application

50
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:27.008
into a container image.

51
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.009
That container image is going to be pushed to Docker Hub

52
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:37.005
when we run the create_images script as part of our setup.

53
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:40.002
So we'll need to log in to Docker Hub.

54
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:43.009
To do that, we can use the docker login command

55
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:50.000
and then just provide your Docker Hub account name here.

56
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.005
You'll then need to provide your credentials.

57
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:56.003
All right, so we're logged in to Docker Hub

58
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.008
and now we can use the create_images script.

59
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:01.005
It accepts one argument.

60
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:05.007
It's going to be your Docker Hub account name.

61
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:09.000
So supply that argument, go ahead, issue the script

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.006
and the container images will start to build.

63
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:13.006
And once they're built,

64
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:18.009
the script will push them up to Docker Hub for you.

65
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.009
Okay, it looks like they finished.

66
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.007
Let's navigate out to Docker Hub and we can take a peak.

67
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:26.005
So here inside of my account,

68
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.004
I'm just going to click on repositories

69
00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:31.005
and I'll hit the refresh button.

70
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:34.009
And there we see the new repository created by the script.

71
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:37.006
It's named gitops-foundations.

72
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:40.006
Inside of this repository are two images

73
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:43.002
that we'll be working with throughout the course

74
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:47.000
and deploying on our Kubernetes clusters.

75
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.007
Now let's navigate back to GitHub

76
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:51.002
and I want to call your attention

77
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:53.008
to the environment repository.

78
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.008
It holds a directory for each toll

79
00:03:56.008 --> 00:04:00.002
that we're going to be working with inside of the course.

80
00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:02.005
If we navigate into one of these directories,

81
00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.007
let's say the argo directory,

82
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:08.002
you're going to find the infrastructure as code files.

83
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:12.002
So things like our Kubernetes manifests and Terraform files

84
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.003
that we'll be working with in the examples.

85
00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:17.002
Inside of these directories,

86
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.005
you'll also find a README file that provides

87
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:23.004
additional instructions for working with each tool.

88
00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:26.000
It's a great resource.

89
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.003
All right, let's go back to the terminal

90
00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:31.001
because there is a little bit of configuration

91
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:34.008
that we need to perform for the environment repositories.

92
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:37.002
I'm going to go ahead and clear the screen

93
00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:40.001
and then we'll need to navigate back a directory

94
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:44.005
and then navigate into the environment repository.

95
00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:48.006
And here you can see it's just a copy of what was in GitHub.

96
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:53.008
And inside of the root, you'll notice the setup.sh script.

97
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:55.005
So we're going to run that

98
00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:58.007
and it accepts one argument as well,

99
00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:01.008
and that is our Docker Hub account name.

100
00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:04.009
So I'm just going to provide that and run the script.

101
00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.002
Okay, so once we do that,

102
00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:10.006
it's going to adjust all the Kubernetes manifests

103
00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:14.004
to point to our Docker Hub repository.

104
00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:17.005
We can just hop into the argo directory

105
00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:19.004
and take a peek at that

106
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:22.008
by looking at one of the yaml files.

107
00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:28.000
So there you can see my Docker Hub repository

108
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.007
has been appended to the image name.

109
00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:35.001
All right, so we're good to go there.

110
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:41.000
Let's step back a directory.

111
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.006
And from here, we're going to go ahead

112
00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:47.000
and push those changes up to GitHub.

113
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.009
So to do that, just add the changes to the repository,

114
00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.009
and then you'll want to commit them.

115
00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.006
I'm just going to provide a short message

116
00:05:58.006 --> 00:06:04.006
and then you'll want to do a push to your main branch.

117
00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:05.004
All right, excellent.

118
00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:06.004
That's everything you need

119
00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:08.007
if you want to follow along with the course.

120
00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:10.000
You're all set up to begin.
