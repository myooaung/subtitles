00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.002
- [Narrator] Does delivering software at a rapid pace

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.005
make you a little uneasy?

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.002
There's so much in the stack.

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.000
Docker,

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.008
Jenkins,

6
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.008
Kubernetes.

7
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.000
It just seems like you're asking for a failed release

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.008
and we all know how pleasant those are.

9
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.001
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

10
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.006
I can show you how GitOps

11
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:23.004
can help deliver cloud native applications on Kubernetes

12
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.004
at the pace your organization demands

13
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.006
without the operational issues

14
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.002
that get everybody upset.

15
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.009
GitOps is a new way of working

16
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.002
that infuses Git into the center of a DevOps approach.

17
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.007
This allows you to deliver changes to your system faster

18
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.008
without sacrificing stability.

19
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.003
In the course, we'll do a lot of hands-on work

20
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.006
with new GitOps tools like Flux,

21
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.005
Argo CD,

22
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.002
and Terraform.

23
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.002
I'll show you how they can be combined

24
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.002
with your existing practices

25
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.000
to build a GitOps workflow.

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.002
Once you've tried it,

27
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.001
you'll never want to go back to the old ways

28
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.000
of delivering software.

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.007
So join me in my LinkedIn learning course

30
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:10.000
to get started on your GitOps journey.
