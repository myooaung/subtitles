00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Now that we've discussed

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.007
some of the main practices involved with GitOps,

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.001
let's see them in action.

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.008
To do that, we'll establish an end-to-end GitOps workflow

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.009
that combines the GitOps principles

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.005
with the practices that we discussed in this chapter.

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:20.005
The workflow uses GitHub, CircleCI, Docker Hub, Flux,

8
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.006
and Azure Arc.

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.009
It's pretty complex, so we'll break it into pieces.

10
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.008
First, we'll focus on the practice

11
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.008
of using container platforms

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.006
by standing up a small K3s cluster

13
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.004
that we'll manage with Azure Arc.

14
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.004
Azure Arc isn't necessary for our container platforms,

15
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.005
but it's a newer feature in Azure

16
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.003
that has some support for GitOps built in,

17
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.003
so it's worth exploring.

18
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.009
So let's start on my local workstation

19
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.008
where I've installed Docker and K3s.

20
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.007
K3s is a small Kubernetes distribution

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.007
that's provided by Rancher.

22
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:01.003
It comes with the command line wrapper K3d.

23
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:05.004
We can use K3d to quickly stand up a cluster

24
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.004
on our local workstation.

25
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.004
So here, I'm telling K3d

26
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.009
to create a cluster named arccluster.

27
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.006
I'll go ahead and execute that command

28
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:21.008
and the cluster will begin to provision on my machine.

29
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.002
That's how quickly you can get up and running

30
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.004
locally with Kubernetes.

31
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.001
Now let's head over to Azure.

32
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.001
Within Azure, we're going to stand up

33
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.002
and configure Azure Arc.

34
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:36.005
Now, you'll need an Azure account for this.

35
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.000
So if you don't have one,

36
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.005
just click on this green button to get a free trial.

37
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:45.006
I'm going to head into the portal and within the portal,

38
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.007
we can do a global search for Arc

39
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.009
and you'll see that Azure Arc

40
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.001
appears as the first selection.

41
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.004
Go ahead and click on it

42
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.005
and this takes us to the starting page for Azure Arc.

43
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.005
Now, Azure Arc is used to manage resources

44
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.009
remotely from Azure,

45
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.004
so things like our local K3s cluster

46
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:12.003
or maybe a cluster over in GCP or AWS

47
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.005
can be managed using Azure Arc.

48
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.003
The cluster doesn't need to be in Azure,

49
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.009
but it can be managed from there.

50
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.007
Now, because we're interested

51
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.002
in managing existing infrastructure,

52
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.005
I'll select this first option.

53
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.001
I'll go ahead and hit Add

54
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.000
and then we have a Kubernetes cluster,

55
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.004
so I'm going to select this option in the middle.

56
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:38.008
Now, before we can manage that cluster with Arc,

57
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:43.007
we need some software installed on our workstation.

58
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:47.006
The softwares listed here, I've already installed it.

59
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.000
You can work through the instructions here

60
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.003
to install Azure CLI, some extensions for it, and Helm.

61
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.005
Once you've completed those instructions,

62
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:01.005
go ahead and click on Cluster Details to continue.

63
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:05.001
Now we need to provide some additional information

64
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:07.000
about the resource we want to create,

65
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.002
and that starts with the resource group.

66
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:16.008
I'm just going to name the resource group arc-cluster-rg

67
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.006
and then I'll go ahead and hit OK

68
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:25.001
and then we need to provide a name for the cluster in Azure.

69
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:31.000
I'll just call this the k3d-local-cluster.

70
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.008
And you can leave the region set

71
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:36.001
to whatever Azure has selected.

72
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.009
Once that's all in place, go ahead, hit Next.

73
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.004
This takes us to the tags.

74
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:41.007
We don't need any of those,

75
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:45.001
so I'm going to continue to the run script.

76
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:48.004
You'll notice that Azure provides us with a script

77
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.008
to get our local Kubernetes cluster

78
00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.000
synced up with Azure Arc.

79
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.007
So it's going to create that resource group

80
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:59.004
and then it uses one of the extensions we installed

81
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:02.003
to make the sync occur.

82
00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:05.007
I'm going to go ahead and copy the last three commands

83
00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:06.008
in the script.

84
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:10.007
I've already logged into Azure via the Azure CLI,

85
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:13.002
so I don't need that first command.

86
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.003
If you haven't logged into Azure,

87
00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:17.008
you'll want to copy the first one.

88
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:20.002
All right, so once that's copied,

89
00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:24.000
then we're going to navigate back to a terminal.

90
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.004
I'll go ahead and clear it.

91
00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:30.001
And then from here, we can paste the commands

92
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:33.005
and that's going to connect our local K3s cluster

93
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:37.002
to Azure Arc.

94
00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:39.008
So the connection appears to be completed.

95
00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:44.000
Let's navigate over to Azure to verify that.

96
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.001
To do that, just click on the Verification button

97
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.000
at the bottom of your screen

98
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.003
and we'll get a confirmation that our local K3d cluster

99
00:04:53.003 --> 00:04:57.002
has successfully been connected to Azure Arc.

100
00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:59.007
Let's go take a quick look at the cluster

101
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:03.006
and we can see some additional information about it.

102
00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:05.004
So by embracing containers,

103
00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:08.002
we start to head down that cloud native path

104
00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:12.004
that has other practices that tie in so nicely with GitOps.

105
00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:14.005
Now that we have our cluster setup,

106
00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:16.004
we're going to move on and take a look

107
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:20.000
at some of the next practices in that mix.
