00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Thanks for watching this course

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.004
on the foundations of GitOps.

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.006
Before we wrap up, I want to provide you

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.008
with some advice on how to get started

5
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.003
with GitOps and give you some information

6
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:13.008
about my other courses.

7
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:15.004
So here's my recommendations

8
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.003
for getting started with GitOps.

9
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.001
First if you can start with a new project,

10
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.001
it makes the first experience much easier.

11
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.009
Some technologies do not have declarative configurations,

12
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.004
starting fresh gives you more flexibility

13
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.003
to choose from tools that support GitOps principles.

14
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:34.008
After you select the tools,

15
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.005
set up your Git repositories

16
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.000
and carefully plan out the security,

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.007
keep a separation of duties and determine who can approve

18
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:46.003
peers on each repository and branch.

19
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.001
Then you'll need to write and commit the infrastructure code

20
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.001
for your cluster and other custom resources

21
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.003
that are used by your GitOps tools.

22
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.009
The course highlighted several GitOps operators

23
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.002
to choose from and there's many tools

24
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.003
that can help you provision the underlying

25
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.002
cluster infrastructure.

26
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.009
Once the workflow is up and running, it's simple,

27
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.006
push all of your changes through Git

28
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:10.007
and let automation handle the rest.

29
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.000
That's the pattern.

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.006
If you like my teaching style,

31
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.008
I have a few other courses on the LinkedIn learning platform

32
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:19.005
that might interest you.

33
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:23.003
I can teach you about other topics like Microservices, APIs,

34
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:27.003
Java, Spring or Git, if you're interested.

35
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.008
If you want to tag me when you post your course certificate,

36
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:35.001
I always like to interact with learners taking my courses.

37
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.001
So that's it for now.

38
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.005
Congratulations on finishing this course

39
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.000
and thanks again for taking it.
