Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Steven Haines, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,450
Spring Integration: Using Channel Adapters to Integrate with External Systems.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,140
Spring Integration is Spring's implementation of the enterprise

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,630
integration patterns and provides powerful functionality for

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,240
integrating different components across your environment.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,460
In this course,

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,500
we're going to review how to integrate with different external systems.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,110
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,730
integrating with message brokers, such as ActiveMQ,

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,380
RabbitMQ, and Apache Kafka.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,260
integrating with databases, such as MariaDB and MongoDB,

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,440
invoking RESTful web services from a Spring Integration application,

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,040
and building custom integrations for which Spring

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Integration does not provide native support.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,740
By the end of this course,

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,550
you'll understand how to integrate with several specific external systems.

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,170
But more importantly,

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,980
you'll understand Spring Integrations model for integrating

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,040
with external systems so that you'll be able to integrate with

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,340
any system in your environment.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,240
Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with the basics of Spring,

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,190
Spring Boot, and Spring Integration,

24
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,990
including messages and channels and how they work together

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,880
to solve enterprise integration problems.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,130
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to use Spring

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,450
Integration to integrate different external systems with the Spring

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:51,000
Integration: Using Channel Adapters to Integrate with External Systems course at Pluralsight.
