00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,540
In this module, we reviewed how Spring integration works with Apache Kafka.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:05,970
First,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,760
we saw that Apache Kafka is a publishâ€‘subscribe based

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,650
durable distributed streaming platform.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,670
It was designed to support massive scale streaming to be able to

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,130
handle things like page clicks on massive websites,

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,440
and it makes a wonderful message broker.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,710
We saw how the KafkaMessageSource was used in the

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,140
role of an inbound channel adapter,

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,120
and the KafkaProducerMessageHandler served the role

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,000
of an outbound channel adapter.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,940
We saw that the KafkaInboundGateway provided inbound gateway support,

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,630
and the KafkaProducerMessageHandler served the role of the outbound gateway.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,680
The KafkaProducerMessageHandler supports outbound

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,240
channel adapters and outbound gateways,

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,430
with the difference being the type of Kafka template that's

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,940
used, a standard Kafka template in the case of an outbound

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,640
channel adapter and a replying Kafka template in the case of an

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,770
outbound gateway. At this point,

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,740
you should understand what Apache Kafka is and what it does.

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,910
You should understand how to integrate Apache Kafka was Spring integration

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,960
applications using both inbound and outbound channel adapters and inbound

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,840
and outbound gateways. And most importantly,

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,290
you should feel comfortable integrating Apache Kafka into

25
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,830
your own Spring integration applications.

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,790
Next up,

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,000
we're going to review how to integrate databases into our Spring integration applications.
