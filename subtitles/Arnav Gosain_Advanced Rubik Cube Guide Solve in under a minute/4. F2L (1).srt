1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,210
So first, let's cover ways of putting a pair and without breaking it.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,540
So here we can see we have a white, green red pair.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,770
It's already matched up with ads and needs to go into this slot right here.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,050
So there's many ways of doing this.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,520
But the most common ones and the reason why I just taught you those last algorithms is because they

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,390
can be used here.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:33,180
So the first wave in this is just doing a reverse sexy move, which is you are you prime our prime.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,310
And that inserts that really easily.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,100
But we can also, instead of doing a reverse sexy, we can also just do the sledgehammer.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,200
So from right here, our prime as our prime.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,270
And that also solve it.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,880
So when when you want to decide which one to use, I think it mainly relies on where your hands or you

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,180
are.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,390
So it's just about which one can be performed more easily without moving your fingers too much to save

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,620
as much time as possible.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,610
OK, this is another really easy case.

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,080
I know it looks like we don't have a pair because there's nothing trailing this edge right here, but

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,900
it's really easy to solve because we can see that the edges back here and these two colors are not matching.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,750
So the white sides would be facing out this way.

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,250
And I Slott is right here.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,730
So since these two colors are not matching, if I move this right side up, then they'll solve the pair

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,540
really easily.

23
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,550
And then once I move this right side up, I also open a slot to move this side into.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,240
So I just move that in and put it back down.

25
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,330
And that's all of it.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,630
And you'll also notice that was that that was exactly a sexy move.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,990
So that was the sequence.

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,640
Are you our prime you prime the you prime at the end?

29
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,490
Is it necessary?

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,320
But if it helps you to remember it, then just know that in this case, you get to do a sexy move to

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,920
solve the hair.

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,920
And I'm going to cover two cases that you should already know.

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,250
Of course, it's obviously possible that after solving the cross, there's a corner that's already solved

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,110
and there's an edge that's on the top layer.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
So let's say I got this case randomly.

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,180
I didn't insert this corner.

37
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,870
It's already canceled like this.

38
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,620
And that means we can just do the same algorithm we had earlier.

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,050
So this needs to go to the left.

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,110
We put the bar facing us and do the same algorithm.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,560
And then that also solves the terror.

42
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:34,070
And that's why those second layer methods were really important and useful for Abdul, because those

43
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,760
two cases are actually two cases of the Attwell algorithms.

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,860
So let's try practicing making pairs now.

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,390
So here's a coin.

46
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,000
We have white, green, red again and you to go here and I would find the edge.

47
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,960
It's right here, red and green.

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,840
However, this corner is not facing this way.

49
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,400
And these two edges are the same color, which means we cannot do a sexy move to insert it.

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,380
As you can see, I didn't do anything.

51
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,720
So instead, what we can do is what if we try and get this edge into this light right here before inserting

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:07,870
it?

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,830
So you might think that we just have to do this, but that obviously displaces this.

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,940
We have to move this or this corner.

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,040
We have to move this corner out of the way somehow.

56
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,070
So if we do this, that messes up the back.

57
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,570
So we can't do it on this side.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,280
Same with over here.

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,120
This gives us no way to insert it because we move it over here.

60
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,220
Then these two colors do not match.

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,630
We can't do it over here, which matches up this pair and we can't do it over here either.

62
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,110
So from this position, we want to put the corner in the top right where the slot is facing us.

63
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,530
And now here, you're the best position to not to, because now I can move this corner out of the way

64
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,760
without breaking anything.

65
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,420
And then I can move this edge and then bring this back up.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
And you can see that we formed a pair.

67
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,850
And then I can just go and go to the side and incident.

68
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,580
So it's the exact same thing when we have a case like this.

69
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,360
We still have our corner over here.

70
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,580
Here's our edge.

71
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,780
And these two are still matching.

72
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,840
But instead of being over here, this piece is over here now.

73
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,420
So this is really easy.

74
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,260
This is exactly the same as the last case.

75
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,860
If we just move the corner out of the way instead of doing a U.

76
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:27,920
We can do in two to move this in the correct spot and then bring this corner back, and then we could

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,060
just easily insert it.

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,930
OK, let's say we have a case like this one.

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,760
So our white is over here facing that way, which means it's ready for insertion.

80
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,220
But this edge is over here.

81
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,650
So these two colors are not matching.

82
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,110
And this edges over here, which means that we cannot simply move this out of the way and put the edge

83
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,870
next to it, because that means the colors would mismatch.

84
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,920
And that's not what we want.

85
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,490
So we can't do a sexy move here either, because that wouldn't put the edge in, since it's not in the

86
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,290
right slight to be paired with this corner.

87
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,550
So instead, what we can do is use that last technique from the last pair to move this edge into a place

88
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,560
we want it to be and then insert it.

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,610
So right here, this is our open slot that we can work with.

90
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,310
So I'm going to move this corner to the back of this open slot so that when I move this side down,

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,380
then nothing gets interfered with over here.

92
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,840
So once I move the side down, obviously, I don't want to go here, because that means that this matches

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,410
the colors.

94
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,020
So instead, I want to move this over here, because when I move this side up, ill form up here, so

95
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,030
I'll go down here, move this over to this light, and then move the corner back up.

96
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,300
Now, you can see that when I move this side up, it solves the path.

97
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,260
So we go back to our open slot right here and get ready to insert it.

98
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,670
And we just do a sexy move.

99
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,530
And there we go.

100
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,660
A case like this is very similar.

101
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,850
It's basically the last step, but this edge has been already prepared up with this side and has already

102
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,110
been moved to this light.

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,240
So all week, all we have to do is really move this out to where we want it to go and then insert it

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,380
just like in the last step.

105
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,240
So here's our open slot.

106
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,850
If we just move this down, we can see that these since these two are mismatching, then we want this

107
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,930
edge to go here so we can match it up with this pair like this.

108
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,640
So I'll move this down, move the edge over here, and then move this back up.

109
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,130
So now these two are ready to get inserted.

110
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,330
If I move it over to the slot, I want it to go in and then insert it.

111
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,760
So this is exactly the same as the last step, if we have a case like this.

112
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,450
We have our corner already solved and our edge is already solved, but not oriented correctly.

113
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,670
So this is this would be fine.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,560
This needs to be flipped over.

115
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,930
And this is actually one of the longest cases.

116
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,480
But it's really easy after we learn the lesson.

117
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,250
So all we have to do is take this out, which is like reverse inserting it.

118
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,490
So if we do the reverse of the insert, then now we've taken this out and then we just have the last

119
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,050
step again so we can move this out of the way.

120
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,350
And here's our open slot.

121
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,610
This is the mirrored version.

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,890
We just move the corner out.

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,470
We want the ads to go here so we can insert it.

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,890
So we do want you to move this quarter back.

125
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,440
And now we have a left side insertion.

126
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,990
So this will pair up with the edge over here.

127
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,460
And then we can insert the pair onto this bar and move it down.

128
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,540
And that solves it.

129
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,360
So a case like this is actually one of my favorites because it's really easy to do and really smooth.

130
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,270
So as you can see here, this slight we have orange, blue this time, all these others are solved.

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,040
So our blue edge is already solved.

132
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,430
It's in the correct spot and it's oriented correctly.

133
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,000
But this corner just needs to jump down here and flip itself over.

134
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,260
So.

135
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:55,690
All we have to do in this is it's really easy to put this on the right facing you and do three sexy

136
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,380
moves, that's it.

137
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,570
So are you are prime, you prime.

138
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,370
Are you are you prime?

139
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,050
Are you are you prime?

140
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,100
And since sexy moves are really fast and really easy to do, then those moves are done really smoothly

141
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,600
and it's it's really nice to perform.

142
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,870
So let's say we have a case like this.

143
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,320
Here's our Orange Blue and here's our Orange Bowl ads.

144
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,150
And I'm going to ignore the green orange first, because let's say that the green orange is harder to

145
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,570
solve.

146
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,320
So are our corner need to go here and our age needs to go here.

147
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,330
So I originally I would do the green orange just to displace this one.

148
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,570
However, let's say that this one is harder to solve than this case.

149
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,080
So I want to show you how to solve this case.

150
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,910
If it was if it was the easiest one to do from here, we want to put this on the left side so that our

151
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,980
corners over here and our edges over here.

152
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,160
All I'm going to do is keeping this edge here.

153
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,570
I'm going to move this corner up into the top this, and then I'm going to move this corner into this

154
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,420
slot to make it ready for insertion.

155
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,300
So I'll do a YouTube.

156
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,200
And then once I bring the edge down, you can see that now I have a perfect insertion case.

157
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,030
This corner is facing this way.

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,120
And our edge is back here with opposite colors.

159
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,310
So I can just insert it.

160
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,600
And that's always the case.

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,380
And then over here, just for fun, we see we have this one against we do three sexy moves and it's

162
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,220
really fun to do.

163
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,760
Let's say we have a case like this one, it's similar to the other case where both are already solved,

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,710
but one is oriented incorrectly.

165
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,110
So here are edges in the solid state.

166
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,540
But this court needs to be flipped down this way.

167
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,000
So we have to take this pear out again and then reorient it and then put it back in.

168
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,460
And the best way to do that is simply take the pear out by reverse inserting it.

169
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,530
And now we have a case like this.

170
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,310
So remember, we just move the corner to the back of the open slot.

171
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,460
And we want to put this ad here since these colors are matching.

172
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,970
And there we have our pair, and then we just moved here and we can do reverse sexy move, which led

173
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,790
to an incident.

174
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm going to do a sledge hammer this time.

175
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,700
And there's our pair.

176
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,210
So it's the same thing for the murder case here, we just have the last one, except instead of the

177
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,000
corner being flipped this way, it's flipped this way.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,170
So it's facing to the right.

179
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,190
So what I'm going to do in this position is I'm going to put this side on the left.

180
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,950
I'm going to do a mirror case to it.

181
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,840
So I'm going to move the left side up and orient this corner into this light.

182
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,000
So it's facing in the correct position.

183
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,480
And now we have a repeat of this case.

184
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,450
So with the same hands, I don't have to do any rotations.

185
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,570
I just move this corner to the back of the open slot.

186
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,500
And I want to move this edge here since these these colors are matching.

187
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,630
So I move this portrait out of the way, move the edge into this light and put it back.

188
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,310
And there's a pair.

189
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,790
And then we can do a left hand sledgehammer to insert it.

190
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,930
And there we go, it's solved.

191
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,560
Let's see what happens if we have a case like this.

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
So we have our pairs right here.

193
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,410
They're connected, but this corner is flipped the wrong way.

194
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,210
And if we flipped over here.

195
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,440
So what we'll do, we already see that these colors are not matching.

196
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,450
So this edge needs to go over here.

197
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,030
So all I can do is move the corner to the back of the open slot again and then move the edge out of

198
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,970
the way to make this correct insertion form.

199
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,660
So now I just moved this back to the open slot.

200
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,030
And we have this case again, which is really easy.

201
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,380
We just do a sexy move.

202
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,420
And there we go.

203
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:34,900
It's all.

204
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,430
OK, so again, it's the exact same for the mered case.

205
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,940
Here we have our pair again.

206
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,940
So this needs to go flip the other way.

207
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,170
So here's our slight.

208
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,710
All I'll do is I'll move the corner to the open slot.

209
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,420
These two colors are not matching.

210
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,010
So this I need to go here.

211
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,140
So I'll move the corner down.

212
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,760
Move the edge into the slot.

213
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,170
Move this back up.

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,800
And then put this back and you can see that this is ready for insertion now and I'll just do a back

215
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,370
insertion.

216
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,790
So this is exactly the same, but I'm just doing it on the other side.

217
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,010
So match these up.

218
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,080
And here's our Baabda inserted into.

219
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,550
We have moved it in here.

220
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,500
And then move this down.

221
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,970
And there's our selfcare.

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,160
So I'm going to pause this section here or this lecture, because it's getting kind of long and I've

223
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,230
already went through a lot of afterworld cases to practice what I've shown you already get those all

224
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,650
down.

225
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,050
And then in the next lecture, we'll go over more afterworld cases and we'll do a bunch of examples.

226
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,710
So I should be covering pretty much every afterworld case there is.

227
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,810
And you should be able to get those all down once you learn in session and all that.

228
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,370
You should be able to do it intuitively.

229
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,660
You'll get a sense for it.

230
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,850
It's it's pretty nice to have.

231
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,580
But yeah, just keep practicing these and then we'll move on to the next lecture.

232
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,200
We will learn more at 12.
