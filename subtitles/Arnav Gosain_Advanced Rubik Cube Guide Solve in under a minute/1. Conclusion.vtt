00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.950
So you've reached the end of the course, I've taught you everything I know, and now it's time for

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.300
you practice and have fun.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.750
Participation in competitions is highly encouraged.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.190
And I'll leave a link to the World Cup Association website for you down below.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.590
I understand a lot of the reasons why people would be scared at these competitions, like being too

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.090
slow or not knowing anyone.

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.430
I felt this way, too, and my first competition, but I easily discovered how silly these fears are.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.980
Don't be afraid of being too slow.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.170
People who literally have just learned to beginners method and are averaging two minutes even go to

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.720
the competition by taking this course.

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.380
You're already one of the highest level speed tubers in any of these competitions.

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.750
And all of the ones I've been to the bottom times have been around one minute, 30 seconds.

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.890
And if you're using advanced method or KFAB up, this is easily beatable.

14
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.490
Any average time below 30 seconds puts you in a place for qualification of future rounds like the second

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.540
round or final round.

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.490
It depends on the tournament.

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.540
But this still shows you how slow you can be and still make it to the second round.

18
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.050
The issue of not knowing anyone isn't large either.

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.960
I have friends who I met or I'm solely friends with because we were both interested in Rubik's Cubes.

20
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.210
Public areas can be intimidating since you don't know if you share interests with the people around

21
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.420
you.

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.790
But at competitions, you are literally there because you share interests with those people, which

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.110
is a recipe for friendship.

24
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.420
You can literally go up to someone and talk about Rubik's Cubes, since you both know you like that

25
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.870
subject.

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.580
That's why you're at the competition.

27
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.090
Read more about competitions on WCA website.

28
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.050
And anyway, I really hope you enjoyed my course and learned a lot from it.

29
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.490
Keep practicing, stay motivated, and eventually you'll get as good as I am.

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210
Thank you so much for choosing me on Udemy.

31
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.800
And don't forget to ask questions or leave me a review.

32
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.000
How fun.
