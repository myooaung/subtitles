1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,310
So the final tip is color neutrality.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,200
But in my opinion, color neutrality is the least necessary step to improve your time.

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,720
So all it is, is the ability to do the cross on any color side instead of white or yellow.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,140
So here you can see we have a green cross.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,970
Everything's paired up with its corresponding centers.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,070
And I still have another F to L case.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,570
But we have to make really weird of two L pairs like this one.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,080
So I have green, orange, red and sort of white matching up with light.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,310
I do weird things like green matching up here.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,260
I have to make pairs like this.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,450
They look really weird with white on it.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,210
Then I have to insert it into the correct slot.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,630
And now this side looks really weird.

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,190
It's white.

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,220
The white is partially solved, which is not something I'm used to.

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,730
And everything can just be hard to comprehend.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
So color neutrality is solely faster because of the existence of luck.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,590
So in any given scramble like this one, the chance that the White Cross or Yellow Cross will be the

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,620
easiest to solve.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,800
Out of all six colors is two out of six.

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,370
So over here, it just so happens that the Orange Cross.

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,770
Can simply be solved with an hour to move.

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,990
But since I'm not color neutral, then I would rather do the White Cross and just do something comfortable

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,320
to me.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,600
So in a scramble like this, or whose color neutral would be able to solve a few seconds because they're

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,580
dressed up, would be really easily done.

27
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,830
But now they'd have to do to L and do it with weird pairs again, which can cost extra time.

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,380
So for me, all steps of the queue were basically ruined because I'm not used to doing Orange Cross

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,550
or any weird colored cross, so I'm barely color neutral.

30
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,770
And what I end up doing is wasting time on F to L trying to figure out how to make pairs, because I'm

31
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,560
just not used to making weird pairs with white in them.

32
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,930
So I'd rather spend my time improving on other stuff rather than learning color neutrality.

33
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,020
Because if I spend my time learning, for example, better F two L or how to be more efficient, I feel

34
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,820
like that would save more time rather than spending a lot of time learning how to solve the cross on

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,900
any colored center.

36
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,570
So if you do learn color neutrality, it'll save you a few extra moves, one to four at the start of

37
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,720
solving a cube and we'll save you like one second.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,940
So basically, this is only necessary once you pass the ten second solved time barrier.

39
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,120
And I'm not even there yet, so I haven't even learned it.

40
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,110
But it's just not very it's not a very good use of your time.

41
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,500
You could spend your time learning other things and save way more seconds.

42
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,050
If you want to learn color neutrality, you can.

43
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,100
But I don't recommend it as it's not very necessary and hard to land.
