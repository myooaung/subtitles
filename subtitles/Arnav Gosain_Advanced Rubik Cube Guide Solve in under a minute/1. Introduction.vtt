Most people pick up a Rubik's cube, learn how to solve it and barely ever solve it again in this course.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.600
I'll show you do the opposite and bring your solving skills to the next level.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.610
You won't just be able to solve a cube.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.660
You'll be able to do it.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.740
And insane speed.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.890
Once again, my name is Arnav, and welcome to my course.

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.530
I'm so happy you've chosen me to help you with your skills.

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.600
Firstly, isn't a course on how to solve a Rubik's cube.

9
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.670
As I said earlier, this is, of course, for those who already know how to solve a cube and want to

10
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.160
improve their method, time and efficiency.

11
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.640
In this course, I will teach you the advanced method known as KFAB.

12
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.960
I will then give you tips on how to further improve your time and become a speed silver.

13
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.380
Again, this is not for people who can barely solve the cube.

14
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.340
Let's start with the basics and recap everything you should have learned before.

15
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.770
The next section will be a recap of beginner's method that isn't very in-depth, but we'll let you remember

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.790
everything you should know.

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.910
I recommend completing a few lectures a day or one a day, as it is easy to forget something you learned

18
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.040
when learning the cube algorithms can be hard to memorize and should be regularly practiced until they

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.910
are muscle memory.

20
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.370
If you don't know any algorithms or don't know notation, you should go back and learn common cue notation

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.290
like are for right.

22
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.470
Some beginner.

23
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.510
You guys do not teach algorithms.

24
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.440
You must know notation in order to learn the content in this course.

25
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.020
So I have left a link to a site down below where you can reference notation at any time in case you

26
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.320
didn't.
