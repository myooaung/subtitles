00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.880
So after Halstead's the first two layers, which is the two steps of beginners method put into one.

2
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.760
So while solving these white corners will match them with their corresponding edges to form them into

3
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.300
a pair.

4
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.380
Let's look like this.

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.350
So we have a white corner that can go into the slot.

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.690
But notice how its edges trailing behind it.

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.580
So we can insert them both together.

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.370
So I'll teach you how to do this intuitively, and then I'll leave a link to a list of all algorithms

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.260
that can be used for F to L.

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.810
In case you encounter a really hard case, I recommend not using these algorithms.

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.510
Don't learn all of them, just learn only algorithms for the really hard cases, because doing it intuitively

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.010
will help your skills and will be much better for when you need to solve something else later.

13
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.560
So overall, our goal is to think about how to make pairs on the top layer and how to insert the.

14
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.010
But before we start off, too, well, there are two very important algorithms that are extremely common

15
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.910
and very useful.

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.490
So they're both 44 moves each.

17
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.890
They'll be inserted in the middle of many algorithms used to solve the solvent ethtool pair used to

18
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.980
move something from the top layer into the bottom and other things.

19
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.190
So the first move to the sexy move.

20
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.320
I know the names weird, but it's a very well-known for move sequence that tremendously helps with algorithms.

21
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.210
And by the way, it's called this because the move sequence is smooth to perform and can be done very

22
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.600
quickly.

23
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.870
So the form moves in this sequence are are you our prime, you prime.

24
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.740
So for the rest of this course, I'll put these four moves in brackets and color green to help you recognize

25
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.960
the secrets and algorithms and to be able to apply it in the in an algorithm without just remembering

26
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.650
a ton of moves.

27
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.780
So this will help with your memorization and it will also help with your finger tricks and being able

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.990
to do the sequence efficiently.

29
00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.050
The sledgehammer is another form of sequence, and its algorithm is our prime.

30
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.260
F r f prime.

31
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.530
So I'll put this one in brackets two and color it red.

32
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.840
And as you can see, both of those algorithms that we did were insertion techniques for up to well,

33
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.480
I answer this pair twice using those moves.

34
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.580
And that's why they're super useful in F2 l along with in many other algorithms.
