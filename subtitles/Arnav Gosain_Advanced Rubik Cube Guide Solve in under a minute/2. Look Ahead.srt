1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,250
The next tip I have is look ahead.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,980
So parties are a massive time waster during a solve and they're frequent after algorithms are completing

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,750
different stages, like after well, this is because your attention shifts from one step to another.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,400
I need a look at the cube and figure out which LPL pll are, after all, case you have.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,010
Looking ahead is the ability to see what case of the next step you have before you even finish up your

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,220
arm.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,250
So, for example, here I'm doing well.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,040
And I see I have this pair here and I want to say here, and since I've got it of to and I know the

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
exact moves that I can, I can do this with, which is, are you prime our prime?

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,620
So this is just a finger finger exercise and my brain isn't working while I'm doing those moves.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,290
So instead, if I do if I want my muscles to do something different from my brain, then I'll be able

12
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,320
to do one step ahead and immediately solve the next pair.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,510
So while I'm solving this, I know that these two pieces are back here, which is my next pair.

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,090
So my brain, my my muscles will be doing these moves, but my brain will be tracking these.

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,490
So I'll just watch what happens.

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,690
I know this corner will come back here and now I know this edge is over here.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,020
So from here, I knew exactly which, after all case I have, which means I can immediately solve this

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,150
and I go straight into solving the next one.

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,970
It's the exact same for oLow and Pilo.

20
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,870
So here I have another afterworld case, but my next step is ololo.

21
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,690
So I'm going to wash the top yellow pieces and see what happens.

22
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,250
I'll move this edge up, replace this, and then move another one here.

23
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,480
So I know love across case.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,090
And then all I have to do is identify the corners while they're moving.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,360
So I just watch the corners.

26
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,450
This one going back here.

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,600
This one will come down here and this won't be facing outwards like this.

28
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,280
So we have a suitcase.

29
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,010
So instead of just simply inserting this pair, now that I know that I'll have a suitcase, I can jump

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,450
straight into the algorithm.

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:04,580
And this is a really special case, because the insertion for this pair involves the OLALLA algorithm.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,840
So I've already done this.

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,350
Are you are prime movers of the Zoon algorithm.

34
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,450
So I can just continue with a U.

35
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,490
Are you to our prime?

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,800
And I could see while I was insisting that pair, I instantly solved all all which saved a lot of time.
