1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,950
So let's go through some more actual cases.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,690
This one, it might look like we have to separate the edge and bring it over here.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,090
But there's actually a better way of solving this one.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:22,140
So instead of just disconnecting the edge with the corner in front, the slide in the back, instead

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,240
of doing this and then matching them up.

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,380
Another way we can do it is to put this whole thing in the back.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,980
And then we move this side down.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,240
Take this corner out this way and push this side up.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,890
So now we've completely oriented this corner, and you can see that we have opposite colors on top.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,080
So instead of having matching colors, we put this quarter down over here and this blue side came up.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,730
And then also we kept this as in its place.

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,130
So we just set it up for insertion.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:06,030
So once we do our prime, you are, then we can just do a YOUTU above the sizes to go in and insert

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,540
the piece.

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,720
Same thing here.

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,850
This is the Myrie case.

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,220
We have matching colors here and two pieces over here and they're not matched up.

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,180
So instead of doing this, an easier way to do it is to just put this above this light right here,

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,770
and then we're just going to do it the same thing as last time, but backwards.

20
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,640
So we're just going to take this corner over here, keeping the edge here.

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,390
Move it into this light and then bring it back.

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,360
So all we did was we flipped this corner over here and you could see that this is ready for insertion.

23
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,240
So you just inserted with the slide on the back a backwards insertion.

24
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,150
And there we go, that was much easier.

25
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,380
Let's say we have something like this.

26
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:00,020
We have our air here, but it cannot be answered because it's already taking up this lot.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,760
So we'll take this pear out without breaking it and then we'll reinsert it to solve it.

28
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,940
So to take it out, I'm going to move it to this box.

29
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,730
Lots that can be easily inserted without breaking anything.

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm going to first take this out and then use one move to put it back here and move this back down.

31
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,900
Now, we have a very easy insertion case.

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,010
I just go to this side, put the slide in the back.

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,640
I'll move the side up, do a YouTube move to match it, and then put this back down.

34
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,820
Here's another case.

35
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,970
We can see here we have our corner, it's solved, but it's oriented wrong and we have our edge over

36
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,190
here and it's making a bar.

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,800
So these two colors are not matching.

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,400
And we can see that if I move this side up, then we'll form a pair.

39
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,260
So that's exactly what I'm going to do.

40
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,900
But I'm going to do it in the back just so that it's easier to perform.

41
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,680
So I'll put this in the back.

42
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,640
I'll move this side up and match up there.

43
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:02,820
Move it out of the way and fix this side, and then I'll just do a Yuto to put it ready for insertion.

44
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,600
I'll go back to this side, move the side up, insert the pair, go back down and sobbed.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,570
If we have something like this, these two are just completely it's a complete mess.

46
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,370
This is not oriented correctly.

47
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,210
This is not Marting, this one, and they're both like taking up slots.

48
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,540
What I'm going to do first is move this corner out of the way and I'm going to bring this up in a way

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,430
that these two will be ready for insertion.

50
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,830
So I'm going to do.

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,930
And are you our prime to bring this into here?

52
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,260
And now we have opposite colors over here.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,700
White facing this way.

54
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,100
So I'll just put this above the slots.

55
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,880
And the seize up for him appear and insert it.

56
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,630
If we have a really another really messy case like this one, they're both in the right place, but

57
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,040
they're completely oriented on them.

58
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,210
Another way we can do this with is to take this one out and then we have a case like this.

59
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,820
But this would be a little bit too many moves.

60
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,340
So I'm going to show you a way that's a little bit faster by breaking these in the process of taking

61
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,760
them out.

62
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,280
So first, I'm going to do an F prime.

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
You F.

64
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,670
And now we could see that this judge is facing upwards and this edge is has been taken out over here.

65
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,910
So now we have a case from earlier.

66
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm just going to match these up right here.

67
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,770
So I'll move this as back.

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,230
And then now if I move this quarter over for form up here and then move this over here.

69
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:43,320
So basically all I did was an hour our new are prime, then Bastos up and then I just insert it with

70
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,980
a sledgehammer.

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,190
And the reason I did a sledge hammer is because since I already have to move this side, I can just

72
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,050
do an hour, two instead of an hour prime.

73
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,280
So wall and mashing these up right here, I can do artu and instantly insert it without any breaks.

74
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,420
So here's another one.

75
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,190
We have our edge on this side, and it's up with green he to go to the left.

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,780
We have our corner here.

77
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,360
It's facing out this way and it's oriented wrong.

78
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,920
So first thing I'm going to do is take this quarter out and then match it up with this.

79
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,210
So I just take this out in the way that these colors are opposite.

80
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,190
And now we have a simple insertion.

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,080
Are you are prime, you prime?

82
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,310
And that solves it.

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,550
OK, so let's all the F to all cases I'm going to show you, I left out some of the married cases as

84
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,960
a challenge for you to figure out.

85
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,670
So once I showed you a case, if I didn't show you the mirror version of it, try and figure it out

86
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,150
yourself.

87
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,110
It's pretty simple.

88
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,650
Either just do it on the left side or do it from behind and you'll be able to get it as long as you

89
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,030
understand everything else.

90
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,590
And you'll easily be able to figure out the mirrors and you'll probably be able to intuitively figure

91
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,400
out how to solve it.

92
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,330
F2 Alpen without having to refer to this course or find an algorithm.

93
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,220
So crisis after.

94
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,970
Well, do do a bunch of examples of these with AV and just try to insert, try to match up.

95
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,960
Just keep practicing and you'll be able to do it very intuitively.

96
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,070
You'll be able to solve any pair in your mind without having to look it up or get help.

97
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,550
So eventually you'll be able to do it and it will become muscle memory.

98
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,220
And now I'm going to move on to some examples of just so that you can see some special cases or in case

99
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,950
you're confused on something or what you should start with.

100
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
So let's move on to those.

101
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,840
OK, so here's our first scramble.

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,310
We have resolved cross.

103
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,540
And let's look around for a first apair that might be easy to solve.

104
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,760
This is really obvious.

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,310
We have a mash up here right here, which is lucky.

106
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,400
So if it needs to go into is here, I'm going to insert it simply with a very sexy move.

107
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,110
And that solves it.

108
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,960
So now let's just look around for another pair.

109
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,000
These two might work.

110
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,300
Let's see these two maybe.

111
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,680
Oh, here we go.

112
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,780
We have our orange GreenEDGE solved and we have our orange edge over here.

113
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,430
So we need to go to the left.

114
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,040
So we'll do the same algorithm through insert it.

115
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,460
That's too soft to look around for more.

116
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,210
Here's another pair we have this case, the colors are matching and the corners facing this way.

117
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,220
So this edge needs to go here to make a pair.

118
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,810
So I see that this line is open, so I'll just use this light to match them up.

119
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,950
And that broke nothing, and now we have our pair, since this is in the back, I'm going to do a YouTube

120
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,630
and insert it through the back.

121
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:55,580
So I just moved this side down, bring this up, puts it in and fix it, and that solves it.

122
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,140
And then here's our last pair.

123
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,150
We have one of these cases.

124
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,980
So I'm going to keep it over here.

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,560
And we can see that this slot is open in the back.

126
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,850
So all I'm going to do is use this to break over these edges.

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,590
So I'm going to move this down.

128
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,950
I want to move this edge here since these colors are not matching.

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,580
I want you to put this back up.

130
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,200
Now, we have a simple insertion case where it's easily paired up, easily like this.

131
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,270
So I just move over to this side.

132
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,050
I'll put this above the slot and I'll do a left handed version.

133
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,010
And there you go, it's solved, and that's our first at Rodon.

134
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,320
All right, here's our next case, we have a sore cross again.

135
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,130
And first, let's look around for a pair that might be easy to solve.

136
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,290
So I see green and orange.

137
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,510
Are the red stuck down here?

138
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,710
Probably don't want to do that.

139
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:54,940
These two might be easy, but the slots in the back and then are blue.

140
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,360
Red.

141
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,280
This this is stuck down here.

142
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,700
So it seems like we're just stuck between orange, blue and green.

143
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,150
Orange.

144
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,210
I think I'm going to sort of blue orange first.

145
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,480
So again, using the open light, since all slots are open, it doesn't really matter anyway, which

146
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,230
is facing me.

147
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,640
This one needs to go here.

148
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,710
I'll move the corner out, move the edge and pull it back.

149
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:25,000
And there's are as a pair, I can just move this over, go to this side and insert it.

150
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,540
And then immediately I see this pair here.

151
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,830
I think I'm going to solve that one first because it's right next to me.

152
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,580
So do you two.

153
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,960
Now we have this case.

154
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,310
So again.

155
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,460
Because these are not noshing, we want to move this over here so we can form a pair like this.

156
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,090
And then the slot is back here.

157
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,940
So let's do a YOUTU and then this forms our pair and brings up the side to insert into.

158
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,250
So I just one the pair move this in and then put it back.

159
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,780
That solves it.

160
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,240
What else do we see?

161
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,210
OK, it seems like this is the easiest because these two are completely messed up, so we have blue,

162
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,040
red and blue red here.

163
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,510
So I'm going to have to move this side down so that I can form a pair like this.

164
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,120
But this side gets messed up.

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,630
So I have to do it on a different side so I can do it on this side.

166
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,880
If I just rotate to the blue side, then now there's an open slot in the back so I can move this side

167
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,040
down, pair the two up with a youtoo and move it back up.

168
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,990
And there it is.

169
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,900
And we'll move it here to a simple insertion.

170
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,700
And that solves it.

171
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,770
And then I see our lost her over here.

172
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,730
This is actually set up really nicely for our other algorithm.

173
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,440
So we see we have this case again.

174
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,740
The two are not matching, but the two on the top are matching.

175
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,160
So instead of just separating them, an easier way again is to move the core out and completely flip

176
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,370
it.

177
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,260
So with an ellu, Prime Alperin moves.

178
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,540
And now we can see we have this case.

179
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,740
These two are not nothing.

180
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,830
So just move this above the slot, rotate to this side, and then insert the left hand insertion.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,650
And that's another Attwell.

182
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,190
Here's the next one.

183
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,780
South Cross, look around for a pair.

184
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,000
Look around for a corner and edge.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,080
There might be easy to solve.

186
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,420
So here's my orange green.

187
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,670
Here's my red green.

188
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,510
Here's my red, blue and.

189
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm not even going to bother looking for the other one, but there it is.

190
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,300
It's just not going to be easy to solve if I can't find it anywhere.

191
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,310
So I'm going to solve this one since they're already kind of paired up and right in front of me.

192
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,970
So these two are not matching.

193
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,260
So I want to move this edge here.

194
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,030
So I'll move the corner out.

195
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,290
Push the edge over.

196
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,190
Put it back.

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,510
Now, these two are ready to be inserted, needs to go here.

198
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,840
So our prime is already l u l crime.

199
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,530
Here's our next.

200
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,330
We have blue and red and you see, oh, here we have another easy case.

201
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,220
We just move this corner down.

202
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,980
Paramount needs to go right here, so this insertive.

203
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,850
What's next?

204
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,680
I'm going to do these two next, so.

205
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,130
They need to go back here, and this is in the wrong light.

206
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,100
So when I rotate this side down, I'll bring this corner over here while moving the edge over here,

207
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,870
which makes it ready to pair up.

208
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,840
So this edge will get moved here or this corner will be flipped over here and we'll have an opposite

209
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,920
color case again.

210
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,820
So then I just do it back in person again.

211
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,660
Put that in and there's a lost one.

212
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,490
So here's our open slot.

213
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,260
We can't do it here that breaks thread, so I'll go over to this side.

214
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,780
Break them up.

215
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,270
Push it in the back and then just do a simple insertion and that Sulligent.

216
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,910
If I do, one more example of and then we'll move on to oil.

217
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,280
OK, here we are.

218
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,740
Here's our cross look around for pairs.

219
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,860
We have another lucky pair already made over here.

220
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,110
So this is obviously going to be what I saw first.

221
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,470
I'm just going to do that right now before I look for anything else.

222
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,630
It's still here.

223
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,380
So I just do our prime you to l solves it.

224
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,940
Now let's find a pair.

225
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,900
We have red green and these two corners are stuck in the bottom.

226
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,880
So I'm going to solve my red green first.

227
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,620
But I take this out.

228
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,260
Move it to the back.

229
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,670
Separate them.

230
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,910
And then now another ready.

231
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,830
So light in the dark.

232
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,060
We have this over.

233
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,710
Pair them up.

234
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,630
Moving in the back.

235
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,610
Here's my next pair, Atheel, here.

236
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,580
This is another nice case.

237
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,480
This move this to the back of the open slot.

238
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,310
Break them.

239
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,100
And then insert them.

240
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,700
And then here's our last one has already solved this irds needs to go left.

241
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,220
So the same algorithm for earlier.

242
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,570
And there we go.

243
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,340
So if you were confused on any of those, just ask me a question.

244
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,170
I can clarify something if you need to.

245
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,930
But yeah, that should be all in all there is to after.

246
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,170
Well, I'll just keep practicing and you'll see what's there to do.

247
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,310
And if you just look at the use of the cross, look for a pair notwist pair you want to do first.

248
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,090
And just keep looking around for other pairs that you want to solve.

249
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,000
Then you'll be able to intuitively do it.

250
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,880
And every muscle memory for you.

251
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,020
So, yeah.

252
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's go on to L.
