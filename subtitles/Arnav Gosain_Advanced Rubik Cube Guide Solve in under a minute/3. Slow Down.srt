1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,840
The next tip I have is to slow down because finger speed isn't everything.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,790
Using look ahead, it's possible that your fingers will be working too fast for your brain.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,950
If I can't see how other pieces are moving while doing an algorithm, there's no way to look ahead.

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,990
So the solution is to slow down finger wise.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,630
Don't do your moves too fast.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,540
Most times you're solving algorithm really quickly.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,780
But then you'll have a long pause trying to figure out what the next step is.

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,510
And then you have solved that next up quickly, et cetera.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,110
And your pauses will add up and you have a really long, solid time.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,870
So a better strategy is to be very fluid.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,510
If I know how have to insert this pair.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,380
But I want to do this slowly so that I can look around for other pieces.

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,360
So let's just do a sample solve.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,620
So while I'm solving this, I'm going to do it slowly so I can watch these pieces.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,660
And now I know of this case.

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,320
So I'll do this slowly while watching, for example, this orange screen.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,960
I know the orange green edges back here.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,730
So I just solve this case.

19
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,690
And then I watch the red green and I know instantly what to do because I was watching.

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,210
And look at how fast we solved after.

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,540
Well, when you don't want to do is just do everything really fast.

22
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,870
So I'm going to do another solve.

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,120
But this time I'm going to do everything as fast as I can and not be able to look ahead.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,740
So here's my first case.

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,120
I was trying to do it really fast.

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,620
And now I have to look around instantly because I don't know what my next cases are, because I did

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,460
that way too fast.

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,890
So after a long pause, I see this case.

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,780
So I just saw this as fast as I can.

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,540
Now I have to look around again.

31
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,840
I'm not really looking around.

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,270
I can't even do it that well.

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,810
I look around again.

34
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,740
I have to keep rotating and I solve it.

35
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,040
And now I still don't even know in my old cases.

36
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,100
So that's why it's really inefficient.

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,650
This is extremely common advice and competitions with high stress levels and lots of pressure.

38
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,730
People commonly make finger slips and mess up algorithms when trying to work too fast.

39
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,730
So, for example, I'm on the last up.

40
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,130
I'm on PLL, and I know exactly what the case is.

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,440
So I'm going to try and do this as fast as possible.

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,450
But keep in mind, I'm very stressed.

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,210
So you could see how inefficient that that algorithm was, my turns were awful, and I had to readjust

44
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,520
many times because I kept moving the layers that I didn't want to move.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,260
That algorithm took a really long time, and it would have been better if I had just slowed down and

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,210
done and done everything very fluidly.
