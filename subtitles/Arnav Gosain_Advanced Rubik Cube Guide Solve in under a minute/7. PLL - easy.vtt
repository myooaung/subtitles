1
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.040
So again, we have easy PLO and advanced PLO, easy PLO is similar to Eto'o in the way that there are

2
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.380
two steps that lead to solving two different things.

3
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.510
Also, PLO is essentially the second last layer beginner's method variety.

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.670
We will solve all the queries first, giving us highlights like these.

5
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.710
Then proceed to solve the cube.

6
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.500
So these, again, are headlights, even though it might not look like it, just because we have a soft

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.300
edge, these Stihler headlights, because we have two corners that are both matching and on the same

8
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.630
side.

9
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.750
So to start off is solving the yellow side.

10
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.460
We look around for a pair of headlights, put it in the back and do the same thing as earlier.

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:01:01.600
So our algorithm is our prime F, our prime D to our F prime, our prime to R2.

12
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.850
So if you don't have a pair of headlights again, do this from any side until you get headlights.

13
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.710
Then proceed to solve the corners.

14
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.770
So you can see now we have all headlights solved.

15
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.150
All corners are completely solved on the cube.

16
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.570
All we have to do is switch these ideas around.

17
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.630
So after doing the corners, there are four possible edge cases.

18
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.480
And since we want to solve all these cases in one algorithm, that means we have to learn four algorithms.

19
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.130
You already know one of these.

20
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.800
So really there are only three algorithms to learn right now.

21
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.570
So if we have a bar in the back, if we will, if we have a bar at all, put it in the back, and now

22
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.960
instead of just doing an algorithm, look at the unsolved charges.

23
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.130
So if we call that orange and red, it opposite's and blue and green opposite's.

24
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.830
So with a solved bar, there will be one pair of headlights with an opposite eyes in the middle such

25
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.430
as this one.

26
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.530
So you can see that one of our highlights is here, and it's opposite as is in the middle.

27
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600
So green is opposite blue.

28
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.850
And this is our side with opposite headlights.

29
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.460
Over here, blue is not opposite orange.

30
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.350
Orange is not opposite green.

31
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.480
So this is our side with opposite headlights.

32
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.860
So we want to determine which side this pair of opposite headlights is on, if it's on the right side

33
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.900
than we do the same algorithm we learned first.

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.840
Are you blind?

35
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:34.290
Are you are you are you prime our prime, you prime are two.

36
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.060
And that's our first subcu.

37
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.490
However, keeping our bar in the back.

38
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.210
If our opposite headlights are on the left side instead of the right side.

39
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.880
So our green blue is on this side right now, then keeping the bar on the back, we're going to do the

40
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.560
same algorithm, but backwards.

41
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.250
So we do our two U.

42
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:08.420
Are you are prime, you prime our prime, you prime our prime.

43
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.150
You are prime.

44
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.300
So here are two cases that happen if there's no bar.

45
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.790
So we have no bar anywhere, we have no soft edges, and there are two different cases.

46
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.600
There's one with opposite headlights and one with a headlights.

47
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.050
So here we have opposite headlights all around the tube, blues with green, red as with orange and

48
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.520
say over here, same over here.

49
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.910
So these all need to be flipped with across position.

50
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.960
So this needs to go here.

51
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.400
These two need to be flat to this.

52
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.120
You need to be flipped.

53
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.640
And this is one of the nicest algorithms.

54
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.330
So in this case, you can hold the queue on literally any side.

55
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.610
And our algorithm is.

56
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.610
And to you and to you, too.

57
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.300
And to you and to.

58
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.050
So, again, I'll do it from a different side this time.

59
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.930
That algorithm is really nice and easy to memorize because it's just a alternating and two and two moves

60
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.630
with a you youtu and you in the middle.

61
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.380
So and to you.

62
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.200
And to you, too.

63
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
And to you and to.

64
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.130
So here's the other case again, we have no bar anywhere.

65
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.940
But the difference is that these two these two had lights and edges are not opposite.

66
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.290
They are adjacent colors.

67
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.560
So none of these edges are opposite the his arm.

68
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.990
Instead, these two need to be flipped.

69
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.580
And these two need to be flipped.

70
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.900
So instead of flipping these two and these two, we flip these two and these two.

71
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.060
So we actually have a way to hold this, because if we don't do it this way, then the cube will get

72
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.540
messed up.

73
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.470
So the way we want to hold it is first look at a side.

74
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.500
And then once you're looking at this side, look to the left of it.

75
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.020
If you can see all four colors on the cube, so orange, blue, green and red, then you're holding

76
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.830
it in the right way.

77
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.180
So over here, I can see blue, red, orange and green.

78
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.830
However, if I go to this side, which is red and blue, if I look to the left now, then the only colors

79
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.190
I see are blue and red, which is not ideal.

80
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.290
So do not hold the cube on this side.

81
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.010
If you cannot see all colors on the cube when you look left.

82
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.410
So on this side, I look left.

83
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.400
I can see all colors.

84
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.610
And then if I go to the green or side, if I look left, I can see all colors, red and blue, green

85
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.150
and orange.

86
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.600
But on this side, I can only see green and orange.

87
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.440
So I'm going to do the algorithm from this side.

88
00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:06.550
So, again, we can select our algorithm is am to you and to you and prime, which is going upwards,

89
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.330
not downwards.

90
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.920
You too am to you too, am prime.

91
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.360
And then we just finished the cube with YouTube and that solves it.

92
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.210
So that's everything for basic oil and PLO combined with the cross and up to.

93
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.250
This will produce a solid cube for any scrambled Rubik's cube.

94
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.760
So any of the 43 quintillion possible scrambles.

95
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.290
So what if, you know, all of these algorithms that I just taught you and you'll be able to do this

96
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.250
and you'll already be getting faster times, even with easy oil and oil?

97
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.130
Once you start practicing it a lot, once you get everything down and are able to do it without looking

98
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:54.130
stuff up or without sitting there and pausing for a long time, then you can instantly recognize something

99
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.270
and solve it really quickly.

100
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.470
And then you should be able to easily get sub one minute once you're ready.

101
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.010
We can also learn oil advanced and pilo advanced.

102
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.160
These will also help your times.

103
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.380
But again, there are a lot of algorithms.
