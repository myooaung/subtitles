The fourth tip is to save moves because it's pretty obvious that less moves is equal to less time.

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.030
What I mean by save moves is find better ways to do things and be efficient.

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.840
This doesn't apply to all other, since those are just algorithms.

4
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.780
But during a cross or after, well, you might see an edge or pair that and you might get stuck to it.

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.030
So, for example, I see this blue orange pair, but it's stuck in the slot and needs to go here.

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.400
So one way to do this is to take this out and then insert this.

7
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
Now I have this one solved, but now the blue rat has to be solved again.

8
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.270
So I need to do more moves.

9
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.310
And then now I took way too many moves just to solve two cases.

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.250
So if I were saving moves, then I know that if I insert the correct pair here, this blue edge pair

11
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.870
will get displaced.

12
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.090
So here I have my red blue pair.

13
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.770
And instead of doing this one first, I'm going to solve this one so that this will get displaced and

14
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.610
then I'll answer it.

15
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.200
So if I go ahead and solve the pair like that with a sledgehammer, then now this one's immediately

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.680
displaced.

17
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.960
I can easily insert her with three moves.

18
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.350
So that took seven moves total versus the complete mess that I did earlier when I just saved moves and

19
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.580
inserted this one first.

20
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.690
So basically what I'm saying is don't get stuck on one pair or EDG if it's stuck somewhere or it's really

21
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.350
hard to solve.

22
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.390
Just do something else first so that you'll get an easier case and you can solve that one afterwards.

23
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.600
So just look around for alternatives and be efficient.
