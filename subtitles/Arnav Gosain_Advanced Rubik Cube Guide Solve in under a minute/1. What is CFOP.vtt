Welcome to CFR.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.650
This is the method of the current world record holders use.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.540
So Seaforth stands for Cross after all.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.870
And PLL, these are the four key steps to solving the cube.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.280
The cross simply across on the bottom, just like what we had in beginners method.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.310
EFT will is first two layers, and it's just the first layer and the second layer, but done in the

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.970
same step.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.920
And this is all mostly intuitive, which makes it one of the hardest things to learn with the Rubik's

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.190
Cube.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.340
All our stands for orienting last layer, which is just solving the yellow side, so orienting all the

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.600
yellow pieces to face upwards and PLO is positioning last layer, which is just solving everything else.

12
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.450
So we take the yellow pieces and just move them around and that solves the cube.
