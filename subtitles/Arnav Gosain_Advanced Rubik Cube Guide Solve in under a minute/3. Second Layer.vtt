00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.910
All right, the next step of beginner's method is the second layer.

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.520
So the second layer solves these middle edges right here.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.150
Yes.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.620
Do we still have ourselves, Whiteside?

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.070
Our fault first later done.

6
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.830
I cross is still intact.

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.090
All we did was we took edges and we installed them with the corners.

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.780
So algorithms are really necessary to solve this stuff.

9
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.760
If you do learn algorithms, then you probably just do them, but don't know that you're doing algorithms.

10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.150
And these will also be used in six of the nation.

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.230
You know, these I'm going to cover them really fast in.

12
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.560
They're examples of second layer.

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.730
OK, so here we are back with our salt first layer right here.

14
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.380
I'm going to do first is look in the top layer for any edge that doesn't have yellow in it.

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.960
Right here, I immediately see blue and red.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.060
So what I'll do is I'll move the blue and red above the corresponding color.

17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
So you should see a bar right here and that should be facing towards you.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.450
So the blue bars here, the red edges on top.

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.510
And we can see that blue and red centers are to the right.

20
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.000
So this edge needs to go in this light.

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.260
So since this edge is on the left and the slight they need to go in is on the right.

22
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.560
Then we'll do the algorithm with the bar facing you.

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.870
You are you are prime, you prime at prime, you prime f.

24
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.650
There's our first Selvidge.

25
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.250
We've got back in the top layer.

26
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.030
Look for another one.

27
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.100
Red Green needs to go to the right.

28
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.070
So you are you are prime you prime F prime.

29
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.490
Ukraine F.

30
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.560
That's two.

31
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.900
Piers, Green and orange needs to go to the right again.

32
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.270
You are you are prime, you prime heffron you prime.

33
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.870
So now we can see that the bar is over here, the slot that needs to go to the left so we can learn

34
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.830
the other algorithm.

35
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.610
So again, the bars of bass you and we're going to do the same algorithm but mirrored so you prime our

36
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.860
prime you prime l you f you F prime.

37
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.440
And that solves our second layer.
