Next is the Yellow Cross, and this is where things get more tricky.

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.790
There are also two different methods of completing the cube that branch off from the step that I'm going

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.050
to briefly cover both of them.

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.710
But first, let's solve the cross, which is a structure with both methods.

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.320
So the Yellow Cross is just like the White Cross.

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.960
We have four edges or on a center, except the difference is that we don't care about the edges on the

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.380
side.

8
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.960
So Green does not have to match up with that center.

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.010
Instead, for now, we can just have the edges in any orientation.

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.290
And as long as they form across with the other center, then that's the step complete.

11
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.640
OK, immediately after solving the second layer, look at this yellowface for either a solved cross,

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.010
which would be lucky, or a bar like this one.

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.530
So if you have a bar like this, there's two edges opposite from each other.

14
00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:02.560
Then put that sideways and do the algorithm, as are you, our prime, you prime as prime to solve address.

15
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.770
OK, if you got a case like this where you don't have a bar, you just have either two adjacent edges

16
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.060
or a dot like this one.

17
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.840
Then we could just do that same algorithm, but on any side until we get a bar.

18
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.570
So like right here, we can just do f are you our prime you prime as prime?

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.130
That didn't give us a bar, so just do it again.

20
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.020
F are you our prime?

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.820
You became prime and we have our bar.

22
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.690
So we put the bar sideways again and just do the same thing and ourselves across f are you our prime,

23
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.750
you prime prime.

24
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.800
And there you go.
