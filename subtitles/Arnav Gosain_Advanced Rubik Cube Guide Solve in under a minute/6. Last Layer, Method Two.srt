1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,440
So the other way from here is to solve the yellow top and then solve the last layer.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,170
And this is identical to old on pilo.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,100
So if you know how to do this method, then it will be really easy to learn the other two.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,310
So we start after solving the Yellow Cross by looking for a case like this known as the case or the

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,880
fish case.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,470
We have one corner oriented in the bottom left and no other corners oriented.

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,900
We have one yellow facing us.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,910
So towards us and not this way.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,960
So if we do an algorithm from here, we'll instantly solve the yellow talk.

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,890
That algorithm is our you, our prime.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,980
You are you to our prime.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,930
You see the other side is solved.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,170
But let me show you what to do if you don't get a scene.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,030
So in a case like this one, we have no corners oriented, so we don't have a fish case.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,920
What we're going to do is we're going to put this in any direction and do the same algorithm until we

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,460
get assoon.

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,480
So from here.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,160
Are you are prime you are you to our prime.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,470
Oh, there's a scene first try.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,680
So put this in the bottom left corner facing us.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,970
Are you our prime?

22
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,980
You are.

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,530
You two are prime one the top.

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,770
OK, so after solving the yellow side, we want to solve this corner first and then put the edges in

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,580
the right spots.

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,000
So we look for a pair of headlights like this one, which is just two corners that have the same color.

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,850
They're facing you.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,870
So you can see we don't have headlights here.

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,300
These are not the same color.

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,750
These are not headlights, but these are headlights.

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,640
So if we get headlights like this one, we want to put it in the back and do the algorithm.

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:53,210
Our climb up our prime to r f prime, our prime to our two.

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,000
And you can see that now we've solved all of the headlights.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,880
So all of these corners are solved, including one edge back here.

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,850
But let me show you what to do if you don't get headlights.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,540
OK, so here we are back with the Salvio side, and you can see here that we don't have any headlights.

37
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,550
All these all these corners are not matching.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,420
So.

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,990
We're going to do similar to before the same algorithm, but from any side until we get headlights.

40
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,160
So I'll just do it from here.

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:30,900
Our prime F, our prime E to our F prime, our prime Dinka are two.

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,670
And let's look around.

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,380
There's our headlights so we can put this in the back now and do the do it again.

44
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:47,340
Our prime as our prime into our prime, our prime e to our two.

45
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,850
And that's all the corners.

46
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,720
And I got lucky.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,350
And it's all the edges, too, but mainly to solve these corners.

48
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,100
OK, so after that last stop, this is what the most common case looks like.

49
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,440
We have one small side just like this.

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,280
So this edge is solved and then we have three edges that are not solved.

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,800
So we still have headlights on every side.

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,610
But this as needs to go here, this will need to go here and this one needs to go here.

53
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,160
So what is use one algorithm to do that?

54
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,290
So put this bar in the back.

55
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,580
Put the subsite in the back.

56
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,690
And our new algorithm is, are you prime?

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:34,100
Are you are you are you prime our prime new prime artu?

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,210
Looks like it didn't do it this time.

59
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,510
So what keep this in the back, do that algorithm again.

60
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,030
Are you prime?

61
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,360
Are you are you are you prime?

62
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,360
Our prime, you prime are two.

63
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,120
And that's all Oliver edges and subtractive.

64
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,860
So that's about it for beginners method.

65
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,810
Make sure you know, all the algorithms I went through, because those are the important ones and not

66
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,950
the ones I didn't go through.

67
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,470
So all the algorithms that I taught you in this beginners method review will be used later on.

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,060
Make sure you know those.

69
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,130
Memorize those.

70
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,540
Write them down on paper.

71
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,590
Practice them.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,110
So, yeah, let's let's move on to Cifas.
