1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,570
Let's start with the event, STRUS.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,330
So the event for is very similar to the normal course.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,770
The end result is the same, but there are more methods to solve the crisis that are more efficient

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,400
and faster.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,830
So, again, our goal is for the cross to look like this with preferably white or yellow edges matching

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,230
the center to keep it simple and these edges matched in their adjacent colors.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,020
I'll go over color neutrality or using any colored cross like Blue Cross instead in the next section.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,360
But first, do you see what I'm going to use?

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,860
White grass to keep it simple.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,030
There aren't really any algorithms in the up because it's all intuitive.

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,450
Let's start with the inspection.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,700
Typically, you'll be given 15 seconds to inspect the queue before solving and competitions.

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,200
This is the standard for basically every soul there is.

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,560
So always inspect the cube while inspecting the main thing you should be looking for is where the white

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,160
edges are.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,610
So we hold the cube with the white center down.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,600
Let me scramble it.

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,330
We'll keep this site on the bottom.

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,560
And while inspecting, we want to look for where the white edges are.

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,560
So we ignore everything else is look, I see a white edge here.

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,530
This is white, blue.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,030
I see one here.

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,810
This is white.

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,290
Orange.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,000
This is white, green.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,900
And it's already solved.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,340
So I don't have to do anything with that.

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,680
And then here's white.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:24,950
Red.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,040
So during inspection, our goal is to find these edges and develop a way that we can try to solve them

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,230
so we don't use the flower method anymore.

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,340
This is very inefficient.

33
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,910
Instead, we want to look for an algorithm that will solve all of our edges.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,970
So with this bluez, I can immediately see that doing a Yuto and an R2 will solve it.

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,600
And then I can look at all the others and I can see that instead of doing an R2, this edge will match

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,010
up with its center in between.

37
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:58,930
So I can just do an hour prime and then orient this red edge back here and then move the blue one down.

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,890
So we solve the red one by doing the blue one.

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,990
And then this orange one is tricky.

40
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,790
So I'm just going to move that to the top layer first and then now I can move this out of the way.

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:15,320
And I can take this orange side and match it up to a center like this that I can move this down and

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,730
fix the blue side with one move.

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,040
And that solves the cross and all of those moves.

44
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,980
I should have done in my head during inspection.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,690
So that stuff seems really hard, but it'll get easier if you.

46
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,750
Well, once you tried it and if you use less moves because less moves are easier to memorize.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,480
OK, so again, there is no more flowers up.

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,120
We just want to get a sense of insertion, insertion and try and move these ideas down to the white

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,140
side as efficiently as we can while being aware of the other edges.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,480
So let's see.

51
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,000
With this one, I see green and orange right here.

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,880
These two can be sold relative to each other.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,570
If I move this side up and move this over and move this down, then that solves both of these edges

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,340
not to do the red and blue ones.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,450
So I know this one can easily be paired up with a center like this.

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,450
And then instead of just moving this down to solve it, I can see that while I'm doing that, this blue

57
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,490
one comes to a state where I can just push it over and match it up with its center in between and then

58
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,150
move this down.

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,470
So I just did an intermediate step to help solve this blue side.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,240
So I move this one down first and then I move this over and then do an hour prime.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,420
And now I can simply move this blue wedge down.

62
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,430
But a simple are two.

63
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,440
And I saw the cross again.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,830
So I was much less moved than the flower method.

65
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,140
And it will be much easier to memorize an inspection because it should be less than 10 moves.

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,910
Ideally, if you're doing more than that, that you probably want to improve your dress.

67
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,750
So let's let's do another example of salt.

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,440
OK, so here we have another scramble cube.

69
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,720
I see this orange side has already solved.

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,790
And here are my three edges.

71
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,630
So let's see, this blue edge can easily be solved just by moving this to the side and flipping the

72
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,020
stone.

73
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,960
So there's two solved and then.

74
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,620
This is GreenEDGE.

75
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,060
I can move it down and paired up with a center like this that displaces this orange one.

76
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,240
But I can just fix that after flipping this frontside, solving this one and move this back up to fix

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,440
that.

78
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,440
Now we have three solved.

79
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,900
And then finally, this red one is really easy.

80
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,970
I didn't move it and match it with the center.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
And I flip it down and those are across again.

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,660
So let's try something harder now.

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,890
Let's try and match the edges relative to each other instead of dissenters.

84
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,730
So by now, it should be clear that none of these centres move on the tube no matter what you what move

85
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,270
you do.

86
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,930
These centers will always be in the same place relative to each other.

87
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,710
So green is always going to be opposite blue.

88
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,130
Red will the opposite orange and yellow will always be opposite white.

89
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,450
So let's take this solved cross and work backwards.

90
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,350
Let's see what happens if I move the white side twice or do a PhD to move.

91
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,620
So nothing happened to the cross, but notice how the edges Mosler opposite centers.

92
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,510
So blue with green, orange is with red and vice versa over here.

93
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,610
So it's simple that we just did a D2 move and that solved the cross.

94
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,610
So working backwards, if we try and get this position earlier before we solve the cross, then we could

95
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,830
easily just do a PhD to move to solve the cross.

96
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,480
So let's say I have a case like this where I have the blue matching the green and the red matching the

97
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,670
orange, since I know that the orange and red and green and blue are already matching.

98
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,540
Then I can solve these relative to each other by simply moving the side down.

99
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,650
So with opposites right here, they're moving this side down.

100
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,830
And obviously, we get to do a PhD to to solve the cross again.

101
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,390
Similarly from across state, we can do a PhD or a deep rimu, and they'll also be one moved from solving

102
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,900
to grass.

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,050
So over here, we can see that red is with green greens, with orange, and all of this can easily solve

104
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,070
the cross in one move.

105
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,960
So let's work backwards again.

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,760
OK, so this is a pretty easy case.

107
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,270
We can see already that blues over here, orange is over here.

108
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,410
And you can you can both be moved down with an hour and a half, Primus.

109
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,580
So you can see that these are relative to each other.

110
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,870
So blue is to the right of orange.

111
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,460
And same with the.

112
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,650
Blue is to the right of orange.

113
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,060
So these two edges can easily be solved with a simple move.

114
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,470
One of the dollface.

115
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,700
We can just do that for every single sign.

116
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,820
I see that this green age is really convenient.

117
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,520
It's directly opposite the blue side.

118
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,350
So don't worry about the center.

119
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,170
It's not up to you.

120
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:10,910
Just know that if we solve these two edges again, then if I move this greenside down now, this green

121
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,670
is opposite blue, which means it's solved relative to each other.

122
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,730
And then now I can also see that this red side can easily be moved down right here, making it opposite

123
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,330
the orange.

124
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,460
And now I know that since all the opposites are in their correct positions to each other, that I can

125
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,310
just move the bottom of this to solve the dross.

126
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,940
So let's do another opposite of here we have red and orange mashed with green and blue.

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,480
So these two can be moved on to the white side.

128
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,600
We can see that the edges are matching their opposite centers.

129
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,750
So these two ideas will be solved with simple D to move.

130
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,990
But before we do that, we can easily just insert the other the other edges into these slots so that

131
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,730
we solve them with the D to move.

132
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,400
So let's see this orange as it can easily be moved down opposite run.

133
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,990
So that will be solved with D2.

134
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,190
But like I showed earlier, this blue edge is also attached to it.

135
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,640
So instead, what I'll do is while moving this orange edge down, I do an intermediate move and move

136
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,460
this edge out of the way and then solve this one again.

137
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,090
And now you can see that this blue and green edges are matched up.

138
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,950
I can move this down to the bottom.

139
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,740
And now all the edges are opposite again.

140
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,170
I can simply 32.

141
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,520
And that's all it.

142
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,440
OK, so let's go through some special cross cases in case there's edges stuck in certain places that

143
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,460
we don't want them to be.

144
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,820
So here we see we have a case where we have our green and red.

145
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,520
I just solved our orange edges over here, but our blue edge is in a wrong spot.

146
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,740
So you can see that the blue is not opposite green, which means it is not solved relative to each other.

147
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,650
So this is in the wrong place.

148
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,740
We want it to be here.

149
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,390
However, to do that, it would take a lot of moves and it would be really inefficient because we would

150
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,700
have to completely move this side up and then move it over and then move it down.

151
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,760
And then on top of that, we would have to solve the orange as well.

152
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,010
So instead, what we can do is just ignore this edge and replace it with the edge that's supposed to

153
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,430
go there.

154
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,080
So we know that orange is supposed to go here to match up with its center and to be opposite red.

155
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:26,490
So here's my orange as I just moved it to a stop and solve it up with its center and move it down.

156
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,770
That solves our orange side.

157
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,510
Now, by doing that, we've also displaced this blue center right here or this blue edge.

158
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,740
So now I can easily just move this to the side and solve it.

159
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,520
And we did that in much less move than solving the blue one first, because we solved the blue one by

160
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,570
solving the orange one.

161
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,550
So this was way more efficient.

162
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,930
OK, let's say we have a case like this.

163
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:58,310
We have three of our edges solved and our last as is in this position right here, it's in the right

164
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,780
spot.

165
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,470
It's with white and blue, but it's flip the wrong way.

166
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,990
So all we have to do is flip this over.

167
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,860
And the best way of doing that is moving this to the side to match up with a different center first.

168
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,690
So now we have blue and red.

169
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,730
And if we get this adjacent to all the other edges, then we could just insert this into this light.

170
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,760
So what I'll do is I'll get this slot over here.

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,680
And now we can see that if I move this down, the blue side will be opposite the green side.

172
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,180
So I can just do that.

173
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,450
And that gives us another adjacent solved edge case.

174
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,200
And I can simply easily be solved with a move, the dollface.

175
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,660
And as a solid cross, that's basically all I have to teach you for the cross right now.

176
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,390
I know this is pretty hard to grasp, but if you just practice trying to get all the edges and the rights

177
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:53,210
lights and all the special cases and how you can do it with adjacent faces instead of with their centers,

178
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,600
then you'll be able to do it with less than 10 moves.

179
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,580
Just keep practicing and asked me questions if you need some clarification.

180
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,780
And yeah, next step is actual, which is really, really hard.

181
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,350
So make sure you have this stuff down and then we'll try and move on to afterworld.
