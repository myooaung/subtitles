1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,590
The next stop in Victoria's method is the first layer, this layer involves solving the wet side by

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,240
putting the corners in the grass.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,550
And notice how this layer has a perfect color scheme and the corners and their correct salt positions.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,290
So you can see here the orange makes a little tea like this.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,060
So does every single other side.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,130
So we still have our cross intact.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,570
Let's do an example of salt.

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,240
OK, so here we have a solid cross state.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,350
This is what it typically looks like.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,700
This is what we had in the first up.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,020
So I'm going to use the most simple method first.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,850
This is what most beginners do will take an edge.

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,670
This one's already on top, preferably one in the bottom layer.

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,760
So like this one, we have white, green and red or in the bottom layer across it right here on top.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,320
So we're going to move the bottom face until this is right below the spot.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,070
We want it to go in.

17
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:01,210
So between the green and red centers and the algorithm that people do is our prime de prime, our D.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,340
And that's all for this corner.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,030
Next corner I see on the bottom is white, green, orange.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,500
Put that in between the orange and green senators right below this light.

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,620
And I will do the same algorithm our prime de prime are.

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,500
And keep going until it's solved.

23
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,550
There we go.

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,100
This one still stuck in this light.

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,720
So let's find this one.

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,800
Blue, red.

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,870
Put that in between.

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,980
Do the same thing.

29
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,390
And now this one is in the bottom.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,350
Sort of move it here and solve the layer just like that.

31
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,850
And that's the fourth.

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,840
First place on.

33
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,450
OK, so we're back with another solid cross.

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,570
And I said, I'm going to use the more advanced method.

35
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,820
So instead of doing that algorithm, we will keep the cross on the bottom and we'll use an intuitive

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,470
sense of insertion insertion.

37
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,090
So this is still above the corresponding corresponding centers.

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,310
And I'll just insert it using Renu moves and I'll do that for every edge.

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,450
So we have the blue and red one here.

40
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,940
This one is facing me, so I'll just do it on the left side.

41
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,140
So using our new moves and then this one one's down here.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,920
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to insert a random corner first like this one.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,070
So I'll insert this just down here.

44
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,090
And what would I would do is displace this green and orange corner.

45
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,350
And then we can move that back to the top above where I need to go and simply insert it.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,570
And that also shows the first layer.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,400
But it's there's no algorithms to it.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,080
It's intuitive.

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,550
So you need to just get in a sense of insertion.

50
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,620
And that's basically what we do in F 12.

51
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,460
But with edges.

52
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,650
So that's about it for the first layer.
