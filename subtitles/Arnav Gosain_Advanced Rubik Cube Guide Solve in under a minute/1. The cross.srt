1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,670
The first step of beginning his method is the cross.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,590
And this is unchanged and advanced methods of solving the cube across will be exactly the same.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,230
I'll teach you how to improve your cross and form it faster.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,700
This is what the cross looks like.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,380
We have four edges on a white center and the white side is a cross.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,040
And notice how each of these edges matches up with this corresponding center.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,470
Let me show you a really easy way that this can be done or how most people do it, which is the flower

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,170
method will get like a white edge right here.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,310
Move that up to the top and then do that for everybody.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,590
So this green one, I move that up to the top with the yellow center.

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,910
I see this white one right here, right orange.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,080
I move that down.

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,750
And then finally, this white, red one.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,170
So now I have this little flower pattern right here.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,390
All the white edges on the yellow center.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,630
We take one edge, like I say, this white, red one.

17
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,430
We twist the top so that now it's right next to its center and then we flip it down.

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,690
That solves this one.

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,610
And we can do that for every edge.

20
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,350
And looks like they're all solved somehow.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,240
So I just moved every single side down.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,060
And that's all across.
