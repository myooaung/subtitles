00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.120
OK, so there are two types of OLOW, which I call Isiolo and Advanced Okello, so Isiolo requires two

2
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.880
algorithms for most cases, while advanced algorithms solve the yellowface in one algorithm.

3
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.630
However, advanced also requires memorization of 57 possible overwell cases.

4
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.330
So basically, you'll memorize every single permutation that the yellow side can come in and know how

5
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.960
to solve.

6
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.210
No one algorithm to solve the yellowface from here.

7
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.840
So, for example, in this case, if you knew advanced, well, then you could do one algorithm with

8
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.150
this crazy case right here and it would solve it.

9
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.390
But of course, you need to memorize fifty seven algorithms.

10
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.580
So that's pretty advanced.

11
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.430
It can be timesaving, but it's easier to do two steps and memorize only seven algorithms.

12
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.920
So we're going to solve the Yellow Cross and then solve the yellow top.

13
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.780
But instead of solving the Yellow Cross with the best case, I'm going to show you how to solve every

14
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.330
Yellow Cross case, which is seven different cases.

15
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.360
So you'll need to memorize seven, seven different algorithms, because if you just do a this over and

16
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.280
over, it's really time wasting.

17
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.000
So, again, we're going to go back to our bathtub.

18
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.310
We have no bar over here.

19
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.290
So just do it from.

20
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.420
I'm going to do it from this side.

21
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.050
Just that I know.

22
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.710
I'll get a bar.

23
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.490
So f sexy move.

24
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.090
Are you are prime you prime F prime.

25
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.260
There's our bar.

26
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.220
Do it again.

27
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.300
F are you are you prime F prime?

28
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.620
And there's our cross.

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.040
So now I'm going to teach you the seven algorithms after you get across and which you can get the solid

30
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.810
yellow side for every cross case.

31
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.660
So the first one is the Suen, this one you should already know corners in the bottom left, one yellow

32
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.680
side facing you.

33
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.120
This one's really easy.

34
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.660
Are you our prime?

35
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.160
You are new to our prime.

36
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.540
That's all that.

37
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.020
Here we have the Mary case.

38
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.710
We have the soon, but we could see that the corners not facing me.

39
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.560
So if I just do a new prime move, then now we have the exact same thing, but on the left side.

40
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.930
So one thing is facing me, one corner facing me, and this is facing upwards.

41
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.990
So what is do the exact same algorithm, but with my left hand.

42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.650
So the algorithm is our prime you prime l u l prime you to.

43
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.990
L.

44
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.110
So if we have a crisis like this, but we have no corners facing upwards, and there's two different

45
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.260
types of this, there's one with two headlights and one with one headlight.

46
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.750
So this is a case with two headlights.

47
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.430
We have one pair of headlights facing backwards, one ferencz facing us.

48
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.420
So we put headlights facing you so it could be on this side or this side.

49
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.540
The algorithm is our YouTube, our prime.

50
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.890
You prime our you our prime, you prime.

51
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.770
Are you prime our prime.

52
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.950
Here's the other case we have across again, no corners facing upwards.

53
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.140
Here's one pair of headlights, but you can see in the back, instead of having headlights facing outwards,

54
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.260
these two corners are flipped and places facing sideways.

55
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.580
So with this case, we want to put the headlights on the left side.

56
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.060
So right here and then this one corner should be facing you.

57
00:03:46.510 --> 00:04:02.040
And our algorithm is our YouTube are to upload our to you prime are to you to our.

58
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.590
So one thing you'll notice is that a lot of these algorithms are just the same algorithm, but backwards

59
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.970
or with some moves in the middle.

60
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.970
So, for example, the the next algorithm is going to be the same as doing the fish case by with two

61
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.110
sexy moves in the middle.

62
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.650
So here's our other case, this is the only case where we have diagonal corners.

63
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.230
These corners are facing out this way.

64
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.410
So we have one to the left, one going to the back.

65
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.080
If we have a case like this, like I said, it's just the sewer algorithm, but with two sexy moves

66
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.530
in the middle.

67
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.380
So it's our YOUTU.

68
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.870
Our prime, you prime.

69
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.380
Are you our prime you plan.

70
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.330
Are you are probably.

71
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.540
You prime are you are prime.

72
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.230
So here's another case, this is one of two adjacent corner cases.

73
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.780
This is one of my favorites because it's nice to perform.

74
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.110
So we have our cross here and two quarters or upwards, and they're forming a bar on the right side.

75
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.520
So they're both next to each other.

76
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.670
But then we have to make sure that there's no headlights over here.

77
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.260
So there are two different cases.

78
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.850
There's this one where the corners are facing outwards and there's one where those headlights over here.

79
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.670
So in this case, the corners are facing outwards.

80
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.590
So one corners would be facing you.

81
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:35.460
And an algorithm is little are you are prime, you prime little are prime at our F prime.

82
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.360
So this algorithm is basically just a sexy move and a sledgehammer.

83
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.330
But with the middle layer included in the first moves.

84
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.870
So now we have our other case again, we have a bar on this side across two corners upwards.

85
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.130
But instead of a corner facing me this time, I have had headlights on this side.

86
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.250
So the algorithm for this one is, are you our prime Ukraine?

87
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.660
Are you prime our prime U2?

88
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.570
Are you prime our prime?

89
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.790
You two are.

90
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.290
You are our prime, you prime.

91
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.330
So that algorithm was just an algorithm where it starts and ends with a sexy move.

92
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.340
But we have a repetition of four moves in the middle of it helps you remember it.

93
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.520
Just do a sexy move at the start of the end start and the end.

94
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.270
And then our new prime, our prime Yuto, twice in the middle.

95
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.360
So those are all the seven algorithms you need to know.

96
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.940
Make sure you can solve the cross immediately.

97
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.670
And look at the corners, identify the case and perform the proper algorithm in order to solve the yellow

98
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.010
top immediately after solving the Yellow Cross.

99
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.470
If you practice this enough, you should be able to solve the yellow side after finishing up to well,

100
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.970
in two to ten seconds.

101
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.490
Don't worry if you can't get in this time range by recognizing the case and performing algorithms as

102
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.750
efficiently as possible when we lead to solving OLOW in three seconds.

103
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.530
Keep in mind, this is easy and take slightly longer.

104
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.440
Also, you just learned how to solve seven of the fifty seven possible Augello cases in one algorithm.
