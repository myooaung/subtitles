1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,920
So the first method after the Yellow Cross is the easier one.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,390
But it's really useless.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,720
And you don't use a you barely use any of the algorithms from it.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,440
So I'm going to show you what it is, but I'm not going to teach you the algorithms because they are

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,310
not necessary.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,770
So at this step, we take our Yellow Cross and we want to get these edges matching their centers, just

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,000
like how we did for the White Cross.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,510
So we solve them.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,560
Now, all of them are lined up and all these ideas are now solved.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,210
And then what we do is we look for a corner that's in its right spot, but not oriented correctly.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,870
So red, green and yellow, you can see that's between yellow, red and green.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,120
So this is in the right spot.

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,640
All we have to do is flip it this way and it'll be solved.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,530
So if we can do that for every corner, then we'll be able to orient all the corners at the same time.

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,460
So we just use an algorithm to position all the corners in the right place.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,450
The orange blue is not solved yet because it's between blue and red.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,420
Now it is so easy, red, blue with red, blue, red, green, green, orange and blue, orange.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,240
So these all can just be flipped upwards and they'll sell the cube.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,850
That's exactly what we're going to do.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,600
Using the same algorithm from earlier.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,810
Our prime de prime already sold this one and then move another quarter into the slot.

22
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,710
And then once we move that back, I saw the cue.
