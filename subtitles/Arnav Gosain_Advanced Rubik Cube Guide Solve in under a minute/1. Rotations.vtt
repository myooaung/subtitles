00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.580
So now let's talk about improving time and efficiency.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.410
And first, we're going to start with rotation's.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.960
So a rotation is when you leave the culture center, you're facing like the red face and look at a different

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.380
center.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.220
You don't do any moves, but you flip the cube to look at a different side.

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.200
One important part of having a good, solid time is how you're able to perform moves with your hands.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.510
And the default position, both your hands will be on the cube and milliseconds away from performing

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.870
a turn.

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.720
However, if you do a rotation, your fingers leave the cube and have to reposition themselves to do

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.080
moves.

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.670
This takes a lot of time and aren't that useful, considering there are better ways to look around the

12
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.000
cube.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
The ideal solve involves zero rotations, which means you're facing the same colored center throughout

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.850
the whole solve.

15
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.490
Obviously, doing Whitecross, it would be really hard to do Seaforth while facing yellow or white.

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.660
So red, blue, orange or green are the best sites to look at.

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.240
This is the ideal case, and it's pretty unrealistic to never do any rotations during assault.

18
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.250
I myself tend to do two to five rotations, not to look around, but to position myself in a way that

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I can do a certain move easily, like incertain F2 Alpari using only Ahran.

20
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.870
You begin off and rotate the cube pointlessly several times during a solve like 10 times.

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.200
And this is really inefficient and cause a lot of seconds to be added instead of rotating the cube slightly

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.160
took the cube up.

23
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.440
So you can see the side you want to look at.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.240
So if I'm looking at the green side and I want to see what the back side looks like or the blue side,

25
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.910
then while I'm holding the cube like this during myself, I can simply move a little bit up and see

26
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.540
the blue side.

27
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.170
And that completely eliminates the point of the rotation.

28
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.150
So tilting is so much better because you don't have to move your hands at all and just spend a tiny

29
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.140
bit of time looking instead of a lot of time fully repositioning your hands.

30
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.100
So here are some examples of why I wrote it and when not to rotate, the first one is rotation's during

31
00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.760
algorithms.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.970
Because some algorithms have rotations built into them.

33
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.010
There's not really much you can do here.

34
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.210
You just rotate the cube.

35
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.310
There's no good way to eliminate these types of rotations because they help you perform this easier.

36
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.950
If you learn algorithm with the rotations as rotate the cube as a few rotations per solve is OK.

37
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.010
So, for example, this is a pillowcase.

38
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.280
We have headlights here and a bar back here.

39
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.230
And the algorithm for this case actually has a rotation in it, and there's really no better way to

40
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.560
do it.

41
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.280
So I'll just do the algorithm.

42
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.890
You can see that there's a rotation in it.

43
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.850
So all I did was I did something on this side and then I rotated to the side and I solved the algorithm

44
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.840
just so that I could use Ranu moves and make it much easier for my hands.

45
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.240
The next one is rotation's during F two L.

46
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.820
So since you have to look all around the cube for F2 L rotating the cube to find a piece and easily

47
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.610
insert, it is another time when it's OK to rotate.

48
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.390
If there's a corner as stuck in the back, that cannot be solved using r u r l moves, then rotation

49
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.250
to the left or right or common so that the backside becomes the right side, meaning the piece can easily

50
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.330
be seen and solved.

51
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.640
So for example, if I have a F tool case like this, I have my red and blue here.

52
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.960
They need to be paired up this way and need to go into this lot.

53
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.630
However, the state of mind is the orange side, and there is no way to insert this.

54
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.900
I cannot move this down.

55
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.070
The only way is to flip to a side and then insert it.

56
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.670
So from this position, what I always do and basically the only thing you can do is flip to the side

57
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.230
just so that you can insert the pair.

58
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.700
And you go from here.

59
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.090
So the next reason is last layer.

60
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.080
And lastly, rotations are basically forbidden, except during algorithm's.

61
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.850
So if you have the bottom two layer solid and rotating, just to see three stickers in the back of the

62
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.990
cube is not worth it.

63
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.780
If you have to see that that piece is during last layer, just do what we did earlier, which is just

64
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.080
slightly tilt the cube up.

65
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.360
Now, I can see I have three green right here, and now I know exactly which algorithm to do.

66
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.210
And I'll be able to solve the cube because I've identified the case.

67
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.080
So another way to do it is to just move the you face.

68
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.300
So if I'm in this position and I want to know what's back here, if I just do a new prime, then now

69
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.950
I can see these three stickers on the side.

70
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.570
And I also know what case I have.

71
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.610
So the final one of where not to rotate is the cross.

72
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.490
Just don't rotate the queue during the cross.

73
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.670
There's no prerent algorithms, so there's no exceptions to the rule.

74
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.100
The cross should always be solved using a new Taner 10 move or less algorithm that you create during

75
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.700
inspection.

76
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.130
So if you forget where a piece is or need to see it edge, just tilt the cube or rotate the you face,

77
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.490
then just form the cross without rotating, which means using all kind of move like Newt like you are.

78
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.310
B, L or D.
