1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,270
So now we're going to deal with these buttons here.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,960
So I'm going to just get rid of this a tag here with the hover.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,410
I just wanted to give you an example of that, how to use pseudo selectors within your nested elements

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,970
or nested styles.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,730
Now these buttons are going to share a lot.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,670
So they're going to share like the padding and the border and cursor pointer, all that stuff.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,060
What we were doing before is we'd have a BTN class with all that stuff and then also a BTN dark BTN

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,880
light that have to do with the colour.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,260
So instead of doing that, I'm going to create a style, a set of styles to be extended.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:48,420
So to do that we use a percent sign and we're just going to do BTN Dash Shared All right.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,660
And then all the core styles that we want to share, I'm going to put in here like display inline block

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:04,200
oops let's do padding say 0.7 REM to REM.

14
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,650
Let's do what else?

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,060
Let's do a border.

16
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,010
None.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,700
Pointer should be a cursor.

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:18,890
Whoops.

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,940
I spell that wrong.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,790
Pointer cursor.

21
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,500
I don't know why it's not popping up.

22
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,200
Oh, I did it backwards.

23
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,690
It should be cursor pointer, brain fart.

24
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,090
Let's do text decoration none.

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,130
And let's just do a margin top one ram.

26
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:54,000
All right, now the styling here I want to use for both buttons, light dock.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,970
And if we had other ones, I, I would want to use it as well.

28
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,910
So I'm going to go down here and let's do BTN.

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,040
Now we don't have a BTN class, we just have BTN light and dark.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,460
However, I'm going to use this type of of nesting, I'm going to say ampersand light.

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,490
So this will pertain to any BTN light and I want to extend the button shared.

32
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:27,030
So to do that we use ampersand extend and then we want to put in here percent BTN shared like that.

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:27,960
All right.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,550
And then I'm going to go right below it and do the same thing for dark.

35
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:42,650
So we want to extend and we want BTN shared.

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,420
All right, so I'm going to save this and it gets all of that, all these properties.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,360
So the padding border, none.

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,530
Cursor, all that stuff.

39
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,480
What we want to change between these is the color, the background color, as well as the text color.

40
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:06,650
So I'm going to add background color for the light is going to be our variable of light color.

41
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:15,520
And then for the text or the color I'm just going to put in, let's do three, three, three.

42
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,430
So we want a dark text and then down here let's do

43
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,240
background.

44
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,780
Color and we'll set that to dark color.

45
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:36,910
And for color we'll say F, F, F, and I'm not using variables here because I'm going to show you in

46
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,350
the next section, when we deal with functions, we're going to have a function that automatically sets

47
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,810
the text color based on the background color.

48
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,430
So let's save that.

49
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,030
And there we go.

50
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,850
So now you can see we have the different colors.

51
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:56,590
Now, again, if you don't like this syntax here, you could of course instead just do like BTN dash

52
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:03,850
light and then you could just take this and put it in here and then you could do down here.

53
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,600
BTN Doc So I mean it's up to you what parts of SAS you want you want to use.

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,150
I like this because it's all encapsulated.

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,160
However, if you don't like the look of this ampersand or whatever, you can just do it like this and

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,440
you can still extend the button shared.

57
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,670
All right.

58
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,130
So hopefully that makes sense.

59
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,870
So in the next video I'm going to show you, I'm going to look at functions, mix ins, which are similar

60
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,710
to functions as well as conditionals and color functions.

61
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:41,740
And the reason I'm doing all that in one video is because we're going to create probably the most helpful

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:51,220
SAS function in my experience, which is one that will look at the background color of an element and

63
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,300
depending on the the brightness of it or the lightness or darkness, it'll set the text color automatically.

64
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,570
So if it's dark, it'll be a light text.

65
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,580
If it's light, it'll be dark text.

66
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,630
So we're going to create that function and do some other stuff as well.

67
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:07,930
All right.

68
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,310
So I'll see you in the next video.
