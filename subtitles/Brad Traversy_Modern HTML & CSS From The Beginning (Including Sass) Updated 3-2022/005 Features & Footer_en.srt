1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,730
So now we're going to jump back into our HTML and we're going to add the three boxes when what?

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,770
I mean is this right here, this location, meals and fitness room, these features.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,340
So I'm going to give this a section with the idea of features and then each one is going to be a div

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,750
and I'm going to give it a class of box and we're going to style that book, those boxes.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,550
So let's go down below our last section, which was the home info.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,210
And again, if you watch me build websites and themes, this is like I said, I usually have a header

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,520
and then I'll build on each section.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,190
And if you if you take my bootstrap bootstrap course on Udemy, I do the same exact thing.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,600
It doesn't matter if I'm using a framework or if I'm using just HTML five.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,950
So let's do section and let's give this an ID of features.

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,380
And within this feature section we're going to have three boxes.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:06,850
So I'm actually going to do let's do dot box and let's use our metric of doing Asterisk three, enter

14
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,290
our tab and it will give us three divs with the class of box.

15
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,810
So inside here we're going to have the icon.

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm going to get to that after.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:23,490
So let's just skip the icon for now and let's do an H three and let's say great location.

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,370
And then we're going to have a paragraph which is going to have, I believe, ten words, let's do lorem

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,590
ten like that.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,330
And then we want the same thing inside these two boxes.

21
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,730
So we'll paste that in there and there, and let's just change the heading for the second one to free

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,840
meals.

23
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,110
And then the third one is going to be fitness room.

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,770
So just a list of what the amenities, the features and we'll save that.

25
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,570
Let's go down.

26
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,790
So it's going to look like this by default.

27
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,950
Now, before we get to the CSS, let's add the icons.

28
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,100
Now, these icons come from font.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,669
Awesome.

30
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,110
So if we go to font awesome, font awesome.

31
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:23,530
Com and go to start using free, it's going to give us a link tag that goes to this all CSS stylesheet

32
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,540
which allows us to use those fonts.

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,940
So we just want to double click this and copy it.

34
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,000
So we're going to control C and then let's paste it up top here above our link.

35
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,850
So Control V will paste that in.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,480
And now since we have this included, we can use certain classes that will give us certain icons.

37
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,110
Now the font awesome website allows us to search for icons.

38
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:53,560
So building I actually want to search for a hotel and it's going to give us some results.

39
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,260
Now there is a pro version to font.

40
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:56,680
Awesome.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,900
I believe it's like $50 a year.

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm not sure I don't have the pro subscription, but usually the first one you see how those three hotels,

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,140
three h squares, usually the first one is is free.

44
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,950
And then these ones, as you can see, have the little pro icon.

45
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,550
So we want this first one, this first hotel.

46
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,690
I'm going to click on it.

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,970
And what we want to look at here, it shows us the icon, different sizes and stuff.

48
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,530
But what we want to look at is this tag, this eye tag with this class.

49
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,600
And you're going to have two classes.

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,240
You're going to have one that's just the font awesome class.

51
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,350
And then you have one that is the actual what the icon is.

52
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,970
In this case, it's the hotel.

53
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,090
So we can actually just click it and it copies it for us and then we can go back into our HTML.

54
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,510
Let's go right above this h three and paste that in.

55
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,750
Let's bring that over and we'll save it.

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,360
And let's go back to our page here and notice now we have a little hotel icon.

57
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,310
Now.

58
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,600
This is too small.

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,780
We could change the font size.

60
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,220
After all, it is a font, but there's actually classes that we can use to change the size.

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:15,370
So if we add in a class here of a-3x, so you have two X to 3 to 5 x, I believe, and it will change.

62
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,380
It'll basically be three times as big.

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,390
So let's save it and go back.

64
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,120
And now we have a much bigger icon.

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,260
So the other icons we want, I'm just going to copy this, I tag here and we're going to paste one in

66
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,610
right above free meals.

67
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,910
This one is called F a utensils.

68
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,820
So if we went and searched for whatever food.

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,480
It'll show us the utensils icon.

70
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,650
And then this one here is a dumbbell.

71
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,330
Let's save that and take a look.

72
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,370
And now we have our three icons.

73
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,760
So that's it for the HTML for this part.

74
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,810
Now let's style it.

75
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,910
So we're going to go to style CSS.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,340
And let's go down to the bottom here.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:14,890
So we want to do our features section, which is basically just the block.

78
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,000
Or we could do a.

79
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:17,900
Hmm.

80
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,550
I'm trying to think if we are going to if we're going to use these boxes anywhere else.

81
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,990
I don't think so.

82
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,060
I mean, you could use the box as a utility class if you were going to use them.

83
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,570
Actually, yeah.

84
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,840
Let's just do a dot box in case we use them somewhere else.

85
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,310
So each box we're going to float left.

86
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,470
Even though they're all going to be in a row, it's not like a left in a right.

87
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,410
We want we want them all to float left, just like we do with the menu items, with the list items.

88
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,370
It'll make them go horizontal.

89
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,800
And then the width we're going to set to 33.3%

90
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,210
because we want them to be we want them to all be even.

91
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,440
And there's three of them.

92
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,250
And then for padding, let's do 50 pixels.

93
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:17,920
And since we have border box up here as a value for box sizing, since we put that there, this padding

94
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,570
will not get added to the width.

95
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,910
If you don't put the border box, then it's going to get added and it's not going to look right.

96
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,980
And then the last thing is I just want to align everything to the center.

97
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:38,380
So text align center and let's save that and take a look.

98
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:38,680
Good.

99
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,620
So now everything is aligned horizontally.

100
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,830
I do want to add a margin bottom to the actual tag to the icon.

101
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:57,910
So let's say dot box I and let's say margin dash bottom ten pixels.

102
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,240
Now for the background.

103
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,960
Now remember we have those utility classes, the BG classes.

104
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:14,200
So instead of coloring, adding box or whatever, we're going to grab on to those classes and put them

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,310
in our HTML.

106
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,920
So this first div with the class of box, I wanted to have a light background, so I'm going to add

107
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,760
BG Light and we've already added the style for these.

108
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,790
The second one is going to be BG Dash.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,070
Uh, primary, because we want it to be that ten color.

110
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,550
And then the last one again is BG Dash Light.

111
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,650
And save.

112
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,300
Uh.

113
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,060
Okay, so it looks like I made a mistake earlier.

114
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,150
I think I put the the color as tan here for BG Primary, where it should be on the background, not

115
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,930
the color.

116
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,430
So let's head back up to BG Primary.

117
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,270
And where is it?

118
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,070
Yeah, right here.

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,070
BG Primary.

120
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,980
So the background should be this, not that.

121
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,040
And then.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Let's see the color.

123
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,460
Should be that I believe.

124
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,200
Or is the color white?

125
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,340
Let me check.

126
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,900
No, that's right.

127
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,920
But let's just move back around to the top like that.

128
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,730
All right.

129
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,900
So let's save.

130
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,560
And now the background is the color, not the actual text.

131
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,480
So that looks pretty good.

132
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,190
Now we want to do the footer.

133
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,400
So let's head back to our HTML and remember we have a semantic HTML, five footer tag.

134
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,850
So right under the section, let's do footer.

135
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,310
And I'm actually going to give it an ID of main footer.

136
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,720
And the reason for for this is because you may have you can have footers.

137
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,560
In other, it doesn't have to mean a website footer like a page footer.

138
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,930
It could be a footer to, let's say, an article.

139
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,700
Maybe you have articles where you have a head, a header, and then you have a footer at the bottom

140
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,100
with maybe the author's name and stuff like that.

141
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,110
So you don't always have to think of headers and footers as page headers and footers.

142
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,700
So let's put a paragraph in here and let's just say hotel.

143
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,130
BTW let's do our copyright entity.

144
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,090
So ampersand.

145
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,920
Copy semicolon.

146
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,680
We'll do 2019.

147
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,150
All rights reserved.

148
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,580
Let's save that.

149
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,760
So by default, it's going to look like this.

150
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,750
We need to add a little bit of styling.

151
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,070
So go back to our style sheet and let's grab on to the main footer.

152
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,310
Let's put a comment in here and we'll say main dash footer.

153
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,740
And first of all, I want to align everything to the center.

154
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,940
Okay.

155
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,090
We're going to add a background actually note.

156
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,120
What we'll do is we'll use the BG doc on the footer.

157
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,160
Wait a minute.

158
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,770
No, we're not going to do that because we want it to be a little lighter than the BG Docs.

159
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,720
So we actually will add a background.

160
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,470
Let's do four for four, which is a shade lighter.

161
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,270
So let's make the color white and let's add padding all around 20 pixels.

162
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,930
Save that.

163
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,940
Check it out.

164
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,730
Okay.

165
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,490
Let's see.

166
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,530
Why isn't there?

167
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,800
Padding.

168
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,220
Oh, you know what it is?

169
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:53,420
We since these three four have been floated, we need to actually clear that float.

170
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,550
So let's go up to where our utility classes are.

171
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:05,220
We'll go under the last background here and do class and let's say float.

172
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,690
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:13,220
Not float clear both and then go back to our HTML and right above the footer.

174
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,780
Let's put in a class of class and save.

175
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,850
And now you can see that it's pushed down.

176
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,940
And that's again, that's another thing that just really sucks about using floats over CSS grid or Flexbox

177
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,650
is is this clearing stuff?

178
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,030
That's why I forget.

179
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,140
All right.

180
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,480
So our homepage looks done.

181
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,120
And again, it's not completely responsive.

182
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,220
I mean, it's somewhat responsive as far as having the max width, like the text doesn't go out of the

183
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,600
page or anything like that.

184
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,640
But there are some things I would add and I would add some media queries which we're going to talk about

185
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,540
later on.

186
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,530
But for now, I think that our home page is pretty good.

187
00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:00,380
So in the next video, we're going to move on to the about page, which isn't too bad.

188
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:05,240
We're just going to have some text rounded image, some testimonials.

189
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,490
Then we'll move on to the contact page and we should be all set and then I'll show you how we can actually

190
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,680
deploy this website to the Internet.
