00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.630
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.790
So I decided to add on a little bonus here.

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.270
I want to actually make the contact form on our website work now that we're actually deployed and our

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.540
shared host has PHP installed, which is a programming language so we can execute PHP files.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.410
And PHP has a very simple mail function that we can use to actually make this, this form work.

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.500
So what I'm going to do is have it submit to my Brad at edge ledger dot net email which you can see

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.030
my inbox right here now in the lecture files for this section or this lecture, I should say you're

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.700
going to have a zip file called contact and inside that you're going to have to files.

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.680
And I have that right here.

10
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.790
So you're going to have processed PHP and successfully HTML.

11
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.470
So we're just going to move those two files to our project, to our website locally, and I'm going

12
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.980
to go back into VS code with those two added files.

13
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.890
And in our index file we have our form which doesn't have any attributes.

14
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.270
So in order for the form to submit, we want to put an action and we want it to submit to process dot

15
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.190
PHP, it's going to submit to that PHP file.

16
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.470
And then we also want to add a method.

17
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.830
There's different types of HTTP methods.

18
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.860
We have a get request which is basically just when the page loads, it's a get request, but when you

19
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.430
submit a form, you want to make a post request to the server.

20
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.240
So we want to do method post and we'll save that.

21
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.330
And what that's going to do is it's going to submit to this process PHP file, which is a very, very

22
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.260
simple script.

23
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.000
I actually got it from the In Motion hosting documentation.

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.550
It's, it's very, very simple.

25
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.920
You probably want to add more validation and so on if you are going to if this is a production site.

26
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.540
But I just want to make it work.

27
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.310
So I'm just going to go through it.

28
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.280
And I know a lot of you probably don't know PHP, but it's just checking to see if the email field is

29
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.200
filled in this post.

30
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.400
Email pertains to our form input right here because the name is email.

31
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.180
All right.

32
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.670
So this is actually called a super global and it's looking for the name attribute of email.

33
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.200
So if that's filled in, it's going to proceed and it's going to create some variables.

34
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.470
This variable is the email that we want to submit to.

35
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.500
So you would change this to yours, and then we have the rest of these variables just pointing to whatever

36
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.660
text is filled in the form fields.

37
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.570
So for the name, email, phone and message, those will get put into variables which are like placeholders.

38
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.890
Then we're going to run a function called mail, which is a PHP function.

39
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.770
The first parameter is the email that it's going to send to, which is our admin email here.

40
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.210
And then the second is the subject of the email, which will be new form submission.

41
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.920
Of course you can change it if you want, and then the body is going to be the message and the phone

42
00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.430
number.

43
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.070
That's what's going to be in the actual email body and then from is going to be whatever the user puts

44
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.210
in as their email.

45
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.580
And then once all that happens, once it sends, we're going to redirect using the header function.

46
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.550
So this will redirect us to a file called successor HTML, which I have right here.

47
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.670
So if we look at success in HTML, it's very simple.

48
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.780
We just have the nav bar minus the links and the footer.

49
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.680
And then here we just have a thank you message so I can show you this real quick.

50
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.570
If I just open with live server, actually, it opened on the wrong screen.

51
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.230
Hold on.

52
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.640
You just bring it over real quick.

53
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.510
All right.

54
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.980
So this is what it's going to look like.

55
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.060
Once you submit the form, it's just going to say thank you and then you can choose to go back to the

56
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.720
site.

57
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.590
So that's pretty much it.

58
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.440
Now, there's one other thing we need to change, and it's actually in our JavaScript file, the main

59
00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:02.250
JS Now right here we were grabbing on to a click event for the nav bar, links for the smooth scrolling

60
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.470
as well as the class of button.

61
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:12.450
Now the class of button is also on the submit button here and inside the JavaScript.

62
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.810
What we're saying is, is to prevent the default behavior of the form or the button, I should say.

63
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.920
And since we have that class on our form button, it won't submit correctly.

64
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.970
So what I'm going to do is just get rid of the dot, BTN and the comma.

65
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.860
That way the smooth scrolling is only on the nav bar in the form should be able to submit.

66
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.420
So let's save that.

67
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.000
And now our website should be all set.

68
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We just want to open up file zilla, go ahead and log in and we're just going to basically replace the

69
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.290
files that are there.

70
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.810
So I'm going to drag all of these over.

71
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.000
If it asks to overwrite, just say yes and now it should work.

72
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.550
So let's head over to Edge Ledger, dot net or whatever your whatever website you're using if you're

73
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.660
following along.

74
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.740
And I'm going to just reload and then fill this out real quick.

75
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.090
So I'll say John Doe email, let's do John Doe at Gmail.

76
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.940
I'll put a number here.

77
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.400
Just all fives and then a message.

78
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.380
We'll just say Hello world.

79
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.660
All right, so now I'm going to click Send.

80
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.890
Now what happened is it's submitted to the processed PHP file.

81
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:31.420
It ran that called the mail function so it should have sent and then redirected us to success dot html

82
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.250
and we can go back if we want.

83
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.060
Now I'm going to go to my inbox and I'm going to reload.

84
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.980
And we have an email from John at gmail.com and you can see the subject is new form submission because

85
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:52.180
that's what we put in the process PHP file and the body here is whatever we put in the message field

86
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.340
and whatever we put in the phone field.

87
00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:01.870
So we now have a working contact form and I know that PHP is not part of this course, but I wanted

88
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.970
to at least have this be a full website where the form actually worked.

89
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.290
So hopefully you guys can appreciate that and that's it.

90
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.790
I'll see you in the next section.
