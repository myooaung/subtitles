00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.870
So in this video, I just want to go over a couple of small things that I missed that I feel are important

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.130
for you guys to know.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.460
So this is kind of just an aside and I just have a file called index.html and I'm going to just generate

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:25.020
my boilerplate here and let's just say test file and we'll put in our style tags and then in the body,

6
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm just going to have an H one and I'm just going to say hello world and a paragraph underneath with

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.790
let's say 15 words, and we'll go ahead and open this.

8
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.440
And the first thing I want to talk about is visibility.

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.580
So we looked at the display property where we could display block, display, inline, inline, block.

10
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.850
Later on, we're going to look at display flex display grid.

11
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.870
There's also something called Display None, which will just remove the element from the browser completely.

12
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.350
So I'm going to take the H one and I'm going to set display to none and save and notice it completely

13
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.040
goes away.

14
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.370
So this can be very useful, especially when it comes to building responsive websites and responsive

15
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.950
applications, because sometimes you might want something not to show on mobile screens.

16
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.720
So this comes in handy.

17
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.630
Now there's also a property called visibility, so we can set visibility to hidden and I'm going to

18
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.560
save that notice.

19
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.430
It goes away.

20
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.250
But the big difference here is that it still takes up the space displaying none.

21
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
We'll just completely remove it from what's called the document object model.

22
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.670
Visibility just basically makes it disappear or makes it invisible.

23
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.250
It's still there in terms of the space.

24
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.620
So that's the big difference between these two.

25
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.780
You're going to find yourself using this much, much more than this, but it's still important to know

26
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.860
that that's available.

27
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.160
All right.

28
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.360
So the next thing I want to look at is the order of precedence and also the important flag.

29
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.310
So basically, if I take this H one here and I give it a color of blue, I save that.

30
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.750
Obviously it's going to turn blue.

31
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:29.460
But if I give this a class of let's just say hello and up here I say Dot hello and give that a color

32
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.570
of red and save it turns red.

33
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.570
So normally the further down the style is that that's what's going to take precedence.

34
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:47.250
However, targeting a class is going to override targeting the actual element.

35
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.540
And if I take this class of hello and I move it above the H one, you might think that well now it's

36
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.250
going to be fixed.

37
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.930
This you might think now it's going to be blue because this is further down.

38
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.120
However, if I save, it's still red.

39
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.810
And the reason for that is, is having a specific class and targeting that it's going to override just

40
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.550
the H one itself.

41
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.450
All right.

42
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.640
Now, I just want to put this back how I had it like that.

43
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.110
And if you come to a situation where and this might happen, if you're dealing with other style sheets,

44
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.900
maybe you're using some kind of CSS framework and you're bringing in external style sheets as well,

45
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.130
and you want your style to override another style.

46
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.990
You can use the important flag.

47
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.310
So right here where we said color blue, I'm just going to add on to the end of this.

48
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.630
I'm going to add an exclamation and then the word important.

49
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.500
Now, if I save this, you can see now it's blue because this this important flag is going to say,

50
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.540
it doesn't matter if there's a class of hello or anything else and nothing else matters.

51
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.160
This should take precedence.

52
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.450
And the only way that that this is going to work is if I also put important on this, which is stupid

53
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.450
and defeats the purpose, but just to show you that it works, we'll go ahead and save that and that

54
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.290
will be red.

55
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.459
All right.

56
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.959
But I'm going to get rid of that.

57
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.400
I do want to keep that, though, just so you guys have it for reference.

58
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.510
All right.

59
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.040
And then the last thing I want to mention for now, and if I remember anything else that I forgot,

60
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.030
I'll come back to this this this video and edit it.

61
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.460
But is is negative margin values.

62
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.510
We went over margin.

63
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.300
We went we went over padding, but we didn't go over negative margin values, which you really should

64
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.190
try to avoid if you can.

65
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.960
But it is possible.

66
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.530
So of course we can take this h one actually.

67
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.270
Let's work in the class down here.

68
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:59.700
We'll say margin dashed top and we say 30 pixels and save and it gets pushed down 30 pixels.

69
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.880
But at the same time we can also do -30 pixels and that will just bring it upwards and you can do the

70
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:15.610
same thing like let's do margin, let's do left -30 pixels.

71
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.310
And what it should do is pull it this way, save and there it goes that way.

72
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.680
All right.

73
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.230
So you can have negative values with margins.

74
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.940
However, you can't do it with padding.

75
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:33.790
If I do it with padding and save, that's not going to work because remember, padding is inside the

76
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.570
border.

77
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.830
All right.

78
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.830
So those are the main things that I wanted to mention.

79
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.060
So we'll move on and let's start our hotel website project.
