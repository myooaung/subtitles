00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.720
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.580
So now we're going to jump into media queries and I'm actually going to do this in our CSS sandbox.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.010
So I'm going to add a file here called one 313 because we left off at 12 media underscore queries,

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.390
HTML, and we're going to put our boilerplate in with Emmet.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.500
So exclamation enter or tab, let's add our title.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.000
And for the body.

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.100
This isn't going to be a very practical use of media queries.

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.570
We're going to do that later on in all our projects.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.850
This is more to get you familiar with how they work and the syntax.

10
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.230
So I'm going to have a few divs here.

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.910
So actually we don't even need that.

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.130
Let's do an ID, a div with an idea of wide screen and inside here I'm going to put an H one and then

13
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.770
I'm just going to put the text wide screen and the names of these, these IDs, they have nothing to

14
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.880
do with media queries.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.210
It's just what I'm choosing to use because I want to give you an example of each screen size and how

16
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.640
we can add separate styles for them.

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.380
So let's clear this out.

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.640
And this one is going to be normal, a normal size, computer size, whatever you want to call it.

19
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.310
This one is going to be tablet

20
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.550
and this one is going to be smartphone.

21
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.050
And this one we're going to do landscape.

22
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.480
We can do media queries for both width and height.

23
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.890
So let's save this and let's open this up with a live server.

24
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.720
So that's what it's going to look like.

25
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.600
Now we're going to put all of our CSS up in the head area just for convenience.

26
00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.430
Usually it would be on in a separate CSS file and I'm going to add some core styles for the body.

27
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.980
So let's just add a better font family.

28
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.550
We'll do aerial and let's do a background of gray.

29
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.520
I'm just going to use color names just for convenience, because what I want to happen is I want to

30
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.660
have a different background color for each device or each of these divs here.

31
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.360
So let's see what else.

32
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.010
Let's align to the center

33
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.990
and let's do a padding top of 100 pixels.

34
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.040
All right.

35
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.240
So we'll save that.

36
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.800
It's going to look like this.

37
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.240
Now, as far as testing your your media queries and breakpoints, you can resize the browser.

38
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.260
That'll work.

39
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.590
It'll update in real time another way to do it and a way that you should definitely do it.

40
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.130
Even if you test to begin with with the browser, you should always check them out with the chrome tools.

41
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.100
So I'm going to open up my chrome tools and hit this icon here.

42
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.160
This is the device toolbar and this actually allows you to test your web page on different devices.

43
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.200
As you can see, the iPhone X, we have iPhone six, seven, eight plus six, seven, eight.

44
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.140
Even the five which you can see is much smaller.

45
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.710
Pixel two XL Pixel two galaxy.

46
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.570
And then we also have the iPad.

47
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.010
So you can test for tablets.

48
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.540
We have the iPad Pro, which is basically the same width as as a laptop would be.

49
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.660
But we do we can test with that as well.

50
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.500
So I usually test mostly with the iPhone six, seven, eight and the iPhone X.

51
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.400
But yeah, this is you're going to see some things here that you won't notice if you just use the browser

52
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.550
because of the height in the browser, you have a much bigger height than you do on actual smartphones.

53
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.580
So you don't get a real look at what it looks like on a smartphone.

54
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.780
But I'm going to close this for now by clicking the icon again, and we're going to go back in here

55
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.330
and inside my my CSS.

56
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.630
Usually this would be in a separate file, but I can do it here as well.

57
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.940
I'm going to add my first media query.

58
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.290
So we do this by doing at media some parentheses.

59
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.690
And then inside here we can put a max width or a min width or a max height or a min height.

60
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.130
But I'm going to do max width and I'm going to set it to 500 pixels and then we open up some curly braces.

61
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.030
Now, another thing I want to show you here in the device is it shows you the width and the height.

62
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.830
So an iPhone X has a width of 375 pixels, 411, Galaxy is 360.

63
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.780
Notice that they're all under 500.

64
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.290
So that's usually what I use for smartphones.

65
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:55.990
So I'm going to go right here and say smartphones and let's take the body and let's change the background

66
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.810
to read by default.

67
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.560
It's gray.

68
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.910
Or I should say the core style or the default styling is gray.

69
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.910
But as you can see, when we test on an iPhone X or any of these devices, it's red.

70
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.860
And I can close this up and just drag the browser, make it smaller.

71
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.100
Once it hits 500, it turns red and you can also do a min width.

72
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.410
If I do min width, it's going to do the opposite.

73
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.460
It's going to be red until I hit 500 pixels.

74
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.020
Now when you do mobile first design, usually you'll put you'll do all your base styling as as you would

75
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.340
on a mobile screen and then add your min width for larger screens.

76
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.440
But we'll get into that later.

77
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.630
But I'm going to put this back to Max.

78
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.490
So the other thing that I want to do is only display the heading for that screen size.

79
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.050
So by default, I'm going to set H one all H ones to have a display of none, which will make them just

80
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.280
disappear completely.

81
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.600
So we'll save that.

82
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.230
And then down in our media query for our smartphone or for 500 pixels or less, I'm going to target

83
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:16.810
the ID Smart Phone H one and I'm going to set the display to its normal value of block.

84
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.070
And there we go.

85
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.960
So now it only displays when it's 500 pixels or less.

86
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.660
Now let's add another one for tablet.

87
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:34.360
I'm going to just copy this whole thing here and let's add tablet and usually a.

88
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.570
Tablet is around 768.

89
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.890
That's a common break point for tablets.

90
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:46.560
I'm going to set this to Blu and let's grab the ID of tablet and display the H one.

91
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.460
All right.

92
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:54.630
Now, notice that even though we're under 500 pixels, this is still applying because all we said was

93
00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:01.080
the max width of 768 and that includes 500 and less so anything under 768.

94
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.870
So if we wanted to target everything under 768, we could just do this.

95
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.670
There's not even any need for this.

96
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:15.570
But if we want a different style for smartphones and then something different for tablets, what we

97
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.460
would do is a min width.

98
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:25.230
Actually, I'm going to go right here, open up another set of curly braces and say men width and I'm

99
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:31.260
going to do 501 pixels and a max width of 768.

100
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:38.490
So if I save that now, when I get down to 500, notice it goes back to red.

101
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:45.750
It just shows this styling because this media query is 501 to 5 to I'm sorry, 768.

102
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.820
Okay.

103
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:58.700
Another thing I want to mention is that you might you might sometimes see this at media only screen

104
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.240
and and then the maximum in width or whatever.

105
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:08.600
Now, the reason for this is because screen is one of the media types are screen print and I believe

106
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.470
speech.

107
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.360
And sometimes you'll see this and it just means this only applies to screens.

108
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.700
I usually leave this off because the default is all, so it'll show.

109
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.230
It doesn't matter the media type, but if you see this, it just means that it's only four screens.

110
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.960
All right, so let's move on here.

111
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.150
Let's do the the normal size.

112
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:37.580
So I'm going to copy this and paste that in and let's change the values here.

113
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.370
So this ends at 768.

114
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.669
So let's do a min width of 769.

115
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.850
And we'll go to, let's say, 1200.

116
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:54.500
And I'm going to set the green or the background to green, and then I only want the normal id h one

117
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.130
to show.

118
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.330
So I'll save that.

119
00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And now from 769 to 1200, we get that green normal.

120
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.710
We hit 768 tablet, we had 500 smartphone.

121
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.550
All right.

122
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.860
And then finally, let's do the wide screen.

123
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.200
So I'm just going to paste this in again and we'll say wide screen.

124
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:23.270
And for wide screen, I'm just going to do anything above 1200 or 12, 1201, I should say.

125
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.370
So we don't need a range.

126
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:31.010
We can simply do min with 1201 and we can just get rid of this.

127
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:40.960
And Let's make it black and the ID of widescreen.

128
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:48.460
So now once they hit 1201, we get wide screen and it's going to it's going to stay like that as large

129
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.270
as I go.

130
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.510
So as you can see, we're just hitting breakpoints and then those styles are kicking in.

131
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.420
Now, usually you're not going to have all of these.

132
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.840
You're not going to have separate styles for every single device.

133
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:08.740
But you might, for instance, have floats on your normal you know, you might have two sections that

134
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.530
are float floated left and right, or better yet, the flex will use flex in the grid system later on.

135
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.660
But then when you get to smaller screens, you want them to be on top of each other because it looks

136
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.320
ridiculous floating like that on very small screens.

137
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.300
So you would add a media query for a mobile device and just set the float to none.

138
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.390
And that's exactly what we're going to do in our hotel website.

139
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:37.480
But this is the syntax for media queries, so let's test this out in the device toolbar.

140
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.520
So I'm going to open up my chrome tools and hit the device toolbar.

141
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:49.600
So any smartphone should just be red because they're all under 500 pixels wide.

142
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.590
And then if I go to the iPad, we get the tablet.

143
00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:04.210
As you can see, it's 768 and then iPad Pro is going to be normal because it's 1024 OC and an iPad Pro

144
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.050
is pretty wide.

145
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:14.620
It's it's pretty much like a laptop now for landscape what we would do is probably set a height because

146
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:20.710
actually let me make this a little bigger because if we hit this icon here, let's go back to iPhone

147
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:26.230
and we'll hit that and it shows us landscape and the width is 812.

148
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.880
So it falls into normal.

149
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.720
But let's add another one here.

150
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.180
I'm going to just copy this

151
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.690
and let's see.

152
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.570
It'll change this landscape.

153
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.990
Let's do a max.

154
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.130
Height.

155
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.640
Of 500 pixels.

156
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.710
And we're going to change the background to Orange.

157
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:03.110
And let's say landscape h won and we'll save that.

158
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.050
And now notice that it's orange.

159
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.400
We get landscape.

160
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.340
It's also going to show normal because of the width.

161
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.030
It's it's also whatever we have for the width still applies.

162
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.400
We're just adding some for the height as well.

163
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.060
All right.

164
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.020
And if this is confusing, don't worry about it.

165
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.200
Just like anything else that that may have confused you.

166
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.150
We're going to we're going to touch on all this stuff as we move along.

167
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.160
So you're going to it's going to make sense.

168
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.150
It's going to click.

169
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.580
So the last thing I want to show you is that we can actually have separate style sheets as our media

170
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:33.910
query.

171
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.860
If you don't want to embed the media query into a style sheet, you can have a separate one.

172
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.420
So just for an example, I'm going to create a new file.

173
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.830
I'm actually going to delete this after.

174
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:50.920
But just to show you, we could do like, let's say a style sheet called Mobile CSS.

175
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.330
And go up to the head.

176
00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:04.270
And just like we add any stylesheet, we could use a link tag, rel stylesheet and we can point to mobile

177
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.270
CSS.

178
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:11.710
Now, right now, it'll always load that style sheet, but we can actually add a media attribute.

179
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:21.430
And in our media attribute, we're going to say screen and and then open some parentheses and let's

180
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:27.760
do a max width of 768 pixels.

181
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:35.200
Now, what this is going to do is it's only going to load the style sheet if the screen is 768 or less,

182
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.540
so basically a tablet or less.

183
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.540
Otherwise, it's not going to load.

184
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.110
Now, you always want to have this after your main stylesheet.

185
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:49.180
In fact, this isn't even going to do what I want because our style, it's down here.

186
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.640
So I'm going to move this below.

187
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.210
Our style tags.

188
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.960
So we'll go right here because you want your main styling up here.

189
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.450
And then down here we have our mobile.

190
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.390
So in our mobile case, where is it?

191
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.320
Right here.

192
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.360
I'm going to actually take the body and I'm going to add a background.

193
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.720
Of Pink.

194
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:25.060
So once I save that, once I hit 768, notice that it's pink and it doesn't matter if it's tablet or

195
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:32.170
smartphone because I set it to 768 and it's after the rest of our styling.

196
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.880
So it's going to take precedence.

197
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.380
But yeah, you can do that as well.

198
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.010
I'm actually going to delete.

199
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.400
The that mobile CSIS.

200
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:49.670
And then I'm just going to comment out the link to it, just so you have it as a reference.

201
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:50.750
All right.

202
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.100
So that's media queries.

203
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.960
And like I said, we're going to get more into them.

204
00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:01.850
But before we do that, I want to take a look at certain relative units in CSS, such as REM EM, as

205
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.540
well as viewport heights and viewport widths.

206
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.940
All right.

207
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.560
So I'll see you in the next video.
