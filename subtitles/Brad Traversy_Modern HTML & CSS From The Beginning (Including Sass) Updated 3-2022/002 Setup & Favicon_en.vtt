00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.630
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.370
So we're going to start on our project.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.540
We're going to create our files and add the HTML for at least the nav bar and hopefully style it in

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.230
this video, we're also going to add the fab icon to the tab.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.960
So in your in the previous lecture, you should have a zip file called Image Resources.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.210
And what you're going to want to do is create a folder.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.030
I called my news grid, I created an IMG folder and I put all of the images in here.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.759
So as far as images, we have the logo, IMG, which is the main logo.

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.430
We have a logo light PNG for the footer.

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.560
I also include the PSD, which is the Photoshop file in case you guys wanted that.

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.140
And then there's an icon, PNG, which is just the icon and we're going to use this to create a fava

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.770
icon.

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.350
And then we have the showcase, our featured JPEG, which is the featured article and the showcase area,

14
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.800
and then a folder called Articles with all the other images.

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.530
So once you get those, let's go ahead and let's create our files.

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.240
So we're going to create index dot HTML, we're going to have an about HTML and we're going to have

17
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
an article HTML which will represent a single article.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.050
And then let's create a folder called CSS.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:27.420
Inside CSS, we'll have a style CSS and we'll have a mobile CSS OC and we can close all of this except

20
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.570
for index HTML.

21
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.640
And let's open up style CSS.

22
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.900
So let's add in our boilerplate here.

23
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.500
And for the title, I'm just going to say News Grid and let's say latest news

24
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.730
and let's link our style sheets.

25
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.860
So we'll say link and let's do CSS slash style CSS and then under that we want our mobile CSS.

26
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.330
So we'll copy that down.

27
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.210
Let's change this to mobile CSS.

28
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.070
However, we only want this to show if the screen is 768 or less.

29
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:15.660
So we're going to add a media attribute and say screen and max width 768 pixels.

30
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.790
Now we're also using font.

31
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.270
Awesome.

32
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.910
So let's head over to font awesome dotcom and let's say start using free and then we're going to grab

33
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.210
this link and put it right above the style CSS.

34
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.690
All right, so let's take care of the fab icon.

35
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.200
Now, what I usually do is I use a service called Dynamic Drive.

36
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.260
I've used this literally for about eight or nine years.

37
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.670
So if you search for dynamic drive, fab icon, you'll get this link here.

38
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.470
It's actually tools dot dynamic dot drive, dot com slash fab icon.

39
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.070
And what happens here is you can upload an image.

40
00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:01.650
So we're going to grab the icon PNG and then click create icon and it will generate a fab icon dot ISO

41
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.390
file or icon file.

42
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.970
So we want to download that and let's go ahead and grab that.

43
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.150
I already have one here, but I'm going to grab that and copy it and then let's bring it over to our

44
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.140
route folder.

45
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.670
Don't put it in the image folder, put it in the route so we'll paste that in.

46
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.270
Good.

47
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.450
And then all we have to do is add this little snippet here, this link to the fab icon, and we'll place

48
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.560
that right here.

49
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.100
And I'm just going to remove the slash because it will give us some issues.

50
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.160
If we just open it with the file system, it won't display.

51
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.220
So let's remove that and that's it.

52
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.300
Let's save.

53
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.490
Let's open with live server.

54
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.860
And if you don't see the fab icon here, you need to just clear your cache.

55
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.260
Or at least I do, because I've already done this.

56
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.890
So I'm going to I'm on a mac so I'm going to do a command shift.

57
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.350
Ah, and it will reload if you're on windows.

58
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.300
I believe it's shift f five and now you can see the fab icon displays in the tab.

59
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.310
So it's as easy as that.

60
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.850
So now let's start to add some markup.

61
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.320
First thing is the nav bar.

62
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.360
So we're going to have a nav with the ID of Main NAV and let's put a container in here to contain everything

63
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.790
to the max width that we're going to set and then we're going to have our logo.

64
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.410
So image with the class of logo, it's going to go to image slash logo.

65
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.740
PMG And for the alt, I'll just say news grid.

66
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.180
And then under that we want our social media icons and this is going to be a grid.

67
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.830
I'm going to set this to grid normally.

68
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.010
I'd probably use Flex for this, but I want I really want to focus on the grid system here.

69
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.710
So each one of these will be grid items.

70
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.880
All right.

71
00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:04.600
So let's create actually, let's give this div a class of social and then we're going to have a link

72
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.000
with we'll do a link and we'll just set this to go to Facebook.

73
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.040
Obviously, this would be their Facebook page, but this is a fictional website.

74
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.240
And then inside here, we want to put the we'll put an eye tag with the class of F a and it's actually

75
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.000
going to be F a B, the social media icons have a class of F, a B instead of face.

76
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.120
And then this will be F a Facebook.

77
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.400
Like that.

78
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.080
And we're going to also add a class of F, a dash to X, which will make it larger.

79
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:49.460
And then since this is an external website, let's add target equals underscore blank, which will open

80
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.630
it in a new tab.

81
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.110
All right, so let's take this and let's copy this down three more times and we're going to do Twitter.

82
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.020
Let's change this to Twitter, the icon, and then this.

83
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.840
I'm going to do a command control DX so that I can choose the next iteration of Facebook.

84
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:18.590
And I'm going to change this to Instagram and then I'll select this one Control DX and then let's do

85
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.760
YouTube.

86
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.740
All right, so if I save this, we should see this.

87
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.770
And don't worry, we'll make this look better.

88
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.450
The last thing we need in this container is going to be our links.

89
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.990
So.

90
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.450
Or our list with the links.

91
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:44.550
So let's do a ul ly say a I'm actually going to give this a class of current because I want the current

92
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.780
page to be highlighted.

93
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:54.630
So let's say class current, it's going to go to index dot HTML and let's say home, we'll copy this

94
00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:02.460
down and let's say about change this to about HTML and let's clear this class.

95
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.870
All right.

96
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.020
So it's going to look absolutely horrible for now.

97
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.180
In the next video, we're going to start to add some of our core styles and then we'll style the nav

98
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.660
bar.
