1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,570
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,130
So now we're going to talk about the position property, which has to do with positioning elements in

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,050
certain places on the page.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,830
So we're going to create a new file here called 11 Underscore Position HTML.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,400
And let's put in our head body tags.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,940
And for the title, we'll just say CSS positioning and let's do our style tags.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,390
And as far as the HTML goes, I just want to have five boxes and we're going to format them to just

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,130
be square colored boxes.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,190
And we want to we want to position them in certain ways so each one will have its own ID, let's do

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,030
box one.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,290
But I also want them to have a class of box because that's what we're going to use to create the height

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,290
and width and let's do five of these.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:00,630
So this will be box two, three, four and five and let's go up here and style the box class to have

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,070
a width of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,960
Now, if I save this and we open this up, it's going to be blank because we have no backgrounds for

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,070
these boxes.

17
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,740
So each one will have a different color background.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,390
So let's grab box one.

19
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,030
Let's give it a background of red.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,060
And then I'm going to just copy this down.

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,130
So we have five of them and let's do box two, three, four and five.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,370
So we'll do red, yellow.

23
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,950
Green, blue and orange.

24
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,570
So let's save this.

25
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,550
And now everything by default has a position of static.

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:02:01,250
If I do a position position here and say static, that's actually the default.

27
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:01,960
I'll save it.

28
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,260
It's the same.

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:10,400
Now, I just want to show you a quick screen right here that has all the the possible values of position.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,060
So static is the default and it's not affected by top, bottom, left and right properties.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,560
In CSS, we have properties where we can, let's say, for top.

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,830
We want to move it from the top.

33
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,020
A certain amount of pixels or percentage, we can do that, but we can't do it.

34
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:35,570
If it's position static relative, we can use these values top, bottom, left, right, and it'll cause

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:42,080
them to be moved from their normal position and whatever, whatever its normal position would be on

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,870
the page, we can move it from that.

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,290
Now absolute is different because absolute it pertains to its parent element.

38
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,320
So if you have a parent like let's say a div that can that that's surrounding other divs, you would

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,640
make the inner divs absolute and the outer div or its parent relative.

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,360
And then you could position it within that parent.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,890
And I'm going to give you an example of that fixed is actually position to the viewport meaning the

42
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,000
whole browser window.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,970
So it'll stay at that that place even if you scroll down or whatever and then sticky is similar to fixed,

44
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,370
except you can stick it in a certain position like at the top when you're scrolling down, if you want

45
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,890
it to stay at the top, you could use Sticky.

46
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,170
And this is used a lot for menus where you always want the menu to show at the top no matter what,

47
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,940
so you can navigate the site.

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:32,960
All right.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,480
So let's I'm going to give you examples of all of these.

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,830
So we already looked at static.

51
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,090
That's just the default.

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,070
Let's change this to relative.

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,020
And since we we we set it to relative, we can actually use top right, bottom and left properties.

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,530
So let's say we want to push this, let's say 50 pixels from the top and from the left.

55
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,950
We want to push it 50 pixels and I'll save that.

56
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,080
And notice the red box has now moved 50 down and 50 over from the left.

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,490
And if if we didn't do position relative and I save it doesn't it doesn't work so it's going to be from

58
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:18,110
it's from its natural place we can move it now absolute like I said, has to do with inside of a parent.

59
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,590
So box two and three, I'm going to make absolute, but I'm going to put them within a container class

60
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,540
or a div with the class of container.

61
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,070
And if there is no relative parent, it's going to use just the the body or the basically the whole

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,630
browser window here.

63
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,690
So let's do that now two and three, which are the yellow and green are within the container.

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:51,290
So up here, just so we can see the limits of the container, let's give it a width of 500 pixels,

65
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,250
a height of 500 pixels, a background of dark gray.

66
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:05,840
And let's position it relative because remember, the parent has to be position relative and I'll save

67
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,200
that.

68
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,920
And there we go.

69
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,090
There's the container.

70
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,370
Okay, now box one and box two are within the container.

71
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,950
But let's say we want to move it.

72
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,710
We want to move this one 100 pixels down from the top and 100 pixels over from the left.

73
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:32,970
So if I go to box two and I say top 100 pixels and left 100 pixels, save it.

74
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:39,000
It doesn't move because it's still static right now since I want it to move 100 pixels down and out

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,450
within its container, I want to set it to absolute.

76
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,280
So let's say position, absolute and save.

77
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,770
And now you can see that it moved down 100 pixels and over 100 pixels within its container.

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,650
Now, box three is also within the container.

79
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,960
So let's just copy this and let's do this.

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,410
Time will do from the bottom right and save.

81
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:18,120
And now within its container it went from the bottom up 100 pixels and from the right over 100 pixels.

82
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:26,970
So you can precisely put things wherever you want within positioned absolute within a relative container.

83
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,470
Hopefully that makes sense.

84
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,910
Now before we move on to fix, I just want to mention something and that's the Z index property.

85
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,080
Notice how box one is behind the container.

86
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,640
So if I wanted to move this in front, I could use the Z index property.

87
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,950
So let's go to box one, which is our red box and let's add Z dash index.

88
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:52,470
And if we do just a value of one that should do it, let's save and now it's in front.

89
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,330
So the higher the Z index, then the closer to you it's going to be.

90
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:05,790
If I were to add to the container, which is the big box, if I add a Z index here of two and save,

91
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,830
it goes in front of the red box because obviously two is higher than one and you can also have negative

92
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,970
values as well.

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,500
But let's get rid of that.

94
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,480
We'll keep the red box up front.

95
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,630
But I just wanted to mention that about Z index.

96
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,380
All right.

97
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,030
So let's do fixed.

98
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:27,440
So box four, let's say we want position to be fixed.

99
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,130
Now watch what happens when I save.

100
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,670
Watch what happens to the blue box or actually the orange box.

101
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,610
It seems to disappear, but it didn't disappear.

102
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,200
What happened is it's under the blue box because when it's fixed, it's it's pulled out of the the flow

103
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,690
of the document and put right on top.

104
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,400
And this would be the the next position after all this stuff.

105
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,990
Now, if I were to scroll down, you would see the orange box because the blue would just stay where

106
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,320
it is.

107
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,790
So let me give you an example of that.

108
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,310
We don't have enough content to scroll, but if I just add a crazy height to the body, we'll be able

109
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,510
to scroll down.

110
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,420
So let's just give the body a height of like 4000 pixels and save.

111
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,300
And now you can see we have a scroll bar and as I scroll, see how the blue box just stays in a fixed

112
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,140
position.

113
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,940
So that's what that's going to do.

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,550
So if you have a web page where maybe you have like an ad or something that's really important that

115
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,630
you always want to stay on top, you would use fixed for that.

116
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:38,130
And the next one I want to look at is sticky, which is similar, but you can actually have it stick

117
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,940
in a certain spot like let's say the orange box here.

118
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,760
We want it to stick to the top when we scroll down.

119
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:55,230
So for box five, let's say Position Sticky and this is used a lot for menus because a lot of times

120
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,580
you want the navigation menu to stay at the top no matter where you are on the site.

121
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,850
Now where we want it to stick is top zero.

122
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,370
So let's save that.

123
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,500
And now you'll see the orange one is on top of the blue and we can change that with the Z index.

124
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,720
But let's scroll up and watch.

125
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,170
When I hit the top with the orange box, it stays there.

126
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,840
I keep scrolling and it still stays at the top.

127
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,590
So it's really good for for top menus or navigation menus.

128
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:23,950
All right.

129
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,330
And just to show you, box five is orange.

130
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,190
If I were to give this a Z index, let's actually give this a negative Z index.

131
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,690
So negative one and save.

132
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,790
And you can see it goes behind the blue.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,760
So hopefully this gives you some insight on the different values for position as well as how Z index

134
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,420
works.

135
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:52,440
Now positioning like this isn't used that much in in modern websites in UI's because responsiveness

136
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,390
and having your your layout look good on mobile devices is very important.

137
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:04,350
And when you do things in this way, it's not very mobile friendly unless it's like part of a very small

138
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,240
area and you have stuff positioned absolute within there that's still going to look good on a mobile

139
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,990
device.

140
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,750
But yeah, it's this stuff isn't used as much anymore than it used to, is it used to be.

141
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:16,680
All right.

142
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,440
So in the next video, we're going to start to look at form styling and.

143
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm actually going to give this one to you guys as a challenge.

144
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,570
I'm going to give you some hints.

145
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,720
And I want you to try and style a form based on all the properties that we've learned about so far.
