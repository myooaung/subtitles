00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.570
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.510
So this is going to be just a bonus video showing you how I created the very simple news grid logo.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.330
And it's this is not true logo design.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.720
Because what I really did is, is I found an icon on the Internet and I just added some text to it.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.910
I edited the colors a little bit.

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.820
But what this is going to do is give you a small introduction to Photoshop because Photoshop is very

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.700
beneficial when you are creating graphics and or even creating mockups, stuff like that.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.270
So I just figured I'd add this on and I'm by no means am I like a true graphic designer.

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.970
I have a little bit of capabilities, but I wouldn't call myself a graphic designer by any means.

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.380
So what we're going to do first is create this is Photoshop CC and I'm going to open I'm going to create

11
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.410
a new file so you guys can't see my menu.

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.270
What I'm going to go to file new and I'm going to create a new document with the width of 600 by let's

13
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.500
say 600 width, 400 height and create.

14
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.140
And let me just bring this over.

15
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.830
And then I just searched Google for a global icon and I found this here.

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.900
So if I go to if I search globe icon, it's going to be this one right here from Carmen's dot Wikimedia

17
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.790
dot org.

18
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.490
Now make sure if you if you're doing this type of thing for a client or for a production website, make

19
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.420
sure that if you do use an icon like this, make sure it's it's it's stock, it's a free stock image.

20
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.670
And it's not from another website or anything like that because you could run into some issues, some

21
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.930
copyright issues.

22
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.230
So I'm going to go ahead and just save this image.

23
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.630
And then I'm going to drag it into my Photoshop image.

24
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.570
I can actually just take this and bring it right in like that and let's resize this.

25
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.200
So we'll do like like that.

26
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.310
And this isn't going to be the exact image that we use, but this is how I did it.

27
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.910
So I'm going to choose this tool right here, which allows me to move things around.

28
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.330
So I'll move this over here and let's choose the text tool right here and just click in there.

29
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.590
And I'm going to say news you guys can't see probably can't see that so small.

30
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.810
I'll increase it in a second but I'm typing news grid and we can change the, the, the size of the

31
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.980
font up here.

32
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.350
I'm not sure exactly what size I use.

33
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.940
Let's highlight this.

34
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.720
And 72 is the largest we can choose here, but you can put in whatever, whatever point you want.

35
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.940
So let's bring this over.

36
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.850
And I don't think this machine has the exact font that I used, but of course you could go through the

37
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.330
fonts.

38
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.560
If I just go up here and just move the mouse wheel, it'll show me all the different fonts that I can

39
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.250
use.

40
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.610
So we'll just choose like, again, this isn't going to be the same exact logo, but we'll choose.

41
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.720
Let's see.

42
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.000
Troops.

43
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.290
Something that's kind of square.

44
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.360
We'll just use that, I guess.

45
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.990
All right.

46
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.800
So you find a font and let's see, we have a color.

47
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.810
That we want to use, which is that red color.

48
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.190
So I'm going to click on the palette right here and just kind of guess.

49
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.050
So it was like a darker red.

50
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.980
So something.

51
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.290
Let's see, something like that.

52
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.040
So I'll click.

53
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.460
Okay, and let's highlight.

54
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.390
Grid and then click this color up, this box up here, which is the actual text color and I can choose

55
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.080
from here.

56
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.380
I could have just did that, but I wanted it in my palette over here.

57
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.440
But you'll see it turns into an eyedropper when I hover over it.

58
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.050
And if I click, it'll change the color to that.

59
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.190
All right.

60
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.550
So that's the text now for the The Globe here.

61
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.690
I want these four inner squares to be red.

62
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.070
I want it to be this color.

63
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:14.220
So I'm going to grab the wand tool right here and I'm going to click actually see over here in our layers.

64
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.290
I probably should have explained the layers I'm going to select with Control.

65
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.010
D But we have layers, so we have the text, we have the actual icon and we have the background and

66
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.340
we can remove the background with this little AI right here.

67
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.510
See, we can remove that.

68
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.170
We're going to want to do that before we export the file as a PNG.

69
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.100
Now PNG you can have a transparent background like this, but JPEGs you can't.

70
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.370
So if you want a transparent background and not a white or solid color, then make sure you export as

71
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.060
PNG or gif gif, whatever you want.

72
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.580
However you want to say it, people say it in different ways, but gifs are they're not as high quality

73
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.870
as PNGs are.

74
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.710
All right.

75
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.730
So we're just going to leave the background for now, just so we can kind of see what we're doing.

76
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:07.530
But I'm going to go and highlight the Globe icon here and again, choose the one tool.

77
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.750
And I'm going to click in here.

78
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.590
You'll see the little the moving bars around the the box here.

79
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.970
That means it's selected.

80
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.710
Now I want to select all four.

81
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.540
So I'm going to hold down shift and click this one, this one and this one.

82
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.920
And then we're going to go over to my brush tool, which is this one right here.

83
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.620
And let's see.

84
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.610
Actually, you know what?

85
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.100
I think we have to pasteurize this first.

86
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.330
Yeah.

87
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.070
So see how I can't do anything.

88
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.600
We have to pasteurize this.

89
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.280
So we're going to go over to the layer and right click and say pasteurized layer.

90
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.460
And now we can color it and notice that it's only coloring within the selected parameters.

91
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.230
Okay.

92
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.580
And you can if you right click with the brush tool, you can make it bigger so we can make it bigger

93
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.200
like that.

94
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.090
So now all the four boxes are colored in.

95
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.840
I'm going to d select with control d and that's it.

96
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.850
So pretty simple.

97
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.410
Now, I also have the the light version of it so that it can go on a dark background.

98
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.810
Because if I take this background and this is going to be locked by default, the background, so you

99
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.780
have to double click and just click, okay?

100
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.140
And now it's unlocked.

101
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.870
And we could take the brush and color this if we wanted to, but I'm just going to double click and

102
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.470
it opens up the Layer style panel.

103
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.210
And from here I'm going to choose Color Overlay.

104
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.010
And then we can actually choose a color.

105
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.130
I'm just going to make it really dark like our footer is because that's where we put the light version

106
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.490
and click, okay.

107
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.390
All right.

108
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.650
Now, that doesn't look too good.

109
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.940
It's just it's too dark.

110
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.470
There's no contrast.

111
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.300
So what I'll do is over here, you can see the folder icon.

112
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.700
I'm going to create a new folder by default called Group one, but I'm going to rename it double click,

113
00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:04.060
rename it to Standard, and I'm going to move my two layers, the icon and the news grid, the text

114
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.320
into that standard folder.

115
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.760
All right.

116
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.340
Now, if I click the I here, I can toggle it.

117
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.710
Now I'm going to create another folder down here.

118
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.920
Make sure it's not in the standard.

119
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.440
And I'm going to call this one light.

120
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.660
All right.

121
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.870
And then what I want to do is duplicate both of these the news, the text and the globe icon.

122
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.630
So I'm going to right click and I'm going to say duplicate layers and you can name them if you want.

123
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.770
I'm just going to click, okay.

124
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.540
And they're just going to be called copy.

125
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.840
And now let's move this into the light folder and then I'm going to take the standard folder and just

126
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.650
click the I.

127
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.760
So it's not showing.

128
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.000
So now it's just showing the the logo and or the icon and the text that are in the light folder.

129
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.490
And now I want to make these light.

130
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.230
So the text is easy.

131
00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:03.940
I can just choose the text tool, highlight news, click on this and make it white, click okay.

132
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:11.260
And then for the icon, I'm going to make sure that it's selected over here in the layer panel and grab

133
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.010
the wand and I want to select Oops.

134
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.780
Uh, let's see.

135
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.410
Yeah, there we go.

136
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.700
So I want to select in there.

137
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.800
I'm actually going to zoom in, so I'll click the microscope here and just zoom in and then click the

138
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.140
wand and hold shift.

139
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.610
That's not the one.

140
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:34.039
That's the color picker we're going to hold shift and just click in each of these.

141
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.280
Okay.

142
00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:46.510
And then what I'll do is choose the brush tool and I'm going to change the color.

143
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.430
Now this we have two colors here.

144
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.210
You can see the blue.

145
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.230
I'm just going to switch these just so I have that red one as a backup.

146
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.210
But I'm going to change this to white and that's going to be the color of the brush.

147
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.520
And I'll just go ahead and fill that in because it's only going to fill in what's what's selected.

148
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.120
And then I'll do control D to deselect and then let's zoom out.

149
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.760
We'll just say, whoops, we want to say 100%.

150
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.800
And that's the actual logo.

151
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.750
So that's basically what I did.

152
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.990
And then we can take the crop tool and crop this image.

153
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.620
So basically we can just select around it like that.

154
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.940
We can adjust it and let's right click and say Crop.

155
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.840
All right, so now the image is only this big and we have the light.

156
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.930
If I click the little icon and click standard, we have our standard.

157
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.940
Now we're going to want to remove the background.

158
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.380
So we'll click that and now we have our standard and our light.

159
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.540
Now let's save the standard.

160
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.670
So I'm going to go to file.

161
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.670
Now, you could do.

162
00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:00.990
Now we'll just do save as I don't want to make this too confusing so let's go to save as and you can

163
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.500
see that by default it's getting saved as a PSD.

164
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.630
It's what I'm going to call this logo and I don't want it to be a PSD that's a Photoshop file, meaning

165
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.520
that it will include all these layers and stuff, but we can't use that inside of a web page.

166
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.090
So I'm just going to choose from here, P and g.

167
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.320
All right.

168
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.660
And then I'll save this to we'll just save it to, I guess.

169
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.550
My desktop.

170
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.280
And we're going to get this PNG options.

171
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.450
We're going to just click okay here.

172
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.900
All right.

173
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.850
So that saves the regular logo.

174
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:41.780
Now let's click the light and same thing file save as and I'm going to change I'm going to name this

175
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.940
logo underscore light and I'm going to choose PNG for this as well.

176
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.620
And och, and that's it.

177
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.810
Now, if I close or minimize this and just get rid of all this stuff, don't save.

178
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.330
And then I can show you.

179
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.140
Let me just bring over what I saved.

180
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.840
So we have our logo light and we have our logo PNG All right.

181
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.270
And if I just open this with preview.

182
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.560
We just have just a standard image that we can include in our Web page.

183
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.100
So I just wanted to kind of go through that little process.

184
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:25.210
It's not really something that is is is needed to know to to build websites.

185
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:32.020
But if you want to get into editing images, maybe creating graphics and stuff like that, or just maybe

186
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.430
just text logos.

187
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.050
Photoshop is great for that.

188
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:41.020
There's also --, which is an open source tool that is very similar to Photoshop.

189
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:48.100
You also have Adobe XD, you have Sketch Figma There's there's a lot of different graphic design programs

190
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.610
out there.

191
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.940
So, you know, fine, find one that fits, fits you.

192
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:57.250
And you know, it was pretty easy for you to pick up, but I just wanted to throw that video in there.

193
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.370
Hopefully, you guys enjoyed it and that's it.

194
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.010
Thanks.
