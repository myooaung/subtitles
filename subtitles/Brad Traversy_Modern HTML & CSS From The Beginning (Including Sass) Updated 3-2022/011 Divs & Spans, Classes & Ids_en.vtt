00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.840
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.870
In this video, we're going to talk about divs and spans, which are both HTML elements or tags, as

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.470
well as ID and class attributes which are used for semantics to use to kind of separate content.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.490
They're also used for CSS styling, which we're going to talk about in the next section.

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.350
So let's create a new file called zero nine Underscore and we'll just call it ID, Underscore Class

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.300
HTML, and we're going to put our structure, our boilerplate in here.

7
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.860
And for our title, we'll say div span ID in class.

8
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.910
So we've used Divs before.

9
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.430
We used it to separate our kind of our labels and inputs in the form and where we talked about forms.

10
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.590
So let's put a div in here and let's say that this is going to be the header of our website.

11
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.430
We have maybe an H one, say my website or maybe you have an image, a logo image and then we'll put

12
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.519
a paragraph that says like some kind of slogan.

13
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.620
We'll just say a site about me.

14
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.870
Now, since everything in this div pertains to the header, I'm going to give this an ID of header or

15
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.940
maybe even main header because you could have multiple headers, maybe you have an art, you have articles

16
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.340
on the page and you have headers for the articles.

17
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.260
So let's call this the main header.

18
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.980
All right?

19
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:34.500
And then underneath that, let's create a UL and let's give it some allies, some list items, and we'll

20
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.390
put some links inside here.

21
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.650
And let's say this goes this is the home page link.

22
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.420
I'm going to copy this down twice.

23
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.960
We'll say this is the about link goes to the about page.

24
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.880
This goes to, let's say contact.

25
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.190
So it's this is a navigation menu.

26
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.880
So let's give this UL an ID of let's call it main nav.

27
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.440
You can call whatever you want.

28
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.090
Now let's say underneath the navigation, we have an area that has some information about us or about

29
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.920
our page or whatever it may be.

30
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.250
So we'll have a div and let's give it an ID of a boat.

31
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.630
Now here I'm going to show you a very, very helpful Emmet trick.

32
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.840
So again, Emmet is installed with V's code and it allows us to do things faster.

33
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.370
So instead of typing out ID equals what we can do is we can say div and we can put just a number sign

34
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.510
which represents an ID, the word a boat and then tab or enter and it puts it in for us.

35
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.380
And then to take it a step further, if it's a div like we could do this with a with an H one, we could

36
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.080
give it an ID of about like that.

37
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.140
But if it's a div, we don't even have to write the word div.

38
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.660
We can simply just put a number sign and then a boat and then hit tab or enter and it will give us a

39
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.490
div with the ID of a boat.

40
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.320
So nice little tip there.

41
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.540
And again, you don't have to use it, but it will make you write your HTML much faster.

42
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.750
So let's say in this boat we have an H three, which is a heading we'll say about and then maybe a paragraph

43
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.130
with some text, we'll just generate some dummy text here and then maybe under that div we have, let's

44
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.360
say an area for, for our contact info.

45
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.630
And I know I haven't talked about spans or classes yet.

46
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.100
I'll get to that in a minute.

47
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.510
So let's create a div with the ID of contact.

48
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.380
And in here maybe we have another heading.

49
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.670
Remember, it's good, it's good practice to not have more than 1h1i don't think.

50
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.070
Well yeah we do have an H one which is in the header.

51
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.670
So every div here is using an H three as a title.

52
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.190
You could use an h two and again you could use an H one.

53
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.100
It's just good practice to just have one on the page.

54
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.160
So let's put a UL here.

55
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:05.140
We'll do some list items, we'll put like address 50 Main Street, Boston, Mass.

56
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.220
Let's put another list item with a phone.

57
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.360
And let's do another list item with an email.

58
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.020
Just say me at something cool dot com.

59
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.080
And then finally maybe we have a footer so we'll have a div here with actually we can just do ID footer

60
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:43.280
and we'll have a paragraph and let's just say copyright 20 older 2019 because it's the very end of 2018

61
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.970
right now.

62
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.840
All right.

63
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.120
So let's save this and take a look.

64
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.410
We'll open it with live server.

65
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.100
It's going to look very ugly because we have no CSS, but it's structured in a very common way.

66
00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.370
So we have a header, we have the navigation, we have some some different sections about contact,

67
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.650
and then we have a footer at the bottom and we used IDs for all of these.

68
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.990
Now when it comes to CSS, we we can grab on to these IDs and we can styles these sections by their

69
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.050
ID, but we also have something called classes.

70
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.870
Now a lot of people get confused on when do I use an ID and when do I use a class?

71
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.410
And and the reason for that is there's no functional difference.

72
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.420
Like they don't behave any differently.

73
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:33.740
You can style them the same exact way, but it's good practice to always have your IDs, be individual,

74
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.220
meaning you're not going to have a main header ID anywhere else.

75
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.190
You're not going to go down here and have a main header ID.

76
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.080
You're not going to have another section on the page that has an idea of a boat.

77
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.390
So basically just one per ID now a class you can repeat.

78
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.570
So let's say we wanted to style like a border and a light grey background around the about and the contact

79
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.290
area.

80
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.200
We might have a class called card actually.

81
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.030
I'm going to add a CSS style up here and don't worry if you don't know what any of this is, I'm going

82
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.080
to do this later.

83
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.540
I'm going to show you this later, but I'm going to put a style that grabs on to the card class.

84
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.480
And we're going to add a class of card to both of the divs of a boat and contact.

85
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.580
So I did that backwards.

86
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.380
I want to do class equals card and then let's go down to the contact div right here and also give that

87
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.760
a class of card and let's save and now notice they both have the same styling so you can see the difference

88
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:43.580
here IDs they're individual to that that section but classes you can repeat so we can have as many cards

89
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.420
as we want.

90
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.480
If I wanted the header to have that same style excuse me, I could give that a class of card as well

91
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.310
and it would get that styling.

92
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.450
So that's the biggest difference between IDs and classes.

93
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.210
Now, some people, I mean, everyone's different.

94
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.010
Some people don't even use IDs.

95
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.360
They'll just use classes.

96
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:10.640
Like instead of doing this, you might see something like this, like class, main header and card both

97
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.650
in in both classes.

98
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.340
But I think that this is a better way to structure it.

99
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.620
But you'll come to find your own way of doing things.

100
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.530
But generally the most important thing is not to repeat IDs on the same page, at least.

101
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.700
All right.

102
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.490
So next, let's talk about divs and spans.

103
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.570
We've used quite a bit of divs here to separate out our content.

104
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.820
And the main difference between a div and a span is a div is a is a block level element.

105
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.860
It pushes the next thing down.

106
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:51.590
So let's say I had a style for let's, let's, let's do a class called enhance and let's say we want

107
00:07:51.590 --> 00:08:02.900
the colour to be yellow and we want the background color to be black.

108
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.030
And I'm going to this is CSS, I'm going to go over this all in the next section.

109
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.110
And let's say we wanted to add it to a piece of text in this paragraph.

110
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:18.290
So if we use a div, if you say div class equals enhance.

111
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.190
And let's wrap this div.

112
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.250
Let's put it like right here and let's save it.

113
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.740
We get that styling, but it knocks it onto to the next next line.

114
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.580
It basically goes in between this line and this line.

115
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.140
This is a case where we want to use a span because a span is an inline element.

116
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.640
So let's grab this.

117
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:48.350
I'll highlight this div and do control D to grab the next one and just change them both to a span oc

118
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:56.490
save it and now notice that it's not it's not block level, it just stays in its place and we can still

119
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.720
add that styling.

120
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.520
So that's the difference between a span and a div.

121
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.860
For the most part, you're going to be using divs, but when you need it to be inline, you want to

122
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.910
use a span.

123
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:06.870
Now.

124
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.650
HTML five When it was released, it came out with something called semantic tags to better to better

125
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.120
lay out our sections.

126
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.820
So for instance, there's a header tag which we could use.

127
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.840
Instead of having to use an ID, we could use the actual header tag.

128
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.170
There's something called the nav tag we could use for navigation.

129
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.760
There's section tags for stuff like this and we're going to go over that soon.

130
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:36.990
But in the next video, I want to just quickly cover entities which are little symbols we can use in

131
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.740
HTML.

132
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.930
For instance, this copy right down here.

133
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:45.750
If we want to put a copyright symbol, we can do ampersand, copy, semicolon.

134
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.210
And if I go ahead and save that and now you'll see down here it actually gives us a little copyright

135
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.810
symbol.

136
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:57.240
So I want to talk a little bit about that in the next section before we move on to HTML five semantic

137
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.990
tags.
