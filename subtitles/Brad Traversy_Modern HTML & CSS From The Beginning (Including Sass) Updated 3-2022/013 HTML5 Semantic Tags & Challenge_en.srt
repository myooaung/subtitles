1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,340
So before HTML five, we would put everything in Divs, much like you saw in not the the last video,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,920
but the one before that where we had an idea of main header.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,910
We had an idea of main NAV with HTML five, we got semantic tags like header footer nav, so we can

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,600
actually describe what is in that tag.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,200
Now, this isn't just for organization, although it is excellent for organization, it's also for accessibility.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,420
It helps people with disabilities that you know, that have hearing disabilities, vision disabilities.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,930
It helps them understand what goes where.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,600
So they're very important to use instead of just using divs, which have no meaning at all.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,100
So these are the more the more popular HTML five tags.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,740
There are a couple of other ones, but these are the main ones.

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,380
And then I just have a sample that I found on the Internet that kind of shows you what goes where.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,010
It's not using all of these, but I'm going to explain each one.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,600
So basically we have header and footer.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,580
That's pretty self-explanatory.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,960
As you can see here, header is usually go at the top footers usually go at the bottom.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,510
A lot of times your header will have like a logo.

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,910
You may have your navigation in your header, you may have it underneath, you may have like a search

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,650
box or something like that.

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,850
Next we have NAV which is used for navigation.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,880
I don't have an example on this, but let's say you have a nav bar here, which would be a ull and unordered

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,640
list and then you'd wrap it in the nav tag.

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,350
Or maybe you have a side menu which is a UL that you wrap in a nav tag main which also is an on here,

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,320
could be wrapped around this whole area which is like the main content of the page or maybe even around

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,040
this whole thing.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,680
There's no like special science to this.

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,850
Some of it is preference, but there are just some general rules to follow.

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
It just generally means the main content of your page.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,530
And a lot of times people don't even use main, they'll just split it into sections.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,190
But yeah, you can use main section is going to be just that.

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,009
For instance, the, the about div that we had and then the contact div, that's where I would use a

32
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,470
section instead of using a div there I'd say section and maybe still give it an ID of, of about or

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,100
whatever.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,670
And then article is going to be used for just that.

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,540
If there's an article post or a blog post, a lot of times you'll see multiple blog posts and then maybe

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,310
a read more button or something.

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,780
Those could be wrapped in article tags instead of Divs.

38
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,240
And then a side is just that.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,970
It's sidebar content or just content that isn't it's not the main focus of the page.

40
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:49,320
It could be maybe an ad or it could be like a category section for the main blog section, something

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,040
like that.

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,270
So these are the HTML five semantic tags.

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:02,490
Now I'm going to give you a little challenge and I want to give you a layout that only uses Divs.

44
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,370
And I want you to figure out where to put these semantic tags, all the ones that I just showed you.

45
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,100
So let's go ahead and create a new file here.

46
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:21,660
We'll call this 11, underscore HTML five, underscore semantic start HTML, and you're going to have

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,600
this HTML file in your project files for this video and I'm going to paste it in.

48
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,590
And it does have a bunch of CSS up at the top in the style.

49
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,850
Don't worry about this.

50
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,670
I just wanted it to look like an actual web page.

51
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,230
We're going to learn how to do all of this later on, but just pay attention to the HTML.

52
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,860
So I'm going to save this and open it up just to see what it looks like.

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,510
So it's not very good looking, but it is laid out like an actual website.

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:57,930
So we have a header, we have our main area, we have this section here, this section here.

55
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,750
We also have some articles in the section and then we have our sidebar with a navigation.

56
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,190
So keep that stuff in mind, keep those elements in mind and let's look at the HTML.

57
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,180
So we have a div with the idea of header right down here.

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,320
We have a div with the ID of main, we have a div with the idea of welcome and the comments should give

59
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,310
you hints as well.

60
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,600
Welcome section.

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,670
We have the blog section.

62
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,910
We have article one, article two.

63
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,980
But notice that they're all using div.

64
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,510
So I just want you to figure out where the HTML five tags go.

65
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,280
We have a sidebar.

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,020
Inside the sidebar we have our navigation and then we have our footer.

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,760
Don't worry about this clear.

68
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,500
This just has to do with the floats we just floated using CSS, so we had to clear it.

69
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,030
Don't worry about that.

70
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:57,450
So just take a look at this and take a look at this and figure out what goes where and I'll even do

71
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,590
the first one for you.

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,760
So for header.

73
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,170
We have this div.

74
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:10,100
So what I would do is replace this with header and then the ending tag also with header and we can keep

75
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,830
and keep the ID if we were going to style it or something, we could even style it just by the element

76
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,340
itself.

77
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,480
But you may want to keep the ID, but that's the first one I'm going to do.

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,840
So take a look at the rest and I want you to replace certain Divs where you think they should be replaced

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,350
with these HTML five semantic tags.

80
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,610
And then in the next video, I'll give you my my solution.
