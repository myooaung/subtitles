1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,890
All right, guys, welcome to your next project.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,710
So I think you're going to enjoy this project because we haven't looked at hamburger menus or anything

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,670
like that yet.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,160
And this is going to be a a hamburger menu that's completely in CSS.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,110
Now, most of these things have JavaScript involved, and we're not going to do that.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,470
I'm going to show you a trick so that we don't even have to use JavaScript.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,930
But first, let's take a look at what we'll be building.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,150
Now, what you're seeing here, this this little splash page with the image, this isn't really important

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,900
to the project.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,280
We've done all this before.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,060
We're just going to add an overlay and image and use flex to center it.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,370
What we're focusing on is this right here.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,350
This is a hamburger menu and I believe it gets its name because it has a three lines that look like

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,280
a hamburger.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,760
And I'm sure you've seen these before where you click them and maybe something opens from the side or

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,150
comes down or you get an entire overlay like we're doing.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,580
So I'm just going to go ahead and click this and notice that a couple of things happen.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:06,210
So one, if we look at the hamburger menu itself, it turns into an X, which is really cool.

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,080
And when we hover off of it and go back on, it kind of just goes back and forth, which is a neat effect.

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,250
And then we get this entire menu overlay with some links here.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,060
So this is a really nice menu because it's completely responsive.

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,430
It doesn't matter how big or small the screen size is, it's going to work and you don't need any extra

23
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,010
media queries or anything like we've been doing.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,220
And I built it in a way so that you can use this in other projects pretty easily.

25
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,250
We're actually going to put all this the menu CSS in its own file in a file called menu CSS.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,680
Now let me explain how this is actually working without JavaScript, because usually what you would

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,070
do is you would dynamically set a class in JavaScript, maybe like a show class or something, so that

28
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,100
when you clicked you had a JavaScript click event that would put in a show class or something like that.

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,270
But we're not doing that.

30
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,670
This is actually a checkbox.

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:11,370
This is an HTML input with the type of checkbox and with a checkbox you can style the checked state.

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,600
When it's actually when it's checked, you can, you can add styles to that.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,740
And that's what we're doing.

34
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,310
We're basically going to get rid of the checkbox itself and replace it with this, but it still has

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,090
a check state.

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,410
So when I, when I click it, we're actually checking it and we can create all these styles.

37
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,250
Basically, you choose to display this overlay, add transitions, transform stuff like that, and then

38
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,320
we can uncheck and it goes away.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,770
All right.

40
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,030
So this is something that is very useful, very unique.

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,620
There's no JavaScript involved.

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,140
So I think you guys will like this little project.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,500
Now, we're going to start with just the HTML.

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,750
I want to create all the HTML, which isn't much at all, and then just the base styles.

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,170
So we get this image and stuff like that, all the stuff we've done already.

46
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,610
And then in the next video we'll start on the actual CSS for the menu.

47
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,990
All right, so I have an empty folder called Hamburger Overlay Menu, and I'm going to just make this

48
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,800
smaller.

49
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,690
We can probably make this a little smaller.

50
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,280
Because this is completely responsive.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,310
So it doesn't matter if we keep it small, but we're going to create a file called Index HTML.

52
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:32,160
So let's go up here and let's create index dot HTML and then we're going to have a folder called CSS.

53
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,810
And inside here, let's create a style CSS.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,470
And then like I said, I want all the menu stuff to be in its own file.

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,320
So menu dot CSS and we're going to have one image.

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,200
So we'll have a folder called IMG.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,840
And let me just grab that real quick.

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,340
Now, you guys can get this from the the files in this lecture.

59
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,570
You'll have all the completed files and you can just take it from that.

60
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,630
But let me see let me just grab it real quick.

61
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,920
Uh.

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,790
Where is it?

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:09,850
All right.

64
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,640
So I'm going to just bring this in here.

65
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,930
So this is our image.

66
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,350
And now let's go into our index HTML.

67
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,140
And I'm just going to close up this sidebar.

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,950
All right.

69
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:31,630
So we'll call this hamburger menu overlay and let's link in our style sheet.

70
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,190
So we'll do link.

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,980
We're going to have style CSS.

72
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,090
Actually, it's in CSS slash style CSS.

73
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,290
And then we also want to include our menu dot CSS.

74
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:45,700
All right.

75
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,840
And it's up to you if you want to do this stuff, if you want to include multiple style sheets, if

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,090
you have a ton of styling for one particular thing like we're doing here, then you may want to do it

77
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,240
this way, or you could just include it all in one.

78
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,570
So let's start with let's let's take care of the HTML.

79
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:09,580
So we're going to have a a div here with the class of menu wrap.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,640
And inside here we want our input.

81
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,640
And like I said, it's going to have a type of checkbox and we don't need a name and an ID.

82
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,820
All we need is a class and I'm going to call this class toddler because that's what it is.

83
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,890
It's going to toggle that overlay.

84
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,900
And underneath that, we're going to have a div with the class of hamburger.

85
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,190
And we're going to have an empty div in here.

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,640
Now, the way that we're structuring this might look a little weird, but that's what we need to do

87
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,610
in order to get the effect that we're going for.

88
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:52,610
So we're going to have a class of menu underneath and then a div and then another div.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,590
And inside here will be the UL.

90
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,890
So this will be our list.

91
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,510
We'll have list item.

92
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,070
Let's put in a tag.

93
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,050
These aren't going to actually go anywhere.

94
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,980
And I want to give you guys a challenge to turn this into a full website with what you've learned so

95
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,580
far.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,230
I'm not going to go through it because I don't want to repeat stuff that we've already done and that

97
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,640
we're going to do in the future.

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,650
But it'd be a nice little challenge for you to create an actual site from this.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,520
I mean, obviously you can just point to about dot HTML and also include the menu in that page as well.

100
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,150
But we're going to just copy this down a couple of times.

101
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,040
And this next one, actually the top one I'm going to make home.

102
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:45,200
So home about let's do services, it doesn't really matter services and let's do contact.

103
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,800
So that's that.

104
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,290
Let's save this and we'll open it with live server.

105
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,240
And this is going to look very.

106
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,530
Oops, hold on.

107
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,100
What's going on?

108
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,150
I think I have something else open with live server.

109
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,030
Let's see.

110
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,780
I think I still have my news grid open.

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,340
Yep.

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
We just close that up.

113
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,020
Okay.

114
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,540
So let's try that again.

115
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,160
And there it is.

116
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,260
So we just have a little checkbox here.

117
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,490
So we're somehow going to turn this into this with CSS.

118
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,430
That's how powerful it is, how powerful CSS is.

119
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,610
Okay, so let's do the rest of the content.

120
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:36,820
So under the last div, we'll create a header with the ID of showcase and let's have a container and

121
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,770
let's also have a showcase.

122
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,350
Dash container we're going to use flex here to center everything and let's put an H one, we'll just

123
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:54,960
say welcome and then a paragraph we'll do like lorem 20 and then under the paragraph let's put in a

124
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,880
tag with the class of BTN.

125
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,760
I realize I didn't have to do this part, but I'm doing it for two reasons.

126
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,610
One, just so we have some things, just so it looks decent and so that we can reiterate things that

127
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,110
you've already learned.

128
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,350
All right, so now let's go into our style, CSS, and let's add our our main styles.

129
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,570
Now we're going to use variables here.

130
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,000
So let's say in our root scope, we're going to have a primary color

131
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,740
and I'm going to use our GBA.

132
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,740
You remember our GBA is red, green, blue alpha.

133
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,500
So we can add transparency to to the element using the color.

134
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:48,270
So we're going to have 13 110 139 and then the opacity or the alpha will be 0.75.

135
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,290
So it's going to be this color here and it's going to be a little see through.

136
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,880
And we're also going to have a secondary color which is going to be like an orange.

137
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,290
So let's say secondary color, we're going to use that for the hover links and that's going to be

138
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:11,070
2291480.

139
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,720
And let's do an alpha of just 0.9.

140
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,230
Okay.

141
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,760
And then we're going to have an overlay color.

142
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,150
So the overlay is going to be actually, you know what?

143
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,150
I should probably keep the keep the file open.

144
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,290
Just so I can show you, like, what's what?

145
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:40,250
So this right here, the background is going to be the overlay color the yeah, that's going to be the

146
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,790
overlay.

147
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,750
So let's change this to overlay.

148
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,690
And this is going to be.

149
00:09:49,020 --> 00:10:00,750
24, this is going to be pretty similar to the primary, but darker so 24, 39, 51 and we're going

150
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,070
to do 0.85.

151
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,000
Now, if you want this to be less transparent, see how we can see the welcome behind it.

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,710
You can just raise this up.

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,260
You'll be able to just put this to maybe 95 or just one if you want it to be solid.

154
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,290
But I like I like the see through effect.

155
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:22,980
All right.

156
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,390
So that's our overlay color.

157
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,580
And then last thing I want is the is the speed, how fast this actually opens.

158
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,520
I want to put that in a variable so that it's easy to access.

159
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,790
So let's say menu dash speed, 0.7 5 seconds.

160
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:45,030
And I know that this has to do with the menu and this is style dot CSS, but I didn't want to put separate

161
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,150
variables in the menu CSS.

162
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,000
We can actually use these variables in that file because we're putting we're including the style CSS

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,450
before the menu, so we're able to use those variables.

164
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,350
Now let's add our reset.

165
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,980
So we'll say margin zero.

166
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,360
I always like to put a space there, margin zero and padding zero.

167
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:20,190
And then let's do box sizing for a box for the body.

168
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,260
We're going to use the Roboto font.

169
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,810
So we have to grab that real quick.

170
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,990
Let's go to Google Fonts and Roboto I have right here.

171
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,780
I'm just going to click that and I'm going to grab.

172
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,940
Um.

173
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,400
Let's make this a little bigger.

174
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,630
Okay.

175
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,530
So I'm going to grab this link and put that in the index.

176
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,080
HTML read above the style sheets.

177
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,380
All right, so let's see.

178
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:09,450
Next thing in our style, CSIS, we want to add the font family, which is going to be Roboto sans serif.

179
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,210
And then let's do a line height.

180
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,140
Of 1.4.

181
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,360
And then we have our container to move everything to the middle.

182
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,770
So we're going to set a max width and I'm going to do 960.

183
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,730
And the reason I'm doing it so thin is because I don't want it to get in the way of the menu.

184
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,400
I want the menu to always be outside of it.

185
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,800
So even if we go like here, you can see that there's, there's room here.

186
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,910
So when we scroll down, the content will be this won't cover the content basically, but you can experiment

187
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,020
with it if you want.

188
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,550
And that goes for any project.

189
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,020
If you guys want to experiment with different values and do things a little differently, that's that's

190
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,920
absolutely fine.

191
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,390
In fact, I encourage that.

192
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,940
So let's say margin auto, we want to push it to the middle.

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,580
Overflow should be hidden and let's add the padding.

194
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,550
That's another thing that's going to push the content in.

195
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,560
So let's do zero, top and bottom and three ram left and right.

196
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,840
So if we if we save this, it's going to look like this for now.

197
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,010
Now, let's see, what should we do next?

198
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,080
Let's do the showcase.

199
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:34,710
So showcase and I'm going to do the background of the showcase as the primary color.

200
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:44,760
So we'll put in our variable variable of primary color and let's do color white and we'll set the height

201
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,860
to 100 viewport height.

202
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,610
So I want to take up the whole page and position relative.

203
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm doing position relative because we're going to use the before pseudo selector to add our overlay.

204
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,650
And the overlay has to be position absolute.

205
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:07,380
And remember the position absolute is relative to its first relative container, which of course we

206
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,880
want to be the showcase.

207
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,040
If not, it will use the, the body as the, as its container.

208
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,990
So that's good.

209
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,950
Let's save and just you can pretty much completely ignore this whole part because we're going to be

210
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,670
changing this.

211
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,650
It's not going to display at first.

212
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,440
We're going to add some CSS to hide it.

213
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,690
And then it's only going to show when we click the the the hamburger, which right now is a checkbox.

214
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:43,530
So let's go down here and say showcase before and remember if we use before or after, we need a content

215
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:51,360
value, but we're not actually inserting content, so we just put nothing and then the background URL.

216
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,800
So the URL is going to be dot, dot, slash, IMG slash showcase.

217
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,690
We want to do no repeat center, center slash cover as usual.

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,030
And then again, like I said before, we want to position this absolute.

219
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:22,140
We want it to start at the top zero and left zero corner and spin all the way across and all the way

220
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,220
up and down.

221
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,090
So if we save that, we get our image.

222
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,430
Now the image is covering everything.

223
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,910
So let's set the Z index to negative one and save.

224
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,540
And there we go.

225
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,990
So now the image is behind the coloring.

226
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,190
All right.

227
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,040
And the this is a little different than how we've done it before because we're using an GBA value.

228
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,730
And that is what this primary color right here.

229
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,640
If I change this to one and save, it's going to be solid.

230
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,590
So the transparency for the background image is controlled with this.

231
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,960
If I do like four or five, you'll see that it's lighter so you can change it to how you want.

232
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,700
And then the overlay is going to be the menu overlay transparency.

233
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,430
So there's really two levels of transparency.

234
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:24,830
So let's see, let's, let's make the showcase container a flexbox so that we can center everything.

235
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,530
So we'll say showcase showcase container.

236
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:40,640
We want to display flex and set the flex direction to column because we want this to go up and down

237
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,860
and we want to do all of our centering.

238
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,700
So align items center.

239
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:58,310
This should start to get drilled in your head, justify content center and text align center.

240
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,730
So that should put it in the middle.

241
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,260
Now it's not down here because I haven't added the height.

242
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:13,970
We have the height for, for the actual showcase which is 100 viewpoints, but the showcase container,

243
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,300
we need to set that to 100% of its parent.

244
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:24,829
So we'll set height to 100% and save and now that'll get pushed down.

245
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,710
All right, so let's see the h one.

246
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,770
I want to make that bigger.

247
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,430
So showcase h one.

248
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,180
Let's set the font size to let's do four rem.

249
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,040
I think I did three on the other one, but I think I think it should be a little bigger.

250
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,220
We should probably make the the paragraph a little bigger as well.

251
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,650
Showcase paragraph, font size.

252
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,930
We'll do 1.3 REM.

253
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,620
All right.

254
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,200
And then for the button, that will be the last thing.

255
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,480
Let's just do a class of BTN.

256
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:13,050
So the button I'm going to do our same rigamarole we've been doing.

257
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:21,600
We want to display as inline block and let's set the border to none and the background.

258
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,910
I'm actually going to use the primary color.

259
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,220
And let's do color white.

260
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,410
Let's do padding.

261
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,770
So for the padding will do 0.75 REM.

262
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,790
Top and bottom 1.5 REM, left and right.

263
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,820
And I just want to add a little margin, top of one REM, just to bring it down a little bit.

264
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,210
And let's add a transition so that when we hover over it, it will kind of smoothly transition into

265
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,050
the hover effect.

266
00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:00,350
So I'm going to say all 1/2 and we'll say ease, ease and out.

267
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,790
So save.

268
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,740
There we go.

269
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,420
And oh, the the underlying.

270
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,140
Let's get rid of that text decoration.

271
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,790
None.

272
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,490
All right.

273
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,250
So now we're going to do the hover state.

274
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,040
So button hover.

275
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,400
And since we're using a variable where it could be any color, I'm just going to use opacity as the

276
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,070
effect and we'll do 0.7.

277
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,210
So I'll save.

278
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,430
And then when I hover over it, you'll see that it changes and it does it nice and smooth because we

279
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,020
added the transition.

280
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,050
We could just do transition opacity.

281
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,370
We don't need to do all.

282
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,590
And there we go.

283
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:46,880
All right.

284
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,780
So that's going to be it for the this whole showcase area.

285
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,570
Everything we do from now on is going to be for the menu.

286
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,290
And there's a lot of CSS now.

287
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,780
Having something like this is really cool.

288
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,120
It looks really cool, but it is a lot of work.

289
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,330
There's a lot of CSS that goes into doing something like this.

290
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:05,960
All right.

291
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,420
So we're going to jump into and that's the reason I haven't created a hamburger menu on every project

292
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,510
we've done because it would just take up so much time.

293
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,590
But I did want to include it in the course, so I'll see you in the next video.
