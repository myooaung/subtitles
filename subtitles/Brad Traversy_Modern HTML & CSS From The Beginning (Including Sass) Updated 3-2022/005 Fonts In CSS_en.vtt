00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.840
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.320
In this video, we're going to look at fonts, specifically the font family property and font size property.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.140
So you might want to use different styles of fonts in different websites and different user interfaces.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.790
So we're going to take a look at how to do that.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.780
We're going to talk about website fonts and also how to use fonts from from other sources like Google

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.470
Fonts.

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.730
So let's create a new file here called zero three, underscore fonts dot HTML.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:37.410
And we're going to put our boilerplate in here and let's go down and just change the title to fonts

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.470
and let's put our style tags in here for our CSS.

10
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.780
And then I'm going to copy from the last file.

11
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.580
The selector is just the two divs that are in the HTML here, just so we can use them as a as as text

12
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.360
display.

13
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.700
So we're going to save this and then open with live server and let's make it a little bigger.

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.660
I'll hold control and hit the plus symbol and just make these a little bigger.

15
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.860
All right.

16
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.740
So in our style right here, let's add a selector for the body.

17
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.910
That's usually where you're going to add your font family, because then it affects your whole page,

18
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.210
right?

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.460
So the fonts on for your whole page.

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.710
So we want to use font family which takes in a font stack.

21
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.260
So basically a list of different fonts.

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.510
And in vsco we get this cool dropdown so of font stacks that we can choose from.

23
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.320
But before we get into that, I want to take a look at website fonts.

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.270
Now you have the ability to use pretty much any font that you want that you can get your hands on.

25
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.540
But if they're not these website fonts, then you're going to want to include them, include the actual

26
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.800
font files within your website, just like you would include a CSS file.

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.480
And you can also link to them remotely, which I'm going to show you how to do with Google Fonts.

28
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.340
But these right here, you don't need to do anything extra for because they're going to they're going

29
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.620
to be available in all all browsers that users are using to view your website with and notice that there's

30
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.199
some of these there's multiple fonts.

31
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.660
These are actually called font stacks.

32
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.650
For instance, this first one, Arial, Helvetica, sans Serif.

33
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.960
What's going to happen is it's going to look for the Ariel font to use if if it can't find that, it'll

34
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.550
move to use Helvetica.

35
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.270
If it can't find that, it'll use to use any sans serif font.

36
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.300
So basically you have sans serif and serif and these this is an example of what these look like.

37
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.870
So basically a serif font has these these edges, these points on the edge, and a sans serif font is

38
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.190
like a flat look.

39
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.540
For the most part.

40
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.070
You're probably going to want to use a sans serif font because they just they just look neater.

41
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.840
They also look much more modern.

42
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.110
And part of the reason for that is because times New Roman, which is a very serif font, is the default.

43
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.350
So when we don't add a font family, that's what's used.

44
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.410
Some of my favorite website fonts are Ariel.

45
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.290
I also like Verdana, I like Tahoma.

46
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.310
So let's jump back into VS Code and Chrome and by default, like I said, it's using sans serif.

47
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.810
You can see the kind of like the point, see the A right here.

48
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.530
So I want to change this to Arial now in vs code.

49
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.740
If I just type in a ario Arial Helvetica sans serif is actually an option.

50
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.750
So this is a font stack.

51
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.350
Like I said, it's going to look for Ariel then Helvetica sans serif.

52
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.750
If I save this, notice how it changes into a flatter looking font.

53
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.150
OC Let's try something else.

54
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.950
Let's try verdana.

55
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.260
So we'll just if I just put a V in there, it's going to verdana is going to pop up.

56
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.460
So we have Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma sans serif, save it.

57
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.670
It's a little different, but it's still a sans serif font.

58
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.040
So if you want to use something different, something that isn't in that list I showed you, then what

59
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.470
I would recommend is using Google fonts.

60
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.770
So I'm going to open up a new browser here.

61
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.580
And just make it bigger.

62
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.910
And let's head over to fonts dot Google dot com.

63
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.180
So here you can go over to search.

64
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.829
You can search for certain fonts.

65
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.420
You can browse them if you want.

66
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.210
You can see samples of them.

67
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.650
I like Roboto.

68
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.340
That's what I use quite a bit.

69
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.670
And you'll see it pops up over here.

70
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.800
There's Roboto, Roboto, condensed Roboto, mono slab.

71
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.150
So let's say we want to use this Roboto font.

72
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.110
We can click this plus sign right here and we get this little pop up.

73
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.210
And if I click on that, it shows us how we can bring this in to our HTML.

74
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.730
We can do it using a link tag, just like we do with just regular CSS files.

75
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.600
We can also import it into our CSS like this.

76
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.480
Usually I do import it, but since we're putting our CSS in the HTML file, I'm just going to use the

77
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.080
link.

78
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.900
So if we grab that and then it shows us how we can actually implement it, we can just add the font

79
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.170
family and then Roboto sans serif.

80
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.120
So let's go back.

81
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:24.400
Into VS code and let's open up our our other browser here and let's go right below the actually we'll

82
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.060
go right above the title and paste in that link.

83
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.050
So it links to fonts, Google APIs dot com slash CSS and then as a parameter, it has family equals

84
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.920
Roboto.

85
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:45.340
So now we should be able to go ahead and put in Roboto just like it said, and then sans serif.

86
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.680
And if I save it, there we go.

87
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.870
And that looks pretty, pretty nice and clean.

88
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.610
I really like the Roboto font, so that's how we can use basically non website fonts.

89
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.600
So next thing I want to look at is font size.

90
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.440
So let's say font size.

91
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.570
Now the standard is 16 pixels and that's actually on the HTML tag.

92
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.740
Okay.

93
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.310
The HTML tag by default has a font size of 16 pixels.

94
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.580
That's what you're seeing that we do have this zoomed in a little bit.

95
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.380
That's why it's bigger, actually.

96
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.210
Let's put it back to just let's put it back to just 100%.

97
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.040
So we're going to do control and then the minus and that's 110, that's 100.

98
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.300
So that's the default.

99
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.090
So let's change it to 18 pixels.

100
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.360
And for the most part, I usually leave it at 16, but just to show you, I'll change it to 18 and save

101
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.830
and I can see it's bigger.

102
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.160
Also, we can adjust the line height, which is basically the height of each line.

103
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:57.370
So let's say line, line, dash height and this is going to this is usually in M units, which is a

104
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.090
relative unit and I'm going to go over REM and M units later on.

105
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.850
So don't worry if you don't really understand this.

106
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:14.020
But a common a common value I like to use for the line height for the body is 1.6 M and we'll save and

107
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.040
notice how now there's more space in between each line.

108
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.590
So I think it makes it look a little cleaner.

109
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.140
Now I want to talk a little bit about units so pixels, M and so on.

110
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.410
Now looking at this list of CSS units, this one, which is absolute units and then we also have relative

111
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:32.740
units.

112
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.210
It may be a little overwhelming, but don't worry about it because we don't use most of these.

113
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.990
In fact, the only thing we're going to use on this page is pixels.

114
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.810
Pixels is the is the the common absolute unit that you're going to use.

115
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.870
You can use centimeters, you can use Mm.

116
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.230
Inches, you can set your font to one inch if you want.

117
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.240
But that's not something that you're probably going to do or you're going to use is pixels.

118
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.360
And the exact size size of one pixel is 196 of one inch.

119
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.190
There's also points.

120
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:13.090
Points may be familiar from something like Microsoft Word, and one point is 172 of one inch.

121
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.840
You may run into points, but for the most part you're going to see pixels.

122
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.440
You also have pikas, which it's actually equal to 12 points.

123
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.210
You're not going to really see that.

124
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.530
Now, there's also something called relative units, which I'm going to get into later.

125
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:31.390
I'm not going to really focus on this right now, but for instance, you have percentage.

126
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.870
You can set it to percentage of a parent element.

127
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.360
And by the way, this doesn't have to be just font size.

128
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.400
This could be for margin padding line height, what else?

129
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.530
Width, height, all that stuff.

130
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.930
So you also have M in REM units.

131
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.350
M is basically it's a multiplier.

132
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:57.850
So whatever the size of your parent element, let's say the parent div to a paragraph is, is 16 pixels

133
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:03.160
and you set it, set it to one m, that's going to be equal to 16 pixels.

134
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:12.070
If you set it to 1.2 M, that will be equal to 16 pixels times 1.2 REM units act the same way, except

135
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:18.790
instead of the parent element, they use the root HTML element, which by default is 16 pixels.

136
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:24.250
So if you set it to one REM by default, it'll be set to 16 pixels.

137
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.800
And if this is confusing the crap body, you don't worry.

138
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.660
We're going to get into this stuff later.

139
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.130
I'm not even going to bother going over viewport width and viewport height right now.

140
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:33.910
All right.

141
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:41.050
So let's head back into VS code and I'm actually going to put the font family back to Ariel or Arial,

142
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.730
Helvetica Sans Serif.

143
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.830
And I just want to show you a couple more font properties.

144
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.920
So I want to look at font weight and font style, which are very simple.

145
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.770
They're basically used to make some text bold or make text italic.

146
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.830
So I'm going to add a span in here.

147
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.120
So let's say span, I'm going to take the ending tag here.

148
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.760
Control C, copy it, delete it and then.

149
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.480
Put that there and also put a span down here.

150
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.430
Do span.

151
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.730
And we'll take the ending tag.

152
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.950
Put that down here.

153
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.090
All right, so let's save that.

154
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:27.070
Let's go up here and I want to show you how to target these spans.

155
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:32.040
So for this one here, we can say we want to go into the welcome div.

156
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.380
So the DIV has the idea of welcome and then we want to go into the paragraph and then we want to go

157
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.430
into that span.

158
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.880
So that's how we can target this first span right here.

159
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.550
Now, technically, we don't even need the paragraph because it's still going to look into this div

160
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.550
with the idea of welcome and then onto the span.

161
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:56.700
But I think it's more organized to keep the paragraph in there just as an extra step.

162
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:06.720
And let's say we want to make the font weight bold and notice that this this code gives us the selections

163
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.650
which we could use numbers to make them more or less bold.

164
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:17.400
But we're just going to choose bold and save and notice how now the span, the text that's within the

165
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.690
span is bold.

166
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.880
So just like the strong tag, we can set it to bold through CSS.

167
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:35.430
So let's target this this span down here by saying we want the about div paragraph span and we're going

168
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:41.790
to set the font style to italic and save.

169
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.110
And now you can see it.

170
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.530
It's very faint, but this text is now italic.

171
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.070
So these are the font based properties.

172
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.130
In the next video I want to start to get into colors.

173
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.270
And you saw that I used, for instance, the color name like red and green.

174
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:04.710
I also use this word, this number sign and then some some letters that's actually called hexadecimal.

175
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.480
We also have something called GBE.

176
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.650
So I want to look at colors and the different types that we can use in CSS.
