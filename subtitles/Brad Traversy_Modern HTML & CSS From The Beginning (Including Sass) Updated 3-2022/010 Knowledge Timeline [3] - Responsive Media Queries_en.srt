1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,630
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,830
In the last video, we went ahead and dealt with the boxes.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,230
We created these boxes with these arrows.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,430
But this is not.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,030
Whoops.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,580
This is not responsive.

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,440
You can see that it's just the same no matter what the screen size is.

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,300
So I want to add a couple of media queries.

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,880
So in the CSV file, let's go down here and let's say media and this is going to be a max width of 900

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,750
pixels.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:36,300
So basically when it's when it's less 900 pixels or less, I want the width of the boxes to change from

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,910
400 to 250 pixels wide.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:50,010
So we're going to say timeline ul ly div and let's set the width to 250 pixels, which were originally

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,870
400.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,800
So now when I hit 900, which is right here, they change.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,880
Now we have an issue with the left side where it's too far out.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,090
So we can fix that really easily by just taking the let's see.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:16,770
Ly We want to do nth child and we want to grab the even which is the left side and grab that div and

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,940
then just move it over.

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:27,360
So we'll say from the left we want to do -284 pixels and save and that brings it over.

21
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:27,960
All right.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,520
Now, when you're creating this stuff from scratch, you're going to be you're going to be experimenting

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,240
a lot.

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,760
You're not going to know these values right away.

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,890
So you won't going to be experimenting when it comes to like the border and making these arrows.

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,140
It took me a while to to figure out exactly what values to use.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,550
So just keep that in mind.

28
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,990
It's not it's not always going to go as smooth as you see in courses, in tutorials.

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,920
All right.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,400
Now, that is if it's under 900.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,630
Now, if we get to like right here, it's still it's not it doesn't look good.

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,470
And what I want to do is move them all to the to the right side.

33
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,750
And I want this line, basically the list item to be on the side here.

34
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:19,980
So let's add another media query and let's say max width, let's make it let's do 600 pixels.

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:30,330
So basically smartphones and we're going to take the timeline ul ly and this is set to margin auto on

36
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,110
the left and right.

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:39,480
If we go up here and we look at the ly, we have auto for left and right, but i don't want it in the

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,110
middle anymore.

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,520
I want it on the side.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,990
So I'm just going to simply set the margin left to 20 pixels and save.

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
And that does nothing.

42
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,290
It's because I'm not 600 yet.

43
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,520
So if we go, there we go.

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:03,000
So at 600, you can see that the the line gets pushed over to the left and it's margin left 20.

45
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,650
We don't want to do zero because it'll be right up against the edge.

46
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,270
So margin left 20.

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,640
And if you're confused of why that happened, again, it's because we had margin auto, which puts it

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,390
in the middle.

49
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,480
Now we changed margin left to 20 pixels, which makes it no longer margin auto.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,100
So let's move on to the width of the boxes.

51
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,290
And I know that you can't see the the other side, the left side boxes.

52
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,400
We're going to fix that.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,210
But I want the width to actually be a calculation, meaning I want it to, to be dynamic.

54
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:46,220
So let's say timeline ul ly div and let's set the width.

55
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:53,000
Instead of using just a fixed number, I'm going to use the CSS calc calc function here and we can say

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,250
we want to take 100 viewport widths.

57
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,740
So basically the whole viewport width, regardless of how big the browser is sized or the device is

58
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:07,430
sized, and we just want to take away 90 pixels from it and let's save.

59
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,060
So now you can see that these just ignore this for now, but these ones perfectly fit in there.

60
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,730
And if I make the smaller they adjust.

61
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:17,910
Okay.

62
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,540
So we're just taking the viewport width, meaning the whole thing, and we're taking away 90 pixels

63
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:32,210
because if we were to do just 100 viewport width and save, you'll see that it actually goes off the

64
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,380
page like that.

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,700
That doesn't look right.

66
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,190
So we're just taking 90 pixels away.

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Now we want to move these boxes over to the right.

68
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,910
We want these all in line.

69
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,040
So to do that, let's take Timeline ul Lee.

70
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,720
We want to grab the ones in the left.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,530
So oops.

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,200
I want to do ly and.

73
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:06,900
Child and we want the even divs and I'm going to say from the left 40 pixels and save.

74
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,960
Now we're just about there but the arrows on the the ones that were on the left, the arrows are still

75
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,670
facing on the right side.

76
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:21,260
So we simply need to move them to this side, which we can copy this whole thing right here, the right

77
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,160
side arrows, because these are pointing this way and paste that in here and just change this to even

78
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,630
and save.

79
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,520
And now they're all facing that way.

80
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,060
All right.

81
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,520
So now it's completely responsive.

82
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,250
Hit 900 pixels, they get smaller, gets 600 pixels, and they adapt.

83
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,870
They all go to the right side.

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,530
All right.

85
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,340
So that's it.

86
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,290
In the next video, we're going to show you how we can implement a little bit of JavaScript to have

87
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,080
a little bit of animation on the scroll.
