1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,540
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,910
So in the last video, we created our boat page and we added the page container, which is going to

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,670
be the grid that we use for all inner pages.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,020
Now, the article of HTML is going to be pretty similar.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,240
We're going to add like a couple of extra things in the main article, but the layout will be the same

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,990
basically.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,620
So I'm going to copy the about HTML content and go to article HTML and paste that in.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,730
All right.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,500
And then we'll go up to the top here.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,290
Let's change the title.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:39,030
We'll just say for the title, we'll just say latest news.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,680
I guess it doesn't really matter.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,430
And then we want to remove the current from the boat.

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,930
So we're not going to have a class of current because the article page is not in the menu.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,480
And then for the section, let's give it an idea of article like that.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,810
And we're going to keep the page container.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,810
We're going to keep the the article tag here.

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:09,820
And let's see for the h101 thing we didn't do is is add the WL heading, so let's do that real quick.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,160
So that's obviously a utility class.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,540
So let's put it.

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,500
We'll put it right under the padding here.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:29,410
So let's say class ll heading and I believe I did font size three REM.

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,100
Let's see what that looks like.

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,440
All right.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,670
Yeah.

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,190
Good.

27
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,200
So for the article, we have our heading, which I'm going to change.

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,120
I'm just going to do lorem five for the title, and underneath the h one, we're going to have some

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,930
metadata.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,430
So an article or a blog post, usually we'll have things like the author, the date, stuff like that.

31
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,400
So we're going to create a class a div with the class of meta and inside meta.

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,560
I'm going to put a small tag.

33
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,470
I don't I don't know if we went over small tags.

34
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:12,550
It basically it's in it's an inline element that will make the text smaller by default.

35
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,970
I forget what the percentage is, but it makes it a little smaller.

36
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,470
And then in here I'm going to I'm going to put an icon of a user.

37
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,880
Just make sure we use font.

38
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,080
Awesome up here.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,110
Yes, we did.

40
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:31,510
So let's say I with the class of face dot f a dash user.

41
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,930
And the reason I want this icon is because I'm putting the author's name.

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:42,130
So it's just a little icon next to the author name we're going to say written, let's say written by

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,450
John Doe.

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:54,490
And then we'll just put the date and we'll just say like January, January 12, 2019.

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,770
So that's in the small tag.

46
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,470
And then we want to have a div with the class of category because we want to put the category here as

47
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,010
well.

48
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,800
And this is we're going to say an entertainment article.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:14,440
So we have a class of category in T and let's say entertainment.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,520
And then let's see under that we can just keep the same text.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,250
But one thing that we do need is an image.

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,850
So I'm going to put the image above the H one actually.

53
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:37,090
So we'll do image, let's point to image slash articles and we'll use end one since this is an entertainment

54
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,910
article and that should be good.

55
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,050
Let's see, let's save it and let's see what it looks like.

56
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,360
So if I go to the home page, I have all of these pointing to Article HTML and that's what it's going

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,840
to look like.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,970
And we're going to style this meta a little bit.

59
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:59,380
But I also want to add an extra box on the side here or right here up above, which will be a list of

60
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,600
categories.

61
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:07,720
So let's scroll down here to where we have our aside, which is the join our club and I'm going to change

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,920
the color for this page.

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,360
We'll say secondary.

64
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,270
That's what's good about having these utility classes.

65
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,959
You can easily change things around the site and then you have variables in the CSS file, which makes

66
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,820
it easy to change the values.

67
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,820
Now I'm going to go right above this and let's create another side.

68
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:35,500
And this aside is also going to it's going to have an ID of categories, but let's give it a class of

69
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,100
card and we'll put an H two in here and we'll say categories.

70
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,660
And under the H two we'll have a UL and we're going to use our list class and we'll do an ally and let's

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,580
just put a link that goes nowhere.

72
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,030
And we're going to have this we're going to put little Chevron icons next to each one.

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,960
So let's use font.

74
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,170
Awesome here we'll do I dot face and the icon is F a dash.

75
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,540
Chevron dash.

76
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,470
Right.

77
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:21,320
Like that, and then let's put a space after it and then we'll put sports and then I'm going to grab

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,940
this and just copy it down.

79
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,830
Let's do one, two, three, four more and we'll change this one.

80
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,100
Let's see.

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,300
We have sports,

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,980
entertainment.

83
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,660
Let's do technology.

84
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,600
Fashion and shopping, it doesn't matter.

85
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,940
So we'll save that.

86
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,650
And there we go.

87
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,210
It automatically gets put in the sidebar.

88
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,580
So the grid is pretty powerful.

89
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,060
You know, we just add display grid, add a couple grid template columns, maybe some spans.

90
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,640
And we have our layout for all of our inner pages without having to do floats or anything like that.

91
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,110
Now I just want to style this, this meta area because it doesn't look very good.

92
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,250
It's very squished together.

93
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,550
I just.

94
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,050
And I also want to give it like some some a look of texture.

95
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,540
So we'll add a background color to it as well.

96
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:25,250
So let's go into our style sheet here and let's go down.

97
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,990
We're targeting something that's on a specific page now.

98
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:40,910
So I'm going to go under home articles right above the footer and let's say the ID of article

99
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,920
and then we want the class of meta.

100
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,050
So I'm actually going to use Flex for this.

101
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,010
This is this is definitely something that you would use flex for.

102
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,860
And you can see the difference between using grid and flex.

103
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,990
Like the grid is good for this type of thing.

104
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,980
This, this the layout of all the boxes and stuff.

105
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:09,010
And then flex is good for inner elements aligning stuff like this or menus and you know, just more

106
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,980
simple stuff that's, that's one dimensional.

107
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,750
So let's say display flex and you could use the grid for this, but I think it's it's stupid to use

108
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,800
the grid for this.

109
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,750
And then we're going to let's let's justify our content.

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,980
And we want to we want to do space between I want I want the category to be over to the right.

111
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,470
Because if we look at the markup in the meta, we have this is now a flex box, right?

112
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,070
And then the small tag is going to be one flex item.

113
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,040
This is another and we want space in between the two.

114
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,020
So it pushes the category over.

115
00:07:51,220 --> 00:08:00,550
And then let's do a actually let's do a line items center as well and then we'll do a background.

116
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm going to do a background of triple E and just add some padding.

117
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,480
So 0.5 RAM and let's save that.

118
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,440
Take a look.

119
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,130
Good.

120
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,810
Now this even though we align center this this category, I want to push it down just a little bit.

121
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:34,000
So let's do article dot meta category and say margin top.

122
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,419
Let's do 0.4 REM.

123
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,240
And that just pushes it down a little bit into the middle.

124
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,940
So I think that's it, guys.

125
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,540
Our site is complete except for the responsiveness of it.

126
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,780
If I if we bring this down to mobile size, you'll see that things things don't look very well.

127
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,900
So we're going to have to just add some media queries and make this look good.

128
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,200
All right.

129
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,270
So we'll start doing that in the next video.
