1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,840
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,990
So now we're going to start on the markup for the showcase area where the navigation, the header,

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,870
all that stuff, and we're going to also style it.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,540
But before we get started with that, I just want to mention I'm using the prettier extension for VS

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,110
code.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,140
So if I have something that's out of line like put this link way over here and I save it, fixes it

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,570
automatically because in my settings I have it set to format on save.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,420
So if you want this extension, you can just click on the extensions here and just search for prettier.

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,020
And it's this one right here.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,680
So prettier code formatter and if you install it and you want it to format on save like mine is, then

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,330
you just want to go to your settings.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,270
So if you click on the little cog down here and go to settings or you do control comma or command comma

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,120
and just search for format on save and it's right here.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,720
You want this box checked if you want that functionality.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,910
And I just want to mention it because you might see at times when I save, it'll kind of change up a

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,300
little bit.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,560
And that's why it's just it's not changing any of the code or anything.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,560
It's just formatting it in a more readable way.

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,900
So let's get started down here in the body.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,620
So I'm going to get rid of the H one and we're going to go ahead and and create the header.

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:32,100
So everything we do right now is going to be wrapped in a header tag and I'm going to give it an ID

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,590
of header dash home.

23
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,480
Now the reason I'm doing a header home is because the home page and the inner pages are very different

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,520
in terms of the header and the menu.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,340
So the inner pages are actually going to have an ID of header inner and we're going to style them differently.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,060
All right.

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,010
And then inside here, I'm going to put a class of container, which is a utility class that we'll use

28
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,290
over and over to just center content.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,070
And then let's put our NAV and I'm going to give this an ID of main dash nav.

30
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,190
And then some of these in some cases, if you want to use class, that's fine.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm basically using ID for things that are just for that single element and then classes more for utilities.

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:22,140
We're actually going to create a utilities CSS file where we'll put like the container buttons, backgrounds,

33
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,350
things like that, anything that's basically a utility.

34
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,660
So in here, let's put the logo.

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,830
So I'm going to do an image with the ID of logo and the source is going to be in the image folder and

36
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,480
then the logo tag.

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,900
And again, I did include the PSD if you want to edit it and change the initials or anything like that

38
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,450
for alts, we'll just say, I don't know my portfolio.

39
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,800
So let's see, under the image we're going to put the UL, which is going to have the links.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,040
So we'll do a list item, let's do an A actually, I'm going to give this a class of current since this

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,540
is the index page, this is going to go to index HTML and we'll say home and then let's copy this down

42
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,320
four times and then we're going to have the about and I'm just going to highlight this class current

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:23,700
and hit control DX twice and then get rid of it so about is going to go to about HTML.

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,610
We also have work html.

45
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,830
So work and let's do contact.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,690
And contact.

47
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,440
HTML.

48
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,950
So those are our links now under the nav.

49
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,050
We're going to put let's do our header content.

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,480
So I'm going to give this a class of header

51
00:03:49,610 --> 00:04:03,800
dash content and we're going to have an H one and say, I am, let's do caps, I am John V and then

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,620
this is where the type text is going to come in.

53
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,200
So JavaScript is going to be used for that.

54
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,140
And again, I'm not going to really go over the JavaScript code.

55
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,530
I do.

56
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,860
Like I said, the tutorial is on YouTube.

57
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,390
However, we need to put in our span here because this is what the JavaScript is going to grab on to,

58
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,090
to insert that text, that type text.

59
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:32,150
So I'm going to give this a class of text, dash type, and we're going to give this some special data

60
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,050
attributes that the JavaScript can basically grab and read from.

61
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,550
So we want a data dash weight and I'm going to set that to 3000.

62
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,340
So that's basically the time it's going to take in milliseconds after it types, photographer or whatever

63
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,920
we put and then types the next thing.

64
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,690
And then it's also going to take in data dash words and I'm going to use single quotes here because

65
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,520
this is going to take in some brackets and then any word that we want in the type effect is going to

66
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,900
go in double quotes.

67
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,600
So I'm going to say photographer.

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,510
Let's put a comma and then we'll do designer.

69
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:21,110
If you remake this for your own portfolio, obviously you can change these and then UI dash UX dev.

70
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,930
So the JavaScript is going to grab on to those and and add that type effect.

71
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,650
So under the H one, let's add a paragraph.

72
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,110
I'm going to give it a class of lead, which is going to be utility class just to make the font size

73
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,940
a little bigger.

74
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,360
And let's say.

75
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:54,210
Um, I specialize in graphic design, UI, UX and photography.

76
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,930
And then the last thing we want in here is an a tag with the class of BTN Dash Lite.

77
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,850
It's going to be formatted as a button and it's going to go to the work HTML page.

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,730
And as far as the text goes, we'll just say, view my work.

79
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,090
All right, so I'll save and you can see prettier.

80
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,420
Just kind of made things look a little more readable.

81
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,270
It put all these attributes on separate lines.

82
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,980
So now let's take a look and notice that it's just white because we actually set the body text to be

83
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,700
white.

84
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:36,060
So the next thing we're going to work on is the CSS or the SASS, and we're going to add that big background

85
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,680
image so that we can actually see the text.

86
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,220
So let's jump in to main access.

87
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:53,730
And we have the header home, the header dash home, and then the inner pages are going to have header

88
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,740
dash inner.

89
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,130
So what I'm going to do is let's say header and we'll do ID header.

90
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,750
Now there isn't going to be an actual ID of header, there's header home and header inner.

91
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:16,590
So in here I'm going to use ampersand dash home and then we'll do ampersand dash inner.

92
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,270
So anything for header home will go in here and then enter will go down below.

93
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:30,240
So for header home, let's do background and we're going to set that to our variable.

94
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,790
Remember we have a variable of BG image which holds the location of the background image and then we'll

95
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,260
do no repeat.

96
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm going to do center and I'm going to position it right.

97
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,030
So center right.

98
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,180
And then we want it to cover the entire area.

99
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,750
And as far as the height goes, we're going to take up the whole page.

100
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:55,200
So we're going to do 100 viewport heights and then let's just make sure the colour is white.

101
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,340
All right.

102
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,900
So if we go ahead and save that and we go back now, we can see the image.

103
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,970
Now let's work on this logo because obviously it's it's giant.

104
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:15,760
So the logo and the nav bar, while we're at it, let's take a look there inside the header home.

105
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,400
Right.

106
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,990
However, we're also going to be using the nav bar and the logo inside header inner.

107
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,640
So we don't want to embed it inside either of these or in header because there is no idea of header.

108
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,260
So I'm going to put that outside of it.

109
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,380
So right here, let's do logo and we'll do main nav.

110
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:49,750
So for the logo, let's do let's do a width of 70 pixels.

111
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,630
I should probably put the selector.

112
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:02,710
Let's see it's an ID so logo width, 70 pixels and let's do a height of 70 pixels.

113
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:10,420
Now you may not want to use an image, you may want to use text or like an H one with an idea of logo.

114
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:17,590
So I'm also going to add a colour of white and I'm also going to make it uppercase.

115
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,770
So text transform uppercase just in case it's not an image.

116
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,200
So if we save that, we take a look.

117
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,530
Now the logo is smaller, we can see the rest of the content.

118
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,350
Now, before we move on to the main NAV, let's center this with the container class.

119
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,370
Remember, it's there.

120
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,500
This stuff is wrapped in a container.

121
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:46,630
Now, like I said, I'm going to create a utilities sass file that we can are a partial for things like

122
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,370
buttons and stuff like that.

123
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:56,890
So let's create a new file in the case folder called Underscore Utilities, Dot CCS.

124
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,930
And in here I'm going to put our container class.

125
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,170
Now we have a variable called website width that we have in the config folder.

126
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:15,130
So let's set the max width to a variable of website width.

127
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,500
Right.

128
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,200
And then I'm just going to add some padding on the side.

129
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:28,170
So let's do 1.5 REM and then let's do margin auto to push it to the middle and then overflow hidden

130
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,570
so nothing goes out of its container.

131
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,010
And now we need to bring this utilities file in.

132
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:44,430
So up at the top here after config, we're going to bring in utilities and let's save that.

133
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,210
And if we go back now, you can see everything is pushed to the middle.

134
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,230
So let's continue working on the main NAV, which is basically the logo and the list here.

135
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,920
So let's go back down.

136
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,410
And let's see.

137
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,550
Main nav.

138
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:15,600
Let's put an ID of main main dash nav and we can embed the UL, the ly or I should say nest.

139
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,660
We can nest the ul ly the link stuff like that.

140
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,970
Now the whole main nav, including the logo and everything.

141
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,430
I'm actually going to set this to display flex as I usually would.

142
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,710
I wouldn't use the grid for something like this.

143
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:36,730
And then I'm going to justify content with space between because I want the logo on one side and then

144
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,300
the UL on the other side and let's just do a padding top just to kind of push everything down a little

145
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,810
bit.

146
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,110
We'll do one REM.

147
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,830
And then we can embed in here the UL, which is also going to be Display Flex because we want the list

148
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,290
items inside to be flex items.

149
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,390
So let's do that.

150
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,750
Let's do lye.

151
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:06,500
And what's nice is we can we can nest all this stuff within the main nav, just like we do in the HTML.

152
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,830
So I'm just going to add a little bit of padding here.

153
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:18,770
So let's do one REM and then 1.5 on the sides and then the link.

154
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:20,600
Okay.

155
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,770
So, Link, I know I did a global text declaration.

156
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,050
None, but I'm going to do it again here.

157
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,790
Same thing with the color.

158
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,780
Let's do white and I want it to be all uppercase.

159
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:41,050
So I'm going to do text transform to uppercase and I'm going to do a border bottom.

160
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,860
And this might seem a little weird, but I'm going to do three pixels transparent, solid.

161
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,760
Now, the reason I'm doing transparent is because I want to have a hover effect.

162
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,220
When we hover over it, it gets a line under it.

163
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,800
But if I don't put a border here and I just do it on the hover, it's going to basically push the text

164
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,690
upwards to give it the border.

165
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,310
And I don't want that kind of effect.

166
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,440
I just want the border to just show up.

167
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,680
So we want to make it transparent at first.

168
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:17,860
And then I'm also going to add some padding bottom that's 20.5 REM.

169
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,650
And then I'm also going to add a transition.

170
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,780
So it kind of has a smooth effect.

171
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,030
So we want to transition the border color because that's what's going to change on the hover.

172
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:35,410
So we'll say border color, 0.5 seconds now I want the hover.

173
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:45,940
So inside this a tag or this a selector, I should say I can do ampersand dot, I mean colon hover.

174
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:55,810
So this will be the hover effect and I'm going to set the border color to the variable medium dash color

175
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,200
so that we define that already in our config.

176
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,510
Now I also want the current link to have a border as well.

177
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:12,100
So I'm going to do Ampersand Class Current, which will be a dot current in the NAV.

178
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:20,440
And I'm going to set the border color and let's set that to what do they call it?

179
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,490
Main color.

180
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,430
So we'll call.

181
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,270
We'll do main dash color.

182
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,770
All right.

183
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,010
So let's save that and we'll take a look.

184
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,120
So it looks pretty good.

185
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,310
So this is this whole thing is the main nav.

186
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,750
It's Flexbox.

187
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,650
And we have space between for the main nav.

188
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:51,060
And then the UL is also a Flexbox where each list item is a flex item and you can see the border.

189
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,840
And now when I hover over it, it just kind of fades in.

190
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,480
If I didn't do the transparent border to begin with, it would just kind of tick up when I hover over

191
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,620
it and I don't want that.

192
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,000
All right.

193
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
So that looks pretty good.

194
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:11,820
So let's see, let's move on to the the header content so that basically this stuff right here and then

195
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,040
we'll bring in our JavaScript file as well.

196
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,210
So let's see, let's go down to header.

197
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,130
And we want to be.

198
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's see.

199
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,190
We want to be within the header home.

200
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:35,090
So inside here, let's say header content sometimes helps just to comment this stuff.

201
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,870
Header home.

202
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:46,560
All right.

203
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,130
So head of content.

204
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,370
It is a class of header dash content.

205
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,340
Let's align everything to the center.

206
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:06,870
So text align center and let's I'm going to add a padding top of 20% and then I'm going to take the

207
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,800
H one that's inside the header content so we can nest it like this.

208
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,620
And I'm going to set the font size to be pretty big.

209
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:20,310
I'm going to do four REM and I'm going to give it a line height of 1.2.

210
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:20,850
All right.

211
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,770
So let's take a look at that.

212
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:30,150
Now, this right here has a class of BTN lite, which is going to be a utility.

213
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,960
So let's take care of that while we're at it.

214
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:43,470
So we're going to go into utilities and I showed you this in the last section, how to basically extend

215
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,600
a selector or extend styles.

216
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,140
So I'm going to just do buttons and we're going to create like a, like a base shared button style.

217
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,690
So I'm going to use a percent sign and say BTN dash, dash shared.

218
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,350
So all buttons will share these styles.

219
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:11,220
They're going to be display inline, inline block and let's do some padding.

220
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:20,520
So 0.8 REM and let's do two REM and then I want them all to transition on hover.

221
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,940
So let's say transition and I'm just going to do all 0.5 seconds.

222
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,750
We're going to set the border to none.

223
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:40,110
And let's set the cursor to a pointer because this is for both buttons and links.

224
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,520
Now.

225
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:54,920
Down here, we're going to have BTN and I want to add a couple of different options here.

226
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,010
So we'll have button, main button light and button dark.

227
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,530
So let's do ampersand dash main.

228
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,320
So this will pertain to a class of button Dash Main and we want to extend

229
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,390
the shared button class or style.

230
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,850
So we want to do percent BTN shared, so we want to extend all that stuff above.

231
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:27,200
And then the color for right now I'm just going to set it to set it to a dark color.

232
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,960
But later on we're actually going to use that set text color function that I showed you guys in the

233
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,950
last section.

234
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:43,310
So let's do background color, which is going to be the main color so that for right now it's that yellow.

235
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,160
But of course, you can change that within the config.

236
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,370
All right.

237
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,560
And then I'll just grab this.

238
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,990
Copy this down twice, and let's make this one the light.

239
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,710
So this will be button dash light.

240
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,400
We're going to extend everything.

241
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,670
We'll keep the dark color here and then the background is going to be the light color.

242
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,590
All right.

243
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,060
And then down here.

244
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,630
Let's do dark

245
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,260
shared button.

246
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:23,760
We'll put the light color here and then the background is going to be the dark color.

247
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:34,680
Now, as far as the hover, I actually want any any of these buttons to when you hover over it to have

248
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,260
the main color as the background.

249
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,250
All right.

250
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:46,950
So the way I'm going to do this is let's go outside of this BTN and we're going to say so four button

251
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,250
and then in here we can actually do like class.

252
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,450
We could do class equals something.

253
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,930
However, I want to only include part of it.

254
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:02,370
Anything that has the BTN dash inside the class I want to grab on to so we can put a carrot character

255
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:12,270
here, which is shifts shift and then number six and then equals and we'll set this to just a BTN dash

256
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,390
and then we want colon hover.

257
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:24,270
So any class, any button with the class of BTN dash, anything this will this will be in effect for

258
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,720
now.

259
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,600
We also want links with the same thing.

260
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,900
So I'm just going to copy this and we'll do an a tag with that stuff.

261
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,340
Let's also do if it's an input with the class.

262
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,670
So yeah, we'll do input.

263
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:52,980
K So any of these, if they're hover, then let's make the background color main colour.

264
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,310
So it just saves us some room here.

265
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,650
Now I'm going to add a couple other utility classes.

266
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,130
We, we already use the lead class, so we want to definitely put that in.

267
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,730
So lead is just going to have a font size of 1.3 REM.

268
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,330
And let's add a little bit of margin bottom as well.

269
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,890
So we'll do two REM.

270
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,440
And then I also want to have a text center just to center something if we want.

271
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,060
So we're just going to set text align to center.

272
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,340
All right.

273
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,880
So let's save that and let's go back and take a look.

274
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,470
And you can see we have our button.

275
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,900
And when we hover over it, we get that that main color, it happens to be yellow, but we could easily

276
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,600
change it in the config to be any color.

277
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
And this would change this color up here with change.

278
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,470
All right.

279
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,010
So the last thing I want to do in this video is this part here.

280
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,480
I want to add the JavaScript script so that this actually works.

281
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,630
And again, I'm not going to go over the actual JavaScript code.

282
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,670
If you want, you can check the tutorial out.

283
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,810
In fact, what I'll do is I'll put a comment in.

284
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:09,870
Let's see, let's go to the index HTML down at the bottom here and I'm going to paste in a comment to

285
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,370
the actual tutorial.

286
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,970
So we'll say type effect tutorial and then let's just include the script.

287
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:26,340
So we want to do source to JS slash typewriter JS, save it, go back and it works.

288
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:35,250
So the script, the way that it works is it just looks at or is it the span looks at this right here,

289
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,650
looks at the wait time, it looks at the different words.

290
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,190
If you want to change up the words, you can just simply change them right here.

291
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,720
All right.

292
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,240
So I think we're good for now.

293
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,990
In the next video, we're going to move on to the next part, which will be what the developer specializes

294
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,750
in, the different icons, stuff like that, the creative process with the transitions.

295
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,030
So we will get into that next.
