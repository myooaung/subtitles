00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.510
So in the last video, we created our hamburger menu.

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.400
Here we have the checkbox.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.810
We can actually check and uncheck, but we can't really visually see that right now.

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.570
What I do want to happen is when we check, I want the I want the lines here to turn into an X.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
So we're going to be utilizing, transform and rotate.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:28.560
So let's go down here in menu axis and let's say toddler animation.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.560
So basically we want to take our toddler, which is our check box and we can target the state of checked.

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
So this style will only be in effect when it's actually checked.

10
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.800
Now I want to manipulate the div inside the hamburger, which is the lines, right.

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.790
So we're going to say plus, remember, we looked at the plus selector a little while ago and we want

12
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.810
to choose the hamburger class and then the direct div.

13
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.500
And that's what we want to transform.

14
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:16.350
So we're going to say transform and we want to rotate and let's rotate 135 degrees and save.

15
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
And now if I click this, you'll see that it rotates 135 degrees.

16
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.920
And obviously that's not all we want to happen.

17
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.880
We want this to turn into an X so we have to target the before and after as well.

18
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.170
So let's actually copy this

19
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.860
and.

20
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.530
Let's do a column before and then comma and I'm going to paste this in again and we're going to do after

21
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.610
as well.

22
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.930
And let's set this to be from the top zero.

23
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.970
And then we want to add a transform for these of 90 degrees.

24
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:08.889
So what we want transform, rotate, and we want to rotate these 90 degrees and we'll go ahead and save

25
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.910
and click.

26
00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.650
And it's doing exactly what we want it to do, except it's not transitioning.

27
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.810
And the reason for that is I actually forgot to put transition on the the hamburger div.

28
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:32.530
So up here we want to add in transition and we'll say all and let's say 0.4 seconds and we'll ease.

29
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.060
So let's save that.

30
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.230
Now when we click it, it actually spins and has a transition.

31
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:51.340
Now I just want to put a comment in here and we'll just say that this turns lines into X again, just

32
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.170
so you know what does what this one right here moves line down.

33
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.020
And another thing that I want is when it's checked like that, right now, the inputs checked.

34
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.370
That's how this is happening.

35
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.530
When it's checked, if I hover over this, I want it to kind of just spin back.

36
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.800
And if I'm off, I'm on it.

37
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.140
And then if I go off, spin back again.

38
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:29.260
So we can go down here and let's just say rotate, rotate on, hover when checked.

39
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.300
So we're going to target.

40
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:44.730
Menu or cheeses I can't type menu wrap and then toddler and we're going to say when it's checked when

41
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:57.360
we hover then we want the hamburger div so whoops, we want to do class hamburger div.

42
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.850
We want that to rotate.

43
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:09.270
So we'll say transform and let's say rotate and let's rotate it 2 to 5 degrees.

44
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.020
All right.

45
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.640
So now if I check it.

46
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.640
It's checked right now.

47
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.079
And if I hover over it, it will rotate 225 degrees.

48
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.279
Close it up.

49
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.560
So this is this is giving us the exact effect that we want.

50
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.390
So now what we want to do is move on to the menu itself.

51
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.900
These links here, we want those to.

52
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.820
We don't want those to be visible at first.

53
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.680
And then when we click this, we want those to show up and we want to add that overlay in that style.

54
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.960
So that's what we're going to get to in the next video.
