00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.330
Okay.

2
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.350
So now we want to give this the effect where it's the nav bar is transparent.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.870
When we scroll down, then we get the background.

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.930
So what we'll do here is in our HTML, we're going to start off with the class of nav bar and top because

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.300
it's going to be transparent at the top, right?

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.360
So we'll go into our style and let's say class nav bar and if it has a class of top, then we're going

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.920
to set the background.

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.010
We're going to set the background to Transparent.

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.030
So if I save that and we go now we have a transparent background now it's going to stay transparent,

10
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.840
which we don't want.

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.820
We can't even see it if it goes over white, white background.

12
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.650
So we need to add a little bit of JavaScript.

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.920
So I'm going to put it right in the index HTML down at the bottom here.

14
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.400
So let's go.

15
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.930
It's right below the footer, right above the body tag and let's put in script tags.

16
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.650
So I'm not going to explain, explain this front to back because this is not a JavaScript course.

17
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.100
You guys can just copy this if you want, but I'll explain it briefly.

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.890
So I'm going to grab the nav bar and put it into a JavaScript variable called NAV Bar.

19
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.500
And we do that with document dot get element by DX and that nav bar div has an ID of nav bar.

20
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.330
So I'm just going to grab that.

21
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.670
I'm also going to initialize actually.

22
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.470
No, we'll just we'll do this for now.

23
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.800
So then we want to take window dot on scroll, which is an event.

24
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.440
So we're saying basically when we start scrolling then we want to run a function and then we want to

25
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:56.380
check where we are on the page in terms of scrolling so we can say if the window dot and then page y

26
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.870
offset because we want to check where we are on the Y axis, which is the vertical axis, if that is

27
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.400
greater than 100.

28
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.040
So if we scroll down past 100 pixels, then let's take our nav bar and for the class list.

29
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.860
So basically the class lists, we're going to go ahead and remove the class of top.

30
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.660
And remember, the class of top is where we make the the transparent background.

31
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.360
So we're going to remove that else.

32
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.480
So if we're basically above 100, so for less than 100, then we're going to take the nav bar and we're

33
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.710
going to take the class list property and the add function.

34
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.420
So basically we can add a class here, we're going to add top back.

35
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.500
So just this code here should give us that effect.

36
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.350
So you'll see as soon as I scroll down past 100, then we get that background.

37
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.620
Now I'm going to take it a step further and give it this bounce effect.

38
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.050
And we're doing we're going to do that using the transform property along with Translate.

39
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.940
And I haven't explained that yet.

40
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.680
So this might be a little confusing.

41
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.630
I do get into this later on in the course, so you don't have to do this if you don't want to.

42
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.940
But I will show you how I did that.

43
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:32.620
So I'm going to go back to my JavaScript here and I'm going to initialize a variable here called scrolled

44
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.020
and set it to false.

45
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.950
So basically what this means is we haven't started scrolling yet.

46
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:49.150
And then down here after we go ahead and we remove the top class and make it so it has a background,

47
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:59.680
we're going to say if not scrolled, then we want to set the nav bar style because we can set direct

48
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.330
CSS properties from here.

49
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.860
We're going to set the transform and we're going to set that to on we're going to set that to translate

50
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.400
why and what translate why is it it does is it moves things along the Y axis.

51
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:23.200
So up and down, we're going to set that to -70 pixels so that it gets basically gets pulled up.

52
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.050
So let's see if we can demonstrate this.

53
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.490
Yeah.

54
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.700
So when I go down and I hit that 100, it goes up.

55
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.590
I see that it just, I mean, it just kind of disappears actually, because we don't have a transition

56
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.420
where it's going up slowly.

57
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.690
So if we want it to go up slowly, we can add a transition, which is also something I haven't gotten

58
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.870
into yet, but we are going to dive into this stuff later.

59
00:04:49.870 --> 00:05:01.720
So in our stylesheet on our nav bar here, I'm going to add a transition, say transition of 1/2 and

60
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.340
let's do ease in.

61
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.830
Actually.

62
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.150
Is that what I want to do?

63
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.500
Yeah, we don't even need.

64
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.540
Actually, let's do a half a second.

65
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.840
Let's just say transition 0.5 seconds.

66
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.080
And I'm going to explain, like I said later on, I'll explain this stuff.

67
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.280
This is just kind of a bonus that I figured I'd add on.

68
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.990
So now when I scroll down, see that how it goes up smoothly, that's because I added that transition.

69
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.530
So it's getting it's going up -70 pixels.

70
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.270
Remember, the height is 70 pixels.

71
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.000
So now it's going up and it's disappearing.

72
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.510
Now let's go back to our JavaScript.

73
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.970
So it went it went up 70 pixels.

74
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.800
Now we want to wait a very short amount of time, like 200 milliseconds, and then bring it back down

75
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.710
by setting translate why back to zero?

76
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.490
So we can do that using a function called set timeout.

77
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.750
So set timeout actually takes in a function and then it takes as a second parameter.

78
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.540
The time that we want to wait to run this function, which will be 200 milliseconds and all I want to

79
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.320
do is set this back to zero, which will put it in its original position.

80
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.750
And then I'm just going to set that scrolled value to true because we've already scrolled down.

81
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.740
Else then we're still going to do the same thing, but we're going to set scrolled to false.

82
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.840
And if you like this kind of stuff, I would definitely recommend my 20 projects course.

83
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.700
We do stuff like this.

84
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.180
So now let's go ahead and scroll.

85
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.760
And you can see that what happens is when we hit 100, we get the background.

86
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:59.030
Also, it translates on the Y axis up into 200 milliseconds later, which is very quick.

87
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.870
It comes back down because we set it back to translate zero, right?

88
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.010
And when we get to the transform, translate and transition stuff later on, it'll make more sense,

89
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.890
even though it might not make much sense now.

90
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.230
But that gives us that effect now for the smooth scrolling, because right now it just kind of pops

91
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.670
down to the area.

92
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:26.880
I'm going to use a jQuery solution, so we're going to just go to let's search for jQuery seed.

93
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.720
N Now we could download jQuery and include it in our project, but I'm just going to use a N meaning

94
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.340
that we're going to load it from their content delivery network.

95
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:46.910
So let's grab the minified version so we can just copy this script tag right here and let's put that

96
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.150
in our HTML.

97
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.420
So we want to go above our custom script and just paste that in.

98
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:59.840
So that'll bring in jQuery and then I'm just going to paste in this smooth scrolling block of jQuery.

99
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:07.370
So I'm going to go under my custom window, scroll here and paste this in.

100
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.370
I should have auto format enabled.

101
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.290
Let me just check something real quick.

102
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.970
Let's say format on save.

103
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.950
I thought I had that enabled.

104
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.690
There you go.

105
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.040
All right.

106
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.490
So that fixed how that's formatted.

107
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:34.850
So basically we're just grabbing the nav bar and when we click any link in it, it's going to look at

108
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.770
the link, it's going to look at the hash.

109
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:42.409
So, you know how we have hash about hash home and it's going to scroll to that and it's also going

110
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.760
to go a little bit above it so that the fixed nav bar doesn't cover it.

111
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.290
So let's try this out.

112
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.100
We're going to go back to our home page here.

113
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.320
Let's click a boat and now you'll see it will go down to that section and it doesn't cover it like like

114
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:05.510
it did before because we set it to be 100 pixels above where it's actually supposed to go.

115
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.030
So I mean, that's how we implemented how I implemented that.

116
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.990
Those effects for the nav bar, there's a ton of other ways.

117
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.850
I mean, there's other libraries you could use without jQuery, but this is a really simple solution.

118
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.970
So if you want to add this to your other your blog page and stuff, because right now if we go to blog,

119
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.760
we don't have that functionality.

120
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.920
We don't want the smooth scrolling because none of these point to anything else on the page.

121
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.390
We just want the, you know, the effect, the transparency effect.

122
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:47.060
So to implement that, we would just go to our blog, HTML and add top add the top class to our nav

123
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.420
bar.

124
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.700
Let's add it on the post page as well.

125
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.910
So where are we now, bar?

126
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:59.790
Let's add top and then we just want that little bit of JavaScript right here.

127
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.820
So we don't want the jQuery stuff, we just want this.

128
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.050
So blog HTML, we'll go down to the bottom and.

129
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:16.400
Put in our script, paste that in and then post.

130
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.580
And of course you can put this in a different file if you want.

131
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.860
So script and paste that in.

132
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.840
So now that should work.

133
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:33.710
If we go to blog, you see it's transparent at the top and then we get that if we go to the Post page,

134
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.550
same thing.

135
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.040
All right.

136
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.580
So I think we're pretty much there.

137
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.640
The last thing to do is the lightbox.

138
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.700
Now, this is we're actually going to implement a library called LightBox, too.

139
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.120
So it's this right here.

140
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.240
So here's some examples.

141
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.220
Let's see.

142
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.960
So we're going to have to download it.

143
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.790
So if we go to the GitHub.

144
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.100
Let's grab right here.

145
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.540
It says clone or download.

146
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.190
We're going to download the zip and let's open that up.

147
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.850
So LightBox to Dev and there's some stuff we need to bring over to our projects.

148
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:24.940
So I'm going to just open up my project if I can find it.

149
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:35.730
So here's our project Edge ledger and we're going to take inside of DIST we need this stuff here so

150
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:42.270
in CSS, in our CSS folder, let's bring over light box mini CSS.

151
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:48.780
So we'll grab the minified version and then let's see, we're going to create a new folder called JS.

152
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:56.070
And in this JS folder we just need to grab, let's see.

153
00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.260
And this does require jQuery as well.

154
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.300
So we're going to grab the minified version here of LightBox.

155
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.650
That should be all we need.

156
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.750
We don't need this stuff here.

157
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.490
We already have jQuery included.

158
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:14.910
Now there are some images to scroll through and stuff like that, the X image.

159
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.540
So we're going to put that right in these right in our image folder.

160
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:30.040
And then we need to include the script and the CSS in our index HTML.

161
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:37.750
So let's go back into our index HTML and we only need to do this on the home page because we're not

162
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.290
using this anywhere else.

163
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:50.350
So up at the top here, let's add another CSS reference and this is going to go to CSS slash LightBox

164
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.260
Min dot CSS.

165
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.700
And then for the JavaScript, let's go all the way down to the bottom.

166
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.690
So let's see.

167
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.700
We have our custom, we have jQuery and then we have our custom script.

168
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.410
We're going to want to put this right after the jQuery reference.

169
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:20.520
So right here, let's say script, colon source and we want to point to JS, Slash and then LightBox

170
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.900
Min JS.

171
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.170
All right.

172
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:30.650
Now, to implement this, we actually have to do some stuff to the cases because that's where we want

173
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.520
to use this.

174
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:41.060
So we need to wrap these cases in in links because we need to point to the actual image.

175
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:49.100
So this first image here, let's put a link and let's see, how do we want to do this?

176
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.350
We don't need any classes or anything, but we need to point to the actual image for one.

177
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.000
So we'll just grab this.

178
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.940
And let's put this image one inside this link to image one.

179
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.230
And then we just need to add a couple attributes.

180
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:16.810
So we want to say data dash light box and we're going to set this to cases which is like the category.

181
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:21.550
So if you want to be able to scroll through all the images, they all have to have the same value for

182
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.850
data.

183
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:31.300
LightBox And then if you want some text, we can say data dash title and let's just grab this text here

184
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.250
and put that inside here.

185
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.400
So we have this link going to the image with these two attributes around the image.

186
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.550
So I'm just going to save this and let's try it out for the first one.

187
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.440
So if we go down to cases and we click on this, there we go.

188
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.890
Now we'll have to do the same thing for the rest of the images.

189
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:58.960
So what I'll do is copy this link, at least the first a tag, go to the next image paste that we want

190
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.750
to make sure we add the ending a tag change this to to because we want to obviously point to the same

191
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.940
image and we can leave this.

192
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.790
We want to leave the same value for that.

193
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.350
And I mean, you could put different text here if you want, but it really doesn't matter.

194
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.970
It's not real content.

195
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.590
So we'll do the same here.

196
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:25.150
This is going to be three and we'll wrap that next one, paste that in.

197
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.500
This is going to be four.

198
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.710
Make sure you put the ending tag on.

199
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:38.410
Then we have cases five and a tag.

200
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.810
Oops, this will be six.

201
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:50.290
Just make sure you point to the same image that you're surrounding the link and the image.

202
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:56.260
Make sure they match seven a tag and then the last one will be eight.

203
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.370
There we go.

204
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.300
So we'll save that.

205
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.710
And now you should be able to click on all of these.

206
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.600
You should also be able to scroll through because they all have the same data.

207
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.280
LightBox equals cases and that's what puts them all in the same group.

208
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.330
All right, so that's it.

209
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.240
We're done.

210
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.160
And hopefully you enjoyed this project.

211
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.620
I know there was some stuff that, you know, in this in this last section that we didn't go over yet.

212
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:30.250
But you'll learn more about stuff like Transform and, you know, pseudo selectors and stuff like that

213
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.040
later on.

214
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:31.390
All right.

215
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:31.820
That's it.

216
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.290
Thanks.

217
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.910
I will see you in the next section.
