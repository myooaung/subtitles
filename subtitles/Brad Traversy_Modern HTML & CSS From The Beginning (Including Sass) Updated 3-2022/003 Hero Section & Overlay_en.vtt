1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.660
Okay.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.010
So now we're going to create our main hero image with the overlay.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:12.390
So let's jump back into our stylesheet here and I'm going to go under the nav bar styling, let's just

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.990
say header and our header has a class of hero.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.640
So for the background we want an image.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.970
So we're going to say URL and let's put in here the location of the image, which is up one level in

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.940
images and then in home.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.000
And I called it showcase.

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.950
Showcase.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.810
I don't know why it's not popping up here.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.660
Showcase JPEG.

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.690
I think that's correct.

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.240
So we go images home.

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.530
Yep.

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.470
Showcase.

16
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.860
So we want to add some other background properties.

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.520
Let's say no, repeat and let's center.

18
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.430
So for the background position, we want to center it on the x and y axis and then we also want it to

19
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.700
cover in terms of the background size.

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.690
Now I want the height of this hero class, this header to be the entire viewport.

21
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.790
So 100 viewport heights.

22
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.270
And I'm going to add a position relative and I'll explain that a little later when we do the overlay

23
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.060
and then the color set to white.

24
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.150
So if we take a look at that, it's not showing for some reason.

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.600
Let's see background URL.

26
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.010
Oh, images.

27
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.420
So we get the background image.

28
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.010
But notice that it's pretty bright.

29
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.620
If we look at the final version, it's much darker because we have to create that overlay.

30
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.260
And I didn't want to just, you know, make it darker in Photoshop or something like that.

31
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.180
We want to do it through CSS.

32
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.860
But before we even get to the overlay, I want to position the content because right now it's just behind

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.550
the nav bar.

34
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.320
We want it to be in the center here and we can center it pretty easily with Flexbox.

35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.230
So let's grab the content.

36
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:16.620
So we have hero content and we want to display Flex and instead of being a row because if it's a row,

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.310
you can see that.

38
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.880
Now if you look behind the nav bar, that stuff is all like it's aligned horizontally and we don't want

39
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.090
that.

40
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.170
So we're going to change the direction to column.

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.760
So that will put it back to going vertical.

42
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:42.750
And then we can use align items center and justify content center and let's also align the text center.

43
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.920
Now if we take a look, you can see it is aligned this way.

44
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.000
So it's a line, it's aligned on the cross axis because remember, this is a flex column.

45
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.600
So this is the main axis, this is the cross.

46
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.300
So align items, put it in the center here, justify content, should put it in the center here.

47
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.300
But the reason it's not is because there's no height.

48
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.800
So what we'll do since the parent, which is the hero, has a height of 100 viewport heights, we'll

49
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.790
set the height of this to 100% of its container.

50
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.030
So if I go ahead and do that now, it's right in the middle.

51
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.240
So before we move on to the overlay, just want to style this because obviously this doesn't look very

52
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.780
good.

53
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.350
So let's do the let's do the H one.

54
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.550
Actually, I'm sorry, there's some other stuff I want to do here.

55
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.800
Well, I just want to add some padding.

56
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.550
So let's say padding, let's do 20 pixels on each side just so it doesn't rub up against the side on

57
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.750
smaller screens.

58
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.640
So hero content h one I'm going to make this pretty large.

59
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.070
So let's do font size 55 pixels and then the paragraph.

60
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.910
So hero content paragraph, I'm going to set the font size on this to be a little larger.

61
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.930
Let's do 23 pixels and I want to set a max width so that the paragraph doesn't extend too far out.

62
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:27.300
So I'll set that to 600 pixels and then let's set margin will do 20 pixels, top zero left and right,

63
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.500
30 bottom.

64
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.890
So we'll take a look at that.

65
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.060
That looks pretty good.

66
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.870
Now, as far as this link goes, it has a class of BTN.

67
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.440
Now, BTN is going to be a utility class that we can reuse.

68
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.440
So we don't want to do Hero BTN because then it only applies to the hero.

69
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.250
So in utilities we're going to go ahead and add our button.

70
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.840
So let's say button BTN.

71
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.940
So first of all, I'm going to set the cursor to a pointer.

72
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:10.800
And then we want to set the display from inline to inline block and we're going to add some padding

73
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.250
to it.

74
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.150
So let's do ten pixels, top and bottom, 30 left and right.

75
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.250
Let's set the color to white.

76
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.180
Let's set the we want to do let's do background.

77
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.540
So the background color I'm going to set to the primary color by default, which is this here.

78
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.740
Okay.

79
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.120
And then let's go ahead and set the border to none and then we'll add a little bit of a curve on the

80
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.570
corner.

81
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.570
So border radius will do five pixels.

82
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.880
All right.

83
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.560
Now for the hover.

84
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.830
So let's say button hover.

85
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.630
We could change the color.

86
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.040
We could do a few different things.

87
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.540
I'm just going to change the opacity and make it more see through.

88
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.330
So we'll do 0.9.

89
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.480
Just make it slightly translucent.

90
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.960
And then I also want to have other button classes for different colors as well if we want.

91
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.180
So let's create a BTN.

92
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:20.900
So BTN primary actually we don't really need the primary because we're using that as the default, but

93
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.880
we'll go ahead and just add it here anyway.

94
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.850
So we want the backgrounds to be that color and the color to be white.

95
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.410
So if you want to use BTN primary and get rid of this, you can.

96
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.840
But I'm just going to keep it this way so we can.

97
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.830
It's just optional.

98
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.360
If we want to use this now, we want some other button classes as well.

99
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.830
So let's have BTN secondary.

100
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.130
So it's almost like creating your own framework, your own CSS framework, because these are these are

101
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.830
classes similar to what you'd see in like bootstrap.

102
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.390
So the secondary color is going to be that.

103
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:10.100
And then I'm also going to do a BTN doc where the background color is three, three, three and then

104
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:16.730
let's also do a light button light where the color is light gray, but the background's light gray,

105
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.740
but the color is dark.

106
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.190
So those are our button utility classes.

107
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.650
So if we take a look, you can see now we have our button, we have that opacity effect when we hover

108
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.280
over it.

109
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.800
So now we're ready to create our overlay.

110
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.970
And like I said, we're going to be using a pseudo selector called before.

111
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:41.630
So in our stylesheet here style CSS, let's go ahead and say hero.

112
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.750
And the way we want to use this is we want to do double colon and then before, now there's before and

113
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.770
there's after.

114
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:56.990
And what this does is it allows us to insert content before or after this element so we can have this

115
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:04.520
content property and we can actually put text in here like, hello, and if I save this and I go back,

116
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.180
you'll see up here in the corner behind the nav bar it has the text.

117
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.540
Hello, which we just inserted using CSS.

118
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.940
Now I don't want to put actual content like text, so we just want to leave that blank.

119
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.680
We do need this property, but we're going to leave this as just an empty string.

120
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.760
Now what we do want to do is create an overlay.

121
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.750
So basically put a color over it, over the entire thing.

122
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.730
So we want to position this to be absolute within here.

123
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:40.700
So that's why up here I put position relative because remember with positioning, if you have something

124
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.440
absolute within a parent, the parent has to be position relative.

125
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:54.950
And as far as placement, let's put it, we'll say top zero, left zero and then we want it to cover

126
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.000
the entire thing.

127
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.630
So 100% width and 100% height.

128
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:07.280
And then if we set the background, let's say we'll say background red for now and let's take a look

129
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.990
and we just have this large red overlay.

130
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.330
So this is covering everything.

131
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.920
It starts here and it's 100% width, 100% height, and it covers everything.

132
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:26.840
Now, in order to make this transparent, we could use opacity or we could use an GBE GBA value.

133
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:35.450
So red, green, blue alpha and set it to black 000 and then we'll do 0.6 for the transparency.

134
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.080
So if I save that and we take a look now we have an overlay.

135
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:46.280
Now, one problem that you can see here is that the the text and the button, it's behind the overlay.

136
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.450
So we need to move that forward and we can do that with the Z index property.

137
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:57.140
So Z index is just the level of of where it is from front to back.

138
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.980
So right now the content is behind the overlay.

139
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:07.100
So it has a lower Z index and your Z index can be any number, it can be negative or positive.

140
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.850
So what I'll do here is I'll say anything that is in here.

141
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:19.670
So let's set the Z index to we'll set it to ten.

142
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.440
So we should be safe with ten.

143
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.980
And now if we take a look, the content is in front of the overlay because the higher the Z index,

144
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.770
the closer to you it is, the closer to the screen.

145
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.150
If it's a lower Z index.

146
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.960
Then the further back it is.

147
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.840
So, I mean, that's pretty much it as far as the top part of our website.

148
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.630
So in the next video, we're going to start on these sections down here.

149
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.860
We'll we'll create some flex items and do this part here as well.

150
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.330
And we'll go from there.
