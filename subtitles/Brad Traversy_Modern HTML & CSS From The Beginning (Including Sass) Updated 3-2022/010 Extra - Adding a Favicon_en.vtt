Hey, guys.

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.290
One last thing.

3
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.720
Before we wrap this project up, I wanted to show you how to create a fan icon so you might see these

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.030
icons up in the tab sometimes.

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040
So I actually have in our project in images, I have a PNG file.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.490
However, I'm going to convert it to an ISO file and there's a tool that I use to do that which is called

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.660
Dynamic Drive.

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
So if we search for a dynamic drive, fab icon, I don't know the exact URL.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.200
So it's right here, the fab icon generator and I've used this for years.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:41.310
So if we just go ahead and choose a file and I'm going to choose that PNG file and click create icon

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.830
and download the fab icon and it's going to be this icon file.

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.180
So I'm just going to go ahead and grab that and let me see it's grab my project and we'll put that.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.880
We're going to put it right in the root, not in the images folder.

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.440
I'm going to put it right in the root.

15
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.570
So just drag that over.

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.170
So now we have that icon file and it also gives us the tag.

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.970
We just want this link tag.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.180
We can go ahead and copy that and I'm going to put that in my index HTML, which I don't think I do

19
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.350
have it still open.

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.230
So I'm going to go up to the head here and put this right above my style sheets.

21
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.780
So we'll paste that in.

22
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.560
And then if we go back to our site and we just need to reload the cache.

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.800
So if you're on windows, I believe it's shift and F five.

24
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.530
If you're on a mac, it's going to be shift control, R reload.

25
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.510
And now you can see up here we have the little fab icon and of course you can use any image you want.

26
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.860
So I just wanted to throw that in.

27
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.810
It's something I forgot to mention.

28
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.680
And that's it.

29
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.070
Thanks.

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.450
I'll see you in the next section.
