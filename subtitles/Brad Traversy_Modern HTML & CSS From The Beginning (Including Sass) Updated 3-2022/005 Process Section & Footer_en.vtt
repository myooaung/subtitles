00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.630
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.320
So in this video, we're going to start to work on the rest of the index page.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.620
So we want this this process, my creative process, and we want these font awesome icons.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.410
We're going to add some background to it, this transition effect, and get these numbers kind of inside

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.530
of the the display of the icon.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.100
All right.

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.450
And then we'll also do the footer as well with these social media icons with the hover effect.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.370
So we're going to start with the HTML.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:34.230
So let's jump into VS code and let's go to our index.html, go right below section B, which is the

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.210
stats that we did in the last video.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.990
And let's say Section C and this is the process section.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:53.880
So I'm going to give this an ID of home dash C and let's give it a class of text center and also a class

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.050
of PY two.

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
So do some padding on the top and bottom.

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.550
We want our container.

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.739
So you can see there's a lot of repetitiveness in these sections.

17
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.990
So we'll have an each two.

18
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.870
Let's give it a class of section dash title, which I believe we still have to add in the CSS.

19
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.680
And we're just going to see my creative process and let's put let's do a bottom line.

20
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.670
Remember, we have that bottom line class, so we'll do bottom dash line.

21
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.270
And underneath that we're going to have a class, a paragraph with the class of lead and we're going

22
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.020
to say, actually, know what I'm going to do is just going to paste this in and you guys can just copy

23
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.530
it.

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.580
So let's go right here.

25
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.450
So all of my UI, UX and design projects are based off of a practice formula to get the result I am

26
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.470
looking for.

27
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.600
And of course, you can put whatever you'd like in here.

28
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.850
I just wanted to make it a little more realistic.

29
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.120
We are going to have some some content, but I wanted to put some real text in here as well.

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.750
So underneath this paragraph, let's create a class called process.

31
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.850
Now, this process is going to be the four divs with the icons and the text and so on.

32
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.010
So this right here.

33
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.010
So the process class will surround these and then we'll have the divs inside and we'll use the grid

34
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.150
to align them.

35
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.700
So let's go back and in process, let's do div and we're going to have our icons.

36
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.460
So we'll say I with the class of face and the icon we're going to use as F a dash file, dash alt.

37
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.280
And we want this to be four times its size.

38
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.530
So we're going to say F or four times the regular default size.

39
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:04.500
So for X and we're also going to add in here process dash icon, which is a custom class I'm going to

40
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.290
add and then I want to do the m y.

41
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.050
Remember, we did the margin classes for the top and bottom.

42
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.140
We're going to do my two now inside here.

43
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.930
Remember, we want to have the numbers.

44
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.750
One, two, three, four inside the icon.

45
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:29.100
So we're going to put a div inside here and let's give this a class of process dash step and I'm going

46
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.490
to put a number one now underneath that, let's see.

47
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.970
And what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to float it because of the way that it's it's positioned.

48
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.120
So I'm going to just put a clear class underneath this.

49
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.150
So we're going to put a clear class.

50
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.330
And then underneath that, we're going to have an H three and let's say discuss the project.

51
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.870
And then we'll put a paragraph and let's do lorem think I did lorem 15.

52
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.370
It looks about right.

53
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.030
So that's going to be the first one, first div.

54
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:24.500
So I'm going to actually copy this whole div and let's put it in two, three, four times, just going

55
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.500
to save it to format it with prettier.

56
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.590
So the first one is all set, which is this one.

57
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.640
Now the second one is going to have an icon of F8 desktop.

58
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.720
We want to keep these classes.

59
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.830
We just want to change this to two for the heading.

60
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:57.380
Let's say we'll do brainstorming and concept and I'll just keep the same text.

61
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:07.400
And then for this third one here, the icon is going to be f a dash object, dash UN group.

62
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:17.270
And then we want to change the step to three and then the title, let's change that to UI Dash or slash

63
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.180
UX planning.

64
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.790
And then for the last one here, we're going to make this thumbs up.

65
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.660
So f a thumbs dash up.

66
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.230
Uh.

67
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.710
Let's see.

68
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.930
We want this to be step four.

69
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.000
And the title.

70
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.200
Let's say interaction.

71
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.930
Okay.

72
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.070
So we'll save that.

73
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.590
Let's see what it looks like without the CSIS.

74
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.270
So it just looks like this.

75
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.540
And notice I do have the same icons here and here.

76
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.360
So if you want to change those out, that's fine.

77
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.050
I just didn't want to go crazy looking for icons because the content is really not that important.

78
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.520
You can always switch out the content.

79
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.270
It's the the markup and the CSS that we're really paying attention to.

80
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.560
So let's add some of those utility classes.

81
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.000
So we have let's see, we want our clear class.

82
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.280
We want the process that's not really a that's not a utility class.

83
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.630
But we did have lead, which I think we already added.

84
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.770
Let's see.

85
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.730
Do we add lead?

86
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.600
Yes, we did.

87
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.910
There was bottom line.

88
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.440
We didn't add that yet.

89
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.690
So let's go down here.

90
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.970
This is Utilities six and let's do bottom line.

91
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.920
All right.

92
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:54.300
So for bottom line, we're just going to do a let's do a height.

93
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.590
So it's just going to be just a line with the main color.

94
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:11.460
So let's do a height of two pixels, let's do a width of three REM, let's do a background of the main

95
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:20.040
color and let's make this display block and then let's add a little margin.

96
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:29.700
So I'm going to do margin, let's do zero auto one auto on the left and right, we'll do one REM and

97
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.900
then auto.

98
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.960
So let's save that.

99
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.440
And you can see right here, this is what it looks like.

100
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.190
And if you want to make it thicker, if you want to increase the width, that's that's fine, too.

101
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.340
We just make sure.

102
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.200
So one thing that another thing we have to add is the title.

103
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.570
See how this one is bigger.

104
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.160
That's because we didn't add the section title.

105
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.110
I believe that's what we named it.

106
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.610
So we have class section title.

107
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.320
So let's put that right here.

108
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.560
We'll say section, dash title.

109
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.140
And it's a utility class because we use it over and over in different parts of the site.

110
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.110
So I'm going to set the font size to be a little bigger.

111
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:20.920
Let's do two REM and let's set the let's make it display block.

112
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.580
Let's make the padding bottom.

113
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.180
We'll say 0.5 REM and let's align it to the center.

114
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.440
Which it already is, but it doesn't hurt.

115
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.780
Just to add that, just to make sure.

116
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.690
So I'm going to say font weight.

117
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.970
Let's do a font weight of 100 and let's make it up.

118
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.020
Make sure it's uppercase.

119
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.730
So text transform uppercase.

120
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.130
So let's take a look at it now.

121
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.630
And that looks better.

122
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.790
You can see we have the title and the bottom line.

123
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:02.810
All right.

124
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:09.800
So let's start to work on the the whole process area.

125
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.320
So we're going to go back to our main source.

126
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:21.830
And let's see, we have remember, we have our home we have home dash A, home dash B.

127
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:27.350
Now we want to work on a home dash C, so we want to go to the end of of the dash B, which is right

128
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:39.440
here and let's say home section C and we'll do ampersand dash C and I want to work on the process div.

129
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:51.440
So we're going to display this as a grid and let's do our grid template columns and I'm going to use

130
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.180
repeat, let's do repeat four times one fraction.

131
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.240
So we have four, four, even columns.

132
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.890
We'll set a grid gap.

133
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.350
I'm going to go a little larger.

134
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:09.950
I'm going to do 1.5 REM for the grid gap and just text a line everything to the center.

135
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.460
So now we want to take each process step.

136
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.970
So if we look at our HTML, we have right where is it?

137
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:28.070
Right here, the process step class which surrounds the number which is this right here, this circle

138
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.670
part.

139
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.590
So we're going to work on that.

140
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:38.240
Now since the class is called process dash step, we can simply go within process and we can just do

141
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.520
a dash step.

142
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.200
All right.

143
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:49.850
Now, I'm going to position it absolute because I want to move it inward.

144
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:58.010
And then we're going to set the top to zero and the right to zero.

145
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.360
Okay.

146
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.770
And then let's do a font size.

147
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.940
I'm actually going to set this to a pixel.

148
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.890
I'm going to do 28 pixels.

149
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.220
And then let's set the background.

150
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.850
So background is going to be the main color.

151
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.190
All right, let me just.

152
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.580
Check that real quick.

153
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.820
Yeah.

154
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.570
So it's going to be main color, but when we hover over it, it's going to transition into the dark

155
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.110
color.

156
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.150
So let's see.

157
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.950
Whoops, this should be background.

158
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.260
Either background color or just background.

159
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.200
And then we're going to set the board.

160
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.300
We want it to be circle a circle behind it.

161
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:53.240
So we're going to set border radius to 50% and let's set a height of 15 pixels and a width of 15 pixels.

162
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.020
Okay.

163
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.630
And then we're going to set a line height of the same.

164
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.460
So 15 pixels.

165
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.340
And for padding.

166
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.260
I'll do one REM and we want it to transition.

167
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.040
So we'll add transition all and I'm going to do 1/2.

168
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.240
So that's our step.

169
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.280
Now we want to work on the icon.

170
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.470
Now, remember, we gave it a custom class of process dash icons.

171
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:25.070
So within this process right here, we'll go go after the step and we'll just do.

172
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.650
Dash icon like that.

173
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.520
And again if you want to comment this like we could say this is the process dash icon.

174
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.090
Process dash step.

175
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:51.540
So for the icon, what I'm going to do is set a border radius because again, we want it to be a circle.

176
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.070
So we'll do 50%.

177
00:12:53.400 --> 00:13:00.150
And let's set the background to the dark color variable.

178
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:09.000
Let's set the color to we'll do white and then the padding to to REM.

179
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.610
And then we want this to be excuse me, much bigger than the the step.

180
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:20.100
So I'm going to set it to 70 pixels and also set the height to 70.

181
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:22.990
Okay.

182
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:32.090
And then let's set the line height to the same thing, line height to 70 pixels, and then let's make

183
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.480
sure it's text aligned center.

184
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.780
And we want to position this relative because the step is inside.

185
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:47.600
The icon probably should have put the icon styling first, but it doesn't really matter.

186
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.520
And then I'm going to add transition for this, not transform.

187
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.960
We want transition and I'm going to do all 1/2.

188
00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:58.960
Okay?

189
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.300
Now let's just save that and see what we get.

190
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.820
So that's what we get.

191
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.620
And when it loads, it does it did the transition just because it was the first load with live server,

192
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.650
but you can see that that looks pretty good.

193
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.770
However, we do want that hover effect and we want them to transition.

194
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.790
All right.

195
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.360
So actually, you know what, guys?

196
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.620
I'm not exactly sure why I had the clear class in there.

197
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.230
So we're going to get rid of that.

198
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.190
There is no float.

199
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.650
I don't I actually don't know why I did that.

200
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.540
So we're just going to clear the oops.

201
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.920
I'm going to clear these out.

202
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.180
Sorry about that.

203
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.260
So let's see.

204
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.730
We get those.

205
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.020
This one.

206
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.920
And this one.

207
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.780
Okay.

208
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.520
So now, like I said, we're going to work on the hover.

209
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:59.200
So let's go back to main success and we're going to do the hover on the icon.

210
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:08.740
So you want to make sure you're within the icon and we want to add ampersand, colon, hover, and we

211
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.480
want to set the background.

212
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.980
So remember, we're dealing with the icon, so we want to set the background to the main color by default.

213
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.100
It's the dark color and then we want to set the width.

214
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.570
I'm going to make it grow a little bit.

215
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:28.510
So we're going to do 90 pixels, height, 90 pixels and also the line height, 90 pixels.

216
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.180
Now the process step.

217
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:36.190
I also want to change I want to change the color of that which by default is the main color.

218
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.620
I want to reverse it to the dark color.

219
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:47.920
So when we hover over the icon, we also want the class of process step.

220
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.030
To change the background to the dark color.

221
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.660
So let's try it.

222
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.550
We'll save it.

223
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.180
And let's go down here and hover over.

224
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.820
And you can see the icon.

225
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:14.020
A process icon grows from 70 to 90, changes the background color, and then the absolute positioned

226
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.960
process step class changes the color as well.

227
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.530
And they both transition nicely over 1/2.

228
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.850
All right.

229
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.680
So that's it for that part.

230
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:28.270
Now, we want to we want to deal with the footer, which shouldn't be too bad.

231
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:36.640
So let's go back into index.html and let's go down below the last section here and create our footer.

232
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:48.480
So we'll put let's do a footer tag and let's give it an ID of main dash footer.

233
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.080
And we're going to have a class in here called Footer Dash Content.

234
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.220
And I'm also I also want to container, so I'm just going to add that here as well.

235
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:07.380
And then in here we'll put a paragraph, we'll say copyright, ampersand, copy, semicolon, which

236
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.369
will give us the little copyright symbol.

237
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:15.180
2019, all rights reserved.

238
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:22.770
And then under that, I want the social icons, which I'm going to put in a class called social and

239
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.020
let's do some font awesome icons.

240
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.790
So a F, a B is what we want to use for the social media icons.

241
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.110
And I'm going to do Twitter.

242
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.990
So f a dash Twitter.

243
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:39.600
Let's copy this down four times and we want Facebook.

244
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.230
Let's do Instagram

245
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.880
and let's do LinkedIn.

246
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:50.370
All right.

247
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.110
So if we take a look at that without any CSS, it should look like this.

248
00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:02.490
So now let's go back into main access and let's deal with the footer.

249
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.960
So we want to be let's see, we want to be outside of everything.

250
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.940
So just go down to the bottom here

251
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:21.000
and let's do ID main dash footer and the footer itself will give a background.

252
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:32.910
Let's do a dark color color, we'll say white and let's do a height of we'll do five rem.

253
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:39.420
Now the footer content, I'm going to style which is inside the main footer so we can put it in here.

254
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.810
So footer dash content.

255
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.750
And I'm going to use Flex here.

256
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:52.870
So we'll say display flex and let's do justify content space between.

257
00:18:53.590 --> 00:19:02.710
So remember the footer has to we gave this footer content a class I mean I'm sorry, a display of flex

258
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:08.110
and we have the paragraph and then we have this div as flex items and we want space between because

259
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.880
we want them on each side.

260
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.640
So we want to put all the remaining space in between.

261
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.720
Okay.

262
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:22.320
Next thing, I'm going to set the height to the same as the parent as the main footer.

263
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:27.130
So five REM and then let's do a line items.

264
00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.600
We want to align items to the center.

265
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.850
Now we want to take care of the icons.

266
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:48.580
So let's see, the icons are still inside footer content so we can stay within here and we'll say dot

267
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.690
social.

268
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.310
And then I want to style the icons with which I'll have a class of fab.

269
00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.830
So I'm going to give them a margin.

270
00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.520
Right, just to separate them a little bit of one REM.

271
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.380
Let's do a border.

272
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:14.050
I'll do border two pixels, white and solid, and let's do a border radius because we want them to be

273
00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:25.630
circular radius of 50% and let's do a height, height, width and line height of 20 pixels.

274
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.840
Okay.

275
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.380
And then let's do a text align center

276
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.940
and let's do a little bit of padding.

277
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.340
So we'll do 0.5 REM.

278
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.940
Now, when we hover them, we want the main color.

279
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:59.070
So within this social fab class, we're just going to do ampersand, colon, hover, and just set the

280
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.840
background to the main color.

281
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.830
All right.

282
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:05.370
And that's it.

283
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.330
So let's save that and go back and you can see our folder looks pretty good.

284
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.090
We have the hover effect on the icons.

285
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:20.640
Now, the last thing I want to do is I want to use the set text color function that we created in in

286
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.220
the last section, because I think that will be helpful if we want to change the main color or dot color

287
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.860
or any background color at all.

288
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.870
So let's go into we're going to put this in our config with our variables.

289
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:41.250
So this config is usually where I would put any variables, mix ins functions, things like that.

290
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:53.970
So let's just say set text color and let's do at function and we want to call this set text color and

291
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.350
it's going to take in a color which is going to be basically the background color.

292
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.320
And then we're going to do a simple condition.

293
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.070
So we'll do if and we're going to test the lightness.

294
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:15.750
So we'll say if the lightness of the color that's passed in is greater than 50, then we want to return

295
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.880
the color of black.

296
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:23.490
Actually, we need we need to add a symbol here.

297
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.620
And then we're going to do an else.

298
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.310
LS.

299
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:36.890
Then we want to return a white color.

300
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.940
And if you want to change up the colors, that's fine.

301
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.440
Just can you use black and white?

302
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.210
So we'll save that.

303
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.380
And let's see whether I actually want to implement this.

304
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.460
Let's go to here.

305
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.460
Let's see.

306
00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:03.940
So basically, wherever we have a background color, we can implement this.

307
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.480
So let's see.

308
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:17.620
Um, so the divorce background color.

309
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.870
No, we don't need to do it.

310
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.950
Actually, I don't know if there's.

311
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.400
I don't know if we actually need to put this anywhere just yet.

312
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.220
Um.

313
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.410
So right here, the actually for the icon, we should probably do that.

314
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:37.970
Let me take a look here.

315
00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:44.840
So here, if we wanted to change these icons to have a light background, then we would want the icons

316
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.250
themselves to be dark.

317
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.230
So we should implement it here.

318
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:59.300
So instead of just white, let's do set dash text, dash color and let's pass in dark color.

319
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.830
Okay, we'll save that and we should get the same result.

320
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:10.130
However, if we were to change both of these to light, then the text should change.

321
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.460
Doc or the icon.

322
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:11.930
Yep.

323
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.650
There we go.

324
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.780
Good.

325
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.060
I'm just going to change those back.

326
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:25.160
And then we should probably do do the same thing with with the step.

327
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:39.680
So let's add right below it a color and let's set that to set text color and pass in the main color

328
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.240
and we'll take a look.

329
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:42.950
Good.

330
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.390
So if we were to to make the background light on that.

331
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.730
Let's change both of these to light.

332
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.340
So now just the step should be light, but it should have a dark.

333
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.800
There we go.

334
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.740
It has a dark text.

335
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.530
Oh, we probably want to do it to the hover too, as you can see now, you can't see the number.

336
00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:09.900
So on the hover right here, let's also add color set.

337
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.370
Text color.

338
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.700
Dark color, and that will decide and it will make it light.

339
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.440
So let's just try that out.

340
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.410
So now when I hover it, you'll see that it turns light.

341
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:23.920
Good.

342
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.840
So let's change the main color.

343
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.580
Back to main for the step here.

344
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.590
So the stew main color.

345
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.690
Wait, was it mean or was it dark?

346
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.130
No, it was dark.

347
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:42.870
No, it was me.

348
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:43.520
Sorry.

349
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.600
All right, there we go.

350
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.970
And if you find other places where you want to use that function, you can do that as well.

351
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.170
All right.

352
00:25:54.170 --> 00:26:01.070
So I think that that's it for this video and that's it for the the home page as far as aside from making

353
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.180
it responsive.

354
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.080
So in the next video, we're going to start on the about page.
