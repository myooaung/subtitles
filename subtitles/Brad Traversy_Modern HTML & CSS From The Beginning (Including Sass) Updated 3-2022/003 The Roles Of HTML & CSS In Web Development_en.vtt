00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.980
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.020
So web development involves many different technologies, including HTML, CSS, programming, languages,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.210
frameworks, tools and much more.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.460
But HTML and CSS are what I call the building blocks.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.550
This is where you're going to start, whether you want to build just simple five page websites or large

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.940
social networks and online stores.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.740
So I want to talk about the different roles of HTML and CSS, how they play into web development.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.710
So HTML is actually short for Hypertext Markup Language, and that's exactly what it is.

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.290
It's a markup language.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.040
Many people that are brand new to web development think it's actually a programming language, but it's

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.700
not.

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.560
A programming language is where you write code that can do things based on logic.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.020
So you can check to see if something is true or false and then do some type of action based on that

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.840
condition.

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.750
You can also do things like math.

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.110
You can create reusable functions and the list goes on.

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.060
You can't do any of that with HTML.

18
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.850
HTML is purely visual and it's used to create and construct documents that are viewable inside of a

19
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.850
web browser.

20
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.180
It doesn't have any any kind of behavior associated with it other than displaying content.

21
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.200
And when I say content, I mean text links, images, things like that.

22
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.540
Now, this isn't to minimize HTML.

23
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.630
In fact, there is no Internet as far as the web browser goes without HTML.

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.330
It's extremely important and relevant, and it always will be.

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.780
Every single site that you visit displays its markup using HTML, and sometimes it's it's handwritten,

26
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.230
sometimes it's actually generated by another programming language.

27
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.660
But when you view the compiled source of a website, you're always going to see HTML markup.

28
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.520
Now HTML by itself is used to display content, but it has little to no styling.

29
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.670
So HTML on its own is very, very ugly.

30
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.590
And this is where CSS comes in.

31
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.590
So CSS stands for cascading style sheets, and it's what's called a styling language or a style sheet

32
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.270
language like HTML.

33
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.790
It's not an actual programming language.

34
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.020
It's purely visual.

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.080
Only instead of being used to display content, it's used to style the content and style the layout.

36
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.900
Now CSS is getting more powerful itself.

37
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.920
You can now have things like variables, you can do some calculations and so on.

38
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.030
It can also be extended with something called sass or less, which are CSS pre compilers.

39
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.060
We'll talk a little bit more about SAS later and talk about some of the the things you can do with it.

40
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.120
But we're going to we're not going to do that much later.

41
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.880
So basically these two go hand in hand.

42
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.780
HTML handles the content display, CSS handles styling it with colors, alignment fonts and everything

43
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.960
else to do with with the styling.

44
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.960
Now, as I said, web development includes a huge range of technologies to the point where sometimes

45
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.430
it's very overwhelming.

46
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.460
But these two are the building blocks because no matter how complicated the web application, it still

47
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.790
uses HTML and CSS to display the visual appearance of what?

48
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.250
Let's take a web app like Facebook or Amazon.

49
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.860
These are huge web applications that do things like have user accounts.

50
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.210
You can sign up, register, you can create posts on Facebook.

51
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.850
Amazon does credit card processing.

52
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.240
She has a shopping cart.

53
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.130
You can't have that functionality with just HTML and CSS.

54
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.420
You need some kind of back end programming language and there's a lot to choose from.

55
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.190
And you also need a database for storage of user accounts and posts and stuff like that.

56
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.030
Now, this is stuff you're going to learn in another course, but without HTML and CSS, Facebook and

57
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.930
Amazon cease to exist because HTML and CSS are responsible for displaying the content to you in a browser,

58
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.650
whether it's on a computer, mobile device or tablet, whatever it may be.

59
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.550
So these two technologies are always the first ones that you're going to learn before moving to more

60
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.600
advanced web programming to build shopping carts and stuff like that.

61
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.560
So you can kind of think of HTML and CSS as the human body and and think of programming with other languages

62
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.030
as the human brain.

63
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.490
They both need each other.

64
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.130
Now, JavaScript is sort of in its own league because it is a programming language, but it can run

65
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.500
on both the front end with which is within the browser as well as on the back end server.

66
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.830
So JavaScript can be used in the front end for things like form validation, click events, stuff like

67
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.310
that.

68
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.000
So JavaScript is is probably the next thing you want to learn after HTML and CSS.

69
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.660
All right.

70
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.310
So we've established basically the purpose of HTML and CSS.

71
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.580
It's to display web pages and style web pages.

72
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.180
So what can we do with just HTML and CSS not knowing any other programming language?

73
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.830
So after this course, you'll be able to build any kind of static website.

74
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.820
And by static.

75
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.570
I mean, still.

76
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.880
So something where you're not creating user accounts, you're not you're not creating posts, things

77
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.570
like that.

78
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.180
And a good example of a static website is, let's say, a portfolio to display some of your projects,

79
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.710
small business website, maybe, you know, a plumber wants a website where they can display their company

80
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.210
info, their contact info, stuff like that plumber, construction flower shop, anything like that.

81
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.220
Also informational and brochure websites.

82
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.690
You can build some really, really beautiful stuff with just HTML and CSS.

83
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.730
You just can't have that special kind of functionality like a shopping cart or something like that.

84
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.250
You're going to need to learn more to do that stuff.

85
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.460
You can also build the visual part of anything.

86
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.880
So even an online store or huge social network like Facebook, you could build basically the shell of

87
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.060
it.

88
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.260
You'll just have to have a programmer add the life to it where you can actually click post and have

89
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.770
it post or upload an image or something like that.

90
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.600
So you can do that.

91
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.750
This stuff with just HTML and CSS.

92
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.480
And I'm going to show you all of this throughout the course.

93
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.260
All right.

94
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.340
So that's it, guys.

95
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.610
In the next video, we're going to start to set up our environment.

96
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.280
We're going to need something called the text editor so that we can actually write our HTML and CSS.

97
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.350
We're going to we're going to use something called VS code and we're going to install some extensions

98
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.890
to to allow it to do some extra things for us.

99
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.630
And of course, you need a Web browser.

100
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.030
We're going to talk about all this in the next video.
