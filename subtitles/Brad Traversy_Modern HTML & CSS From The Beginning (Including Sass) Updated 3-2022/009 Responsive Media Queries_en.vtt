00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.730
Now we're going to get started with the the mobile version of the website.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.550
So let's make this a little smaller here and we're going to have a few.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
Some styles are going to vary, whether it's a tablet or whether it's a smartphone.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.990
So basically for tablets, I want I want this to be two columns.

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.300
I want just to two columns.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.650
But on mobile, on smartphones, I want it to be stacked in one column.

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.380
But let's let's handle the navigation first.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.740
So the navigation is going to be the same on tablet and mobile.

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:46.170
Now in our HTML files, we already have a link to mobile CSS and basically it kicks in when the screen

11
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.090
is 768 or less.

12
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.730
So let's, let's keep style CSS open so we can use this as a reference and let's take mobile CSS and

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180
let's bring this over to the side here.

14
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.180
And let me see if can we fit all this on here?

15
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.770
Let's see if we can do this.

16
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.960
Um.

17
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.130
Like that.

18
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.270
All right.

19
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.640
So hopefully this this works out for you guys.

20
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.360
You can see this.

21
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.840
Good.

22
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.510
So we're going to start with the navigation now.

23
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.830
One thing right off the bat that I want to do is get rid of the social icons unless it's on, you know,

24
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.630
larger than 768.

25
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.740
So let's put a comment here.

26
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:46.150
We'll say navigation and then let's take the main dash nav ID and target the class of social and let's

27
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.470
set that to display none and save.

28
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.710
So that will get rid of it.

29
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.140
Now, this doesn't look bad.

30
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.040
It really doesn't.

31
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.520
And this would probably be fine if.

32
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.430
If if you never planned on adding any other links, if you just had these two links home and about.

33
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.560
But I don't like to do things that way.

34
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.970
I like to plan it, you know, I like to make it scalable, basically.

35
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.280
So we're going to switch this around a little bit.

36
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.310
Let's take the the navigation container.

37
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:31.050
So we have main dash nav and container and let's set the grid template columns to just one FR.

38
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.600
So basically just on top of each other.

39
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.480
And I'm also going to say grid gap.

40
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.830
Let's do 1.2 REM.

41
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.010
All right.

42
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.800
Now, we want these to be centered, right?

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.020
So we're going to take the UL, so let's say main dash nav UL, which is the menu and we're going to

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.270
justify self to center.

45
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.300
So if I do that, it pushes it in the middle.

46
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.360
And then actually I think that's all I want to do with the UL.

47
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.140
So here we had just a fi self end which had it all the way over.

48
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.570
Now we have it in the middle.

49
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.710
Now the logo.

50
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.360
We want to do the same thing.

51
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.380
So actually now what we can do is just add.

52
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.860
Onto this main nav logo and that puts it in the middle.

53
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.530
Now for the link, I want to lessen the padding just a little bit.

54
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.920
So we have 0.75 REM for the padding around this, but I want to make this a little smaller.

55
00:03:44.920 --> 00:04:02.170
So let's say main nav and ul l i a and let's change the padding to 0.50 rem so that just it just makes

56
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.400
it a little bit smaller.

57
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.570
All right.

58
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.330
Now, that's pretty much all we need to do for the menu.

59
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.530
So you'll see as soon as we hit 768, it turns into that and it's still sticky, of course.

60
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.130
All right.

61
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:23.650
Now for tablet size, I want this right here on tablets.

62
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.970
I want this to be the same.

63
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.260
So I'm going to leave that for now.

64
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.540
We're not we're not doing mobile yet or I shouldn't say mobile tablets are also mobile, but we're not

65
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.480
doing small smartphone devices yet.

66
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.730
So I'm going to leave this for now and let's move on to this area, which is the home articles.

67
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.320
And I want those to be in two, two columns.

68
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:54.370
So let's say home dash articles and it has an articles container which is our grid container and we're

69
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.900
going to set grid dash template dash columns.

70
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.520
And let me just show you over here what we have it set to.

71
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:13.510
So we have it set to repeat three one FR But I just want to two so I'm going to say repeat two, one

72
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.340
fr all right.

73
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.480
We'll save that.

74
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.500
Uh.

75
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.850
So let's see the first child here.

76
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.570
Yeah.

77
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.380
We want to get rid of the spans because that's kind of that's kind of ruining things.

78
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.190
So let's grab the first child.

79
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:46.330
So we'll say home articles and we want to target articles container and we want the immediate element,

80
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.910
the immediate first child element.

81
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:57.610
And let's set grid template columns because remember the first in the last there there are also grids,

82
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.370
as you can see right here and they have grid template columns of two one far.

83
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.570
We just want to set it to a single column.

84
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.580
So just one fr like that.

85
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:07.200
All right.

86
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.400
And then we want to clear the span, because right here you can see we're doing the span.

87
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.640
So I'm going to say grid dash column and just set it to one, which is just the default.

88
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.190
So let's save that.

89
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.230
And now this is put back into just it's just like the rest of them.

90
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.840
Let's do the same for the last one.

91
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.570
So we can actually just.

92
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.850
Copy this.

93
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.020
And put a comma here and then change this to last child.

94
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.440
Save that.

95
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.310
And there we go.

96
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.870
So now we just have two columns, no matter what.

97
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.100
First and last are the same as the rest.

98
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.360
Good.

99
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.990
Now, I think that's that's good for the tablet.

100
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.250
In fact, let's check it out.

101
00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:02.700
So actually we'll use our chrome tools here and lets me just move this to the side and we'll hit the

102
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.860
the, the little icon here for the devices.

103
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.510
And this would be an iPad.

104
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.040
Let me just stretch this out.

105
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.770
And right now, this iPad is in landscape mode.

106
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:19.300
So I'm going to just flip it and this is what it's going to look like, which which looks pretty good.

107
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:26.260
Even the footer I'll keep like that for our devices that are 768 like this.

108
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:32.860
But on smaller devices like let's choose iPhone X, this doesn't look right.

109
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.530
So we want this to be in the middle.

110
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.120
So just take up the whole thing here and then I want these to all be stacked.

111
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:46.390
The footer is definitely not responsive, so we want that to be stacked as well.

112
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.800
About Page, we want to change that up the page container.

113
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.320
Same thing with the article page.

114
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.500
So now let's deal with smaller devices.

115
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.020
So I'm going to get out of this mode here and let's bring this back down.

116
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:11.170
And now in this mobile case, I'm going to I'm going to add a media query.

117
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:19.450
So I'm going to say media, and I'm going to do a max width of, let's say, 600 pixels.

118
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.470
And then anything we put in here is only going to pertain to anything under 600 pixels.

119
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:32.710
So let's, let's take what we need to stack, meaning I want just one column.

120
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:39.669
So I'm going to say stack grid items and there's a few things I want to I want to do that to.

121
00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.620
One is going to be the showcase container this right here, if you remember or I can just show you real

122
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.220
quick.

123
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:57.580
Let's see showcase showcase container is set to grid template columns repeat to one fr we want it to

124
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:05.050
just be just one fr so we're going to take this actually we should probably put the selector in here

125
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:05.410
first.

126
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:16.690
So let's say showcase dot, showcase container and we just want to change this to just simply one fr

127
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:18.520
like that.

128
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.280
And if we save now that goes all the way across.

129
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:26.590
There's some other things we want to stack such as the these home articles.

130
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:39.550
So let's say home ID home articles and we want the container, which is articles container and we want

131
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.390
those to stack.

132
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.380
So we'll save.

133
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.580
There we go.

134
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.320
So that looks pretty good.

135
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.750
Yeah.

136
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.120
All right.

137
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.710
So what else?

138
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.700
The footer.

139
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.730
So we want these footer items to stack.

140
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:08.200
So let's go ahead and put a comma here and let's say main dash footer and we want the footer container

141
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.390
and save.

142
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.610
And it didn't work.

143
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.920
Why didn't that work?

144
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.340
I mean, for.

145
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.370
Hmm.

146
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.220
Why isn't that working?

147
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.040
We called it main footer.

148
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:31.800
Correct.

149
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.900
Let's just check it over here.

150
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.720
So we have main footer.

151
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.800
For a container and it's set to basically for one far.

152
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.860
Oh, you know what it is?

153
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.850
It's the span, the last child here we span.

154
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.110
So we want to clear that up.

155
00:10:52.110 --> 00:11:01.350
So let's take this the selector right here and put that in and let's grab the what was it?

156
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.300
The last child is what we spanned.

157
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.240
So let's say last child.

158
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.000
And oops, forgot the colon.

159
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.940
And then we want to set the grid column.

160
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.080
To one and save.

161
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.690
And now it stacks because if you have something spanning however many columns, four columns, it's

162
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:31.590
going to it's going to you can't have just one fr it's going to it's going to adapt to whatever the

163
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.080
amount of columns that you're spanning.

164
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.080
So we want to set make sure that that's set to one.

165
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:38.340
All right.

166
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:44.130
Now, another thing I want to do here is this looks kind of really clumped together.

167
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:50.370
So I want to add a faint border between the modules here or whatever you want to call these these these

168
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.210
items.

169
00:11:51.690 --> 00:12:05.400
So let's go and say main footer and take the footer container and let's say all items in the footer

170
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.030
container.

171
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:15.330
I'm going to add a border bottom of four, four, four dotted one pixel and then some padding just to

172
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.230
separate it a bit.

173
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.540
So we'll say padding, dash border.

174
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.860
And let's set that to one ram and.

175
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.990
Oops.

176
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.960
What's going on here?

177
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.110
Padding does I see padding border with the padding bottom.

178
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:33.070
Okay.

179
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:38.760
So as you can see now, we have a border separating all of these with some padding now.

180
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.790
This one here doesn't look right because of the we have the list items and we have a border for each

181
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:45.060
one.

182
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.390
So this kind of looks funny having it's like it looks like a double border, really.

183
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.270
So I want to remove that one.

184
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.940
And remember, we have the Nth Child.

185
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.590
I also want to remove this one.

186
00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:00.510
I don't think that that needs to be there because this has its own background and it looks completely

187
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.170
separate.

188
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.440
So that's pretty easy to do.

189
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:11.730
We can just say main footer for our container and then let's say we want the item, we want the the

190
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.560
last child, so colon last child.

191
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.270
And then we also want just copy this.

192
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.360
We want this one here, which is going to be the third one down, right?

193
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.320
The third item.

194
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.090
So we'll use nth child.

195
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:37.800
So Child three and let's just set border.

196
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.840
To none.

197
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.310
And save.

198
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.500
And now you can see that that border is gone.

199
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.900
And, oh, actually, you know what we don't want the last child would be this one.

200
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.760
Which I guess, yeah, we would want to move that, remove that one.

201
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.730
But if we want to move this one as well, we can use any child.

202
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:06.000
So we'll copy that and let's do Child four and Save.

203
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.500
And now that board is gone.

204
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.720
All right.

205
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:15.480
And we could have done it the opposite way and just chose this first first child and child two and just

206
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.290
added a border.

207
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.610
We could have did that as well.

208
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.960
I guess that that probably I guess that would be a better way to do it.

209
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.260
Yeah, let's actually do it that way.

210
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.300
It's less, it's less CSIS.

211
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.200
And I'm not going to cut this out of the video because I just want to show you, you can do things different

212
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.830
ways.

213
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:39.180
So instead of doing this, instead of putting a border on all and then removing, let's just pick out

214
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.530
the first child.

215
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:47.000
So first child and then the ninth child.

216
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.490
Two and we'll add the border and then we there's no need to do this and it's less CSIS.

217
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.430
So if I save, we get the same result.

218
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.490
So we just added the border here and here instead of to all and then removing it.

219
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.330
All right.

220
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.060
So, I mean, you know, I could cut that out and just redo it.

221
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.150
But I want you guys to see that there's there's different ways to do things.

222
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:16.230
And sometimes you realize that when you're writing your code, I think, let's see, what do we have

223
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.390
left the page container?

224
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.420
So right now, I mean, this is done the home page.

225
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.550
But if we go to a boat and that doesn't look right, that's, you know, that's way too thin.

226
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.380
So we just want to put this we want to stack this into one column.

227
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.330
So one fr basically.

228
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:43.890
So let's take the page container and let's say grid template columns one FR.

229
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.090
So we're going to stack it.

230
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.870
And I also want to align everything to the center on, on really small screen.

231
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.750
So we'll do text align center.

232
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.220
Now if I save this, let's see.

233
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.560
Well, yeah, I guess that does work.

234
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.670
Let's look at the article page.

235
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.210
Yeah, that works.

236
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:14.040
But I do want to clear the row span because remember we do have a row span.

237
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.600
If we look at let's see, where is it?

238
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.840
If we look at the page container, first child, we have a grid row spanning here.

239
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:32.070
So I'm going to just grab that and we're going to set grid row just to one and save.

240
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.700
All right, so that looks pretty good.

241
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.750
So our site is now complete.

242
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.890
Let's let's go ahead and check it out in the actual devices.

243
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.430
So we'll open up our dev tools here, click that icon.

244
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:50.290
So this is an iPhone X, everything looks pretty good.

245
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.260
Footer is stacked.

246
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.180
We have our two borders.

247
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.190
Yeah, so that looks pretty good.

248
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.900
Let's check the about page.

249
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:00.580
All right.

250
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.590
That's that's quite a bit of text there.

251
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.050
And we probably didn't need that much text, but that's fine.

252
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:10.450
And if you guys want to add on to the I would actually suggest that you add on to these projects, you

253
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.470
know, add more pages, add more little widgets and stuff like that.

254
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:21.490
Let's see, what do we have the article page take a look at that looks pretty good.

255
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.730
If you want to stack the flex items here, you could do that.

256
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.349
But I think that that's OC.

257
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.930
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.770
Everything looks good.

259
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.410
Let's check pixel two.

260
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.430
Yep.

261
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.840
Same same deal.

262
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:41.830
Let's check the iPhone five, which is sometimes hard to to make look good.

263
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.210
But I think that this is pretty good about page.

264
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:53.170
Oh you know what we should do is lessen the font size for the LX heading on mobile devices.

265
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.280
So we'll say L dash heading.

266
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.140
I think I have it set to three rem.

267
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:07.120
So let's set font size to two rem OC and yeah, that looks that looks more that looks better.

268
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:14.200
All right, guys, hopefully you enjoyed this project and hopefully you learned quite a bit about how

269
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.220
to use CSS grid and that's it.

270
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.190
Thanks for watching, guys.

271
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.120
I appreciate it.
