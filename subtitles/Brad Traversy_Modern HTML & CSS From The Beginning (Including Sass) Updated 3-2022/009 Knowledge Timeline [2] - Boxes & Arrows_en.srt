1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,780
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,780
So now we're going to get to the fun part, which is the time line.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,780
So let's go to our style Cscs and let's start off with the timeline.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,130
UL So we'll say timeline.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,750
UL And it's not much.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:25,530
We just want to add the background, let's say background, which is going to be the primary color.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,560
So we'll save that and we see no difference there.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,940
But I just want to add that and then padding, we're going to do 50 pixels, top and bottom zero left

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,390
and right.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,340
So we just move that down a little bit.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:53,730
Now for the list items, let's do timeline ul ly and we want to set the list style to none.

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,420
So make sure there's no bullet points.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,960
And then we want to position this relative.

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,480
And the reason for that is we're going to position some of the stuff inside of it absolute.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,430
So we want to make sure this is relative and then we're going to set the width to six pixels and we're

16
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,650
going to and you'll see why in a little bit.

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,410
But we're going to set the margin zero auto so that pushes it into the middle.

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:30,570
And then we're going to say some give it some padding top of let's do 50 pixels.

19
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,910
So for each list item and then the background, we're going to do white.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:50,010
So what we've done here is we've created our line, as you can see, which is a has a width of six pixels.

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,490
Now the boxes that are going to be coming off the sides are actually going to be the divs.

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,720
So if you look in our HTML inside the ly, we have the divs.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,240
So those are going to be the boxes.

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,550
So that's why I put six pixels for the ly itself because it's basically just the line.

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,930
So let's go down here, let's say boxes.

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,370
Actually, right here.

27
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,480
What we'll do is we'll say create line.

28
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:33,650
And let's see, we're going to take timeline ul ly div and let's say position relative.

29
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,860
And from the bottom we're going to say zero.

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,980
So we're going to start from the zero, from the bottom, and then we're going to set the width of the

31
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,560
initial width of the boxes to 400 pixels.

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,560
So now we have each div is 400 pixels wide and we need some padding.

33
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,350
So padding will say one, REM gives it some padding.

34
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,360
We also want a background.

35
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,500
So we'll do background and let's use our secondary color.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,010
So we'll say var and let's say dash, dash, secondary color and save.

37
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,470
And now we start to see our boxes forming.

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,950
Now I want to add a transition on this because ultimately if we add our JavaScript, we'll have some

39
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,970
animation.

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:38,810
So we're going to add transition all and let's say 0.5 seconds and let's do is ease in out.

41
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,090
Okay, so that's all divs.

42
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,880
Now the way I want to do this is the right side because remember, we're going to have them on the right

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,390
and the left.

44
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,670
The right side is going to be the odd and the left side will be the even.

45
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,240
Now, remember, we have the nth child selector and we can choose odd.

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:07,290
And even so let's go down here and let's say right side.

47
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,830
So we're going to take the timeline

48
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:22,230
ugly and we want to choose the North Dash child and let's take all the odd and we want the div.

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,600
We want to make sure we're targeting the divs.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,390
The divs is what happened was where the box with the padding 400 pixels wide that's the div not the

51
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,630
line.

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:40,170
And then here we're going to say from the left, we want this to be 40 pixels and we'll save and notice

53
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,070
that all the odds now are 40 pixels from the left.

54
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,800
So for the left side, we'll go ahead and just copy this.

55
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:58,560
And let's say left side, we're going to choose the evens and we're going to say from the left, we

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
want to go.

57
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:06,000
Now, remember, what we're saying is from the from the middle here, which is the left, we want to

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,020
go this way.

59
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:15,030
So we're going to do -434 pixels and save, and that's going to bring it to the other side.

60
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,750
Now, I want to have the little dots here for each item in the timeline.

61
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,640
So let's go down here and let's say dots and the dots.

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:37,410
It's going to be timeline ul ly and we're going to say after so we're going to use the after pseudo

63
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:45,510
selector, let's say content, nothing and position absolute.

64
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,180
So remember we created this this line here with the ly.

65
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,380
So we're just saying after that we want to position this absolute.

66
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:02,580
We want to say from the left 50% and we're going to set from the bottom.

67
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,480
Zero and let's set the width.

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,250
So the width of the dot, I'm going to say 25 pixels height, also 25 pixels.

69
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,310
Now if I save that, we're not going to see it yet because there's no background.

70
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,740
It's basically just just invisible.

71
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,510
So let's say background and I'm just going to inherit.

72
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,010
So it should be.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,770
Well, actually, let's what I want to do is I want it to be white to begin with.

74
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,200
But once the sides are once they're brought in, when we use the JavaScript, I then want it to be filled

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,950
with blue.

76
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,990
But for now or I'm sorry, not blue, but the primary color, but for now let's just use the primary

77
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,590
color.

78
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,890
So we'll say dash, dash, primary color.

79
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,020
And if we save it's you can see do we want.

80
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,280
No, we want secondary.

81
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,230
You can't see it.

83
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,220
So let's say secondary color.

84
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,970
All right.

85
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,340
Now I want to move it over and I also want to make it into a circle.

86
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,700
So to move it over, I'm going to add a transform, because remember, we can do transform, translate

87
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,390
to move it.

88
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,500
So let's say translate and we want to translate on the x axis.

89
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,370
So we're going to use translate x and we want to bring it over negative however much to the left we

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:24,850
put it.

91
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,010
So we put it 50% to the left.

92
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,610
So we want to say -50% and save, and that will bring it right smack dab in the middle.

93
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:42,690
And then let's make it into a circle by just simply doing border radius 50% and save those.

94
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,360
There we go.

95
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,450
Okay, so now we have our dots.

96
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,460
Let's see.

97
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,690
So the next thing.

98
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,740
Actually.

99
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,700
Yeah, that's good.

100
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:02,690
So let's add a transition because like I said, when we add the JavaScript, I want it to be white at

101
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:10,730
first and then and then transition to to blue when, when a certain class is added.

102
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,980
That's basically what the JavaScript is going to do.

103
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,430
It's going to add a certain class that will do certain things like position these, so slide them in

104
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,650
and also change the color of this.

105
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,250
But for it to do it smoothly, we need to add a transition.

106
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:31,670
So let's transition the background 0.5 seconds and ease and out.

107
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,200
So let's see, the next thing I want to work on is the arrows because we want little arrows pointing

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,789
to the dot and the way that we can do that is manipulating the border.

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
So let's go.

110
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,210
Yeah.

111
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,660
We'll go.

112
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,970
Great.

113
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,050
Right down here.

114
00:08:51,070 --> 00:09:00,970
Now we're going to the arrows are going to be on the div before, so we're going to say timeline div

115
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:08,680
before and we're going to have to we'll have some styles that will pertain to just the left and just

116
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,630
the right, because obviously the arrows will be facing a different way depending on if it's on the

117
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,130
left or right box.

118
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,360
But we're going to add some similar styles to all of the arrows.

119
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,340
So let's say content, just blank quotes, and then we want a position absolute.

120
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,480
So it's going to be positioned absolute within the div and we're going to say let's go from the bottom

121
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,460
five pixels up because we want it to be we don't want it to be right at the bottom.

122
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:49,480
We want it to be like up five pixels and then we're going to set the width to zero and the height to

123
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,550
zero because the board, the arrows are going to come from the border.

124
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,830
It's going to be just from the border width.

125
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,310
And then let's set border style to solid.

126
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:11,300
Now the reason I'm just doing border style here is because whether it's on the left or the right, it

127
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,730
the style is going to be solid.

128
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,990
However, the width and the color are going to have different properties depending on if it's on the

129
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,040
left or the right.

130
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,690
So let's go down here.

131
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,660
Actually, I'll put a comment here and I'll say arrows.

132
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,330
I'll say arrows base.

133
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:38,690
And let's go down here and let's say right arrows or right side arrows.

134
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,040
And notice if I save, we have these see these little dots or these little squares on each side.

135
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,390
That's what we created with this this whole style right here.

136
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,130
If I get rid of that and save those, those squares disappear.

137
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,800
So we've created that.

138
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:04,940
Now, what I want to do is grab this the odd div, because that's the right side.

139
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,120
And we'll paste that in and remember that before selector is is how we're creating these arrows.

140
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,740
So we want to do colon before and let's move it over.

141
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,130
So we'll say from the left, -15 pixels.

142
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:28,080
If I save that, you'll see that now this has moved over and the way that we can get this to basically

143
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,730
shaped like a like a point using CCIS is with the border width and border colour in certain spots.

144
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,590
So border width we can do top right, bottom left.

145
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:50,040
So we're going to do eight pixels, top 16 pixels right, eight pixels bottom and zero left.

146
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,660
So top right, bottom left.

147
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,220
And if I save that you'll see that it just gets bigger really.

148
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,540
Now we only want to colour certain, certain parts of it.

149
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,620
We want to make transparent in certain parts, we want to colour.

150
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:13,440
So let's do border dash colour and we're going to say transparent for the first value.

151
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,930
Second is going to be the secondary colour.

152
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:22,110
So var secondary colour and then the next two will be transparent.

153
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:24,960
All right.

154
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Now if I save that, it turns into an arrow or it's shaped like an arrow, and this is done with with

155
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,360
just the border.

156
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,650
It's a solid border.

157
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,410
We give it widths on each on each side and set it to transparent except one side.

158
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,600
And we get this point effect.

159
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:49,230
And if we move this, if we add to like, let's say bottom 25, we can move the arrow up if we want,

160
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,930
but we want it right on par with the circle.

161
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,700
So five pixels is good.

162
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,650
It's basically right in the middle there.

163
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:05,580
And for the other side for this over here, let's just copy this, paste that in and say left side arrows

164
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,890
change this to even because that's the left and we're going to set the position to be from the right

165
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,320
15, 15 pixels.

166
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,630
And then we need to change this stuff up because if I save this, you'll see that it's it's pointing

167
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,650
the wrong way.

168
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:28,980
So we want to change the width to be eight pixels, top zero eight pixels, and then 16 at the end.

169
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,840
All right.

170
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,180
So if I save that, we can't even see it because we need to change this.

171
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,450
The colour pattern up basically we want transparent for the first three and then have the secondary

172
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,470
colour as the last value like that and save.

173
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,100
And there we go.

174
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,780
So now we have our arrows.

175
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:56,070
So it's kind of cool that you can do this kind of stuff with CSS and it's a little difficult to understand,

176
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:04,650
but you know, you'll, you'll get the hang of it as you create stuff like this more and more so and

177
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,700
this is kind of advanced.

178
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,850
This is this is pretty, pretty advanced CSS.

179
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,580
So we have our points.

180
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,990
This looks pretty good.

181
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,860
I think what we need to do next is make it responsive, because if I make this smaller, you'll see

182
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,960
it's basically just it's just stuck in that width no matter what I do.

183
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,550
So in the next video, we're going to add some media queries and we're just going to change a couple

184
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,190
of things up, depending on the screen size.
