1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,420
All right.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,450
So in the last video, we set up our file structure for our little website here and we created the nav

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,800
bar and also styled it.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,690
So we have this nav bar at the top.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,460
The next thing we want to do is the showcase area, which is this right here, this background image,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,530
this text, this button here.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,090
So that's what we're going to move on to.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,270
So within the header, so we have our header tag, we have the nav and then under the nav is where we

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,010
want to put our showcase.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,240
So I'm just going to use a div here and I'm going to give it an ID of showcase.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,400
And inside here we're going to want another container.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,440
So let me explain why we need this.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:44,850
If I stretch this out, if we don't put a container, our content is going to go all the way over here,

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,160
just like you saw with the nav bar on the last video.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,700
So we don't want the container around the showcase because then the image would be constricted, right?

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,820
So we want the showcase to go all the way out, but we want the content inside to be within a container.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,270
So let's go ahead and add a class of container here and then all of this stuff, the heading button

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,870
paragraph.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:18,750
I'm going to put that inside of a class called, let's call it showcase dash content because that's

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,170
what it is.

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,150
It's the content within the showcase.

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,100
So inside here we have an H one that says, enjoy your stay.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,810
And then underneath that we have a paragraph which I think it's 15, I'm just going to do lorem 15 enter.

24
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,900
And then underneath that we have a link and this is actually going to go to the about page.

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,800
So about HTML and for the text we'll say about our hotel.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,330
So if we take a look, it should look like this.

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,250
Now there's a couple of things that I left out here that we need to add.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,210
One, if you notice, the enjoy is a different color.

29
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,800
So the way it is now, there's there's no way for us to actually target that.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,100
Right?

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,360
There's just this one word.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,450
Of course, we could we could make the H one all that color.

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,950
But I just want that one word.

34
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:23,940
So what I'll do is surround that in a span and I'm going to give it a class of text dash primary just

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,600
the enjoy.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,020
So this ending span, we want to cut that and we want to put that right after enjoy like that and then

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,910
this text primary will style it to just have this color and we can put that wherever we want.

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,860
You can see down here, the history also has that color so we can use that same class down there.

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,900
Another thing I want to do is add a class to the paragraph and call it lead because it's bigger than

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,890
the rest of the text.

41
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,360
So it'll be it'll be just a larger font size.

42
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,890
And then the link, obviously the link is, is formatted like a button.

43
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:09,690
So let's give this a class as well of BTN and that should do it as far as the HTML.

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,590
So let's save that and let's go to our CSS.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,670
So let's go down below the nav bar and let's add our our styles for the showcase.

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,780
So of course we want to style the actual showcase which has an ID of showcase I believe.

47
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,170
Right.

48
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,440
Yep.

49
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,130
Right here.

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,130
And that's what we want to add the background image to.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,560
So remember background or background image and we want to use the URL and then the image is located

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,510
in if we look at our file structure, it's located in this IMG folder.

53
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,680
Now since we're inside of the CSS folder, right?

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,590
We're in the style sheet that's inside of the CSS folder.

55
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:02,070
We can't do dot slash, IMG slash, and then the name we have to do dot, dot, slash because we need

56
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,840
to go outside of the CSS.

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,530
So the the double dot means that we're going outside of the current file and then we want to go into

58
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,730
the image folder and then we want to choose the showcase jpeg.

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,510
A single dot would mean we're looking in the the current, the current folder double is going to mean

60
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:29,040
we want to go outside of the current folder and then we're just going to add no repeat, let's do no

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,810
repeat and then let's do center center.

62
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,290
So this is the, the background position and then we want it to cover the whole thing as well.

63
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,760
So let's save that.

64
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,260
Now obviously we want the showcase to be we want a bigger height than this.

65
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,800
So I'm going to set the height to 600 pixels and save.

66
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,490
Good.

67
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,710
So now you can see that it's the same height.

68
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,620
And the reason that when I click over you see how the links move over and stuff.

69
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,550
That's because of the scroll bar right here.

70
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,630
There's no scroll bar here because there's no it doesn't go down far enough yet.

71
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:10,890
All right.

72
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,430
So now we want to target the showcase content.

73
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,570
So I'm going to say ID showcase and we have a class of showcase dash content.

74
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,700
And first of all, I want all the color, anything that's inside of there.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,910
I want to be white except for the link.

76
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,970
The link will have to actually add the color ourselves for that.

77
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,600
And then we want to align everything to the center.

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,150
So we want to do text align center.

79
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,920
So if I do that, everything gets aligned to the center and let's push everything down.

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:51,240
So I'm going to do a padding top of 170 pixels and that pushes everything down.

81
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,170
All right.

82
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,900
Now, let's let's work on the H one.

83
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,820
So we'll do showcase

84
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:07,560
showcase content and then we want to target the H one and I want that to be bigger.

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:15,630
So I'm going to say font size and let's set it to we'll do 60 pixels, so save that.

86
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,860
So that's much bigger.

87
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:25,500
Let's do a line height of, let's say 1.2 M and then.

88
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,720
Let's do padding.

89
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,780
Actually, we don't need to do that because we already have the padding bottom on all of the.

90
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,490
On H one, h two and H three.

91
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,290
So we don't need to add that here.

92
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,120
All right.

93
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,440
Now, that's the h one.

94
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,200
Let's.

95
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,980
Let's add the text primary class.

96
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,980
So remember we added the class of text primary.

97
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,560
Now we don't want to put like h one text primary because I want to be able to use this class absolutely

98
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,040
anywhere.

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,630
So it's more of a utility class.

100
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,690
So I'm going to put that up here right under container.

101
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,250
All right.

102
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,030
So text primary, we're going to use color and let's see the color that we want.

103
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,640
Is hexadecimal, it's going to be F seven, c zero.

104
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,080
Eight.

105
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,710
A So same as as the the hovered link right here.

106
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,780
So if I save that now only that word enjoy has that color.

107
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,100
Let's go back down to showcase and finish that up.

108
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:45,930
So we have the H one now the paragraph here, we want the font size to be larger, but remember it has

109
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,370
a class of lead.

110
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,520
So actually let's add that up top as well.

111
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,890
So right under tech's primary.

112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,430
And let's see, I forget the font size.

113
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,840
I want four lead.

114
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,540
Uh, let's do 18 pixels.

115
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,670
Font size, 18 pixels.

116
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,990
I think she looks a little bit bigger than that.

117
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,070
Let's do 20.

118
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,040
All right.

119
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,010
So font size, 20 pixels for the lead class.

120
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,490
And hopefully you guys understand what I mean by utility classes.

121
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,180
I mean that these are just classes that will be we'll use throughout the site.

122
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,360
They're not specific to any specific area, like it's not specific to the showcase or to the nav bar.

123
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,710
We can use them anywhere.

124
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,809
So let's go back down now to the showcase and.

125
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,480
The showcase paragraph.

126
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,760
Let's see.

127
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,670
Just want to see if we want to add anything to that.

128
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Let's let's give that some padding bottom, actually.

129
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:08,800
So we'll grab this and put in paragraph or P and let's let's add padding dash bottom, we'll say 20

130
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,060
pixels just to push the button or the link down below.

131
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,830
And you know what?

132
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,750
Let's increase the line height a little bit too.

133
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,800
Here, we'll say line height for the paragraph.

134
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,750
Let's try 1.5.

135
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,470
I do seven.

136
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,190
There we go.

137
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,390
All right.

138
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,570
So now let's move on to the link here.

139
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:38,750
Now, this is going to be another utility class because I want to be able to format links into buttons

140
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,010
just by using that BTN class that we added.

141
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:52,670
So we want to go up above here and go right under lead and let's say Dot BTN and let's first of all

142
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,430
display it as an inline block.

143
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,350
So save that there's going to be no difference just by doing that.

144
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:08,280
But we don't want it to go all the way across like a block, but we also don't want it to be in line.

145
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,040
So let's say font size.

146
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
We'll set that to 18 pixels, make it a little bigger.

147
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,380
Let's set the color to white and let's set the background.

148
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,990
Background is going to be three, three, three.

149
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:31,930
Okay.

150
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,830
Obviously, we need some padding here.

151
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:42,530
So for padding, let's do 13 on the top and bottom and let's do 20 on the left and right like that.

152
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,200
OC And then I think the last thing, let's make sure that there's no border on any browser.

153
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:56,150
So let's say border none because we want to if we have buttons, we want to be able to add this to the

154
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,380
button as well.

155
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,640
And buttons by default have borders, links don't, but buttons do.

156
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,800
OC So now when we hover over this, we get a pointer.

157
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
But again, buttons do not.

158
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,830
If you use a button tag, it doesn't.

159
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,930
And we want to be able to add this to those as well.

160
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,150
So let's make sure we do cursor pointer and then we want to hover state.

161
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,790
We want it to be this color if we hover over it.

162
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:29,810
So let's actually copy this color, this hexadecimal right here from text primary and let's say BTN

163
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:41,210
Colon Hover and let's set background to that color and set the color of the text to dark and save.

164
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,940
And now when we hover over it, we get that color.

165
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,760
All right, so that's the showcase.

166
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,650
So now let's do the the home info section.

167
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,410
So this right here, meaning the the image and this part I'm calling home info.

168
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,810
And we want this to be a section.

169
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,630
So let's go below the header and you'll see a common theme throughout my projects.

170
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,790
I usually have a header at the top and then every other part in the page is going to be a section up

171
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,600
until the footer.

172
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,970
Then we'll use the HTML five footer tag.

173
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,250
So let's do a section and I usually gives the sections in the ID that describes them.

174
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,010
So I'm going to call this home dash info.

175
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,180
All right.

176
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,870
And as far as naming conventions, I like to use dashes.

177
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,840
When I use if I have more than one word inside of an ID or class, I usually use a dash or a hyphen.

178
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,280
Some people will use underscores or some people will even use none.

179
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,570
It's all up to you.

180
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,850
Like I said, I like to use dashes.

181
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,520
So inside here, let's see.

182
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,150
I actually want the background of this whole thing to be dark.

183
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,230
And there's other parts of the site where I'm going to want that as well.

184
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,340
So actually I think it's just the full yeah right here.

185
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:05,510
So this part I want also to have dark and what I'm going to do is create a utility class called BG Dark.

186
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,310
We're going to have different background utility classes now doing stuff like this.

187
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,160
You don't have to I mean, you could just style each individual element like home info with the background

188
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,600
dark and then when I get to this part, I could target this and put background whatever 333, which

189
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,710
is the dark gray.

190
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,680
Or we can have nice clean utility classes where if we have, if we add on to the website later, if

191
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,590
we add more pages, we have that class available to us.

192
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,970
It's almost like using a framework, but it's like it's your own framework.

193
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:49,220
So I'm going to add a class of BG Dash Dark, and then inside here we're going to need these two sections

194
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,490
or two.

195
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,720
I shouldn't say sections, but two areas we have one which is going to be an image, a background image,

196
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,780
and then one which is going to be this area with the text.

197
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:06,290
So let's go ahead and add in here class of info.

198
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,250
I'm going to do class of info, dash img and then right under that, not within it, but under it.

199
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,660
We want to do a class of info dash content.

200
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,970
So this is the info IMG, this is the info content.

201
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:29,930
And inside the content I'm going to use an H two and I'm going to say the actually let's put a span

202
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,100
in here as well.

203
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:38,990
Let's do a span with the class of text primary because in that span we want the history.

204
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:46,490
So the history and then outside of the span, we'll finish that, we'll say of our hotel.

205
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,880
And by the way, I know this doesn't look that great.

206
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,190
It's because it's not this is not responsive.

207
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,210
It's somewhat responsive where we use the max width and stuff like that.

208
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,800
But later on when we talk about media queries and stuff, we'll get more into building responsive websites.

209
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:11,780
So after the H two, we're going to want this text right here, which I'm not sure.

210
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,100
I think it's 40 or 40, but I'm not exactly sure.

211
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,480
So I'm going to copy the exact text and I'm going to put it in a paragraph.

212
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,760
And you guys have the finished project in the in the first video of the section as well, if you want

213
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,870
to copy anything.

214
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,560
All right, then under the paragraph, if I make this bigger, you'll see we actually have a read more

215
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,780
button here.

216
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,290
So let's go ahead and add in a tag and let's do class BTN.

217
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,290
And again, I want to be able to have we have different buttons.

218
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,420
This one's dark, this one's light.

219
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,660
So I'm going to have a utility class of BTN light in addition to BTN.

220
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:56,970
Okay.

221
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,200
So we want to do that.

222
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,280
And then this is just going to go this will go to the about page as well.

223
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,160
It's not a big site, so we don't have too many options here and that should be it for the home info.

224
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,750
So if we save that and go back, I forgot to put text in here.

225
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:18,240
This should say read more and there we go.

226
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:18,930
All right.

227
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,340
Now let's let's start with the button.

228
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,650
So notice it has all the traits of this one because they both have the class of BTN.

229
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,530
The only difference is I want this one to be light.

230
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:40,560
So we'll go back to our CSS and go up to where we have our BTN class and right under the BTN class we're

231
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,430
going to do.

232
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,700
Dot BTN.

233
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,110
Light.

234
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,740
So we have a light version and we're going to set the background.

235
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,900
Two.

236
00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:00,430
Let's do hexadecimal F for three times and then set the colour of the text to dark.

237
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,970
So now if I save that, notice that it gets all the traits of the BTN, meaning the padding, the font

238
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,609
size, all that stuff.

239
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,300
It just has a different colour.

240
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,060
Whoops.

241
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,310
That should be three, three, three.

242
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,410
There we go.

243
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,839
And if we wanted to have a different hover or color for the light, we could.

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,770
But I'm just going to keep it as is.

245
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:31,670
So now let's let's work on floating the image, which we don't even have yet, but we're going to add

246
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:37,790
a background image to this div right here, this info image we want that floated to the left and then

247
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,130
we want info content to the right.

248
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,530
So let's go.

249
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,850
Down below showcase and let's say home info.

250
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:59,450
So home dash oops, home dash info itself.

251
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:08,990
I'm going to give this a height of 400 pixels and that should be all we need for for the home info itself.

252
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:19,130
So for the image we want to do home dash info and we want to target the class of info dash img and let's

253
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:19,910
add.

254
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,640
Uh, let's see.

255
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,370
First of all, let's float it to the left, and we want it half and half.

256
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,430
So I'm going to do with 50%.

257
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,750
And then let's give it a background of Earl.

258
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:42,730
We want to go outside of the CSS folder into image and then we want the let's see, we want photo one

259
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,500
dot JPEG.

260
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,450
So let's put quotes around this.

261
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,540
And then.

262
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:03,170
Let's do no repeat and then we just want to set a min height of 100% because we want the image to take

263
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,880
up the whole space.

264
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,830
So let's save that.

265
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,520
All right, good.

266
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,040
So now let's do the content side.

267
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:21,920
So home info and we want info dash content and we want to float, right?

268
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,060
We want to set the width to 50%.

269
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm going to set the height to 100% and I want to align everything to the center.

270
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,200
So text align to the center.

271
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,110
And let's add some padding.

272
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:46,040
So we'll do 50 top and bottom, 30 left and right, and then let's just do overflow hidden.

273
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,220
So if anything goes outside of it, there's no scroll bars and save.

274
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,080
Good.

275
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:59,870
Now notice how the background is white because the BG dot class is what's going to handle that, the

276
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,580
background color being dark.

277
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,130
So let's add that as a utility class.

278
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:14,660
So we're going to go up above here and let's go right here under the BTN light and do BG Dark and let's

279
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:21,920
say background and we'll set that to three, three, three and you want to set the color to be light,

280
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,730
to be white.

281
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,340
Now while we're here, we might as well add some of the other BG classes because I want to be able to

282
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,690
do a background light and also a background primary.

283
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,270
Now the primary color in this is this tannis color.

284
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,120
So I want to be able to have those as background.

285
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:49,100
So let's copy this and let's do BG Light and let's see, BG Light will be F four, but we want to change

286
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:56,010
the color to three, three, three and then BG primary, just like text primary.

287
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,560
Up here we have text primary, except we want the background to be that color.

288
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,830
Which is right here.

289
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,980
Okay.

290
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,310
Now, if I save this, we get this background.

291
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,720
Doc bg doc.

292
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,620
So the last thing I want to do here is the, the content info, the paragraph.

293
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,550
I just want to add a little bit of padding to the bottom because you see how close this is.

294
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:34,000
So I'm going to go back down, copy this and target the paragraph and just say padding bottom and let's

295
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,350
say 30 pixels.

296
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,790
So that'll push it down.

297
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,650
And that's it.

298
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,460
There we go.

299
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,950
So this is starting to look pretty good and hopefully things aren't too confusing.

300
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:51,430
So we basically just have our header, our header has our nav bar and the showcase.

301
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,860
And then underneath that we have our home info.

302
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:01,750
And then along the way we have some utility classes like text primary, BG, Primary, BTN, BTN Lite.

303
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,440
Hopefully you can just kind of see how everything's coming together.

304
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,170
So in the next video we're going to work on the three boxes below and we're also going to start to look

305
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,430
at Font Awesome, which is a fantastic service, very easy to use.

306
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,040
We just have to include a certain stylesheet and then use some certain classes and we can get some some

307
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,150
nice icons.

308
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,630
All right.

309
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,100
So I'll see you in the next video.
