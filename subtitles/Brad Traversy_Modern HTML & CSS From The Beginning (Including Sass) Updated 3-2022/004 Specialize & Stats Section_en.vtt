00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.840
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.900
So in the last video we did the header, the nav bar, basically the landing part of the website on

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.800
the index page.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.990
Now we're going to continue with the index page.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.290
And I also have a tab with the finished product just to see what we're going to be getting at.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.910
Now, the way I'm going to format this is each page is going to have sections.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.050
So the sections I'm going to give an idea of the page name and then a BCD and so on.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.530
And the reason for that is you might end up changing the content.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.790
So I don't want to call this like section specialized or something like that.

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.910
I'm going to call this section home.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.020
A This will be home B, this will be home C and then this will be the footer on the about page, you'll

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.990
have about A, about B, about C and so on.

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.810
So let's go ahead and move on to this right here.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.820
This specialize in part.

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.630
So I'm going to jump into index.html and let's go ahead and put a comment in here and we'll just say

16
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.050
section A and we can put what it is in the comment because that's always easy to change.

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.430
So we'll do specialize.

18
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.730
So let's do section with an ID of section.

19
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.800
I'm sorry, not section home because we want to because we don't want to have section A on the home

20
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.170
page and then section A on the about page.

21
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.120
So we're going to do home A and let's also.

22
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.250
Yeah.

23
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.090
Let's do this now.

24
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.700
So I'm going to give this a couple of utility classes.

25
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.870
Now, we already have a text center utility class because I want everything centered.

26
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.180
I'm also going to create some padding classes as we've done before.

27
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.540
I want py meaning padding on the top and bottom too.

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.920
So we'll, we'll add, we'll create that class later on, but let's just finish the markup for now.

29
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.550
So pretty much every section is going to have a container.

30
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.430
We want to move everything to the middle.

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.780
Let's do an H two and we're going to have a class of section dash title and we'll say, I specialize

32
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:23.440
in and underneath the H two, we're going to just have a class of bottom dash line.

33
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.460
And just to show you what that's going to look like, it's going to be this right here.

34
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.050
So we can use that around the site under the bottom line.

35
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.160
Let's do a paragraph with the class of lead.

36
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:48.310
And in here we're going to say so we're saying I specialize in and then we'll say, uh, photography

37
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.220
as well as creating digital masterpieces.

38
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.910
I might misspell some stuff here, guys, but I really don't care.

39
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:18.220
So in UI UX layouts for websites, for websites and mobile applications, we'll be a bit more descriptive

40
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.970
than some of our other projects where we just use just alarm ipsum.

41
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.610
So underneath the paragraph we're going to have a class of specials

42
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.910
and inside here we're going to have some divs and we're going to be using the grid for this as well.

43
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.650
So each div is going to have an icon.

44
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.160
So let's put an icon here, let's do a face.

45
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.230
And then we want a class of F, a dash file, dash alt.

46
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.030
That's the icon we want to use.

47
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.160
And then if we want to make an icon bigger font awesome have has classes for that, we're going to do

48
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.990
F dash to X.

49
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.490
So that's our icon.

50
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.570
Then we're going to put an H three and this is going to be concept and then a paragraph.

51
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.830
And I believe I did form 20.

52
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.780
It should be right.

53
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.610
And then what we'll do is just copy this whole div and we want four of these.

54
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.140
So we've got one, two, three, four and then I'm just going to change the second one here.

55
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:33.850
Let's do instead of this file all let's do f a dash desktop and the heading is going to be UI, dash

56
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.930
UX.

57
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.090
And then this third one here will be F a dash object dash UN group.

58
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.190
These are just icons I found on font.

59
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.910
Awesome.

60
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:56.050
And then this is going to be visual design and then this last one here is going to be thumbs up.

61
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.750
So thumbs dash up and the heading for this is going to be interaction.

62
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.110
So that is section A.

63
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.140
And if we take a look at it, our version, it looks like this, which looks pretty crappy.

64
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.990
So we're going to add the CSS for this.

65
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.720
So let's jump into VS code.

66
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.880
And before I start with the specific styles here, let's go to our utilities and let's add in, let's

67
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.770
create our padding classes.

68
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.590
All right.

69
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:39.910
So for padding, I want to have padding on the top and bottom.

70
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.780
So we're going to use the PY so we can actually just do class.

71
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:53.200
PY And then for each one we can do like ampersand dash one, which will be p-1 and I'm going to set

72
00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:03.400
the padding to let's do one REM, top and bottom zero REM left and right.

73
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.250
And then we can just basically just copy this down.

74
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.600
Let's do four of them.

75
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.610
So one, two, three and four.

76
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.300
Second one will be two.

77
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.190
We'll just do two, three, REM, four, REM.

78
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.050
All right.

79
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.130
So if I save that and we take a look, we should have some padding here.

80
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.270
Let's check it out.

81
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.930
Looks like we do, but let's make sure.

82
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.690
So, yeah, we can see the padding in the green.

83
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.610
And if and if you guys want to extend it a little more, if you want to use P three instead, anything

84
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.800
like that, feel free to do that.

85
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.040
Now while we're at it, we might as well add some margin classes like this.

86
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.240
And I mean, if you want to put it all on one line, like if you want to do that to clean it up, you

87
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.200
might you can do that.

88
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.450
But if you use prettier and you save by default, it's going to format it like this just to let you

89
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.900
know.

90
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.610
So let's do margin.

91
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:13.300
This will be my and then we're just going to change these for to margin.

92
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.650
So that should be good.

93
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.010
Let's save that.

94
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.220
And now let's go back to our main file because now we want to target the actual home a ID.

95
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.540
All right.

96
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.370
So for the home styles, let's put a comment in here.

97
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.640
Let's just say home sections.

98
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:52.030
So we have ID home and let's do ampersand a which will target home dash A Now I'm going to target the

99
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:57.490
specials class and like I said, I want to use the grid.

100
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.280
I'm actually going to add a little bit of margin to the top, though.

101
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.350
So let's do margin top.

102
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:10.660
We'll do three REM and let's do display grid OC.

103
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:19.330
We're going to add a grid gap of one REM and let's do our grid column.

104
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.190
So grid dash.

105
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.790
Uh, grid dash template columns.

106
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:34.919
And I'm just going to do a repeat and let's say repeat four times one fraction.

107
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.010
So we'll have four even columns.

108
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.679
And then the icon I actually want to make the main color.

109
00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.490
So inside specials, we're going to grab the class of FE.

110
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.020
What is it, Fe?

111
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.700
S because each icon has a class of face.

112
00:08:53.710 --> 00:09:00.840
So let's grab on to that and let's set the color to the main color.

113
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.310
All right.

114
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:09.900
And then I'm just going to add a padding bottom of 0.4 REM.

115
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.840
So let's take a look at that.

116
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.120
And that looks pretty good.

117
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.430
So we set this this is the div with the class of specials.

118
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:27.630
We set that to be a grid and we set template columns of repeat for one FR so they're all even.

119
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:34.440
And then we have a grid gap of one REM in between and we change the icon colors.

120
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.070
So let's move on to the section B, which is this part here.

121
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:54.000
So we'll jump back into our index HTML and let's go under the last section here and let's put a comment.

122
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.890
We'll say section B, which is basically stats, so the awards and stuff like that.

123
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:09.150
So we're going to do section with the class of home, dash B, let's do some utility classes.

124
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.470
So text center and let's let's also do py2.

125
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.810
So padding on the top and bottom.

126
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.180
And then I'm going to have a class of stats.

127
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.080
We're also going to use the grid here and let's do a div.

128
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:31.080
So each div is going to have a UL and the first list item here is going to be an icon.

129
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:42.240
So let's do an I, I tag with the class of face and I'm going to do f a dash users and then let's do

130
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:52.830
an ly with the class of stats dash title and we're going to do clients and then let's do an ly with

131
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.660
the class of stats.

132
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.540
Dash number and I'm going to say 100.

133
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.010
All right.

134
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.300
And then I'm just going to copy this div and we're going to have four of these as well.

135
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.050
So two, three, four, I'm going to save.

136
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:16.020
And then let's go and change the second one from starting with the icon.

137
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.060
We're going to do a award.

138
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.840
Oh, one thing I forgot is I want to make these icons bigger.

139
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.180
So we want to add a-3x for all of these.

140
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.190
So let's just do that.

141
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.180
And then we have Fay Award.

142
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.430
Let's change this to awards.

143
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.750
And let's say that this user or this developer has three awards.

144
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.310
Okay.

145
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.750
Next one is going to be ours.

146
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.040
Work so far.

147
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.220
Dash our hourglass.

148
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.770
Dash start.

149
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:59.380
I'll say hours worked and let's do 3500.

150
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.870
It's just a random number.

151
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.000
I don't know if that's a lot or a little or what.

152
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:14.440
And then this icon here is going to be a code dash branch and you can find all these in the font awesome

153
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.000
website.

154
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:26.230
And then this is going to be projects completed and let's do 135.

155
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.120
So we'll save that.

156
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.920
Let's see what it looks like without CSIS.

157
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.930
So it looks absolutely horrible.

158
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:43.150
So now let's go back to Main CSIS, and now we're going to deal with with the Section B, so just like

159
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.280
we did here.

160
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:53.650
So this ends right here, we're going to do ampersand, dash B and if you want to put comments here

161
00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:04.870
home section B, go up here and say Home Section A.

162
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.780
So I mean, you know, certain people might like this way of doing it.

163
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.160
You might not.

164
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.840
But it's all preference.

165
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.970
I'm just giving you guys the option.

166
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:26.920
So let's take the stats that are in section B, class of stats, and let's display a grid and let's

167
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.140
do our grid dash template dash columns.

168
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:42.160
And say repeat four one FR and you could even create functions.

169
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.370
If you're seeing the same type of patterns, you could even shorten this up a little more, create functions,

170
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.560
extend styles, things like that.

171
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.200
So if you want to make this this project even better, I invite you to to do that.

172
00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:06.400
So let's take the list items and I'm going to do a line height of two for each list item.

173
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.630
All right.

174
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.430
And then remember, some of the list items have class names such as stats titles.

175
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:22.690
So I'm going to take this the list item with the class of stats dash title and let's set the font size

176
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.360
to 1.5 REM.

177
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.330
And then we also have stats number.

178
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.980
So let's say the list item with the class of stats.

179
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.980
Dash number.

180
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:53.410
And let's set the font size here to to REM and let's set the font weight to bold.

181
00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:01.840
Now, if we save that and we take a look, this is what it looks like.

182
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.680
Oh, you know what I think?

183
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.700
I forgot the container.

184
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.260
Actually.

185
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.270
No, we don't want to contain her if we look at this.

186
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:12.480
Yeah.

187
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.330
We don't want this bound inside the container.

188
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.050
That's right.

189
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.470
It'll look better once we add the colors in the background.

190
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:26.070
Now, for the colors, we're going to use any child odd and child even because we want light gray,

191
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.300
dark gray, light gray.

192
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.180
So remember, these are all divs.

193
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.680
So we'll target.

194
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.030
Let's see.

195
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:40.860
We want to go outside of no, we want to be within stats, but we want to go outside of the lie which

196
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.290
ends right here.

197
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:48.150
So right here, let's say div.

198
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.750
So for each div I'm actually going to give it some padding.

199
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:58.770
Let's do three REM, top and bottom and then we want to grab the nth child odd.

200
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:05.640
And even so we'll do Ampersand Colon and we want the nth child pseudo selector.

201
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:11.070
We want to grab the odds and let's set the background.

202
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:19.510
To the light color variable, and then we'll take the evens.

203
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:23.460
I'll just grab this and we'll say even.

204
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.810
And we're going to set that to the medium color.

205
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.830
All right.

206
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.950
Let's take a look and there we go.

207
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.450
So that looks pretty good.

208
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.720
So again, we have a grid with four columns and we're going to do the responsiveness later on for for

209
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.520
smartphones and stuff like that.

210
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.030
All right.

211
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.980
So I think I'm going to stop here in the next video.

212
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.100
We're going to get to this part where it's a little tricky.

213
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.240
We have our icons and then we have this positioned in a way.

214
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.740
So it kind of overlaps it.

215
00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:02.040
We have a transition, so we'll do that and also the footer in the next video.
