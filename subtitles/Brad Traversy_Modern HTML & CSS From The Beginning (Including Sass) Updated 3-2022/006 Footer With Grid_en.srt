1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,760
So in the last video we finished the the whole article section here, and now we're going to start to

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,210
work on the footer, which is also going to be a grid container.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:17,490
So let's go below the section here and we'll just say footer and let's give it a footer tag with an

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,820
ID of main dash footer.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,350
All right.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,760
And then inside here, we're going to have the container class to move everything to the middle.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,810
I'm also going to add a class of footer container here, which will be the actual grid container.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,190
And inside here, we're going to have basically have five divs.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,460
If we look at the project here, we're going to set it to repeat for one FR.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,200
So it has one, two, three, four and then the next one gets knocked on to the next line.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,130
Now, this last one here, we want to span across all the way.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,890
So we're going to add a grid span as well.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,940
So let's add our first div, which is going to have that light logo.

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,400
So we're going to say image.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,710
The source is going to be in the image folder and it's going to be this logo light and we'll just say

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,560
news, news grid.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,750
And then underneath that, I'm going to put a paragraph excuse me and we'll say, let's do lorem 30

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,890
actually, let's do 20.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,600
I think that's what I want.

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,750
So that's the first div and the next one is going to be the email newsletter.

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:43,770
So let's do an H three and say email news newsletter and then we're going to do a paragraph, let's

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:51,330
say lorem, we'll do lorem eight and under the paragraph we're going to have a little form.

24
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,060
Oops, we want to get rid of the action.

25
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,870
And inside here, we're going to have an input.

26
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,670
Let's give it a type of email since this is going to be an email field.

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,770
We don't need a name and ID.

28
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,170
We will put a placeholder.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,870
Oops.

30
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,080
And we'll say enter.

31
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,150
We'll say enter email.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,540
And then we want to submit button.

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:28,860
So I'm going to do an input with the type of submit and for the value we'll say subscribe and let's

34
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,150
also give this a class of BTN and I want to do BTN and Primary.

35
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,250
All right.

36
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,120
So the next thing we want is the links here.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,710
So the site links which aren't going to go anywhere, but it's just for just for the aesthetics of the

38
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,070
site.

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:58,610
So let's say DIV and we're going to have an H three and just say site links and then a UL.

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,290
Now this UL, I'm going to style, I'm going to give a class of list and I want it to be basically like

41
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,220
a utility class so that we can use this in other places as well.

42
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,860
And as far as the list items go, we're going to have links to just nowhere.

43
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,820
This first one is going to be help and support.

44
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,050
Copy this down a couple of times, four times.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,780
And let's do privacy policy.

46
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,850
It's just some common pages you see on websites we'll do about us.

47
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,080
And this one here, let's do contact.

48
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:47,730
Now, the next grid item is going to be a div as well and this is going to be that the join our club.

49
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:58,440
So we're going to do an H, let's do an H two and we'll say join our club and then let's put a paragraph

50
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:07,230
and we'll do lorem ten and then under that we'll have an A tag with the class of BTN and class of BTN

51
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,790
secondary.

52
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:21,480
And let's just say and here we'll say join now and then the final div is just going to be a paragraph

53
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,140
and in that paragraph we'll say copyright, let's do ampersand copy semicolon, which will give us a

54
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,870
little copyright symbol 2019.

55
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,390
All rights reserved.

56
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,110
All right.

57
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,550
So that's all of our HTML.

58
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,600
Let's check it out.

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,240
So it's going to look very, very ugly.

60
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,290
So we'll head over to our CSS and we have some utility classes to create, but we're going to just start

61
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,000
on the footer itself first.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,410
So let's say footer, we have an ID, so we have an ID of main dash footer.

63
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,060
Now the footer.

64
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm going to give the dark color as its background.

65
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,370
So var.

66
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,760
Let's do a dash, dash, dark color and let's make the actual color, the text white.

67
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,580
So we'll save that.

68
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,280
Now, the image is obviously way too big.

69
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,220
So let's say main dash image.

70
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:29,210
Not main image mean footer and then target the image and we want to set the width to let's do 150 pixels.

71
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,070
All right.

72
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,140
And I want all the links to be white.

73
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:42,590
So let's say main footer, all the tags, we want the colour to be white and now we're going to work

74
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,420
on the grid and aligning these.

75
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,250
We want them to go in.

76
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,400
Obviously we want to create some columns.

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:56,630
So we're going to say main footer and we're going to grab on to the footer dash container and we're

78
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,600
going to say display grid.

79
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,030
And then as far as the grid template columns, we're going to do repeat and let's repeat four times

80
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,180
one fraction and let's add a grid gap, spread them apart a little bit.

81
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,230
So we'll say 1.5 REM and save.

82
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,600
And now you can see that they're all aligned.

83
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:30,620
Now we have some some other design to do, styling to do like this, this form here, also the list.

84
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,580
But this last one here, this this copyright.

85
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,530
I want this to span all the way across.

86
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:47,540
So I'm going to target that by saying main footer and let's let's say we want from the footer container

87
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,160
a direct element that is the last child.

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,700
So even if it wasn't a div, it doesn't matter what what kind of element we're going to target it and

89
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,420
then we're going to set the background to let's do four for four.

90
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,810
And if we save that, you can see it's stuck in here.

91
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,180
So we want to span it all the way across.

92
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,130
And you guys remember how to do that.

93
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,010
We're going to do Grid Dash column

94
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,050
and we want to start at the first column and then we want to span across four.

95
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,570
We have four total, so we'll save that.

96
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,670
And now it spans all the way across.

97
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,050
Let's just add.

98
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,430
A little bit of padding here.

99
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,140
He'll say 0.5 REM.

100
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,790
Let's also text align to the center

101
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,370
and I want to make the font size just a little smaller.

102
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,680
So we're going to do 0.75 REM and save.

103
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,030
All right.

104
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,560
So let's see the footer itself.

105
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,340
Actually, you know what?

106
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,860
Let's add a padding class to the footer.

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,860
So up here, we'll say class.

108
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,070
And remember, we have the p y, which is top and bottom.

109
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,550
We'll do p two and save.

110
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,770
So now this right here, the form, the little email form, I want to style that.

111
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:31,750
So let's target main footer and let's do footer container and we're going to grab the input and I'm

112
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,270
going to say I want the input that has the type that is equal to email.

113
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:38,820
Okay.

114
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:54,760
And I'm going to set the width to 90% and let's set padding, say 0.5 REM and let's do a margin bottom

115
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,980
of 0.5 REM.

116
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,150
All right.

117
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,290
So we'll save that.

118
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,580
So that looks pretty good.

119
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,780
Now for this for this button here, I just want to set that width to 90% as well.

120
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,600
So remember that main footer,

121
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,910
that's an input and we want to say with a type is equal to submit.

122
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:32,440
And then I just want to set the width to 90%, which didn't work because we need a semicolon.

123
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,900
So that looks pretty good.

124
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,860
One thing that I forgot to do is for the paragraphs.

125
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,460
I want all paragraphs to have a little bit of margin.

126
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,330
You see how this is so close right here and right here.

127
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:53,830
So I'm just going to add let's go up top here to like our core styles and let's put in paragraph and

128
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,030
we'll say for the margin, top and bottom, we want to do 0.5 REM.

129
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,120
Such as adds a little bit of space.

130
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,500
All right.

131
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,660
So I think that looks pretty good.

132
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,280
Let's handle the list.

133
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,110
Now, like I said, I want to be able to use the list class and other places as well.

134
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,020
So we're going to add this as a utility class.

135
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,720
So let's go let's see.

136
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,910
We'll go right under the padding here and let's say dot list.

137
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,460
Actually, we don't need to style the list itself, the UL let's just do the ly and I just want to add

138
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,360
padding.

139
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:41,390
We'll say 0.5 rem, top and bottom and let's add a border bottom of five, five, five dotted, one

140
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,170
pixel.

141
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,330
And then I want to set the width to 90% and save.

142
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,400
So that looks pretty good.

143
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,100
All right.

144
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,150
Oh, you know what?

145
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,440
Let's excuse me.

146
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,180
Let's do a hover state.

147
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,250
Let's make the hover the primary color.

148
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,020
So we'll say list.

149
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,670
Let's do.

150
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,210
Whoops.

151
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,100
We want to do a dot list.

152
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,170
Like a.

153
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,650
Hover.

154
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,000
And let's say we want the color to be var primary color.

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,600
And now that's not working.

156
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm not sure why that's not working.

157
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,870
We've lost Ally.

158
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,070
A hover?

159
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:28,870
No.

160
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,890
Let's add an important flag here.

161
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,010
See if that works.

162
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,280
All right.

163
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,970
There we go.

164
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,170
Okay.

165
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,000
So that's our list styling.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,500
And I think that's it.

167
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,940
I think that's it for the footer.

168
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,350
So in the next video we're going to start to work on the inner pages.

169
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,670
We have an about page.

170
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,830
We also have an article page.

171
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,830
So we'll create those and then we'll start to work on the, the mobile version for the website.
