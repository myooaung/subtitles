00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.720
Okay.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.310
So we're going to get started and I'm just going to have the final project open here in case there's

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.840
something we need to reference.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.390
And we're going to start basically top to bottom.

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.500
I want to do the whole hero image and nav bar first.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.780
So we'll do the HTML for that and then we'll jump to the styling and then we'll move on and go section

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.680
by section.

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.370
So I'm going to open up vs code and I have all the images already in here and you can get these in the

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.840
section resources and you can see I have them all in categories.

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.500
So we have the blog images, the cases, the home images, the team and we have a fabric on PNG here

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.870
that that we're going to implement later.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
We're actually going to convert it to an ISO file and use that as our fab icon.

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.670
So let's go ahead and create in the root here index HTML, which obviously is our home page, our main

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.660
landing page.

15
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.190
And then let's also we'll create the other HTML pages later.

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.920
Let's create the CSS folder and inside there will create a style CSS.

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.880
Now, like I said in the intro, we're going to be using a lot of utility classes like for buttons and

18
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
backgrounds and stuff like that, almost like a built in framework.

19
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.720
So we can just throw these classes in where we need them.

20
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.730
So I'm actually going to have two style sheets.

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:26.040
I'm going to create another one called Utilities, CSS, and classes that will reuse as utilities will

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.670
go in here for buttons, text, background, stuff like that.

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.220
So we'll have two CSS files.

24
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.460
Now let's create a boilerplate in our HTML.

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.340
So exclamation enter and let's say welcome to Edge Ledger for our title.

26
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.490
And then we want to link in both of our style sheets.

27
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.390
Now the, the utilities, CSS, we want to put first and then under that the main style CSS.

28
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.030
That way, if we have to overwrite any of the utility styling, we can do that in our style CSS.

29
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.560
Now we're also going to be using font.

30
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.040
Awesome.

31
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.860
So we want to excuse me, we want to grab that real quick.

32
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:10.650
I'm going to go to NJ.com and just search for font and grab this right here, click on the CSS version

33
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.640
and grab the link for the all dot mini CSS file.

34
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.970
So if we say copy link tag, copy that, we can close that up and then just paste that right in the

35
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.140
head and we should be all set for now as far as the head goes.

36
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.890
So for the body, we're going to have an HTML five header tag and I'm going to give this a class of

37
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.640
hero.

38
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.170
So this is basically the entire, you know, everything above the fold, the main image and also the

39
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.240
nav bar will be within the header.

40
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.990
So let's create a div with the class of nav bar.

41
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.360
Actually, we'll give this an ID too because we're going to need it for the little bit of JavaScript

42
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.530
that we add later.

43
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.180
I mean, we could use a class, but when, when I take elements from the DOM using JavaScript, I like

44
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.380
to use an ID.

45
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.920
So within here we want our logo.

46
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.630
So that's going to be an H one.

47
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.740
I'll give it a class of logo and we're going to have our font font awesome icon here for our logo.

48
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:23.370
So face and then let's do a dash book, dash open and then just a space and edge ledger.

49
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.260
Now I do want to have the the icon or the logo and the word edge.

50
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.350
I want those to be green, as you can see right here.

51
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.210
So we're going to use a utility class called Text Primary that will create later on.

52
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.820
So let's actually surround this in a span.

53
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.250
We definitely want to use a span because if we use a div, which is a block level element, the word

54
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.890
ledger is going to be put on the next line and we don't want that.

55
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.990
So the span, I'm going to give a class of text primary and that's our logo.

56
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.090
So under the H one, we're going to have a NAV with a UL and have our list items with links and these

57
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.920
are just going to go to areas on the page.

58
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.700
So if we do a hash home or a number sign home, that's going to go to an ID of home on the page.

59
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.110
So we'll say home.

60
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.600
And I actually want that to go to the very top.

61
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.270
So I'm going to give the body an ID of home and then we'll just go ahead and copy this down.

62
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.340
We want five links.

63
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.810
So after home we'll have a boat and we want that to go to the ID of a boat.

64
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.270
Then we'll have cases.

65
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:47.960
Underneath cases is going to be the blog section which will go to the ID blog and then we'll have the

66
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.980
contact.

67
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.940
So that's it for the nav bar.

68
00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.320
Now, as far as the content in the header, like the, you know, the sky's the limit heading and all

69
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.910
that that's going to go under this nav bar div.

70
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:12.780
So we want to go under that and have a class of content and here we'll have our H one say the sky is

71
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.700
the limit and we'll do a paragraph here.

72
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.290
And let's say we provide we provide world class financial assistance.

73
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.070
And then underneath that, we're going to have a link that's formatted as a button.

74
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.580
So it'll be in a tag, but let's give it a class of BTN.

75
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.610
And this is just going to go to the about section and we'll say Read more.

76
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.710
Let's actually put an icon in here though.

77
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.080
So I'm going to put an eye tag with the class of face and then a Chevron.

78
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.030
So it's what is it?

79
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.280
Fe Dash.

80
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.000
Chevron dash.

81
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.920
Right.

82
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.560
So we'll just put that little icon in there and that should be it as far as the HTML so we can open

83
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.120
this up with live server.

84
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.690
So that's what it's going to look like now, which doesn't look too good.

85
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:17.320
So we're going to jump into the CSIS and to style CSIS, and we're going to start with just the base

86
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.030
styles like the the body, the, the links, stuff like that.

87
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.590
Basically global styles.

88
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:31.390
Now we are going to use the open sans font, so we want to go to fonts, google.com and let's search

89
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:40.510
for open sans, which is right here and I'm going to grab the light 300 so select style and then also

90
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.160
the regular 400.

91
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.130
And then over here we can click in bed and you can either grab the link and put it in your HTML or the

92
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:54.580
import, which is what I'm going to do when I take this import and copy that, and then we'll put that

93
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.780
in our stylesheet.

94
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.290
So let's add some base styles here.

95
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:07.120
So we want to add box sizing border box on everything so that the width doesn't, you know, padding

96
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.560
doesn't take up the width.

97
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.140
We want to just reset the padding and margins.

98
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.290
So we're going to set both of those to zero on everything.

99
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:24.430
And then for the body, let's add the font family, which is going to be open sans and sans serif.

100
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:32.380
And for the background, let's make that white by default and the color of the text will be dark gray,

101
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.400
almost black.

102
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:41.500
And then I like to usually do a line height of 1.5, 1.6 for the body and then for Uls.

103
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.270
I want to, I don't want any bullet points.

104
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:49.420
So we want to set the list style to none and on links.

105
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:56.200
So we'll just make the default color dark gray and then let's remove the underline with text decoration

106
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.860
none.

107
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.840
So this applies to all links and then h ones and h twos.

108
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.980
So large headings.

109
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.440
I want to make it a light font weight.

110
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.340
So we're going to set that to 300 and then I'm just going to lessen the line height for headings, large

111
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.230
headings, we'll do 1.2.

112
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.940
That way, if they go on to multiple lines, the words aren't too far apart vertically.

113
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.500
And then for paragraph, remember we took away all the margins.

114
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.620
So I'm going to add ten pixels on the top and bottom and then any images, I want to have a width of

115
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.679
100% of their container by default.

116
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.690
So those are the base styles.

117
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.710
Now we do want to do the nav bar, so we'll do that here.

118
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.039
But I want to add the text classes.

119
00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.030
We have that text primary class to our utilities.

120
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:56.020
So let's just put a comment here and say text styles or text colors and we have text primary.

121
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.480
So that's just going to have a color.

122
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:06.370
It's going to be our green color, which is hexadecimal two eight, a745 is going to be that color and

123
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:11.620
then we'll have a text secondary as well, which will be a blue color.

124
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:17.980
So we'll set that to hexadecimal 0284d0

125
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.560
and that will be our secondary.

126
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.820
So now if we take a look here, you can see we have that green now for the nav bar we want.

127
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.430
Remember, the nav bar has two items in it.

128
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.310
It has the the H one and it has the UL.

129
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:39.970
So we want that we want to set that to a Flexbox because we want those to align in a row and we want

130
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.740
the UL to be way over here.

131
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:48.880
Now the UL itself will also be a Flexbox so that these list items can float horizontally as well.

132
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.150
So let's go to our style CSS and let's just put a comment here.

133
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.380
Say nav bar.

134
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.360
So the nav bar is like I said, it's going to be a Flexbox.

135
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:09.070
So we want to set the display property to flex and let's align everything since it's a row, a line

136
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.150
items does the cross axis which is going to be vertical.

137
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.730
So we want to align center.

138
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:22.810
And then as far as justify content which aligns on the main axis, we're going to set that to space

139
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:28.030
between because we want the H one to be on one side and the UL to be on the other.

140
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:34.000
So if I go ahead and save that now you can see the UL is way over here and the logo is over here because

141
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.880
we have space between for justify content.

142
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:49.090
Now as far as the background, we'll set the background color to let's do three, three, three and

143
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:56.290
then the color will be white and I am going to make it a little bit see through add some, it's going

144
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.430
to be a little translucent.

145
00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.280
So we'll set opacity to 0.8.

146
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.980
You don't have to, but I think it gives it a nice effect.

147
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.440
We want the width to be 100.

148
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.160
Sent in.

149
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.960
The height is going to be 70 pixels, which is pretty common for a nav bar.

150
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.660
And we want to position this.

151
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.040
We want it to stick to the top.

152
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.130
So we're going to position this in a fixed position and from the top zero pixels.

153
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.470
So it will always be stuck to the top.

154
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.810
And then we want a little bit of padding on the sides so that everything so that the logo and the UL

155
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.550
aren't right up against the sides.

156
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.380
So we'll do 30 pixels on the right and left and that should do it for now.

157
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.710
So if I save that, that's what it's going to look like.

158
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.360
Now, the links over here you can see are still vertical.

159
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.410
We also can't see them because they're the same color as the background.

160
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.030
So let's fix that.

161
00:11:50.050 --> 00:12:02.170
So first of all, let's say nav bar, any tags, we're going to colour those white and then we have

162
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:10.450
our UL and we want to display that as flex so that the list items align in a row.

163
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:16.690
And that's pretty much all we need for the UL now for the A tags we want, we want to space them out

164
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.740
because if we take a look, you can see they're all squished up against each other.

165
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.350
So let's add padding.

166
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.280
I'm going to set padding to.

167
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:34.190
Let's do ten pixels, top and bottom, 20 left and right and then also margin on the left and right,

168
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.420
five pixels.

169
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.570
And yeah, that should do it.

170
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.180
So if we take a look at that, that looks pretty good.

171
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.920
Now I do want to have a hover effect.

172
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.070
I'm going to add a border, a border bottom on hover.

173
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:56.510
So let's go right here and say nav bar, colon hover and we'll say border bottom.

174
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:03.710
And as far as the color, I'm going to use this same text, this primary color right here and put that

175
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.160
in.

176
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.390
Of course, we need the width or shall we to pixels and the style which will be solid.

177
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.160
And if we hover over these links, that's not working.

178
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.070
Oh I put nav bar hover.

179
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.050
It should be nav bar a hover.

180
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.540
And there we go.

181
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.520
All right, cool.

182
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.990
So I think that's pretty much it for the nav bar.

183
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:35.000
Oh, one thing I do want to do is bold the logo a little bit, make the font weight a little bigger.

184
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.400
So let's say nav bar and that H one has a class of logo and I'm just going to set the font weight from

185
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.380
300 to 400 and now it's a little more bold.

186
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.360
So in the next video, we're going to go ahead and do the hero image.

187
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.620
We're going to add the background.

188
00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:01.400
We're actually going to use a pseudo selector called before because you can use after and before to

189
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.120
create an overlay because we don't want the bright image.

190
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.700
We want to have this dark overlay over it.

191
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.040
So we'll be doing that in the next video.
