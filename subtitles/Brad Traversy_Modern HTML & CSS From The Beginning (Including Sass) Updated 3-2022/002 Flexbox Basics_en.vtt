00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.000
So now we're going to start to get into Flexbox.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.060
I want to show you how to create a flex a flex box or a flex container and flex items within it and

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.880
how to align them in a row or a column.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.180
So in our CSS sandbox, I'm going to create a new file called 16 Underscore and we'll call this flex

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.520
underscore basics HTML and we'll create a quick boilerplate here.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.600
Let's say flex basics and style.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.290
So I'm just going to add some default styling.

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.680
We'll set the box sizing to border box and I just want to add a font family onto the body so it doesn't

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.590
look really ugly.

10
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.540
So set this to Ariel.

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.920
Now in the body here, we're going to have a class div with the class of flex container.

12
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.320
And this doesn't have to be a div, it could be a UL, it could be absolutely anything can be a flex

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.460
container or a flex box and then each direct child will be a flex item.

14
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.860
And that could be images, divs list items, and you could have them like you could have an image and

15
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.400
then you could have a div and these would both be direct elements, so they'd be flex items.

16
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.750
But we're going to have three divs.

17
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.890
So let's create a div with the class of item and then item one and here we'll have an H three and we'll

18
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.430
say item one and let's just copy this down.

19
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.890
We'll have three of these and it doesn't matter how many you have, they'll still align correctly.

20
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.920
So this will be item two and item two for the class item three.

21
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.640
And I'm only given these specific classes here because we haven't gotten into pseudo selectors, which

22
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.340
is what I would use normally to access these.

23
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.720
So we wouldn't, we actually wouldn't need these extra classes, but I don't want to do stuff that we

24
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.100
haven't got into yet.

25
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.310
Now up here I'm just going to style the items so we can, so we can tell them apart better because right

26
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.720
now they're just h threes.

27
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.960
In fact, I can just open this up in live server and let's make this a little smaller.

28
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.790
We can close this up because I want to be able to see both of these at the same time, but have enough

29
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.600
room here.

30
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.200
So for the item, let's style this.

31
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.760
Let's give it a background.

32
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.420
Excuse me, let's do a light gray.

33
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.180
So light gray background.

34
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.200
We'll do a border.

35
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.620
Solid and let's do to pixels of a border we'll taste space them apart with a margin.

36
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.330
Add some padding.

37
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.330
It already has padding but will make it ten pixels.

38
00:02:49.660 --> 00:03:00.340
And let's do text a line to the center and let's also do a border radius of ten pixels.

39
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.400
Now, if I want to align these side by side with Flexbox, it's incredibly easy.

40
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.220
We just take the flex container, whatever that may be.

41
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.460
In this case, it's just a div with the class flex container and we just set the display property.

42
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.820
So remember we have display block, we have inline inline block.

43
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.740
We also have flex as an option.

44
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:30.490
And as soon as I do that, it turns it into a flex box and we automatically have certain alignment properties

45
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.870
and stuff that we can use.

46
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.690
We also have properties to basically change the widths of these to fill up the entire row, which I'm

47
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.280
going to get into in the next video.

48
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.120
But for now I'm just going to set this to a width.

49
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.720
So the item I'm setting to a width of 200 pixels.

50
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.840
So each one of these items are going to be 200 pixels.

51
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.320
And it doesn't matter how many of these we have, we can add an extra one here and we could add anything

52
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.660
like if I put an H one, as long as it's a direct child of flex flex container, it's going to be put

53
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.840
into the flex box and added to the row.

54
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.060
Now we can also change the direction or the orientation of our flex box.

55
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.940
So by default, let's say flex direction by default it's a row which goes horizontal and in a row this

56
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.740
is the main access and this is the cross axis.

57
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.080
Now I can change this to a column and then they're going to be stacked on top of each other.

58
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.120
Now this is the main axis of the flex box and this is the cross axis.

59
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.630
So the axis changes depending on the direction.

60
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.130
And we can also do column, column, reverse.

61
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.860
And now notice that item three is on top.

62
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.000
So that will reverse it.

63
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.440
We can also do row reverse and it'll actually align to this side.

64
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.090
And then item one is at the end, but I'm just going to keep this at row.

65
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.750
In fact, we don't even need to use it because that's the default anyway.

66
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.100
Now before we move on to the next video and look at some other properties, the last one I want to show

67
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.900
you here is flex wrap.

68
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:14.680
So by default, we have this set to I believe it's no wrap where if we make this smaller, you'll see

69
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.000
that they just shrink up until they can't shrink anymore.

70
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But if we have flex wrap set to wrap and we go ahead and shrink this, notice how when we get to a certain

71
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
size, they basically move on to the next row.

72
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.450
So I mean, it really just depends on how you want your layout, but I'm not going to use Flex Wrap,

73
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.040
so I'm going to comment that out.

74
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.250
So in the next video, I want to go over how we can change the widths because you might not always want

75
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:53.380
just a fixed width for your items, you might want to have one take up a certain fraction of the page

76
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.910
and another a certain fraction.

77
00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.300
So we're going to get into properties like flex, flex, grow, flex, shrink and the flex property

78
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.110
itself.
