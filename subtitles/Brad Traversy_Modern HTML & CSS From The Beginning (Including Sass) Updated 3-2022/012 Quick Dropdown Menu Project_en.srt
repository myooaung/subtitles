1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,910
All right, guys, in this video, I want to just show you how to quickly create a CSS dropdown menu.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,070
So we're going to create this right here.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,860
Basically, it's just we're focusing on the menu.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,560
And when we hit services, you'll see that we get this dropdown, we hit blog, we get a dropdown.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,520
We also have this this area over here which displays the number of posts.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,680
I figured it was just a nice addition.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,650
And then we just have a simple showcase here and you could go on to to add to this if you wanted to.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,540
But the main focus is how to get it to show you how to get this dropdown effect.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,330
And I made it semi responsive.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,970
So you'll see that when we hit a certain point 600 pixels, they'll still display block and we hover

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,570
over it.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,030
We'll get this as the sub menu.

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,680
So it'll basically just push the rest of the links down and show the sub menu here.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,630
All right, so let's get started.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,490
I just have a folder called Dropdown.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:04,290
I'm going to create an indexed HTML and let's also create a style CSS, generate our boilerplate here,

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:13,980
closes that up and let's say CSS dropdown menu and let's put in our style sheet.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,070
And then we're also going to use font awesome for these little arrows right here.

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:30,120
So I'm just going to go to font font awesome dotcom start using free and we're going to grab this link

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,070
right here, paste that in.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,310
Okay.

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,890
So now what we're going to do is go down to the body and we're going to start to create our HTML or

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,990
our markup body, whatever you want to call it.

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,350
So we're going to have a nav tag and we're going to give this an idea of nav bar.

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,230
And inside here we'll have a UL, we're going to have an LY with an A tag and this will be the home

26
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,300
home link and I'm going to copy this down.

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,620
This one will be about and then the next one is going to be services.

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,200
However, this is going to be the dropdown.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,090
Now, I'm not going to have this be a link, so I'm going to get rid of the a tag.

30
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,550
I mean, you could if you wanted to, but I'm just going to have just the text and then we'll have the

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,310
dropdowns and I'm going to put the icon next to it.

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:25,590
So that's I with a class of face and then f a dash angle dash down.

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,600
So that will give us the icon.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,230
And then after that we're going to put a nested list.

35
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:42,870
So another ul and let's do ly and in a tag and this is going to be web development and we'll just copy

36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,400
this down a couple of times.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:52,110
This next one will be, let's say, website design, and this one here is going to be mobile development

38
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,850
and then let's do SEO.

39
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,480
And then the next one is going to be the blog, which is also a dropdown.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,680
So we want to go after this list item after the services, and we're going to say blog.

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,470
And again, we want our icons.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:27,350
So face f a dash angle dash down and we're going to put UL once again and let's put a list item with

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,170
an A tag and this is going to be HTML.

44
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,800
Now we're going to have that that the post number as well.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,570
So we're going to put that in a span.

46
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,390
So we'll say span 22 posts.

47
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,160
All right.

48
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm going to copy this down.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,810
Let's do that's one, two, three, four, five, six.

50
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,320
And we can just change these numbers up to whatever you want.

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,230
Okay, I'll do 21 and let's change these up.

52
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,050
So we'll do some CSS JavaScript.

53
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,010
Python PHP.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,510
And we'll do one call design and then after the list item, we'll do one more.

55
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,110
And this is just going to be to this is going to be the contact link.

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,170
So contact.

57
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,320
All right, so that's our menu.

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,950
Let's save it.

59
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,730
Let's take a look.

60
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,990
It's going to look horrible.

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,240
Okay.

62
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,600
So it's just a list, an unordered list with some nested unordered lists.

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,990
So let's jump into our CSS and let's turn this into this.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,950
So we'll start off with just a general reset of the margin and padding.

65
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:01,010
And let's do box sizing, board or box, and then let's do our body.

66
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,370
And a lot of times you'll see HTML and body like that.

67
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,290
And for this we're going to add a background.

68
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:19,070
Let's do a background color of light gray and let's set a font family of let's do aerial.

69
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,540
All right.

70
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,710
Now we're going to work on the nav bar.

71
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,270
So let's do nav bar.

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,260
The nav bar itself isn't going to have anything.

73
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,490
But we're going to take the UL.

74
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,390
We're going to do list style none.

75
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,670
Make sure there's no bullets.

76
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,050
Then we're going to deal with the list items themselves.

77
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,330
Basically all list items.

78
00:05:50,330 --> 00:06:02,090
So let's do nav bar ul ly and we're going to set the color to dark gray, which if I save it, it's

79
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,350
only going to affect the ones that are not links because we have to color the link separately.

80
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:13,280
Now we want to display each of these as an inline block.

81
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,050
So if we do that, they'll go side by side, we'll do some padding.

82
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,930
So we'll save one realm of padding.

83
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,050
And we also want a position relative.

84
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,810
Basically, the way that the dropdowns are going to work is they're going to be positioned absolute

85
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,150
inside of this inside of the the the top ally as a container.

86
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,960
That way we can position it and we can add it so that we can make it so that it comes down on hover.

87
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,910
Now let's color the links.

88
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,250
So I'm going to just grab this here.

89
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:54,830
Let's say A and color will be dark gray and let's take away the underline.

90
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,440
So text decoration is going to be none.

91
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,880
Now, we want to we want to hide the nested URLs by default.

92
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,750
So basically anything that's in a dropdown, we don't want that to show by default.

93
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,160
So let me just put a comment here.

94
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:25,940
We'll say hide, hide nested UL by default and we can target that by doing nav bar ul ly ul because

95
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,150
we're grabbing the unordered lists that are inside the lies, and we're going to set that to display

96
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,040
none and save.

97
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,750
And now those all go away.

98
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,030
All right.

99
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,800
So let's see.

100
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,680
We'll go ahead and.

101
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:44,710
Okay.

102
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:53,280
Um, if I hover over these, we get, we get the cursor changes to a pointer, but not on these because

103
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,180
these are not links.

104
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,630
But I want, I want a cursor on these when we hover.

105
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:10,500
So let's do nav bar ul ly hover and let's do cursor pointer.

106
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,730
And I also want the background to be a different color.

107
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:22,050
So let's do background coral and let's do color white and save.

108
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,400
So the color white is not showing on the links, but it is on the text because we have remember links,

109
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,010
we have to target the color separately.

110
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:40,650
So let's just take this and say when we hover, we also want the links to have the color of white.

111
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,530
So now when I hover over any of them, whether it's an actual link or just text, we get the white color.

112
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,210
Now when we hover over these here, we want the drop.

113
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,150
We want the nested uls to show.

114
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,560
So let's do that.

115
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,050
Let's say nested.

116
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,360
Drop down show.

117
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:14,770
So we're going to do nav bar ul ly hover and we want the ul inside of that to show.

118
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,500
So remember we set it to display none by default.

119
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,240
So now we're going to set it to display.

120
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,470
BLOCK So now if I hover over it, we're going to we're going to see it, but it's going to it's it's

121
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,270
just crazy.

122
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,890
So we're going to fix this up.

123
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:35,170
Let's go ahead and let's do a position of absolute.

124
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:47,270
And we're going to we're going to say from the left, zero, and let's set a width to be 200 pixels.

125
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,490
And if you guys want to mess with this a little bit, you can.

126
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,880
And then I'm going to do a margin top of one REM.

127
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,310
All right.

128
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:02,000
So if we check it out, you can see that at least it's positioned underneath.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,190
It's going to be 200 pixels wide.

130
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,870
There's no background, though.

131
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,480
So let's target each list item.

132
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,750
So I'm going to grab this right here, what we just did, and we're going to target the list item on

133
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,010
hover and we're going to say display block

134
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:31,600
and we're going to add a background and let's do E, we'll do e73 times.

135
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,180
And now if we hover, you can see that it has the background.

136
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:40,420
However, the links are white still, so we want to target the a tag when we hover.

137
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,060
So let's do like a and let's set the color to three, three, three.

138
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,730
So now the links are dark.

139
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,680
Now we also want a hover color for these if we hover over that.

140
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,770
So we'll have to do.

141
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,480
Let's see.

142
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,660
We'll have to do this.

143
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:11,970
So when we hover over the top lie we want, we're going to target the hover of the nested lies like

144
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,540
that.

145
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,840
And let's do a background.

146
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,570
And we're going to do e03 times.

147
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,920
And make sure the color.

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Well, we shouldn't have to do that.

149
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,150
Well, we could just do color inherit.

150
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,440
Oops.

151
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,470
All right, so we'll save.

152
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,170
And now we have that lighter color I'm sorry, a darker color when we hover over these.

153
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,340
All right.

154
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,290
So it's starting to shape up now.

155
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,740
Let's deal with the spans these 22 these posts right here.

156
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,890
We want these to have a coral background.

157
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,250
I also want the color to change for those when they're hovered over.

158
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,650
So let's target the span.

159
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:06,190
Remember, we put those in a span, so we want this nav bar ul ly hover ul ly and then the span.

160
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,280
So we'll go like that and we'll say the span.

161
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:21,460
We want that to actually float to the right and we're going to make the color white and the background

162
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,560
coral.

163
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,230
We're going to add a little bit of padding.

164
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,290
We'll do 0.2 REM, top and bottom, 0.5 REM left and right.

165
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,340
Let's text align to the center.

166
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,430
And let's make the font size a little smaller.

167
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,440
We'll do 0.8 REM and let's round the corners a little bit.

168
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,120
So border radius and we'll do five pixels.

169
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,440
So let's save that.

170
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,040
Take a look.

171
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,580
Good.

172
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,130
And I think that's well, I also want them to change color a little bit.

173
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,540
So let's let's grab this.

174
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,950
But let's say on the list item hover.

175
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:18,200
So the inner list item hover, we want the span background to change to let's do chocolate, which is

176
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,610
pretty close to coral.

177
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,900
So as we hover over it now, you can see the background of those change.

178
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,280
All right.

179
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,900
So pretty good.

180
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,810
Now what I'm going to do and if you want to add a background to the nav bar, you can do that as well.

181
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,020
But I'm going to add our showcase area right underneath.

182
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,970
So did I already add it?

183
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,540
No, I didn't.

184
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,780
So in the HTML, it's going to be very simple.

185
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:51,320
I'm just going to go under the NAV and put a let's do a header showcase and all that I'm going to put

186
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:03,260
in here is an H one and just say your website here and we'll go back to our style sheet and let's grab

187
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,180
on to the showcase.

188
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:17,410
And let's set actually, what I'm going to do is I'm going to display this as a flex column.

189
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,290
So display, flex, flex direction is going to be column.

190
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:29,890
And for the height, I'm just going to do 300 pixels and then let's align everything to the center.

191
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,620
So we'll say align items.

192
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,590
Center justify.

193
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,220
Content center, text align.

194
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,160
Center.

195
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:53,360
And let's do padding zero and let's do two REM on the left and right, and let's go ahead and put our

196
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,590
semicolon there.

197
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,190
All right.

198
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,390
So we'll save that.

199
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,070
Oh, I didn't add the background.

200
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,880
So let's add background.

201
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,100
Coral.

202
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:09,880
All right.

203
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,440
Actually, you know what?

204
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,260
Let's put the let's put that in the in a variable, the color.

205
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,050
So we'll say for the root scope.

206
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,130
Let's do primary color is going to be coral.

207
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:32,110
And then we'll just change this to var dash, dash, primary color.

208
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,310
Grab that and go down here.

209
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,000
Replace that.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,390
That way it's easy to change the color and then we could use this as a secondary color.

211
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,270
So up here we'll say

212
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,620
a secondary color chocolate.

213
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,580
All right.

214
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,820
And then for the H one in the showcase.

215
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,760
Let's make it color white and let's make the font size.

216
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,300
Let's do four REM.

217
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,010
Here we go.

218
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,530
So I have the showcase matching the hover state, which I like.

219
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,400
I like that effect.

220
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,440
And if you're on a certain page, you can do like a current a current class and have it like that.

221
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,140
So it actually looks like it's kind of part of the showcase.

222
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,280
All right.

223
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,950
So let's let's deal with the responsiveness, because right now, if we go like right here, it's I

224
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,300
mean, it goes off the screen.

225
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,600
So I'm just going to do a quick solution for this.

226
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:55,910
And let's add a media query with a max width of 600 pixels and we're just going to take the nav bar

227
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:02,210
ul ly and instead of displaying inline block, we're going to display block.

228
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,010
That way they go on top of each other.

229
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:04,880
All right.

230
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:14,180
And then let's see, we're going to take the the nested UL on hover and we're going to set it to a width

231
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,849
of 100% and also position it relative.

232
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:23,000
Right now, it's 200 pixels wide and it's position absolute, which means it just goes over the rest

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,790
of the content and we can't see the rest of the menu items.

234
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,910
I want it to basically just push everything down.

235
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,440
So we're going to say nav bar ul ly hover.

236
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,700
So we hover over it.

237
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:44,300
We want the UL to have a width of 100% and we want the position to go from absolute to relative.

238
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,560
We'll save that.

239
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:51,500
And now when we hover over it, we get all of our sub items and we can still go to the next one.

240
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,450
We can see all the menu items still.

241
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:01,100
So I mean, it's not really the best looking thing in the world, but it is a solution for if you're

242
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,630
for smaller screens.

243
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,120
But yeah, that's going to be it, guys.

244
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,330
A lot of these dropdown menus will involve JavaScript, but I'm trying not to get into too much JavaScript

245
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,820
because I don't want because I want to focus on HTML, CSS and how you can do things with just those.

246
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:24,080
And I've mentioned it before that I do have a modern JavaScript from the beginning course on Udemy as

247
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,370
well, but that's it.

248
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,930
Hopefully you enjoyed this little project.

249
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,780
It's just something that I thought of that I think should be included in the course is how to create

250
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,770
these little dropdowns and of course there's many other ways to do it.

251
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,110
But this is one and and I think it's pretty, pretty easy, but that's it.

252
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,930
Thanks for watching.

253
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,370
And I'll see you in the next video.
