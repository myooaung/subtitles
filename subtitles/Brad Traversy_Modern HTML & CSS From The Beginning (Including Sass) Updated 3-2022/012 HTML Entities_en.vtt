1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.660
All right.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.680
In this video, we're going to look at entities and symbols real quick.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.200
So we're going to create a new file called ten Underscore.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.150
And let's just call this entities HTML.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.470
So we're going to put in our boilerplate, let's say, entities.

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.370
So the first thing I want to show you is a non breaking space.

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.140
I'm going to put a comment here and say non breaking space.

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:45.860
So if I put a paragraph and I say, hello, my name is Brad and I run this in live server or you open

9
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.700
your web page.

10
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.940
So we get just a paragraph that says, Hello, my name is Brad.

11
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.150
Let's say that I wanted to put a bunch of white space.

12
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.500
So where you see no text, it's called white space.

13
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.010
Let's say I wanted to put a bunch of it in between is and Brad.

14
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.340
Like if I go over here and I just put a bunch of spaces like that and I save there's no difference it

15
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.710
doesn't in the browser is not going to see these spaces and render it like that.

16
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.900
If you wanted to do that for some reason and there's not too many cases where you would do this, but

17
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.220
if you did, you could use a non breaking space, which is an HTML entity.

18
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.470
So it's actually going to be ampersand and be SP semicolon.

19
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.740
Remember the in the last video at the end I showed you the copyright entity which was ampersand, copy

20
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.270
semicolon and you can look these up on W three schools.

21
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
You can find a list of all the entities, symbols and stuff like that.

22
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.910
But let's go ahead and save this.

23
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.950
And you see how it knocked it over a little bit.

24
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.240
If I go ahead and grab this again and put another one, let's put a couple of them and save.

25
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.680
It'll keep pushing it over.

26
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.360
So if you ever need to push a line over like that, you can use a non breaking space.

27
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:08.870
So next thing I'm going to show you is how we can use or how we should use angle brackets so greater

28
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.100
than and less than.

29
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.110
Obviously they're used in HTML tags.

30
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:22.070
But what if we wanted to actually put them on the in the HTML page, let's say greater than and less

31
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.730
than?

32
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.300
So I'll put a paragraph and let's just say Fi, maybe, maybe this is a page that had some math equations

33
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.100
or something.

34
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.740
We'll say five is greater than two.

35
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.160
If we save that, it does actually show up on the page.

36
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.520
But in some browsers it can actually get confused because it looks like the beginning or actually the

37
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.670
end of an HTML tag.

38
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.440
So usually when you do this, if you want to actually put an angle bracket displayed on the page, you

39
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.150
would use the entity ampersand, g, t, semicolon, g t is greater than.

40
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.590
So let's save this and you'll see that it renders the same thing.

41
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:16.430
If we wanted to do a less than let's actually we'll just copy this down and let's say let's do one is

42
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.240
less than two.

43
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.980
We could use l t.

44
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.150
If I save that, you'll see one is less than two.

45
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.260
There's also numbers for entities as well.

46
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.530
So I'm actually going to copy this down again the greater than and instead of doing GTD, I'm going

47
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.300
to do number 62 and save and notice that it again gives me the greater than.

48
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.400
So the number for less than is actually 60.

49
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.560
So we would do ampersand number sine 60 and save and you'll see it gives us the same thing.

50
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.960
Now in most cases you're going to use the greater than and less than.

51
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.320
But I just wanted to show you that you can actually use the number.

52
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.630
We already saw the copyright, but I'm going to put it in here anyways.

53
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.640
So we're going to do ampersand copy semicolon.

54
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.380
This is the one that I use frequently.

55
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.160
We also have the trademark, so let's do ampersand and this is our G.

56
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.990
And if we save that, you can see it gives not the trademark the little R if we want to do like currency

57
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.560
stuff, dollar signs, pounds, stuff like that.

58
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.130
We can do.

59
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.080
Let's see for.

60
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.450
Well, obviously dollar signs we can use the the actual key but let's say we want to do sense we could

61
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.000
do ampersand sent save and it gives us a little sense sign.

62
00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:05.570
We can also do for working with foreign currencies like pound can do pound, we can do yen, we can

63
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.320
do euro.

64
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.230
Save that.

65
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.170
We get all those different symbols.

66
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.930
We can even do suits like card suits such as spades.

67
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.100
So if I wanted to do Ampersand Spade's semicolon.

68
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.300
There we go.

69
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.820
And of course, we have the other three.

70
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.810
So if we want.

71
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.120
Clubs.

72
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.530
Hearts and Diamonds is actually d i a.

73
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.380
So, I mean, you're probably not going to use these very much, but I did just want to show you guys

74
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.640
that.

75
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:54.870
Also, if you want to display something in like computer code font, you can use the code tag.

76
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.670
So let's say computer code.

77
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:06.520
So let's say code, which is a tag and let's say we wanted to display php php code.

78
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.120
Now in PHP, you start your code with this right here.

79
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:18.220
This is an opening PHP tag and this is a closing PHP tag and you could put like echo string.

80
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.640
Hello.

81
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.380
And I don't expect you to understand any of this, but let's say we want it to display this on the page

82
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:32.120
and we wanted it to look like code so we would replace this with the entity of less than.

83
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:43.660
So we'll do ampersand, l t semicolon and then let's replace this with Ampersand G.T. semicolon and

84
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.500
we'll save that.

85
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.950
And now down here notice that it actually looks like code.

86
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.250
So if you wanted to put a code snippet into your page, maybe it was it's a programming site or something

87
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.030
like that.

88
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.530
That's how you would do it.

89
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.310
There's also a tag called KB DX for keyboard.

90
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:10.510
So if we wanted to put like a paragraph and we were giving instructions to say save the file by pressing

91
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.980
and let's say we were telling them how to save a file so control s we could put a KBD tag and we could

92
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:29.020
put in c t r l plus we'll do that like that and save and now save the file by pressing control s and

93
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.040
notice the control s is kind of it's in that computer code font.

94
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.130
So it's again, not these these aren't things that you're going to use all the time, but it's something

95
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.600
that is good to know.

96
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.460
And again, if you want to look at all of the different the different entities and symbols available

97
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.860
in HTML, you can go to W three schools.

98
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.410
It's a like I said, it's a great reference site.

99
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.190
All right.

100
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.630
So in the next video, we're going to start to look at HTML five semantic tags.
