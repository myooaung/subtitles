00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.930
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.719
In this video, we're going to take a look at lists and tables.

3
00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:10.470
So let's create a new file and we're going to call it zero six, underscore lists, underscore tables,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.790
dot HTML.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.830
And let's add in our boilerplate here, closes that up lists and tables.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.220
So we have a couple of different types of lists.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.470
So we have unordered lists

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.940
and unordered lists.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.770
They're not numbered, basically.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.190
They're they have bullet points, which, of course, you can remove with CSS.

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.070
You can you can have different types of bullet points.

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.170
But let's go ahead and create an unordered list.

13
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.250
So we want to put a UL tag and then each item in the list should be wrapped in a list, item in line

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.910
tag.

15
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.090
So let's go ahead and just say item one.

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.820
And what I'll do is I'll hold down shift and option or shift in alt and just hit the down arrow so that

17
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.200
we can bring these down.

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.810
And let's change that to two, three and four and we'll save this control.

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.450
S And then let's open this with live server.

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.890
And there we go.

21
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.480
So that's what it's going to give us.

22
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.550
I'm actually going to zoom in a little bit on the HTML so you can see this better.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.920
Should have probably done that a while ago.

24
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.990
And notice that the bullets are here.

25
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.650
And like I said, these can be removed through CSS.

26
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.970
We can also have different types of bullets.

27
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.130
This isn't something that I would recommend, but you can use a style tag to change CSS attributes and

28
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.500
there's something called a list style.

29
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.370
And we have Circle Square.

30
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.180
Let's see, let's change it to a square and save.

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.510
And now you can see that each bullet is a square.

32
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.290
We have disc.

33
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.750
Save that.

34
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.200
That's the default circle.

35
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.180
Save that.

36
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.340
So that's kind of an unfilled circle.

37
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.760
And then we also have actually, I think that's it.

38
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.960
And then we have none.

39
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.520
All right.

40
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.190
And this is something that I would not recommend doing.

41
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.200
You want to you want to put all your styling in your CSS style sheet.

42
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.820
But I just wanted to give you an example of this.

43
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.770
So let's get rid of that.

44
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.920
So that's an unordered list.

45
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.350
At the same time, we have ordered lists,

46
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.630
and I'm going to give you another little trick here.

47
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.880
So first of all, it's an old tag.

48
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.580
And then we still use lies.

49
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.000
We still use list items, whether it's ordered or unordered.

50
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.050
Now with Emmet, let's say I want to have four list items.

51
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.620
I can actually do time so I could put an asterisk for and hit tab and it will actually give me four

52
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.400
list items.

53
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.150
So little tip there and we can fill these in.

54
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.400
We'll say item one.

55
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.110
Item two.

56
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.540
I am for and we'll save that.

57
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.650
And now notice that instead of bullets, we actually have numbers.

58
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.820
So it's a number list and then we can change the type as well.

59
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.950
So there's a type attribute.

60
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.870
So basically type one is the default.

61
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.940
If I save that, you'll see no change.

62
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.400
That's just numbers we can use.

63
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.040
Type uppercase A if I save that, it'll change it to uppercase letters.

64
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.390
If we use lowercase, a is the type, it'll be lowercase letters.

65
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.620
We can use uppercase I, which will actually do uppercase Roman numerals, lowercase I will do lowercase

66
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.750
roman numerals.

67
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.670
So just to let you know that you can add the type attribute order list is something that I almost never

68
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.450
use.

69
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.680
Unordered list is something you're going to use all the time because they're used for navigation menus,

70
00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.190
whether it's a horizontal navigation nav bar or if it's a side menu or anything like that.

71
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.800
So we can also have nested lists.

72
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.700
So let's actually copy this.

73
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.529
So I'm going to just control C copy this ul here and control V will paste that in and let's say we want

74
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.269
to have a list within the list.

75
00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.760
So inside this lie, this second one, let's get rid of that.

76
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.440
Actually, we'll keep that.

77
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.360
But next to it, I'm going to go on a new line and I'm going to put another UL inside here and let's

78
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:42.420
put an ally and we'll say nested item one, and then we'll do nested item two and let's save that.

79
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:50.010
And now you can see that these two items are nested and it automatically changes the the bullet point

80
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.790
here to a circle, changes it from a disk to a circle.

81
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.010
So lists are pretty simple.

82
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.130
Styling them is is a whole new level when you start to get into creating navigation bars and stuff like

83
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.610
that.

84
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.970
But we'll get into that later on when we start to deal with CSS.

85
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.110
All right.

86
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.390
So let's talk about tables.

87
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.390
So tables are used for tabular data.

88
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.650
Now, back in the day, back in, I don't know, eight, nine, ten years ago, people would actually

89
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:28.380
use tables to for website layout before we had proper CSS, before we had Flexbox and the grid system

90
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.480
and and frameworks and stuff like that.

91
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.870
People would actually would have like their sidebar and their main content area in their website be

92
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.910
a table which is absolutely horrible.

93
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.650
You never want to do anything like that.

94
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:49.080
You only want to use tables for tabular data if you have a, you know, a list of users or whatever

95
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.140
it may be, just some kind of data.

96
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.710
So to create a table, we want to put a table tag.

97
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:03.960
And in a table we have a head, a body, and we can also have a footer if we want.

98
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:13.080
I don't usually use footers, but for the head we're going to say t head and we want a table row and

99
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.650
inside the table row we want some columns.

100
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:24.840
But when it's when it's a heading, you want to use t h k for table head and let's do first name and

101
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.780
then we'll bring this down twice by holding control option or control alt and hit the down arrow twice.

102
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:39.780
And we'll change this to let's say last name and let's do email.

103
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.650
Now, if I save this, you'll see that these are our headings.

104
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.610
So these are the headings and then we want the data underneath.

105
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.640
So the data is going to go in the RT body.

106
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:59.010
So we have our table, our table head and then our table body which will also have table rows, but

107
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.590
instead of t h we want to use t d t h is only for the heading.

108
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.020
And then we'll say Let's do John, bring down two more.

109
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.820
So doh would be the last name and email

110
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.560
if I save that.

111
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.790
And there we go.

112
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:27.900
So we have first name, we have one entry here or one row with which is John Doe and then his email.

113
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.630
So I'm going to go ahead and copy this whole table row and let's do two more.

114
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.890
Probably want to fix this up a little bit.

115
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.080
And we'll go ahead and change up some of this data.

116
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.710
So we'll say Kate Smith.

117
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.490
Kate.

118
00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.860
Jeff.

119
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.440
All right, so we'll save that.

120
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.040
And now we have three rows in our table.

121
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.200
So pretty simple.

122
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.980
If we want to, we could change the width.

123
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.820
Now I would suggest doing this stuff through CSIS, but just to show you, we can we can use the style

124
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.280
attribute and we can say with, I don't know, 600 pixels.

125
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.710
And now it's wider.

126
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.650
And it just it's more readable like that.

127
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.980
But again, I would suggest not using the style attribute.

128
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.990
That's not good practice, but we haven't gotten into CSS yet.

129
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.380
So in the next video, we're going to take a look at forms and input fields.
