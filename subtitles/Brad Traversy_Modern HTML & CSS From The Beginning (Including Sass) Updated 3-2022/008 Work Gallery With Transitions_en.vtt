00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.000
So we finished the about page.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.200
Now we're going to move on to the work, which is going to be a set of images that will have a transition

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.950
overlay.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.820
So we're going to be using Transition Transform some other stuff as well.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.910
So let's jump into VS code and what I'm going to do is copy everything from the about dot HTML and I'm

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.770
going to create a new file in the DIST folder called Work HTML and then we'll go ahead and paste that

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.730
in and let's change the title.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:47.790
We'll just say my work and then we want to move the class of current from about to work and then let's

10
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.350
delete everything except for the footer.

11
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.210
So all the sections.

12
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.740
You can get rid of all these and we'll just keep the footer.

13
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.129
So now if I save this and we go back and we click on work, it should just look like this.

14
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.660
All right.

15
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.820
So the work page is it's basically just going to have one section, which is going to be the gallery

16
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.930
we could call it.

17
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:27.500
So let's just say section A and let's say or we'll just say, yeah, we'll say gallery here

18
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.330
and we're just going to add a section.

19
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:47.840
Let's give it an ID of work, dash a and actually I want to give it a class of text center and let's

20
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.150
do py-3.

21
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.330
I'm going to put it in a container.

22
00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.630
We're going to add our H two with a class of section title and let's just say my work.

23
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.300
And then underneath that, we'll put a class of bottom dash line and underneath that we'll put a paragraph

24
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.830
with the class of lead.

25
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.840
And let's just say check out some of my projects.

26
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.980
Um, yeah.

27
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.180
So we'll do that.

28
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.410
And then underneath that we're going to have a grid, so we're going to have a class of items and then

29
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.720
each item will be a div and I'm going to give it a class of item.

30
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.290
And then inside there we'll have a class of item dash image.

31
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.270
And let's put in our first image which is going to be it's going to have a source of image slash items

32
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.960
slash item one dot PNG.

33
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.030
So that's our first image.

34
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.890
Then we want to go outside of the item image and create another div with the class of item dash text.

35
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:15.720
And inside here we're going to have another div with the class of item dash text, dash wrap and we're

36
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.670
going to have a category and a title.

37
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.170
So the first is going to be a paragraph with the class of item dash, text, dash category and let's

38
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.490
say design.

39
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.380
And then under that we're going to have an H two, which, which we'll have the title, we're going

40
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.060
to say item, dash, text, dash title and we'll say great gradients.

41
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.050
So these are just sample projects and they're just stock images.

42
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.130
So what I'll do now is just copy the whole div with the class of item because we're going to have quite

43
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.120
a few of these nine to be exact.

44
00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.600
So let's do two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

45
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.680
And then we just want to change some of the info for some of these.

46
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.300
So that's the first one.

47
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:16.440
The second one we're going to change the image to item two, we're going to change the category to UI,

48
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.800
Dash UX, and the title is going to be World Experience.

49
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.920
And some of these titles might be a little weird.

50
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.520
It's just kind of the first thing that came to mind when I saw the image.

51
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.280
So this will be Image three, and the category is going to be photography, photography and design.

52
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.670
And then the title for this is going to be vanishing.

53
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.500
Okay.

54
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.890
So this one here.

55
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.680
So we have to three.

56
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.450
This will be item four.

57
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.150
And let's see, item four is going to be category of design.

58
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.270
And let's do Gap, say Gap Inc.

59
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.290
And then let's see, this is going to be five.

60
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:17.300
So five is going to be the category of mobile, let's say mobile UI design.

61
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.300
And we'll say face the experience.

62
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:37.280
So we have here it will be image six and category is going to be design concept and it's going to be

63
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.840
busy a curves.

64
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.330
Got seven.

65
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.000
Item seven is going to be photography

66
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.190
and the title is going to be Doc Ponder.

67
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.750
Okay.

68
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.860
So we got two more.

69
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.780
This will be eight.

70
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.710
Image eight.

71
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.360
And this is going to be web applications

72
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.520
and it's going to be called it's just a restaurant app.

73
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.250
So let's say rest grant app.

74
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:27.170
And then this final one here, it's going to be image nine or item nine and it's going to be, let's

75
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:37.400
say, social network concept and we'll call this friend feed.

76
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.590
So if we take a look now, it's going to look like this.

77
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.140
Just very large images, small text.

78
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.350
So obviously we need to add some styling here.

79
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.670
Now, there's a lot of styling that goes into this.

80
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.230
So what I want to do is just create its own sass file.

81
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:04.040
So I'll do that if I have a page or part of an application that has just a ton of styling, I'll put

82
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.310
it in its own sass file because in the end it all, it's all going to just be compiled into our main

83
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.330
CSS.

84
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:19.580
So and if you wanted to, you could have another CSS file get compiled, just leave off the underscore.

85
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:28.070
But I'm just going to create a new sass file in the source folder called Underscore and I'm going to

86
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.110
call it item underscore, grid dot CSS.

87
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.620
Now, when you create a new a new partial, you might want to restart your server with control C and

88
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.360
then PM run sass.

89
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.850
If you don't see any changes that you make in your sass files, always try that because sometimes node

90
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:53.240
sass can just muck up a little bit and not you won't show your changes until you restart.

91
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:59.960
So let's grab the items and we want to display as a grid.

92
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.470
So all the items we want a three column grid.

93
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:14.060
So we'll do grid dash template dash columns and let's do a repeat and we'll repeat three times one far.

94
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.320
All right.

95
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:24.620
And then I'm just going to add a light box shadow here and we'll do zero five pixel blur, ten pixel

96
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.540
and then zero.

97
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.059
And then for the color, I'm just going to do our GBA, which is red, green, blue alpha and let's

98
00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:40.159
just do a dark so zero for our GBA and then 0.3 for the alpha.

99
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:47.600
And if I save that and we take a look, you'll see that now our images in all our items are in a grid.

100
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:54.980
Now we're going to let's see, I'm trying to think of how I should do this.

101
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:05.570
Um, you know, let's do the item, the core item styles first along with the hover effects and then

102
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:11.960
we'll, we'll move this stuff off the screen because ideally we don't want this to show at first until

103
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.330
we hover over and then we want to have it basically come in with the overlay.

104
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.020
So let's do that.

105
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:24.890
We'll take the item and everything else we do is going to go in here because everything is prefixed

106
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.850
with item.

107
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.750
We have like item, dash, image, item, dash, text, text wrap.

108
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.810
So we can just use amp or stamp dash and then whatever.

109
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.320
So for the item itself, we want to position relative.

110
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.150
Everything is pretty much going to be positioned absolute inside of this item.

111
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.640
So we want to position it this relative.

112
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.540
We want the background to be the main color.

113
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:55.790
Okay, we'll set the overflow to hidden and then we want to add the overlay.

114
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.380
So we're going to use Ampersand Colon after.

115
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.170
Okay.

116
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.630
We've created overlays like this before.

117
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:14.290
We need to put in content some quotes, and let's position this absolute within its container or within

118
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.100
the item.

119
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.190
And then we're going to do display

120
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:25.120
block and for the background we're just going to inherit.

121
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.900
So we get the main color and then the opacity.

122
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.260
I'm going to set just slightly translucent.

123
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:41.560
So we'll do 0.9 and then let's say top from the top zero, from the left zero, and then we want to

124
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.700
go all the way across.

125
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.630
So 100% again, we're just creating the overlay here.

126
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:52.330
So 100% and then we want to add our transform.

127
00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:01.810
So transform is going to be scale to translate X.

128
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.780
So we want the we want it off screen at first.

129
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:11.050
So let's do -75% and then let's do translate

130
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.860
why that's also going to be -75%.

131
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.610
We're pushing it to the left and then we want rotate.

132
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:30.460
Rotate is going to be -28 degrees and then we'll add our transition.

133
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.070
So when we hover over it, we're going to we're going to transition the transform property, oops,

134
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.860
transform.

135
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.780
We'll do it over 3 seconds.

136
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:48.190
And instead of using like ease or ease in and out, we're going to use cubic BCA which allows us to

137
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.720
kind of change the speed up and stuff like that are the curves.

138
00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:01.180
So we're going to do 00.21, 0.3 and one, and you can mess around with it if you want.

139
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.870
But let's save that and we can see the overlay over the text here.

140
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.270
But this is not going to be here afterwards after we we we get down to that part.

141
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:19.090
So the overlay is not showing, which is what we want because we want to bring it in when we hover.

142
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:26.680
So let's go back and let's go outside of this after but still within the item.

143
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.320
And we want to bring in main color overlay.

144
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:33.130
All right.

145
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:38.350
So to do that, we're going to do at not at ampersand hover.

146
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:47.440
And then we also want to grab on to after, which is where our overlay is and we're going to do transform.

147
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.850
Say Scale two.

148
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.590
Actually, I'm just going to copy this because we're essentially doing the same thing, except we want

149
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.640
to bring it into view.

150
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.430
So we want to do zero here instead of -75.

151
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.510
All right.

152
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.370
So let's save that and go back.

153
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.530
And now you can see it's coming in.

154
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.460
All right.

155
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:18.730
And if you mess with these values for the BCA, like if I do one, it'll change the curve.

156
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.750
So you can see that it actually changes the speed because it changes its place.

157
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.370
The curve up here because it's outside, it's -75% over.

158
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.850
So 0.2, I think is a good value.

159
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:31.780
All right.

160
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.880
Now, we also want to scale the image a little bit on hover, make it zoom in a little bit.

161
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.770
So scale image on hover.

162
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:51.250
So we're going to say ampersand, colon, hover, and we want to grab on to the item dash image class

163
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:56.170
so we can do ampersand, dash image and let's say opacity.

164
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:04.660
I'm sorry, not opacity transform and we'll scale.

165
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.320
Let's scale 1.2 on hover.

166
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:15.250
So now if we go and we hover, you can see that the image is scaling up and we're getting that overlay.

167
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.260
Next thing is I want to bring the text in on hover.

168
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.940
Although we haven't hit, we haven't hidden the text yet, but we will.

169
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:31.570
So let's say bring in text on hover.

170
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:38.110
So we're going to do ampersand, colon, hover, and then Ampersand Dash text.

171
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:45.220
And we want to set the opacity to one because we're going to set it to zero by default.

172
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:53.590
But when we hover, we want it to set to one and we also want to bring it in with translate y, so translate

173
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.550
y, and we want to just say zero, which will be its resting position.

174
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.630
All right.

175
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:04.390
And right now, it's not going to do anything because we haven't dealt with the default text, basically

176
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.330
where it should rest by default.

177
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.160
So let's deal with the image first.

178
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:20.170
So we're going to add here ampersand, dash image, which is the item image class.

179
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:26.050
Set the height to auto set of transform.

180
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.250
Actually, I don't think we need to transform.

181
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:40.210
Let's do display block because an image is is inline by default and then add a transition.

182
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.370
Actually, you know what, we do need to do this.

183
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:52.150
We need to deal with the translate z so we want to add a transform for a translate Z.

184
00:15:54.340 --> 00:16:06.640
And set that to zero and then set the transition to that transform and let's say 750 milliseconds and

185
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.960
we'll add the same cubic BCA value that we have up here.

186
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:17.020
So just copy that and that should be good.

187
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.530
All right.

188
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.730
Now we also want to grab on to the image before pseudo selector.

189
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:30.880
So we're going to do ampersand image before and set the content to just quotes.

190
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.380
And let's also set this to display block.

191
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:44.260
And then I'm going to add a padding top of 75% in an overflow of hidden.

192
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.460
So that should take care of the actual image container this right here item image.

193
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.810
Now for the actual image, we want to position that absolute within it.

194
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:09.460
So let's do ampersand, dash image and then IMG and position absolute top zero.

195
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:16.990
Left zero set the width to 100% height.

196
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.220
We should be able to just set to auto and then line height.

197
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.020
We'll set to zero as well.

198
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.900
So that takes care of the image.

199
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.560
Not really any difference yet.

200
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:35.890
Now for the text, remember, we want to hide that by default.

201
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.390
We also need to move it.

202
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:44.020
We need to we need to use, transform, translate to move it.

203
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.250
So let's go ahead and do the text.

204
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:55.450
We're going to position this absolute.

205
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.110
Let's set it to the top zero position.

206
00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.250
And.

207
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.740
Left.

208
00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.960
Zero position actually going to do zero on all sides.

209
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.130
So top left, bottom right, zero.

210
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:19.870
Now the opacity by default, I'm going to set to zero because we want it to kind of fade in and then

211
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:27.910
let's just make sure it's aligned center and let's add a Z index of one so that we make sure that it's

212
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.230
on top and we can read it.

213
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.120
We'll set the color to white.

214
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:38.410
And as far as the transitions go, we want to transition the opacity.

215
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.720
Let's see.

216
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.440
Actually, you know what?

217
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.120
Let's yeah, we'll just do opacity and then the transform.

218
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:54.610
So opacity will do 500 milliseconds and that same cubic BCA value.

219
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:04.440
So paste that in and then let's put a comma here so we can add another one for transform, which I actually

220
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.640
haven't added yet.

221
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.590
So transform.

222
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:15.870
500 milliseconds, same cubic BCA and then let's actually put the transform above it.

223
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:27.840
So transform we're just going to take translate Y and set that to -20% by default.

224
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.240
And then up here, this is where we bring it in.

225
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:40.230
So we set the opacity from 0 to 1 and then transform, translate Y from -20% to zero on hover.

226
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:41.970
All right.

227
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:48.780
So we also have the text wrap to deal with, which goes around the title and the category.

228
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:56.220
So let's add here text dash wrap.

229
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:05.700
We want the width to be 100% and the position to be absolute.

230
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.890
Okay.

231
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:16.270
Actually, let's put the absolute first position, absolute with and then from the top, let's move

232
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.950
it down 50%.

233
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.220
And then we also want to translate y -50.

234
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.160
So translate.

235
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.700
I mean, transform.

236
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.340
Translate why and we're going to do -50%.

237
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.260
Okay.

238
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.500
So that's the text wrap.

239
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.860
Now, the text title, let's just format that.

240
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:45.610
So we'll do ampersand, dash text, dash title.

241
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.200
And I'm going to set the font size.

242
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.350
Font size for that to to REM for the title.

243
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:06.700
And then let's set the padding to zero and let's do one REM and then margin.

244
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:14.200
I'm just going to do five pixel margin on the top and then the category.

245
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.500
Let's do dash text, dash category.

246
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.360
I want that to be uppercase.

247
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.780
So I'm going to do text transform uppercase.

248
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.340
I also want it to be smaller.

249
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.850
So I'm going to say font size, well, smaller than the title.

250
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.800
So 1.2 REM.

251
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:41.440
And then I'm going to set an opacity of 0.7 and clear the margin and that should do it.

252
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.130
So let's save and let's go back.

253
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.230
All right.

254
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.580
So something's not right because see, all the text is coming in really fast.

255
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.140
It should actually come in after.

256
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.840
And I think that's because I forgot the delay.

257
00:21:59.440 --> 00:21:59.800
Yeah.

258
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.700
So we want to go to the where the text is and let's add a delay.

259
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:12.820
So transition dash delay and let's do 300 milliseconds, see if that works.

260
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.200
Yeah.

261
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.130
So it kind of comes in at the same time.

262
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.750
If you want to if you want to mess with any of these values, feel free.

263
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.680
I know it's it's kind of advanced CSS.

264
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.300
So if you want to mess with things and see exactly what does what.

265
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.100
Feel free to do that.

266
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.360
But I think that's good.

267
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.710
I think that looks pretty good.

268
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.150
It has a nice effect.

269
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.550
So I think we're all set.

270
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:42.220
So in the next video, we're going to start on the contact page, which is pretty simple.

271
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.030
And then after that we'll move to making this responsive.

272
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.150
And then finally we'll go ahead and deploy.
