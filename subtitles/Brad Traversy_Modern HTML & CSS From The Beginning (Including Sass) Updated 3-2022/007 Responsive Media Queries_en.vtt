00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.720
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.580
So we're going to go ahead and add our media queries now to make this responsive and look good.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.090
And all of our media queries are going to go in our stylesheet.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.470
Actually, we only have one.

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.450
We just want to have some styles for anything that's under 768 pixels.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.580
So basically a tablet or less.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.270
So let's go down here and we'll just say mobile and we want a media query.

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.110
So we want at media and I'm going to do a max width of 768 pixels.

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.530
So basically any time the screen is smaller than 768, these styles will kick in.

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.320
So let's start with the nav bar because right now we can see the links are going off the screen.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.660
So remember, it's it's a flex row.

12
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.810
So what I'll do is I'll change the flex direction to a column and immediately they're now they're on

13
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.900
top of each other, the logo and the UL.

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.800
So I'm just going to set a line items to send.

15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:13.650
Yeah, we'll set a line items to center and let's set the, the.

16
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.120
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.830
Not a line items justify.

18
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.120
What did I have here?

19
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.390
So had now by our line item center OC justify content is space.

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.690
I guess we can just we don't have to do anything with that.

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.590
So forget that now the height I'm going to change to 120 pixels because it needs to be higher now because

22
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:52.650
obviously we have the logo on top of the links and then let's add some padding, say padding 20 pixels.

23
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.200
So that looks pretty good now.

24
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.170
These links are still pretty far apart on on smaller phones.

25
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.420
You know, these might kind of run into each other.

26
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.910
So let's change the padding on those.

27
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.699
So we'll say nav bar links.

28
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.840
I believe we have 1020.

29
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.440
So let's do 1010.

30
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.890
So now you can see the links are closer together.

31
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.240
We'll even lessen the margin.

32
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.140
So we had five pixels, we'll set three pixels.

33
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.890
So now they're closer together and should look fine on smaller phones.

34
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.010
So nav bar looks pretty good.

35
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.900
And I mean, you could always do like a hamburger menu or something, but this is just a pretty simple

36
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.960
solution that doesn't include any JavaScript.

37
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.650
Now this I'm going to keep this.

38
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.230
I mean, you could lessen the size of the the H two here if you want, but I think that looks pretty

39
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.800
good.

40
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.940
Now, the flex items, obviously, we want to change.

41
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.480
We want to stack these so flex items.

42
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.420
So it's already display flex.

43
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.080
We're just going to change the direction to a column.

44
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.340
All right.

45
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.050
So it's as easy as that.

46
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.680
So basically, if this is.

47
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.960
When it gets to 768, it just stacks on top of each other.

48
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.420
And you could do it different ways you could.

49
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.160
Instead of Display Flex, you could change it to Display BLOCK or something like that.

50
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.320
But I like just changing the direction.

51
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.940
Let's see.

52
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.970
Next, we have this.

53
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.180
So what's this?

54
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.040
Flex columns.

55
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.740
Yeah.

56
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.050
So flex columns for the actual column.

57
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:57.920
What we'll do is we'll set the flex value or the flex grow to 100% and also the max width to 100%.

58
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.170
So if we save that, you can see now these both stack on top of each other.

59
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.910
All right.

60
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.170
So that's one way to do it.

61
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.780
And we can even do that with the grid.

62
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.800
Let's see.

63
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.560
So these images right here have flex grid.

64
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.600
So I think we could just take flex grid and take the column there.

65
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.590
And that will yeah.

66
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.080
That will stack them on top of each other as well.

67
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.230
So if we make this bigger.

68
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.900
Yeah.

69
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.070
I mean, you could.

70
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.290
You could add another media query and have them in two for like 768.

71
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.300
You could have them in two rows.

72
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.930
And then on smaller screens stack them.

73
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.980
But I think that's fine.

74
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.770
We'll just we'll just leave it like that.

75
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.630
All right.

76
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.500
So what else do we have here?

77
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.780
Let's see.

78
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.610
This is good, because, remember, that's the the flex column.

79
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.520
This is good.

80
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.700
These are stacked because these are flex items.

81
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.180
However, I do want these images to be a little smaller.

82
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:24.500
So what we could do is take the team image and instead of 100% width, we could do, let's say 70% make

83
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.310
them a little smaller.

84
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.810
I think that looks a little neater.

85
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.270
Maybe we could even do that with the image.

86
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.820
I guess that's fine.

87
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.120
So this looks good.

88
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.900
Footer.

89
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.320
Footer, footers.

90
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.800
Fine.

91
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.230
I don't think we need to do anything there, so I think we're all set as far as media queries go.

92
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.780
So our site looks pretty good on small screens and we can test it out with the device toolbar as well.

93
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:56.000
So if we open up our chrome tools and hit this icon here, so that's an iPad.

94
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.550
Let's try iPhone X.

95
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.540
Okay.

96
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.580
Yeah.

97
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.120
So I think that looks pretty good.

98
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.450
Let's try Galaxy S5.

99
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.830
It's even smaller.

100
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.330
It still looks good.

101
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.100
iPhone 678 OC.

102
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.790
So our site's responsive now.

103
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.510
In the next video, we're going to create the blog page, which is pretty simple and also the single

104
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.010
blog post page.
