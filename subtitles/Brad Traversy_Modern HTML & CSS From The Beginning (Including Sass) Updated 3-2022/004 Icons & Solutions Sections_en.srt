1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,630
Okay.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,270
So the top part of our site is complete.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,210
Like I said, we'll add the JavaScript for this later on where this is transparent, but now we want

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,900
to do the this icons section and the solutions section.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,960
So we're going to be using Flexbox to align everything.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,340
So let's jump into our HTML first and add that.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,570
So I'm going to go under the header and I'm actually going to use a main tag here.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,860
And all of our sections aside from the footer will go inside this main tag.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,770
So our first section here, I'm going to give an ID of a boat so that our menu goes to it.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,160
And then let's give it a class of icons and we're going to have background classes as well, utility

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,730
classes.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,050
And I want this to be light.

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,670
So I'm going to use a class of BG light and we'll, we'll create that in a second.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,410
And then for anything that we just want simple flex flexbox rows, I'm going to have a utility class

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,920
called flex items that we put directly on, you know, as the flex container.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,690
So we're going to have some divs and in the div we'll have an icon.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:16,470
Let's give this, let's say face and then f a dash university.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,330
So that's our icon that we're going to use.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm also going to give it a class of F, a dash to X, which will make it twice as large.

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:23,830
All right.

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,710
And then underneath that, we'll have a Div with an H three.

22
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:40,140
So this is just going to be like a heading, we'll say investment, investment banking and then a paragraph

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,860
and let's just do lorem ten for the paragraph.

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,070
So that's the style of the or the format of each flex item.

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,290
So we want to copy this down twice.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,000
The second icon is going to be book reader and we just want to change the heading up here as well.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,900
So let's say investment.

28
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,060
No, we already did that.

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,100
Let's say portfolio manager.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:23,040
Then this third icon here is going to be pencil, dash, alt and for the heading, let's say tax and

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,750
custodial.

32
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,540
So if we take a look at that, doesn't look too good, but we'll fix that.

33
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,790
So let's jump into the CSS.

34
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,230
So we're going to go into style CSS first and any direct styling for the icons class will go here.

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,060
So let's say icons and I just want to add some padding.

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:56,640
So we'll do 30 pixels for the whole thing and then for the H three, let's say icons H three, I just

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,380
want to bold the font.

38
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:08,310
So we'll set font weight to let's do 400 now, do bold and then add some margin to the bottom.

39
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:18,780
So 15 pixels now for the icons, I want to style them so that so icons I the font awesome icons I want

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,080
to style them so that they have this round background.

41
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,080
So let's go ahead and set the background color to our green.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,680
And I mean, we probably should be using variables or custom properties for this because we re using

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,990
the colors, but I haven't gone over those yet.

44
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,060
Those are going to come in a later section.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:50,700
So let's say color white and we want padding, so we want some spacing around it.

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:58,620
So 16 actually we'll do one REM, which in this case will be 16 pixels because that's the root element,

47
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,680
font size, border radius.

48
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:11,370
I'm going to set that to 50% and then let's set a margin bottom of 15 pixels.

49
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,399
So if we take a look at our icons now, we have this green round background.

50
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:23,340
Now we want to deal with our Flexbox because we want these aligned in a row.

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,410
So in our utilities, I'm going to I'm going to style the flex items class that we used.

52
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:48,660
So let's say flex items and we want to display flex and let's go ahead and text a line center and justify

53
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,180
content center and also text a line center.

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:05,070
So pretty simple and I'm just going to set the height to 100% and then add some padding to the divs

55
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,700
inside.

56
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,720
So let's say flex items and we can say the direct div.

57
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:17,400
So basically the the direct div child, we're going to set a padding of 20 pixels.

58
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,690
So let's take a look at that and there we go.

59
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,130
So that looks pretty good.

60
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,480
Yeah.

61
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,890
So the next thing that we're going to do is this section here.

62
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,550
And for these two column layouts, you'll see this looks similar to this one, which looks similar to

63
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,240
this one.

64
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,790
So we're going to have a utility class called Flex Columns for these because it's going to be slightly

65
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,070
different than how we style the three we just did.

66
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,140
So let's jump into our HTML and we want to go right under where we did the about actually we can let's

67
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,320
put some comments here.

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:04,430
So that's let's about icons and then under this section, this is part of the about section.

69
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,240
This is the solutions.

70
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:14,610
So we want to add a section here and let's give this a class of solutions and also a class of flex dash

71
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,350
columns.

72
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,170
And then within here, let's, let's create a row.

73
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,270
So take note of the structure of this.

74
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,620
We're going to have a row with two column div, so we'll say column times two.

75
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,410
And then inside this column we'll have a div called column one.

76
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,270
And in this one here, we'll have a div with column two.

77
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,170
All right.

78
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,320
So this this first one is going to be the image.

79
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:58,170
So let's add that we'll say image and we want to go into images, slash home and then people that's

80
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,620
all we want.

81
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:07,410
And column one, column two, we're going to have an H for we'll say what you are looking for and then

82
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:21,570
an H two and we'll say we provide bespoke solutions and then a paragraph and let's do lorem 20.

83
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,650
I believe I did.

84
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,110
Or lorem 30.

85
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,440
I don't know.

86
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,670
We'll see how it looks.

87
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,220
So that's column two.

88
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,810
And actually under the paragraph we do want a link formatted as a button.

89
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,860
We'll use BTN.

90
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:44,850
I'm also going to have a BTN outline class as well and we'll just put the text of Read More, but let's

91
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,890
put an icon as well of a Chevron.

92
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,520
So we'll do F as F a dash.

93
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,050
Chevron shares a space after it.

94
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,830
All right.

95
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,530
So if we take a look at that, we just have a stretched out image because remember, it's with 100%

96
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,220
by default.

97
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,450
We set that in our style CSS and then we have our content down here.

98
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,180
So let's go ahead and style the flex columns.

99
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,980
So this class right here, so we're going to go to utilities and let's go under where we have our flex

100
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,030
items.

101
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,990
And I'm only creating this utility class because we're doing a few different sections that have this

102
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,520
same exact styling.

103
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:41,010
So let's say flex columns, and we want to style the row and say display flex and the flex direction

104
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,940
is going to be a row, which is the fault.

105
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,120
So we don't really need that, but we'll specify it anyway.

106
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,120
We want the flex wrap to be wrap and we want width to be 100%.

107
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:04,110
And then for the columns, let's say flex columns, and then we have the class of column.

108
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,070
We also want to display Flex here, but we want the flex direction obviously to be a column and we're

109
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,720
going to set the basis.

110
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,620
So basically the default, we're going to set that to 100% and set it to flex one.

111
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,630
So it'll take up the entire height.

112
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,470
And then for column one and column two.

113
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,670
Let's say call them one and then we'll copy that down.

114
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,650
Call them two.

115
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,940
We want the height.

116
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,860
Make sure we set that to 100% as well.

117
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,700
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

118
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,500
Good.

119
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,180
Now I want this to have a green background.

120
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:57,440
So one thing I forgot in the HTML is to add, let's see, we want to put this on column two.

121
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,440
So BG primary.

122
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,100
And by doing that, it should be green or not.

123
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,070
Oh, we didn't do the background classes yet, did we?

124
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,320
So let's quickly add those in our utilities.

125
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:17,000
Now we already have the button classes and the BG classes are going to have the same exact thing, the

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,160
background color with the text color.

127
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,490
So what I'll do.

128
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,570
What I'll do is just excuse me.

129
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,380
We'll say BG primary and let's go here.

130
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,240
We'll say class BG Secondary.

131
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,770
We'll have a BG dark.

132
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,040
And a big light.

133
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,120
All right.

134
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,710
So now if we take a look, we have that green background and it doesn't go all the way down just yet.

135
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,150
We'll do that when we get to the column, to styling.

136
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,330
But for the image, I just want to do the image for us, because if we go to a certain width, you can

137
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,150
see the image starts to go up.

138
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,530
We want it to fill this entire area.

139
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,810
So let's go back to let's go back down here.

140
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,320
Oh, we had we had a colon there.

141
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,800
But that should so.

142
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,850
Oh, now it.

143
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,240
Yeah.

144
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,620
Now it fills the whole height.

145
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:39,530
But as far as the image goes to fix that, let's say flex column's image and set the make sure the width

146
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,730
is 100%, the height is 100%.

147
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,720
And if we take a look, the width and the height are 100%.

148
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
But see how it looks all stretched out.

149
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:56,750
We can easily fix that with a property called Object Fit and we can set that to cover which it works

150
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,250
similar to a background size cover with the with a background image.

151
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:08,360
So if we look now, you'll see that it takes up the whole area, but it's not stretched out.

152
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,890
It just covers it.

153
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,060
All right.

154
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,780
So that's what we want.

155
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,050
Now, as far as column two, let's style that.

156
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,990
Let's flex columns and let's do column two.

157
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,610
And we want this to display flex so we can align it display flex.

158
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:41,120
We also want the direction to be a column and then we want to align items center and let's I'm sorry,

159
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:51,920
let's align items to flex start since it's a column, align items has to do with the horizontal and

160
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,450
then justify content is going to be center.

161
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,020
So we'll center that and then just add some padding and we should be good.

162
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,120
All right.

163
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,380
Now, we do want to style some of the individual elements here.

164
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,360
So the H two, I'm going to make bigger I'm also going to add some margin and we got to take care of

165
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,950
this button outline class that we created or that we used.

166
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,900
So let's say flex columns h two.

167
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:37,630
Instead of font size of 40 pixels and let's make the font weight 100 and that's it for the H to the

168
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,680
H for.

169
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:51,960
Let's add a margin bottom of ten pixels and then the paragraph, flecks, columns, paragraph.

170
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,950
I want to add 20 pixels, margin on the top and bottom.

171
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,860
So if we save that, that all looks good.

172
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,060
Now for the button here.

173
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,990
I just want to have a border and I want a transparent background.

174
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,280
So just an outline.

175
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,670
So let's go to style CSIS up to where we have not style utilities, up to where we have our buttons.

176
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:28,980
And let's add a BTN outline and we'll set the background to Transparent and set a border of one pixel

177
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,700
solid and white.

178
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,230
So that'll be our button outline.

179
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,370
Let's take a look.

180
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,750
Good.

181
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,200
So that takes care of the icons.

182
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,460
That takes care of this.

183
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,250
Now, when we make this smaller, it doesn't look too good.

184
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:54,330
Later on, we're going to add media queries so that everything stacks and the navigation looks better.

185
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,030
But we're going to do the desktop version first.

186
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:03,690
In the next video, we'll go ahead and we'll do the cases and hopefully get to the blog section as well,

187
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:09,090
which should be really easy because it's the same style as this, except we want the image on this side.

188
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,480
All right.

189
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,710
So we'll get to that next.
