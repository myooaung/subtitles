1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,720
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,400
So we're going to jump back into our SAS sandbox.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:11,190
Now, remember, we have the the SAS script, the MPM script, so I'm going to run NPM, run SAS, we're

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,220
going to want to run that when we're in development and then in our index HTML, let's open that with

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,690
live server and it should be blue if you've been following along.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:31,770
And if I go ahead and into my SAS main access and they change this to let's say black and save, it'll

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,630
it'll reload automatically.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,170
All right.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,380
But I'm going to set that back to blue now.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,250
Variables.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,140
I mean, you can see how they're used.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,620
We use a money sign to define a variable and then we simply use a colon for assignment and then whatever

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,300
the value goes in here.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,690
So it could be a color, it could be absolutely anything.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,980
Just just like with standard CSS variables.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,020
So I think what we'll do here is just create a couple of different ones.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,890
Let's do primary dash color.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,660
I'm going to set to steal blue.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,510
We're going to just create kind of a simple interface to to work with for the next few lectures.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:24,630
So we'll do secondary dash color and we'll set that to sky blue and let's do a light color.

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,320
And a dark color.

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,560
Okay.

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:44,730
So as far as this kiss here for now, I'm just going to add a reset.

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,060
So we'll say margin.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,290
Adding zero and then let's just add some stuff for the body.

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,990
So the background I'm going to set to the light color

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:12,090
and color I'm going to set to four now just set to the dark color and then for font family

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,270
we can do Arial Actually what we'll do is we'll take this and we'll put this in a variable called font

29
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,200
stack.

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,490
Just in case.

31
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,750
We want to change that.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,060
It's right up here, easily accessible.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,790
So we'll set that to font stack and then let's just set a line height.

34
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,860
It's completely up to you guys what you want to put in variables in your projects and what you don't.

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,550
I try to keep a minimal amount, usually things that are going to be used quite a bit in different places.

36
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,030
But yeah, so that's how we can set variables.

37
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,410
I'll go ahead and save that.

38
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:04,860
Now we also have what are called partials, so a lot of times the SAS, you break your CSS up a lot

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,640
more.

40
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,110
For instance, if you use bootstrap, which is a CSS framework and you use sass, every element like

41
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,500
the buttons, the nav bar, they all have their own separate partial file with just those styles.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,060
So you can really break it up.

43
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,030
Now you can import these partials into a CSS and to a sass file.

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,570
And it's important to mention you can do this with regular CSS.

45
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,070
However it works differently.

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:40,800
You make you have to keep making extra HTTP requests to the server to fetch these the regular CSS files

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,240
with SAS, it just kind of takes them and builds them on top of each other.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,600
All right.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,260
So it's just much more efficient using SAS partials.

50
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:57,650
So in our case, I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to call it underscore variables CSS.

51
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,750
So this is a partial where I want to store all my variables.

52
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,700
Now notice I put an underscore.

53
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,120
The reason for that is this tells the SAS compiler that this is a partial and I don't want this file

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,320
to be compiled.

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,709
I don't want a variables CSS file in my main in my CSS folder.

56
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,920
I still we still want to keep just one file here.

57
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,170
However, we want to split it up here.

58
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:28,470
So I'm going to take all my variables here and cut them out and I'm going to put them into variables

59
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,010
CSS and save that.

60
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,520
Now, if I go back here and I save, we're going to get some errors down here.

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,050
It's another good thing about SAS is it gives you errors and tells you what's going on.

62
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,320
So this is basically telling us we have undefined variables.

63
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,790
So in order to use the variables in the partial, we have to import the files.

64
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:55,980
So we're going to go up here and we're going to say at import and we want to import variables.

65
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,600
You don't want to put the actual underscore the underlying.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,770
You also don't have to put dot CSS just simply variables.

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,580
All right.

68
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,200
And then I'll go ahead and save that.

69
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,210
And now that's working again.

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,480
If I go to variables and change light color to red just to show you.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,270
And I say, actually, you know what, we'll have to restart SAS down here just because we created a

72
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,170
new file.

73
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,360
So let's run that.

74
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,350
And now if we save this, now it turns to red.

75
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,440
All right, so I'm just going to put that back.

76
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,740
And safe.

77
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,310
Good.

78
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,060
So you can see we can structure our SAS however we want and notice that it didn't create a variables

79
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,250
CSS because it is a partial.

80
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,850
If I left that underscore off then it would have compiled this whole file into the CSS folder.

81
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,660
We don't want that.

82
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:01,310
We just want this single main dot CSS and notice it's using the light gray that we set in the variable

83
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,990
and you never want to touch the CSS that that gets compiled from SAS.

84
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,350
All right.

85
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,780
So in the next video, what I want to do is finish up our index HTML so we can get some markup in here.

86
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:18,890
And we're also going to look at nesting and structure within SAS, which is very important and a really

87
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,990
nice advantage of using SAS.
