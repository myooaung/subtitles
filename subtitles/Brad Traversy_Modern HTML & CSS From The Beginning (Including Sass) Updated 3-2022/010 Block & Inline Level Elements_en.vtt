00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.270
In this video, we're going to look at inline level elements and block level elements.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.500
Now, certain tags or HTML elements are block, some are inline.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.430
Now, this is a page from W three schools, which is a great reference site and it shows us which elements

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.020
are block in which are inline.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.800
So all of these tags right here are block level.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.100
So we have paragraph form, all the tags, the heading tags, these header section, all this stuff.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.650
These are HTML five semantic tags, NAV Main, I'm going to talk about those in a little bit.

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.120
Those are very important.

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.310
But for now, let's check.

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.740
Let's look at the ones that we know, like paragraph, ordered list, unordered list, list, item.

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.360
All of these are block level.

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.310
And then for inline we have a tags which are links we have let's see button, we have span.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.870
We didn't talk about spans yet.

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.440
Select what else here have we looked at?

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.810
And these these bold and italics.

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.820
We're not going to be using those anymore.

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.990
Emphasise strong text area these are inline.

19
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.360
Now the difference here is that a block level element will span 100% width of the page.

20
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.270
So it basically goes across the whole page.

21
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.040
And then the next thing that you put on the page is going to be on the next line because it knocks it

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.450
down to the next line and inline element does not span across the page.

23
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.370
It only takes up that space.

24
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.120
Therefore, the next thing you put is going to go to the right of it.

25
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.830
It's just going to go right after it.

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.020
So let me give you some examples.

27
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.600
So let's open let's create a file here.

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.310
I'll call it zero eight, underscore block, underscore, inline dot HTML and we'll go ahead and put

29
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.480
our structure in here.

30
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.520
Let's say inline,

31
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.860
inline, verse, block and inside the body here.

32
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.470
Let's go ahead and put a paragraph, which is a block level element and I'll say Lorem, let's do lorem

33
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.550
30 tab or enter and we'll save that.

34
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.950
Let's go ahead and open this with live server.

35
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.010
So this is a block level element.

36
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:27.330
If I put another paragraph underneath it, right, let's say lorem 20 tab, notice how it gets pushed

37
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.470
on to the next line.

38
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.200
Paragraphs actually have styling by default.

39
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.130
See the space here?

40
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.330
They actually have default margin which I'm going to we'll talk about when we get to the CSS.

41
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.720
But since it's block level, it goes across the whole page and pushes the next one on to the next line.

42
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.280
Now a link in a tag is an inline element.

43
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.500
So let's go ahead and let's put a link not within a paragraph, but just a link itself.

44
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.180
And if we put a number sign, that just means it goes to the current page you're on.

45
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.410
It doesn't go anywhere.

46
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.500
And in here, let's just say a link.

47
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.370
And if I save it, this is an inline element, which means if we add another link, let's copy this

48
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.840
down and I save notice that it goes next to it.

49
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.940
It doesn't get pushed on to the next line because it doesn't it doesn't span all the way across.

50
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.220
So that's the difference here.

51
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.240
Now, I'm going to add a style attribute because I want to put a border around all of these just so

52
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.540
you can see kind of the outline of them.

53
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.300
And again, I don't suggest using style tags.

54
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.970
You want to use CSS, but we haven't gotten to that yet.

55
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.160
I'm just showing you this for an example and you'll learn all about borders and stuff later on.

56
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.520
But I'm just going to say Border Green, Solid, and we'll do the same with the next one.

57
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.350
So I'll just copy this and let's save that.

58
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.480
And you can see that it goes all the way across.

59
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.480
Now let's add a red border to the link.

60
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.720
So I'm just going to change this to red.

61
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.030
And read and save.

62
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.330
And you can see that it doesn't go all the way across.

63
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.730
Now, you might be saying, well, these paragraphs are, you know, they're long, they reach all the

64
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.899
way across the page.

65
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.760
But this doesn't the end doesn't.

66
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.019
If it were in line, the next one would start right here.

67
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:28.030
So even if I just had a one word paragraph and I save, it goes all the way across.

68
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.040
So that's the difference.

69
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.440
And it's very important to understand that.

70
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.150
So another block level element is an unordered list as well as list items.

71
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:47.260
So when I put a oops, when I put a list item in here and another one, it knocks it down to the next

72
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:55.390
line because it's, it's a block level element and you can change the you can change it from inline

73
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.240
to block or vice versa using CSS.

74
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.770
And we're going to get into that later.

75
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:08.530
But I just want you to understand the difference between inline and block and then those are not span.

76
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.070
I want to do a strong the topography semantic tags like strong and

77
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.150
strong and emphasis.

78
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.930
Those are also obviously inline because you can see we can make this strong, but it doesn't knock it

79
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.220
down to the next line.

80
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:35.620
So these these are inline and you also have something called inline block, which I'll talk about when

81
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.850
we get to CSS because it doesn't really pertain to to just HTML.

82
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.790
So hopefully that makes sense.

83
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.930
Guys, I just wanted to clear that up before we move on in the next video, we're going to talk a little

84
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.860
bit about Divs with IDs and classes.
