00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,940
Hello and welcome to Modern HTML and CSS from the beginning.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,440
In this video, we just want to talk a little bit about what you can expect from this course.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,110
So this is going to be a comprehensive course on HTML and CSS, and we're going to start from the absolute

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,990
beginning, starting with HTML five markup.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:31,220
We'll go through all the basics of CSS to the latest features like Flexbox, CSS grid, animation variables,

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,320
responsive design and much more.

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,870
Not only that, you'll also learn sass in this course, which is a CSS pre compiler that extends the

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,330
syntax of CSS to include things like nesting, inheritance functions and more.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,330
This course is composed of both learning sections where we'll basically be working in a sandbox to look

10
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,470
at certain features.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,710
And then we have about a half dozen projects ranging in size and then some mini projects on top of that.

12
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,410
So who is this course actually for?

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,270
The short answer is everyone.

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,640
Whether you're an absolute beginner, learn looking to learn how to build websites, how websites work,

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,360
or a seasoned developer that wants to get better at CSS, sass and UI creation in general without having

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,530
to rely on frameworks like bootstrap.

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:22,400
So sections one through four are geared more towards beginners as we go over the basics of HTML and

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,180
CSS.

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,480
So if you're comfortable with things like HTML five and CSS topics like font styles, basic alignment,

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,780
margin and padding, things like that, then feel free to skip these sections and start using flex CSS

21
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,970
grid animation and sass.

22
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,870
So here's a summary of some of the things that we'll be going over in this course.

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,210
So we'll start with the basics of how websites work and how the Internet works in general, in terms

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,570
of IP addresses, how exactly a website that's stored on a server somewhere else gets displayed in your

25
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,790
browser, we'll look at setup and tools.

26
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,700
We're using a text editor called VS Code, which is definitely the most popular editor in the web development

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,730
world, and we'll be using tools such as Emmet.

28
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,229
We'll install a couple of different extensions as well, get a workflow going.

29
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:16,070
We'll look at HTML five in terms of just the core basics of tags and attributes, we'll look at all

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,940
the basic tags.

31
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,000
We'll also look at the semantic tags like header footer aside, things like that, and show you how

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,720
to structure in a proper HTML five document, we'll be looking at CSS fundamentals like the box model,

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,380
font styles, things like that, responsive design.

34
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,890
So media queries, making everything look good on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets.

35
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,070
Every single project we create is going to be responsive.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,390
We'll be looking at Flexbox CSS grid, which are ways to align columns and rows.

37
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,990
We'll be looking at animation with transitions and keyframes.

38
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,650
CSS variables transform pseudo selectors.

39
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,750
We'll be building things like sticky menus.

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,200
Overlays will be styling forms and landing pages.

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,270
We'll even look at website deployment.

42
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,940
So making your website live on the Internet, using a shared host, we'll also be looking at a platform

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:17,870
called Net Phi and then finally we'll look at SAS, which is a CSS pre compiler to allow us to basically

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,910
extend the functionality of CSS and we'll create a portfolio project with that.

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,440
All right.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,920
So as I said, this is going to be a mix of learning sections and projects.

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,130
The learning lectures will include specific topics such as the box model, media queries and many other

48
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,670
things.

49
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,950
And then we'll also have six good sized projects along with some other mini projects.

50
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,370
So the first website project will be building is this hotel website, which is before we even get into

51
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,250
Flexbox in the grid and anything like that, we'll be using just basic CSS here, including floats,

52
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,200
because I think it's important to learn the basics, even though for the most part you're going to be

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,970
using Flex or the Grid.

54
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,390
Next project is this Edge Ledger website, which is a single page site for a financial company.

55
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,040
It includes Flexbox Image Overlay, Sticky menu, things like that.

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,850
We will be implementing a little bit of JavaScript for smooth scroll.

57
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,130
We'll be doing this in a couple of projects.

58
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,800
However, JavaScript is not the focus of this course.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,899
I just want to make that clear.

60
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,920
We will be using a little bit of it, but we're not going to really get into JavaScript.

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,330
This course is more about UI and HTML, CSS and sass.

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:37,520
So the next project is a news grid site where we use CSS grid, we use grid template columns and I show

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,740
you how to span rows and things like that.

64
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,490
Next, we'll build a landing page that uses a hamburger menu.

65
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,410
So you guys have probably seen this before.

66
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,720
You click it and it opens up a menu.

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,090
We'll have a big overlay that has the menu items.

68
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,200
We'll also animate the the the hamburger menu itself.

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,850
And we have a CSS timeline project where we have different items on the timeline.

70
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,620
We're going to add a little bit of JavaScript here to bring the items in from the side as we scroll

71
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,250
down.

72
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,670
And then the last project is a salad.

73
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:14,890
This project where we create a four page portfolio site with a home about a work page with some pretty

74
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,690
in-depth CSS animations transitions, and then a contact page.

75
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,210
And we're going to deploy this to a platform called Nullify and make the contact page actually work

76
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,680
with spam filtering.

77
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,230
All right, so that's it.

78
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,060
Hopefully you enjoy the course and learn a lot from it.

79
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,190
So let's jump in and get started.
