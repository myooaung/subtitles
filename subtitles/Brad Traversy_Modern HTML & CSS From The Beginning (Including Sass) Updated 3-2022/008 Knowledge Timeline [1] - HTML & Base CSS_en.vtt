00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.610
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.350
So we're going to start our next project, which is going to be a timeline.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.380
And some of you guys may have seen something like this before.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.360
It's just a timeline that has different years.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.950
It could be any type of data.

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.220
This happens to be just web development knowledge.

7
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.970
And when I actually learned this stuff, so you can see it starts in 2007 with HTML and CSS, then we

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.690
go to JavaScript and jQuery, PHP and WordPress and notice that we have these coming in from the sides,

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.970
just animating in, sliding in.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.290
Now we're going to have to add a little bit of JavaScript at the end if we want to have that type of

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.350
effect, because only in JavaScript can we tell where we are in the viewport and stuff like that.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.720
You can't do that with just pure CSS.

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.600
Also, when the page loads they'll come in from the side.

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
But as far as the whole layout here, we're going to do that first and we're just going to use HTML

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.140
and CSS for that.

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.500
All right.

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.650
So we'll try to do the JavaScript that at the very end.

18
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.830
So I have a empty folder called Knowledge Resume and we're just going to need to files for now.

19
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.550
So let's create index HTML and let's create style CSS.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.430
I'm just going to put the CSS right in the root and let's let's close up the sidebar and go into our

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.400
HTML and generate our boilerplate.

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.720
And for the title we'll just say knowledge timeline and let's link our style sheet.

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.860
So styled CSS and we're also going to be using font.

24
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.340
Awesome.

25
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.110
So let's grab that real quick.

26
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.980
So font awesome dot com, we'll click the start using free and then grab the link here, paste that

27
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.640
right in.

28
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.780
All right.

29
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.600
And then down in the body we're going to have a header and we'll give this an ID of just main dash header

30
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.210
and we're going to have in here a container class and then let's put an H one and we're going to have

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.950
that the brain icon.

32
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.070
So I the class of face for font.

33
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.759
Awesome.

34
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.600
And then a dash brain that will give us that icon.

35
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.560
And then we just want to put the text knowledge resume and you can change up this if you want if you

36
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.540
want to use different data and make it something completely different, that's, that's absolutely fine.

37
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.900
So let's put in an H three underneath and we just want to put the user's name, but I want to put an

38
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.190
icon as well so far as F a dash user.

39
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.170
And then next to that icon I'll put my name, but feel free to put your own.

40
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.030
And if we save this and open it up, we're going to see this.

41
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.010
So now under the header, we just want a section and we're going to give this an ID of timeline.

42
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.270
And like I said, all this is going to be is an unordered list.

43
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.260
So we're going to do a UL and then each line is just going to have a DIV and then it's going to have

44
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.760
an H three with the year and the technology.

45
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.770
I also want to put a Chevron icon.

46
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.490
So we're going to do phase F a dash.

47
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.650
Chevron dash.

48
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.700
Right.

49
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.580
And then we'll put a year so let's say 2007 and I'll say H, HTML and CSS and then underneath that I'll

50
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.490
do a paragraph with let's say 20 words, so I'll save that and it should look like this.

51
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.320
Now the what's cool about this project is the HTML is very simple.

52
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.130
It's just, it's just list items exactly like this.

53
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.780
There's no nothing's different.

54
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.920
They're all the exact same.

55
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.540
They just have different titles.

56
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.360
So in that case, I'm going to just paste the rest in because I don't want to just type out the same

57
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.670
thing over and over just with different titles.

58
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.630
So let me just go right under this ly and paste these in and save.

59
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.330
And basically if you want to pause the video, if you want to do exactly what I'm doing as far as the

60
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.840
text and the content, just change the titles.

61
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.000
It's the same as the the first one we did.

62
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.100
They're just different titles, different years.

63
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.520
Now I am going to add just some core styling in this video.

64
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.310
So we are going to use some variables.

65
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:25.530
So I'm going to have a root scope and I want a primary color and we're going to set that to a blue.

66
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.970
They're both going to be shades of blue.

67
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.620
So let's do 4 to 5 and we want b84.

68
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:41.130
So that's going to be our primary and then our secondary color is going to be hexadecimal and it's going

69
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.820
to be five, b, seven, b, b four.

70
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.280
So that will be our secondary color.

71
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.910
And then I'm just going to also set a max width and we'll set that to 1100 pixels.

72
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.520
So that's all I'm going to do for variables.

73
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.910
And again, if, if you guys find something that you think should.

74
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.560
Be put in a variable for easy access or whatever.

75
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.870
Feel free to do so.

76
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.960
And then I'm just going to add a reset.

77
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:19.920
So let's do margin zero, padding zero and box sizing for the box and then for the body.

78
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.170
Let's do a font.

79
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.360
Let's put everything in just the font tag.

80
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.130
So I'm going to do a normal font way.

81
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:37.620
Let's do one REM, let's do 1.5 line height and let's do aerial font sans serif.

82
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:45.600
So just a shortcut for the font and then the background for the body is going to be the primary color.

83
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.980
So let's grab that.

84
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.430
Okay.

85
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:58.140
And then the color is going to be white and I'm going to add an overflow.

86
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.440
I don't know if I showed you guys this, so I did.

87
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.040
I've done overflow hidden, which means that there's not going to be any scroll bars.

88
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.260
Also, it's going to include all the content.

89
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.990
It's not going to like stop above the content or whatever.

90
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.180
But we can also do overflow dash X and dash y and it just pertains to that access.

91
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.340
So I don't want to have any type of scroll bars that go horizontal.

92
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.860
So I'm going to set this to hidden.

93
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.760
All right.

94
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:34.260
And then I'm just going to add padding bottom of 50 pixels just to have a little bit of room on the

95
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.980
bottom.

96
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.190
So we'll save that and it's going to look like this.

97
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.650
So let's take care of the header real quick.

98
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.730
We have an ID of main header and that background is going to be the secondary color.

99
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.220
And let's add padding.

100
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.310
So we'll say top and bottom for REM.

101
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.350
And if we save that, good, now it has a container as well.

102
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.090
So let's say container.

103
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.360
Let's do a max width.

104
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.670
And we created a variable for that.

105
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:20.350
So max width is going to be the the width of the the UI and then or the header and then margin.

106
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.700
We want to do zero, top and bottom and auto left and right, push it to the middle and let's do text

107
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.110
align center and save that good.

108
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.530
And the H one, I want to be a little bigger.

109
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.930
So let's say h ones we want.

110
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.360
Let's do font size.

111
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.790
We'll do 2.3 rems.

112
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.000
And that's pretty much it.

113
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.540
Everything else that we're going to do is going to have to do with the timeline.

114
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.400
So we're going to stop the video here and we'll continue with the timeline CSIS in the next one.
