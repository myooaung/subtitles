1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,420
All right.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,070
So in this video, we're going to look at auto fit and Min Max, which can make your grid kind of responsive.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,120
And it's good in certain situations, not so good in some other situations.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,060
It's great for like image galleries, stuff like that, but probably not so much for just regular website

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,780
layout.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:29,130
So we're going to create a new file here called zero for underscore min max dot HTML and let's generate

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,110
our HTML here.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,530
Okay.

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,270
And I'm just going to copy the styling for the item.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,290
And paste that in here and then in the body.

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,190
Let's put our parents and then we'll do item.

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,390
And let's do Time's four.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,160
So we have four grid items.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,130
So let's set display grid onto our parent element here.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:17,660
And then we're going to set grid template columns and I want to set it to repeat.

16
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,110
And I want to set in here auto fit.

17
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,850
So auto fit.

18
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:32,440
And then instead of just setting a width here, I'm going to use min max, which is a minimum and a

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,070
maximum.

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,840
So it's going to take in those two things.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,110
I'm going to say a minimum of 300 pixels, a maximum of one F, R, which is just the whole fraction.

22
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,620
So let's save this and let's open this up.

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,800
So immediately you can see that there is at this browser size we have two columns, right?

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:02,440
But as soon as I get to 300 pixels, which is our minimum, it's going to just go to they're going to

25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,190
stack.

26
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,560
So it's pretty responsive.

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,820
And if I go bigger, you'll see we'll have three until it hits.

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,300
They hit 300 goes back goes to two bigger.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,830
Now if we were to make this, let's do like 200.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,500
And let's add in a bunch of items here and save.

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,910
So now you can see that it's it's pretty responsive.

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,340
It stacks here, but it's only good for certain types of content, in my opinion.

33
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:45,120
I don't use it for regular layout because if I wanted to have like, let's just, let's say I just wanted

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,200
three boxes, right where we have an icon, some text, it's like the features or whatever for the website.

35
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,150
I don't ever want it to be like that, you know.

36
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:04,740
So I like to have more control over it in media queries so that I can set it to be either three or stacked

37
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,280
like that.

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,840
I don't want this midpoint here, so it's good for some, some things, but not so good for others.

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,570
Image galleries, things like that.

40
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,530
It's really good for.

41
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,780
But I did want to just show you that.

42
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,810
But in the next video before we get to, I'm going to show you how to use media queries with the grid

43
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,440
as well.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,810
But before we get to that, I want to show you something called grid template areas which are really

45
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,170
nice.

46
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,690
They allow you to basically map out your content visually within your CSS.

47
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,060
And I'll show you what I mean in the next video.
