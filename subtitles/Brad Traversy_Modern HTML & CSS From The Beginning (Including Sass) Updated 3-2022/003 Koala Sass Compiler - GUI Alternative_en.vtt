00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.520
So this is kind of an aside from the rest of the section, I just want to give you a different option.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.900
If you don't want to deal with node sass and deal with the terminal, although I think it's easier than

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.180
using this this graphical program.

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.880
But nevertheless, I want to give you the the option.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.380
So if you go to Koala App.com, you can download this program.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.370
It's for Windows as well as Mac, and it's a gooey program and it compiles both sass and less.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.080
So I already have it installed.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.030
So if you download, install it just like any other piece of software and then open it up, it'll look

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.990
like this.

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.020
Now I also have VTS code open and I just created a test folder just to give you an example here and

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.490
I'm going to structure this just like we did in the last video, we'll have an SAS folder where we'll

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:55.440
have any SAS and then we'll create another folder called Dist and inside Dist, we're going to have

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.090
a folder called CSS and most likely, most likely an index HTML.

15
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.980
Like that.

16
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.550
All right.

17
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.690
Now in Koala, I'm going to say plus sign to add a project and I'm going to choose from desktop test.

18
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.970
Okay.

19
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.780
So we'll select that and.

20
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.450
Um.

21
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.460
Let's see.

22
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.870
So we don't have any SAS files, so let's create in SAS.

23
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.550
I'm going to create a new file called Main SAS.

24
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.570
Refresh that.

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.820
So now it sees that we have a SAS file.

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.310
Now by default when it compiles, it'll put the CSS file in the same folder in success.

27
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.060
We want to direct it to go into the CSS in the dist.

28
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.230
So we'll go to set output path and we're going to choose dist CSS.

29
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.710
Okay.

30
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.290
Please select the CSS file.

31
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.980
So we have to actually create the CSV file.

32
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.919
So we'll do main dot CSS like that and then let's do it again.

33
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.330
Set output path to dist CSS.

34
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.190
Main CSS.

35
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.140
Replace.

36
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.250
So now this is this is running.

37
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.740
We can go ahead and minimize this.

38
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.690
Now, when I write some sass in this main, so I'll do the same thing.

39
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:39.100
I'll do a color red body and let's do background.

40
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.870
Set it to color.

41
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.090
And when I save that, if I look in the main dot CSS, you'll see that a compiled.

42
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.830
It also creates a source map.

43
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.900
I'm not going to go over that, but you'll see there's a main dot CSS map as well.

44
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.170
So any time we change, like if I change this, actually what we'll do is we'll go to our index HTML

45
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.010
and let's include that CSS.

46
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.920
So we want to go see CSS slash main CSS.

47
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.380
All right.

48
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.810
If we go ahead and open this with a live server.

49
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.840
Actually live servers are already running.

50
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.650
So.

51
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.160
Let me just sit.

52
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.110
So.

53
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.140
Where is all right?

54
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.590
Here.

55
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.590
So I'm just going to stop live server from running.

56
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.210
I'm going to stop node sass and live server.

57
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.480
So now if I run live server from here, this is the test folder where we use Koala.

58
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.510
And if I go to my SAS and I change this to, let's say, green and save, you'll see that it changes.

59
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.910
All right.

60
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.730
So if you're more comfortable using Koala using the graphical interface, then by all means you can

61
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.480
do that.

62
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.700
However, we're going to stick to Node SAS.

63
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.210
All right.

64
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.580
So I just wanted to kind of add this as an aside to to give you another option.

65
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:13.000
Also, if you want to look into extensions, if we search for SAS and VS code, this right here live

66
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.040
SAS compiler will actually compile your SAS for you as well.

67
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.840
If you want to look into that, there's just there's so many different programs you can use, really.

68
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.940
So whatever works for you.

69
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.600
All right.

70
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.040
So I'm going to stop this.

71
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.630
I'm not going to use this anymore.

72
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.370
This test folder that I created, I just wanted to give you an example.

73
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.640
In fact, I'm going to just delete my project here and koala.

74
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.450
All right.

75
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.330
So in the next video, we're going to jump back into our SAS sandbox and we'll start to look at some

76
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.110
of the features.
