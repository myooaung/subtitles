1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,480
All right.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,440
So up to this point, we've only looked at HTML, which is definitely needed.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,930
We need it to actually put stuff on the page.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,180
But by itself, it's very ugly.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:16,560
We need CSS to style it and move things around and and align and add colors and background and anything

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,930
else that has to do with layout and style.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,560
So in this section, we're going to look at all the basics of CSS.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,410
So let's go ahead and create a new folder.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,040
And just like we did with HTML, we're going to create a sandbox.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:37,590
So I'm going to call this CSS sandbox and these files will be in the lecture, the last lecture, the

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,120
introduction, if you want to download those, or you can just create them along with me.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,790
So I'm going to open this with VS code.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:52,920
So in Visual Studio code, I'm just going to go ahead and open folder and open up CSS sandbox and we're

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,350
going to create in here a new file.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:04,319
And I'm going to call this just we'll call it basic .01 underscore basic dot HTML.

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,450
So I'm just numbering them.

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,520
So you know what order we're going in.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,620
And again, you don't have to number them.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:17,820
And if you didn't watch the last section, the HTML section, we are using an extension called Live

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,890
Server so that we can open our HTML file in a little server and it will auto reload.

21
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,920
So you just want to install that if you don't have that yet.

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,820
All right.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:34,260
I also went over some tips and tricks with shortcuts as well as Emit, which allows us to write faster

24
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,640
HTML so we can actually do exclamation and hit enter or tab and it'll give us this basic HTML structure.

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,540
So in the title here, I'm going to call this implementing CSS because I want to talk about the different

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,180
ways we can actually bring in CSS.

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,430
And we're going to look a little bit at selectors, but we're going to talk more about that in the next

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,150
video.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,910
So let's put some basic HTML in here.

30
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:06,570
I'm going to put an H one and just say heading one and then I'm going to copy this down by doing shift

31
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,060
option or shift alt on a Windows machine and then hit the down arrow twice.

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:24,150
So this will be heading two and heading three and let's actually make this an H to make this an H three

33
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,120
and I'm going to save this and then we're going to open with live server.

34
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,440
And right now I have this, I have both the browser and the editor on the same screen, but later on

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,050
we're going to have to make this bigger if we're going to build, you know, real websites and stuff.

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,300
So we have three headings on the screen and I'm going to show you three different ways to implement

37
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,290
CSS.

38
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,430
The first is called inline CSS, which is not something that you want to do, but it is something you

39
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,000
should know.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,970
And this is what we what we were doing in the last last section, the HTML section, when I just wanted

41
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,070
to show you a couple examples of stuff.

42
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,600
So we use the style tag and you can actually put CSS in here.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,710
Like let's say we want to use the color property and we want to set that to red.

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,590
If I go ahead and save that, the heading turns red.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,300
Now you don't want to do this.

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,130
And the reason for that is you want to you want to keep it's called separation of concerns.

47
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,700
You want to keep your styling out of your markup.

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,890
You want to keep those two things separate.

49
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,130
And when you do it like this, you're just clumping it all together.

50
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,790
It's much harder to read, it's much harder to change.

51
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,740
It's just not good practice and any developer will give you crap for doing this.

52
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,870
So this is not something you want to do, but it's something that you should know you can do.

53
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,710
All right.

54
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:52,350
So next one I want to show you is called internal CSS, where it's still on the same page.

55
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,100
It's on this HTML page, but it's separate from your HTML.

56
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,980
The way that you do this is inside your head tag.

57
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,470
You put in a style tag and then in here you can just put CSS.

58
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,410
Now with when you're using CSS, you need a way to select whatever it is you want to style.

59
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,410
Let's say we want to change the color of this h to well, we can use the actual element as the selector

60
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:23,040
so I can say h two and then open some curly braces and I can put as many styles in here as I want.

61
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,250
So let's say we want color and let's, let's add green.

62
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,960
And if I save that, notice that it turns green.

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,350
All right, now let's go over this syntax really quick.

64
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,030
So if we take a look here, I mean, this is similar to what we just did, except we use color instead

65
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,320
of background color.

66
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,450
But the first thing here is a selector.

67
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,130
In this case, it's an A tag.

68
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,790
What we just did was we did the H one, then we did the H two.

69
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,280
And you can use the actual tag as a selector, but you can also use IDs classes.

70
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,710
There's something called pseudo selectors.

71
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,910
There's a lot of different things.

72
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,780
We can do four selectors and we're going to get into that in the next video as well as later on.

73
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,920
So that's the selector.

74
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,390
Then we have the declaration start, we also have the declaration end.

75
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,020
So everything goes within these curly braces.

76
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,110
And inside the curly braces we have a property such as background colour or colour, as you just saw,

77
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,490
and then the value.

78
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,440
And in between that we have the property value separator, which is a colon.

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,670
All right, so you have the property and value and you can add more of these.

80
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,400
If we wanted to add a colour, we could do that as well.

81
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,010
You just want to end each one with a semicolon.

82
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,770
So this is the basically the just a diagram of how CSS works.

83
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,990
So we've looked at two ways to add CSS in line, which you don't want to do.

84
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,750
And then internal and I'm just going to put a comment here and you can have comments in CSS as well.

85
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,440
If I hold down control and hit the question mark or forward slash, you'll see that it adds in a forward

86
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,230
slash asterisk and ends with an asterisk.

87
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,010
Forward slash.

88
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,750
This is a CSS comment.

89
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,360
So in here I'm just going to say that this is internal CSS.

90
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:12,910
All right.

91
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,060
So I'm going to save that and I'm going to show you the third way, which is external CSS, where you

92
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,140
actually have a separate file that you bring in that has all your CSS.

93
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,760
So let's create a folder.

94
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,740
I'm going to go over here and I'm going to click the folder icon and call this folder CSS.

95
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,780
And in here let's create a file called Style DOT CSS.

96
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,020
That's a common name for a for a main stylesheet.

97
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,740
And you can include more than one style sheet if you want as well.

98
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,890
So now that we have a separate file, let's start let's grab this H three right here.

99
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:53,830
So I'm going to use the H three element as a selector and I'm going to do color blue.

100
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,680
We want to end that with a semicolon.

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, if I save this, you'll notice that the the H three is not is not blue.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,090
And the reason for that is this file has no clue that it's supposed to look at that, that style CSS.

103
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,890
We actually have to bring that in.

104
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:15,070
And the way that we do that is with a link tag, HTML has a link tag that we can use in the header.

105
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:21,550
So we'll say link and then I'll hit Enter or tab and it gives us some necessary attributes such as Rel.

106
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,640
This tells it basically what, what type of link is this.

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,820
It's for a stylesheet and then in a graph, just like with the A tags, this points to the location

108
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,540
that we want to basically load, which in our case is in the folder called CSS and it's a file called

109
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,600
Style CSS.

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,190
So if I save this now, you'll see that the h23 change is blue.

111
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,680
That's because we're now including this file.

112
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,480
If we don't have this, if I comment this file out and save, it's not going to read it.

113
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,290
So you want to make sure that you include your style sheets.

114
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,890
Now out of these three, this is the preferred using an external CSS file.

115
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,260
When we build our projects, when we create a website, all our CSS will be in a separate file.

116
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:14,170
However, for this sandbox, for this section, I'm going to be doing it this way because I don't want

117
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,460
for a couple of reasons.

118
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,800
One reason I don't want to have to go back and forth to to go to my CSS.

119
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,010
I also want you guys to get a big picture of what's going on.

120
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,300
So I want you to see the HTML and the CSS at the same time.

121
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,460
But usually you would do it this way.

122
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,049
You would have a separate file.

123
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
So just keep that in mind.

124
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:40,720
So in the next video, we're going to start to look at how to use IDs in classes for selectors, how

125
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,250
to use multiple selectors, nested selectors, things like that.

126
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,990
So I will see you in the next video.
