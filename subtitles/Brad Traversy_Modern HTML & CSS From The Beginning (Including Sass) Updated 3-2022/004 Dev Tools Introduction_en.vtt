00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.600
All right.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.689
So before we get into CSS properties and stuff like that, I want to take a break from from via code

3
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.830
and just go into Google and take a look at the dev tools.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.750
Now, if you're not using Google, if you're using Firefox or Safari, those also have developer tools

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.980
and they have all they can do.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.690
All the stuff we're going to do in this video, you just might have to look up the shortcut to get to

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.030
them or the menu item to get to them.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.090
So in Chrome, if you're on windows, you can hit F 12.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.840
That should open them.

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.640
If you're on a mac, you can do option option command I and that will also open them and it's also in

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.150
the menu.

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.520
So if you go up here and you go to more tools, I know you guys can't see it, but off to the right

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.500
there's a developer tools option and I can click that and that will also open them up.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.900
So there's a lot of tabs here.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.790
And this, they're very powerful.

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.410
We can see network connections.

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.180
We have a JavaScript console.

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.100
There's all types of stuff we can do here.

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.950
But what we want to focus on is the Elements tab.

20
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.390
And what this does is it shows us all the HTML and CSS for the page.

21
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.950
And by the way, if you want to make this bigger or smaller, you can hit control plus to make it bigger

22
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.290
or control, minus to make it smaller.

23
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.430
Also, if you want it to dock on the side, you can hit go like that or the other side or you can even

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.390
undock it.

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.820
This will undock it and put it in a separate window.

26
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.130
I just I usually like to have it on the bottom.

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.730
But anyways, this is the HTML over here.

28
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.110
This is the CSS.

29
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.990
Now notice when I hover over something like the body, it actually highlights everything that's in the

30
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.440
body.

31
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.640
If I hover over the div with the idea of welcome, it hovers over that.

32
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.870
If I collapse this and I go over the H to the paragraph, so whatever I hover over, it's going to highlight

33
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.070
in the browser.

34
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.440
And then if we want to select something, we can go ahead and hit the select tool, see how it turned

35
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.040
blue.

36
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.930
And then let's say I want to look at the HTML in CSS for this welcome this h to right here.

37
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.980
I can click that and notice that it's now highlighted down here and it also shows me the CSS.

38
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:12.630
So it shows me the H two CSS and the class of primary heading because that's a class that's actually

39
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.620
on this element.

40
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.340
Now, we didn't put any of this H H2 stuff in here, the font size display block, there's some margin

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.080
here, font weight, bold.

42
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.570
This is default browser styling.

43
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.760
Every browser has default styling.

44
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.490
For the most part, it's it's pretty much the same.

45
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.570
And the way that we can tell this is from the browser is right here user agent stylesheet by user agent

46
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.170
it basically means the browser that you're using this here, this styling is coming from our selectors

47
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.190
HTML file.

48
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.000
Now usually this will be a CSS file because like I said, usually we use external CSS files and you'll

49
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.280
see that when we start getting into projects.

50
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.390
But it's just going to give us whatever the file name the CSS is located in.

51
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.380
All right.

52
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.160
Now we can actually change stuff here too temporarily.

53
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.690
So this welcome text right here, if I wanted to change this to let's say hello and then click somewhere

54
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.970
else, you'll see the text actually changes.

55
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.720
I can also like I can change this if I want to.

56
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.930
I don't know other class.

57
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.320
And now you'll see that it's no longer blue because it doesn't have the primary heading class.

58
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.990
The primary heading is where that blue came from.

59
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.730
Now what school is you can do this with any site.

60
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.830
Like if we go to Google.com

61
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.500
and we open up our tools here.

62
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.700
And what I want to do is click the select select type icon and then this button right here.

63
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.470
So this is actually an input.

64
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.060
It has the type of submit.

65
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.820
Remember we learned about this stuff in the in the last section and the value is, I'm feeling lucky.

66
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.970
So if I double click this, I can change this to whatever.

67
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.150
Let's say I'm feeling awesome and you might want to have some fun with this and notice that it's changed

68
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.170
now in the browser.

69
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.130
Now it hasn't changed on Google servers, so other people can see it.

70
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.649
It's only locally to our browser and if we reload the page it goes back to normal.

71
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.740
So if we wanted to change some CSS, let's go up here and let's click on the body.

72
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.350
That gives us the CSS of the body.

73
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.790
Let's say we wanted to change the background here, which is white.

74
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.750
This is hexadecimal for white.

75
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.070
Let's change it to red.

76
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.140
So now we have a red body.

77
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.660
You can change the color here to white.

78
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.180
And notice the text up here is not white because this has its own styling.

79
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.500
So if I click the select tool and let's click one of these links right here, notice the color is black,

80
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.140
so I'm going to select that and change it to white.

81
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.000
And now these links are white.

82
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.160
So you can really have some fun here.

83
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.260
You could replace the image link if you want.

84
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.680
Whoops.

85
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.720
I don't mean to do that, but yeah.

86
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.280
See now it goes back to normal.

87
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.990
But you could change a whole bunch of stuff.

88
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.320
You can add content and it's only local to your machine.

89
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.340
No one else sees it.

90
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.340
Obviously that would the internet would be a crazy place if you could just edit anyone's site, but

91
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.390
it is kind of fun to mess with and you can learn a lot from doing stuff like that.

92
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.110
All right.

93
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.300
So I just wanted to kind of introduce you to the the chrome tools, the developer tools.

94
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.590
And we will be using these more as we go along in the course.

95
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.640
So in the next video, we're going to start to look at fonts.

96
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.690
I want to look at different font families.

97
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.000
I want to talk about website fonts, and we'll also look at colors.

98
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.340
All right.

99
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.660
So I'll see you in the next video.
