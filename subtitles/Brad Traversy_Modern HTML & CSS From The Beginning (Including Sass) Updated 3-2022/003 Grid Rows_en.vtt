00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.570
All right.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.560
So in the last video, we looked at how to create a grid and how to deal with the grid template columns

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.100
property.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.740
Now, there's also a grid template rows property.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.270
And we're going to we're going to look at that.

6
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.990
We're also going to talk about the implicit grid or implicit rows.

7
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.330
So let's create a new file here called zero to underscore grid underscore rose dot HTML.

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.150
And I'm going to actually copy what we have in the grid columns file because there's going to be some,

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.440
some things that are similar.

10
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.390
So paste that in and we'll change the title here and let's get rid of everything in this grid class

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.860
except for display grid.

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
I want to keep the item styling, get rid of main.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.060
We don't want that.

14
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.770
We don't want this main down here.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.800
I just wanted to show you how easy it was to create a basic, main, main area and sidebar.

16
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.850
But we're going to keep this here and let's open this with live server.

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.020
All right.

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.390
So remember with Flexbox, we have a row and a column we can set flex direction to either row or column

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.230
with the grid.

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.870
We have we also have rows and columns.

21
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:23.070
So I'm going to go ahead and set grid dash template rows and let's set this to we'll do one far too

22
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.600
far, three far.

23
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.890
So I'm going to save this and let's see what we get here.

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.910
So as you can see there, they're vertical.

25
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.650
So it's not we're not adding columns here, so it's not going horizontally.

26
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.050
And the first one is one.

27
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.770
If our second is two, if our third is three, f, r, if I were to add another one here and go for

28
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.300
a far, the next one will be for f r, but notice the ones that are remaining where we don't add a specific

29
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.170
value.

30
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.090
Four They're just going to stay the same.

31
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.710
They're all going to look like this.

32
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.580
This is actually called the implicit grid or implicit rows because we didn't we didn't manually set

33
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.030
them.

34
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.830
In fact, I'm going to take this one off and there's actually another property we can use if we want

35
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.870
to set these to something different.

36
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.030
And that's grid auto rows.

37
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:27.390
So if we say grid dash, auto dash rows, we can set this to let's say we want the rest of them to be

38
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.620
3fr as well, just like the last one that we put here.

39
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.890
So we can say three F, R and save.

40
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.280
And now the rest of them are all 3fr.

41
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.690
All right.

42
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.040
Now, unlike Flexbox, the grid is multi dimensional.

43
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.070
So we can we can use grid template rows along with grid template columns.

44
00:02:50.070 --> 00:03:00.570
So just to show you that, let's say grid dash template dash columns and let's say we want to do let's

45
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.950
do repeat.

46
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.450
We'll just have to.

47
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.470
So we'll say repeat two and let's do one f.

48
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.550
What did I spell wrong here?

49
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.550
Oops.

50
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.650
So we'll save that.

51
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.930
And now you can see that we have our columns, which is just two one fr so the columns are even, but

52
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.300
then we're also, we also have our rows, which are one far too far and three too far.

53
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.770
And this, this will still be in effect.

54
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.330
So if I were to add extras down here and save, you'll see that those will all be three fr all right.

55
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.620
And if I wanted three rows, there are three columns, I could do that as well.

56
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.320
So you can really create the layout that you want and you can span items across multiple rows and columns.

57
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.240
And I'm going to show you how to do that as well.

58
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.990
All right.

59
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.420
But that is grid template rows.

60
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.320
So that's it.

61
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.730
I'll see you in the next video.
