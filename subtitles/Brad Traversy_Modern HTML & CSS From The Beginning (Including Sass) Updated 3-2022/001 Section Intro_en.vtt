00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.810
All right.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.100
So we've learned about HTML, including page structure tags, syntax attributes and more.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.540
But HTML by itself is very ugly, as you've seen.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.450
So we need CSS, our cascading style sheets to make our markup or HTML look presentable.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.410
So the goal of this section is to look at the fundamental CSS properties for things like fonts, colors,

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.730
alignment, positioning, etc..

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.189
Now this section after this will will be creating an actual website project, but I didn't want to jump

8
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.680
right into that, right into a full project because I want you guys to really understand what's going

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.590
on and understand what these properties are doing.

10
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.110
Rather than just jump into a website project and have you copy the code and just follow along.

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.580
If you're really comfortable with basic CSS, feel free to skip around.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.290
But even if you've worked with CSS before, I think that there will be things in this section that will

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.420
still help you out that you can still learn.

14
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.310
So here's a list of what we'll be going over in this section.

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.780
I'm going to show you how to actually implement CSS.

16
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.020
There's a few different ways we're going to look at basic selectors so that we can actually grab different

17
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250
elements, whether it's by the tag name or the ID, the class.

18
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.690
We'll look at fonts and colors and different properties, different color types like hexadecimal or

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.520
GB.

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.280
We're going to look at backgrounds and borders, including background colors, background images, box

21
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950
model and margin and padding.

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.110
We're going to look at what the box model is, what exactly margin is, where that spacing goes, where

23
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.080
the padding goes floating in alignment.

24
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.150
Now, there are more, more modern ways to align things on a page such as Flexbox and the Grid system,

25
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.070
and we're going to get into that later on.

26
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.580
This section is all about just core basic CSS.

27
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.490
We're also going to be looking at the display property.

28
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
So display inline display block, inline block.

29
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.450
We'll look at styling links and buttons, creating menus such as a horizontal navigation menu as well

30
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.850
as a vertical menu positioning.

31
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.680
So relative positioning, absolute fixed and so on, form styling.

32
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.190
And then we're also going to be using the Google Chrome dev tools quite a bit to look at the HTML and

33
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.990
CSS as well as like the computed CSS and stuff like that.

34
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.370
All right.

35
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.500
So just like with the the last section, we're going to have a sandbox.

36
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.200
So this will be the CSS sandbox where we're going to have a different file for different aspects of

37
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.920
of the the section, different aspects of CSS.

38
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.780
And you can keep this and use it if you ever need to go back to and these files will be included in

39
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.190
the lecture downloads.

40
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.420
And then after this section, we're going to start putting everything together and we're going to build

41
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.310
a simple hotel website.

42
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.210
So and you can either use the CSS sandbox Stata files, or you can just create the files as you go like

43
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.800
I'm going to be doing in the video.

44
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.520
But that's it.

45
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.020
Let's go ahead and get started.
