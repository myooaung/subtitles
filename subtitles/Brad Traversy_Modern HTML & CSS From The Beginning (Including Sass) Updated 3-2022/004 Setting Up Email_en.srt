1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,990
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,950
So before we go ahead and create an FTP account and upload our website, I want to show you how to create

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,440
an email account and also how to create an email forwarder in case you want to send your email to something

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,430
like Gmail.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,060
So you want to go to your C panel and click on email accounts.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,880
And it's very simple, very self explanatory.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,300
We have one domain on this account which is edge ledger dot net.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,750
So let's say we want to create Brad at Edge Ledger dot net as an email address and we'll put a password

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,350
in here.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,400
You can also choose to generate a password.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,340
And then you can choose a quota.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,560
So if you have employees and you don't want their emails to take up so much room on the server, you

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,690
can limit it or you can do unlimited.

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,610
You can also choose to send a welcome email with client configuration instructions.

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,910
So if you're if you have a company and you use like outlook or something like that or Gmail, you can

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,160
send them, you know, the account configuration stuff, but we're not going to do that.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,610
So let's click create account and we get success.

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,940
If we click this view right here, it'll show us the email account.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,580
Also, if we go back out to see panel and we click on email accounts, we'll see it here as well.

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,780
Now to check your email, you can do that right from C panel by just checking off or clicking access

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,560
web mail.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,100
And it's basically going to ask us which which default application we want to use.

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,780
And they're all pretty much the same.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,390
I would suggest using something like Gmail, just forwarding all your email there and then within the

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,460
Gmail settings, you can actually make it so you can send email from your account as well.

26
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,260
If you just look on the Gmail, the Google documentation, you can find out how to do that.

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,690
So I usually choose squirrel mail.

28
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,820
If I do use this, you're probably going to get a welcome page where you need to put in your name and

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,070
stuff like that and then just click submit and then this is the inbox here.

30
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,830
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go off screen onto my Gmail account and I'm going to send an

31
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,510
email to Brad at Edge Ledger Dot Net just to make sure that it works.

32
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:22,310
So I'll say Brad at Edge Ledger dot net and I'll just say hello.

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,420
And it works.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,770
All right.

35
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,450
So I'm going to go ahead and send.

36
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,480
And let's reload our page here and it might take a couple of seconds.

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,210
It's chicken box.

38
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,170
Should be here any minute or any second.

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,960
There it is.

40
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,440
All right.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,560
So from Brad Travis, see if we go to hello.

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,850
You can see that the message is it works.

43
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,620
And I just put hello in the subject.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,020
So this isn't the best looking interface.

45
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,020
So like I said, I would probably use Gmail or something.

46
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,890
So to add a forwarder, we can go back to C panel.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:10,460
Let's close that up and let's go home and then forwarders and let's say add forwarder.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,260
So the address we want to forward is Brad and the domain.

49
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,990
We only have one domain which is edge ledger dot net.

50
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:24,170
So it's going to use that email address and I'm going to forward it to tech guy info at gmail.com.

51
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:24,950
All right.

52
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,780
So we'll say add forwarder.

53
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,440
And now anything that's sent to Brad at Edge Ledger dot net is also going to go to tech guy Infocom.

54
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,620
Now if you're not going to use something like Gmail, if you're if you're going to use your C panel

55
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,700
email, there's a there's a shorter way to get to your inbox rather than logging into C panel, clicking

56
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,770
on email accounts, searching for it.

57
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,200
What you can do is you can go to your domain so we can go to edge ledger dot net and then just slash

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,010
web mail.

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,420
So it's going to take us to this login right here and you can log in with your email address and password

60
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,870
and there we go.

61
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,010
And you can if you want if you don't want to show this screen, every time you can choose to set squirrel

62
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,290
mail or any of these as your default, that way it just automatically goes right into your inbox.

63
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,370
So that's just a much easier way to get to your inbox.

64
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,150
So you can also set up things like auto responders.

65
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,100
So if you're out of the office, you can do that filters, spam, filtering.

66
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,210
I'm not going to go through all this.

67
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,860
It's out of the scope of the course.

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,310
But I just wanted to show you how to how to get your email set up.

69
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,700
All right.

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,580
So in the next video, we're going to set up an FTP account.

71
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,260
We're going to I'm going to show you how to use something called file zilla so that we can actually

72
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,050
upload our website to edge ledger dot net.
