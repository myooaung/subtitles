1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.570
All right.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.160
So now we're going to start to make our hotel website responsive because there's some things that we

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.920
need to change on on smaller screens.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.890
So if we take a look, the menu looks okay right now.

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.090
But if we add more links, it's going to start to look funky down here.

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.830
I don't like this how this is.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.350
These are too skinny to be side by side.

8
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.000
Also, the text runs off.

9
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.040
These should be stacked as well.

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.440
So we basically want to stack everything that's that's being floated on larger screens on the about

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.010
page.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.650
We want to stack these we probably want to change the line height for the heading down here.

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.470
These are coming out of its container because the height is fixed here and then contact the form looks

14
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.740
good.

15
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.270
But this these should be stacked.

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.020
So if we have a few things that we need to change or just change on smaller screens now we could put

17
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.360
media queries right in our styles, CSS, but this, this style sheet is already pretty big.

18
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.920
So what I'm going to do is create a whole new style sheet in the CSS folder called Mobile CSS.

19
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.520
And we're just going to go to our index and right below the style CSS link, I'm just going to copy

20
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.570
that down.

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.580
We'll change this to mobile and then we just want to add a media attribute and we're going to set this

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.280
to screen and and then a set of parentheses and we'll say max width, let's do 768 pixels.

23
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.080
So basically tablets and less tablets, smartphones, any, any small device.

24
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.020
And then that's that style sheet should kick in.

25
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.210
So to test it out in mobile CSS, I'm just going to do a body and do display none which will make the

26
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.760
whole body disappear on small screen.

27
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.670
So if I save that, you'll see there's nothing showing until I hit that 768 breakpoint.

28
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.940
So we know that that is actually in effect.

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.680
So we'll get rid of that.

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.120
I just wanted to test it out.

31
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.320
Now in our index file, we're going to start with the menu, which looks fine now, but if I take this

32
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.400
last list item, the contact link here and I go go down three more times and save, you'll see that

33
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.780
now it looks messed up.

34
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.940
So what I want is everything to be centered, the logo centered, and then all the links to be in a

35
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.230
vertical fashion.

36
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.730
So what I'll do is I'm going to keep our style CSS open and take our mobile CSS and move it over to

37
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.980
this half over to the right side.

38
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.760
That way we can see both at the same time and see what we need to change.

39
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.250
I'm also going to close up the sidebar here.

40
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.560
Now for the nav bar.

41
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.570
Let's see.

42
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.720
Let's go down.

43
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.530
To our nav bar and we're floating the H one, the logo to the left.

44
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.240
We're floating the UL to the right.

45
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.640
We want to basically set those to float none.

46
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.280
So let's say nav bar h one.

47
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.300
And you know, we should be actually targeting the logo class.

48
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.790
See how the H one has a class of logo.

49
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.510
So let's actually do nav bar logo.

50
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.910
We'll do that here and over here.

51
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.380
Dot logo.

52
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.740
All right.

53
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.220
And then we're going to set this to float.

54
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.690
None.

55
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.860
Just doing that.

56
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.240
It's not going to change anything.

57
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.830
But we want it in the middle.

58
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.980
So we're going to say text a line center.

59
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.520
And if I save that now that's put in the center.

60
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.350
Now, for these, I want to first get rid of the float on the UL.

61
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.850
You can see it's floated to the right.

62
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.030
I also want to get rid of the float on the allies.

63
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.910
So we want to remove both of those.

64
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.820
Now I could combine both float.

65
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.470
What am I doing?

66
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.000
So we'll say nav bar.

67
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.680
UL And let's also do nav bar.

68
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.930
LY And we want to set both of them to float none and save.

69
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.720
Actually.

70
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.230
You know what?

71
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.480
This.

72
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.519
This is not overwriting this because over here we specified the UL.

73
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.090
So we'll just have to do that here as well in order for it to overwrite it.

74
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.530
All right.

75
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:32.480
Now, this comes down quite a bit and later on, you're probably going to learn JavaScript where you

76
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.240
can create some kind of button and you can click it and then have this menu just kind of transition

77
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.990
down.

78
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.810
We may even get into some of that later on, but right now we're just dealing with straight HTML, CSS,

79
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.700
no animation or anything like that.

80
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.610
So I think one thing we could do is get rid of some of the padding, not make these so, so wide, so

81
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.250
fat, so it doesn't come down as much.

82
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.920
So let's grab nav bar.

83
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.640
Ul ly a we want to grab the link because that's where the padding is.

84
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.790
If we look over here, it has padding 20 pixels.

85
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.260
So I'm going to update that to be only five pixels on small screens.

86
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.430
All right.

87
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.230
Now they kind of look bunched together.

88
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.270
So what I'll do is add a border as well, a very faint border.

89
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:29.600
So let's do border bottom and let's do just a shade lighter.

90
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.370
We'll do four, four, four, let's do dot it as a style and one pixel.

91
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.980
So we'll save that.

92
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.780
And now that looks much better.

93
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.120
So we still have our hover effect.

94
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.400
Good.

95
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.520
So the next thing I want to do, actually, let's get rid of those extra links that will make it look

96
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.460
better because there's not there won't be as many links.

97
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.840
Okay.

98
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.030
So now we have a responsive menu.

99
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.040
So we have our standard nav bar and then we have our responsive nav bar.

100
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:12.520
So the next thing I want to do is we'll skip the showcase when we test with the devices in the dev tools.

101
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.680
We may need to update this a little bit, but for now, let's move on to the home info section.

102
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.760
And one thing I want to change is the height.

103
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.730
If we go down to our home info ID, it's 400.

104
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:35.470
I want to actually change it to 450 because it was covering the read more even when it was a little

105
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.210
bit above 768 like right here on 400.

106
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.530
If I change it to 400, you can see that it kind of runs down a little bit.

107
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.040
So we want that to be 450 like that.

108
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.210
And then once we hit that 768 mark and mobile CSS kicks in, what I want to do is just get rid of that

109
00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.310
image completely and have this whole dark part with the text go all the way across.

110
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:08.320
So let's add in here home info and we're going to take the image.

111
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.420
So home dash info and I believe right here it has a class of info image.

112
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.080
And I'm actually going to set that to display.

113
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.430
None.

114
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.550
All right.

115
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.380
So now that image is gone.

116
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.670
Next thing we need to do is the info content, which is this part here.

117
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.480
We need to get rid of the float because right now it's float, right?

118
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.450
So we need to get rid of the float.

119
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.410
Actually, I'll just copy this whole thing.

120
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.150
And we need to change the float, the width and the height.

121
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.910
So the float should be none.

122
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.660
And actually the height.

123
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.790
We'll just leave that.

124
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.080
But the width we want to change to 100% because we want it to go all the way across.

125
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.610
So let's save that.

126
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.560
And there we go.

127
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.550
All right.

128
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.550
So you can see that this that these parts are now responsive.

129
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.470
Once we hit that part, it goes.

130
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.710
Down like that.

131
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.070
Okay.

132
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.350
So the next part is the three boxes right here.

133
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:23.410
Now, these have a class of box, which it's the same class that's on these as well.

134
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:29.320
So it's also going to pertain to this basically anywhere on the site where we want to where we want

135
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.150
to line these boxes up like this.

136
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.610
They have that box class right here.

137
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.470
So we want to clear those and then we want to set them to 100%.

138
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.210
That's really all we have to do.

139
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:51.420
So let's say boxes and dot box, we want to save float none and we want to set the width to 100%.

140
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.410
We'll save that.

141
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.240
And now you can see they're nicely stacked, so that looks pretty good.

142
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.210
Now we're going to move on to the about page.

143
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:07.720
And this is not going to take effect yet because we haven't added these the link tag to the about page.

144
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.610
So let's go to index and let's copy loops.

145
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.310
Let's just go to this index.

146
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.660
You know, let me close this up for a second.

147
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:25.000
So from index, I'm going to copy this link to the mobile CSS, which has this media attribute and I'm

148
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.160
going to put it in a boat right under the style CSS and save.

149
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.540
I'm also going to do it with contact.

150
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.580
So on the contact page, right below style CSS, we'll paste that in as well.

151
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.940
That way we have it working on all pages.

152
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:46.900
So let's see, let's bring back mobile CSS and bring it over to the side.

153
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.320
And close that up.

154
00:09:53.830 --> 00:10:01.930
And we need to clear this float right here, because if we look at the style CSIS, we have info, right?

155
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.310
Which is float, right?

156
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.940
We have info left which is float left and they're both 50% wide.

157
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:16.300
So what we need to do is clear or not clear but set float to none for both and set the width to 100%

158
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.070
for both.

159
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.170
So let's go down here and let's say about and we're going to grab a boat info

160
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.100
info.

161
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.280
Dash Right.

162
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:37.720
And let's also grab a boat info info.

163
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.620
Dash Left because we're doing the same thing for both.

164
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.600
So we might as well just, just put them both on, on the same style.

165
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.220
So let's do float none and let's do with.

166
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.290
All right.

167
00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.630
100%.

168
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.920
And save.

169
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.400
All right, cool.

170
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.520
Now for the heading here.

171
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.290
I actually want this to be aligned to the center.

172
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:19.500
So if you remember, this has a class of L heading, so I'm just going to grab that class l dash heading,

173
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.080
and we're going to text a line to the center.

174
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.500
And then another thing I want to do is the L heading and the style cos I just want to add a line height

175
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.070
to.

176
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.350
Because the words were running into each other.

177
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.250
So let's see.

178
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.270
Where is it?

179
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.400
Uh, it should be up here at the utility right here.

180
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.370
So l heading.

181
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.100
I'm going to say line height.

182
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.320
Let's change it to 1.1.

183
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.250
Point two.

184
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.770
All right.

185
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.870
Now, let's see.

186
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.700
What else do we want to do here?

187
00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.680
The info, right.

188
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.140
Which is the image.

189
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.670
I kind of want to move that down a little bit.

190
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.500
I think it's too close right here.

191
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.140
So I'm going to grab this.

192
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.260
We'll go right here and we'll just add a margin top to it.

193
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:21.040
So let's do 30 pixels so that move that down a little bit.

194
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:21.990
All right.

195
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.800
Now the testimonials here.

196
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.970
You can see that the boxes are kind of coming out a little bit.

197
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:35.610
So to fix that, we should probably actually put that in the style sheet over here.

198
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.050
So let's find testimonials.

199
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.820
So we get height 600 pixels.

200
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.400
What if we just set this to height?

201
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.110
100%.

202
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:51.850
There we go.

203
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.560
So that fixes that.

204
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.930
We don't even have to add anything special there.

205
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.580
So that looks pretty good to me.

206
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.650
Now let's go to the contact and notice that these are already stacked because remember, these have

207
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.960
a class of box and we've already cleared.

208
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.430
We've already done the floating on.

209
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.500
We've already done with 100%.

210
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.640
One thing that I would like to do, though, is have a border, because I think this just I don't know,

211
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.250
it looks like there's too much space in between here.

212
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.760
So let's go down here.

213
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:32.130
We'll say contact and let's target the contact dash info and we want to target the box class inside

214
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:38.520
there, not just dot box because we don't want borders on the in the other boxes which are on the home

215
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:38.850
page.

216
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.960
We don't need that because as you can see, they kind of revolve the colors.

217
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.280
So we don't need it there.

218
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:51.420
But for the contact boxes, let's do border bottom.

219
00:13:52.560 --> 00:14:00.660
Let's do four for four dotted, one pixel and save.

220
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.500
And now you can see we have the border.

221
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.270
I just think it gives it a little just a little texture, I guess.

222
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.340
Okay, cool.

223
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.910
So what else do we want to do here?

224
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.330
I think we're ready to start testing it on the actual devices.

225
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.440
So I'm going to make this bigger.

226
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:23.280
I'm going to open up our dev tools and let's click on the device icon here.

227
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:30.930
And for this course, I'm only going to be testing on iPhone X six, seven, eight Galaxy.

228
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:37.680
I don't care about iPhone five because the screen size is so small that we'll have to add extra media

229
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.300
queries just for that.

230
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.480
And not too many people have an iPhone five anymore.

231
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.920
If you want to add those, add those styles yourself, you can do that.

232
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.110
But we're not going to focus on that.

233
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.140
So let's see if we look at this.

234
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.520
This looks pretty good.

235
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.770
One thing I would I notice, though, is that this is pushed down quite a bit.

236
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:03.690
So we may want to look into that about page looks good.

237
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.600
This is pushed down quite a bit.

238
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.210
Contact page looks good.

239
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.650
All right.

240
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.920
Let's look at iPhone six, seven, eight.

241
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.170
So kind of same thing, really.

242
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.720
It looks good.

243
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.230
Let's try the galaxy.

244
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.210
Yeah.

245
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.570
Pretty much all the same.

246
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.310
But if we look at the iPhone five, you can see that the screen is so small that it kind of messes up

247
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:34.060
a little bit.

248
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.320
So you might want to just mess with the heights and stuff like that.

249
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.630
But I don't want to get too deep into this.

250
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.640
I just want it to look good on on on modern iPhones and the Galaxy.

251
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.190
Pixel's pixel also looks good.

252
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.350
So let's let's change this right here, the spacing.

253
00:15:54.950 --> 00:16:00.680
I'm going to go back into mobile CCIS and let's go above or actually let's go right below where the

254
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.910
nav bar is.

255
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:20.300
And let's say showcase, actually showcase and we want the ID showcase and I'm going to set the height

256
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.370
to 100%.

257
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.900
So we have the height at 100% now.

258
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:35.510
And then I'm going to set the padding top to 70 pixels and I'm going to add some padding to the bottom.

259
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.130
Right now, the padding is what is the padding on showcase?

260
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.060
Let's see.

261
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.120
Yeah.

262
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.480
Showcase.

263
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.440
Oh, yeah.

264
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.480
Padding top.

265
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:50.110
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.740
Not showcase.

267
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.970
Showcase content.

268
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.800
The padding top is 170, so I'm going to change it to 70, which will move it up.

269
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.470
So let's actually just grab this.

270
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.240
And then we can take these out.

271
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.819
So we'll do padding top 70 and then to add some space on the bottom.

272
00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.150
Let's do padding bottom 30 pixels.

273
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.220
And there we go.

274
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.420
That looks much better.

275
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.940
And that's the pixel two.

276
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.329
So if we look at the iPhone and let's take a look at the iPad.

277
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.600
So that's the iPad.

278
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.020
Good.

279
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.740
And the iPad Pro is just going to look like the desktop.

280
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.650
Because it's so wide.

281
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.720
Okay.

282
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.040
So now what I want to do is check out the landscape view.

283
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.610
So let's hit the landscape.

284
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:53.300
And if you wanted to, you could put a media query for the height and you could you could lessen the

285
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.260
padding here.

286
00:17:54.260 --> 00:18:00.200
But I think it's fine because as we scroll, it looks good, you know, but if you absolutely need to

287
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:07.040
have this above the fold when when the person lands on the page in landscape mode, you could do that.

288
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:12.500
But yeah, the rest of it you can see the floats are intact because the width is 812.

289
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.130
Our, our breakpoint is 768.

290
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.640
So these are still going to be floated along with the menu.

291
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:24.440
If we go to the about you can see we have our floats, everything looks good.

292
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.740
Contact boxes are floated good.

293
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.650
So I think that we're we're in good shape here.

294
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:36.320
And as I mentioned, it's it's more difficult to make your site responsive when you're using floats.

295
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.820
Floats are almost like a hack.

296
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.540
They're almost like a CSS hack to to align your elements.

297
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:47.240
But in the next section, we're going to start to look at Flexbox, which is a much, much better way

298
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.470
to align things.

299
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.300
You also have CSS grid.

300
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.940
Some people choose like to choose one or the other.

301
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.930
I think that's silly.

302
00:18:53.930 --> 00:19:00.080
I think that there's certain situations for flex in this, certain situations for the grid system.

303
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.850
And I'll kind of go over those differences as we move along.

304
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.270
All right.

305
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.810
So that's it.

306
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.720
I hope you're enjoying the course and I'll see you in the next video.
