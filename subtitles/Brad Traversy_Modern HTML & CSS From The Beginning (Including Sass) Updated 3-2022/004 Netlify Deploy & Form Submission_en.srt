1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,210
So we have the news grid files.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,460
We have them in a repository on GitHub.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,690
So now we can deploy the net lo fi in literally seconds or minutes in in our case, because I'm going

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,990
to be explaining some things, but you'll see how simple it is if we go to our panel here and the FI

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,170
panel, which is very simple, we could just say new site from Git and we have different providers here.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,260
We used GitHub, so we're going to click on GitHub and you might get a little box set that asks you

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,040
to to authorize your GitHub account so that I can access your repositories.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,500
And then you're going to see all your repositories down here.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,060
And you can see I have quite a few, so I'm going to search for News Grid.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,140
And if if you just created a GitHub account and did and follow the instructions, you'll just have this

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,220
one repository.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,050
So we're going to choose that.

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,640
We're going to choose the master branch.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,170
It's the only branch we have.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,760
And then we don't need a build command or publish directory because everything is in the root.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,190
So we're going to just say deploy site and you can see this little gear spinning should only take a

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,710
couple of seconds and now our site is deployed.

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,060
So it's as easy as that to actually get your website live on the Internet.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,350
Now, the domain, as you can see right here, is something it's going to be different than this, but

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,850
it's going to be something crazy.

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,280
Mine is optimistic.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,110
FEYNMAN And then some numbers dot net ft.com.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,250
So let's go ahead and open this up in a new tab and there's our website.

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,360
So deployment is that easy with notify now the domain.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,440
We're going to take care of that.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,430
Don't worry about it.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,540
But what I want to do is I want to make this form work.

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:54,120
So I'm going to search for net phi forms and this is documentation page here will show us what we have

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,390
to do.

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,630
We have to add method post to our form tag and data net equals true and then just make sure we have

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,770
a name attribute on on each field which we only have an email field.

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:12,210
Now we've already deployed our, our pushed our repository to GitHub and deployed our website, but

34
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,560
we need to make a change.

35
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,160
So whenever you need to make a change, you need to push your need to update your repository and push

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,750
to GitHub and then it should automatically update on the site.

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,650
So let's do that.

38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:33,900
Let's go to let's see, I'm just going to minimize this and I'm going to open up our news grid website

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,190
in vs code.

40
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,450
And just make that bigger.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,630
And let me just close this stuff up.

42
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,130
So let's see, we have our news grid website open and the form is on every page.

43
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,730
So we're just going to have to go to each of the three HTML pages.

44
00:02:51,730 --> 00:03:06,400
Let's go down to our form and let's add a method of post and we need to say data dash net fi equals

45
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,080
true.

46
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,840
And then the input of this email input, we want to give a name of email.

47
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,310
All right.

48
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,660
Let me just make sure that.

49
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,620
That's correct.

50
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,790
So we did data.

51
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,970
Net net fee equals true method post.

52
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,610
Let's give it a name as well.

53
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,880
So we'll say, where is it?

54
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,630
Form name equals.

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,450
Call it contact.

56
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,010
All right, so that should do it.

57
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:45,010
Let's save and then let's take this whole form and go to about HTML, because obviously we want it to

58
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,360
work on all pages.

59
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:54,880
So we'll paste that in here and then let's go to article HTML to the footer and do the same thing.

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,940
So now that we've updated that, we're going to go back into our terminal, make sure you're in the

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,650
news grid folder.

62
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,120
As you can see, I am and we need to go get add all.

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,650
So it's going to add anything that has been changed is now in the staging area.

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:20,079
So now we need to commit once again I'm going to say get commit dash and then I'm going to say updated

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,279
form.

66
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,200
So we're going to commit that.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,860
You can see three files changed and now we need to push to GitHub.

68
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,090
Now we've already added it as a remote repository and all we have to do now to push our changes is simply

69
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,140
get push.

70
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,410
All right.

71
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,820
So just doing that.

72
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,210
Should go ahead and update our repository, see how it says one commit if I reload.

73
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,190
Now we have two commits and if we look at one of these HTML files, we should see the changes.

74
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,840
So let's go down to the form and there it is.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,340
So there's what we added.

76
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:04,110
Let's go to our website, notify site and reload, and let's take a look at the source code.

77
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,830
So I did I'm on a mac, so I did command option U and if we go down.

78
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,030
You can see that the form.

79
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,370
Now this.

80
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,420
It's going to look different than what we actually uploaded.

81
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,040
So it has a method of post.

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,690
You can see the name is contact.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,510
What it does though is it puts a hidden value in here.

84
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,520
So basically net ify needs this to to process the form.

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,350
But it has changed.

86
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,140
Maybe we should have changed something else just so I could prove it to you.

87
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,910
But it is there.

88
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,750
It should work.

89
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,520
So let's try it out.

90
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,430
Let's go down to the email and let's say test.

91
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:54,190
We'll just do test at test dot com and subscribe and look at that.

92
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,140
Now if I actually gives us a success page, we don't even have to deal with that.

93
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,300
And then we can just go back to our site.

94
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,330
Now, if we go back to nullify and we go down, we go to overview right here.

95
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,790
You can see recent form submissions and we have test at Test Dotcom.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,360
If I click on that, it's going to show us the email field and any other fields we have.

97
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,320
If we had name and address and all that stuff that would also show here, we can delete these so we

98
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,740
can manage all of our submissions from here.

99
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,040
We can also download them as CSV file.

100
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,190
All right, so really, really cool service.

101
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,690
Definitely recommend it.

102
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,090
Now the next thing I want to do is I want to set up a custom domain.

103
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,450
So in the next video, I'm going to show you how we can register a domain name from name cheap and we

104
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,720
can basically link it to our net website.
