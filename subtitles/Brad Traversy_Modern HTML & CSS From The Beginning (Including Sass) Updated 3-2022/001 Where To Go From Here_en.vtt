00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.840
So you've completed the modern HTML and CSS from the beginning course.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.170
First off, I just want to say congratulations.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.430
This wasn't a short course, and making it all the way through is a real accomplishment.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.020
So I really hope you enjoyed it.

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.370
I hope you learned a lot from it.

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
And I just want to thank you for taking it and taking any other courses or tutorials that you've watched

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.130
of mine.

9
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.030
So the question is, what now?

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.380
What do you do next now?

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.140
You have a decent understanding of HTML, CSS, SAS, along with some of the basic principles of how

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.780
websites work, deployment and so on.

13
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.950
So my advice would be to build a few projects based on what you've learned.

14
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.430
Look at some examples of other websites or other website themes and try to rebuild them without looking

15
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.900
at any of the source code.

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.340
You want to use stuff that you've learned in this course.

17
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.140
Go, go look at documentation, look at other tutorials, maybe some other courses.

18
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.990
If you want to do something completely custom and create a mockup in Photoshop or some other program

19
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.200
and then write out the HTML and CSS, that's even better.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.960
I would also suggest learning JavaScript.

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.510
That's probably the most logical next step.

22
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.220
You want to get some programming under your belt and JavaScript is great because it's just everywhere

23
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.740
it runs in the browser, it runs on the server.

24
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.870
There's mobile apps built with JavaScript.

25
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.790
It's just a great language to learn.

26
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.920
And I think that every web developer needs to know at least the basics of JavaScript.

27
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.540
I do have a 21 hour course on Udemy called Modern JavaScript from the beginning.

28
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.460
Now you might want to learn something like Bootstrap, which is a CSS framework.

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.940
It makes creating websites and user interfaces much easier because there's predefined styles, pre-defined

30
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.750
classes, however you want to make sure you customize your your projects if you do use a framework because

31
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.150
a lot of them can start to look the same.

32
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.530
So just keep that in mind.

33
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.000
But you may find it useful.

34
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.770
It can speed things up.

35
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.950
And it's great for prototyping if you're going to learn, you know, web application development.

36
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.479
So other than that, I would say code every day, try to stay driven and passionate, try new things.

37
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.320
And if this is what you really want to do, as long as you put your all into it, you're going to get

38
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.640
to where you want to be.

39
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.930
So that's it.

40
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.680
Again, thank you for taking the course and hopefully I'll see you in the next one.
