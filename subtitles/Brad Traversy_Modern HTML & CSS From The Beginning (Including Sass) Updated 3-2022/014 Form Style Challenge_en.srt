1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,930
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,360
So now I'm going to give you a challenge.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,910
I want you to style a form that looks like this.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,430
It doesn't have to be exact, but something similar that looks pretty decent and clean.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,650
So I'm going to give you all the HTML.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm going to give you even the the classes and all the elements we're styling along with some hints.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:27,630
So in the in this lecture, you should find a file called form styling, underscore stata HTML.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:36,480
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a file called 12 underscore form, underscore styling

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,510
dot HTML and I'm going to grab everything that's in that start file and paste it in and just go over

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,410
it real quick.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,560
So let me just close this up and let's take a look at the HTML first.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:57,210
So we have an idea of container that wraps around everything and then we have an class of form wrap

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,910
that wraps around the form.

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,330
So this part right here, we have an H one, a paragraph, and then in our form we have some fields.

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,480
Each one is wrapped in a div with the class of form group.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,980
And inside the form group we have the label, we also have the input.

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,500
So we have first name, last name, email password, confirm password.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,150
Then we have a button which which has a class of BTN.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,140
Then we have a paragraph which is this part right here.

20
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,250
And underneath the form wrap we just have a footer that says, I already have an account log in here.

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,200
So that's the markup for this.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,450
Now up here, you have everything that's going to be styled, all the styles that I'm going to add along

23
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,560
with some hints.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
So I'm going to go along and just give you some hints here.

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,680
So as you can see, I actually brought in a font from Google Fonts called Railway.

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,940
So you want to you want to use that as your font family.

27
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,400
I have an asterisk here.

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,920
It says may want to add border box for box sizing so padding does not affect the width.

29
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,050
We've talked about that quite a bit.

30
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,870
We should also reset the margin and padding.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,790
In the body.

32
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm just saying the background color is going to be this right here.

33
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,150
Now, I'm not saying that that's all you need to put in the body or that's all you should put.

34
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:29,190
It's just a hint in the A tags underlines they're ugly, so you probably want to remove those container.

35
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,800
So remember margin auto on the left and right will center a block element.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,910
So you want to center the container and remember margin auto.

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,990
All right.

38
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,250
And I'd also suggest using a max width for responsiveness.

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,500
You also may want to add some padding.

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,120
Now, the form wrap is the white area around the form.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,350
So this whole box right here around the form and the heading and all that.

42
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:01,860
So figure out how to style that the h one and the paragraph you want to center these remember the text

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:11,070
line property, the form wrap or the form group, I should say each label and input is wrapped in the

44
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,760
form group.

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
So this is a form group.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,680
Right.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,860
So you may want to add some margins separating these.

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,650
Label should be turned into a block element because we want the label to be on its own line and we don't

49
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,160
want to use line breaks.

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,670
I only use line breaks to give you guys examples.

51
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:33,670
You don't want to use those in your actual layout, so turn that into a block element so that the next

52
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,980
element pushes on to the next line.

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,650
Inputs should reach across the form, wrap 100% and have some padding by default.

54
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,730
Inputs of very ugly.

55
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,200
They're very thin and it'll only it won't go across the whole thing.

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,190
So you might want to set the width to 100% and add some padding.

57
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,310
So the form wrap button, which is this right here, should wrap across 100%.

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,090
It should also be displayed as a block background color.

59
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,470
Is this hex right here?

60
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,400
The hover is this color for the button.

61
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,730
Let's see, the bottom text is smaller, so you might want to set the font size smaller for the bottom

62
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,720
text footer, which is this right here should be centered.

63
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,600
So remember text align line and the footer color I'm sorry the footer link color is this right here?

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,370
So that's a lot of hints.

65
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,850
So I'm going to give you guys this as a challenge to try and recreate this and don't just skip it,

66
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,660
really try it.

67
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,430
If it looks absolutely insane and nothing like this, don't worry about it.

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,660
Don't get discouraged.

69
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,490
It's kind of a tough challenge if you're just learning CSS, but just give it a shot.

70
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,560
And then in the next video I'll go over it and I'll give you all my styling and it doesn't even have

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,590
to match mine as long as it looks decent.

72
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,040
So I'll see you in the next video, which will be the conclusion.
