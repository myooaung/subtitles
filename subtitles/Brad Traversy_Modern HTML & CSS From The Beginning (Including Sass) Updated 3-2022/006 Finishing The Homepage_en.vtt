1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.660
Okay.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.700
So now we're going to do the team section.

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.470
So I'm going to go under the blog and we can actually copy since we're using the header and all that,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.120
we can copy the cases.

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.600
And paste that in here.

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.870
So say team.

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.990
So we're going to give this we actually yeah we'll give this an idea of team even though I don't think

8
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.370
we have it in the menu.

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.220
But let's go ahead and add a class of team and let's see, we're not using flex grid, but we are going

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.410
to use section padding and section header and we'll just change the content up.

11
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.810
So H for will say who we are and let's change this.

12
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:56.650
We'll say our professional team and we'll keep that text now for the the images we're actually going

13
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.100
to use.

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.800
We can get rid of this row because we're not using flex grid.

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.570
We're using flex items.

16
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.990
So same thing we did with the icons.

17
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:17.390
So we'll have a div with an image and it's going to be images slash team person one underneath the image.

18
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.670
Let's do H for and John Doe and then paragraph.

19
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.370
This will be the the person's position.

20
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.420
So President and we're going to have three of these.

21
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.700
So this will be person two.

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:42.110
We'll say let's say Jane Doe and we'll say vice president.

23
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.070
Person three Let's say Steve Smith.

24
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.300
I know male creative what my names and let's see say marketing head.

25
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.040
All right.

26
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.030
So just doing that, if we take a look excuse me, it looks pretty good because we already have those

27
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.320
classes in place.

28
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.480
Now, I do want to round the corners of these images, make these kind of circular.

29
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:21.770
So in our style sheet, I'm just going to say class of team image, set the border radius, let's do

30
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.180
50%.

31
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.180
And there we go.

32
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.830
So that's it for the team.

33
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.020
So for the what's next?

34
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:40.650
The contact section here, we're going to use the same layout as this and this.

35
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.030
Actually, we'll probably copy this because we're going to have the image on the left.

36
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.950
So it's left, right, left.

37
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.890
So let's let's just copy the oops.

38
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.510
Copy the solutions.

39
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.670
So grab this.

40
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.500
And put that right here.

41
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.050
So this is the contact section.

42
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.520
So we'll say contact and let's give it an ID of contact and a class.

43
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.300
And we're going to be using this flex columns here as well.

44
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.840
So we want the row, the column, column one.

45
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.990
The image, however, is going to be contact.

46
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.880
And then this content, I mean, we're going to keep the column, too.

47
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.380
I'm actually going to use BG Light and we want to turn this into a form so we can get rid of the headings

48
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.870
and stuff like that.

49
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.380
So everything within column two and then let's create a form, give it a class of callback form.

50
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.650
And action.

51
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.570
We'll just keep that empty for now and then in the form.

52
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.870
Let's go ahead and add a form.

53
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.110
It's a form control class, so every label and input will be wrapped in a form control class, let's

54
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.600
say label for name.

55
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.590
And the input, let's say input.

56
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.480
We'll give it an ID of name and we'll give it a name of name.

57
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.970
And then the placeholder.

58
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.870
Set that to name.

59
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.690
Now, this isn't going to actually submit anywhere by default.

60
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.360
I might do something later on.

61
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.700
I believe in the next section.

62
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.580
We did do a PHP script.

63
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.930
I might change that up because like I said, I'm redoing this this project.

64
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:57.240
But I do have a way where we we put this to a shared host and then we add a simple PHP script to submit

65
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.010
the form.

66
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.780
But I might change that up.

67
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.410
I don't know.

68
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.590
So let's copy this down.

69
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.620
Three times because we're going to have name, email, we'll change the type of this to email as well

70
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.120
and then change that to email the ID.

71
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:27.120
And then the placeholder actually placeholder should say like enter email and this should say enter

72
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.830
name.

73
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.730
And then this one is going to be phone.

74
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.980
Text.

75
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:47.060
Phone ID is phone and then placeholder will say enter phone and then we just need a submit button.

76
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.710
So under this div here, let's say input and we can say colon, submit, give us type, submit, we'll

77
00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:04.520
say send, we'll give it an ID of submit and let's give it a, let's give it a class of BTN.

78
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.070
Oops.

79
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.610
All right.

80
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.000
So if we take a look at this, the image is not showing up for some reason.

81
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.320
Images.

82
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.060
Oh, I have two JPEGs.

83
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.060
All right, so we have the image.

84
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.910
So the layout is good, but the form looks horrible.

85
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.540
So we obviously want to change that, so we're going to style it.

86
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.980
I also want a header right above the form or heading I should say.

87
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:41.020
So let's do an H two and we'll say request callback.

88
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.170
So as far as as far as the form goes, let's go ahead and style that.

89
00:06:47.170 --> 00:07:00.790
So in style CSS say callback form and it has a class of callback form and we're going to set the width

90
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.820
to 100% of its container, some padding on the top and bottom.

91
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.900
And then let's go ahead and style the label.

92
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:19.630
So callback form label by default labels are inline, but we want the label to be block so that it's

93
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.470
on a new line.

94
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:28.000
So let's say display block and then just give it some margin on the bottom to push the input down.

95
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.130
So say margin bottom five pixels and then each form control.

96
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.430
So callback form form control.

97
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.340
So that wraps the label in the input.

98
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:47.290
I just want to add a margin bottom of 15 pixels to push, push everything down and then the input themselves.

99
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.700
So those are really important to style because they're very ugly by default.

100
00:07:51.850 --> 00:08:03.460
So let's say input, callback, form, input, set the width to 100%, we'll set the padding to four

101
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:17.620
pixels and let's give a height of 40 pixels and the border will do like gray one pixel solid and the

102
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.130
button.

103
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:27.460
So we'll say callback form BTN, I just want to, I want to add some extra padding to that.

104
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.380
So we'll say 12 pixels top and bottom and then push down.

105
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.240
I want to push the button down.

106
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.780
So let's say margin top 20 pixels.

107
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.900
So that looks pretty good.

108
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.460
Now when I click inside of it, we get this blue outline.

109
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.170
If you want that, that's fine.

110
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:54.010
But I can show you how we can change that color so we can actually do that by let's go right here and

111
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.290
say callback form inputs, input.

112
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:08.050
We want the focus state and then we can set the outline color and we'll set that.

113
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.880
Let's set it to the green.

114
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.670
So this right here.

115
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.930
So now if we go and we click, now we get that green outline and you can set it to outline zero if you

116
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.160
don't want it at all.

117
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.140
So the last thing is the footer.

118
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.480
So we might as well do that because it's pretty simple.

119
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.080
So we'll go ahead and add the HTML.

120
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.890
So we actually want to go under the main because the footer isn't part of the main.

121
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:45.780
So let's say footer and let's give footer a class of footer and also BG Doc because I want to give it

122
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:51.660
the dark background and then we're going to have a div called social.

123
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.000
So this is where our social icons will go.

124
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:02.010
They'll have a link around them which would go to your like your profile and let's put an icon here.

125
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:11.430
So F a B you need to use a class of fab for social icons and then let's do a Facebook and then we'll

126
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.110
copy this down a few times.

127
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:22.140
So we'll do Facebook, we'll do Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn.

128
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.810
And then under that div we're going to have a paragraph with copyright.

129
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.520
We'll use an HTML entity.

130
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.780
So ampersand, copy, semicolon, 2020 and we'll say edge ledger.

131
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.020
So that's what it's going to look like.

132
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.810
So obviously we have a little bit of styling to do here.

133
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.740
So let's go to style CSS.

134
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.970
And let's add a class of footer.

135
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.910
We want to display this as a flex box, and I actually want it to be a column.

136
00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:04.170
So Flex Direction column, because all we're doing, if we look at the final version here we have,

137
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.590
we're going to have it in a column, but center it in the footer.

138
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.370
If you wanted to, you could have a row and you could have the icons over here and the text over here.

139
00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.820
But I think that this looks fine if we do it this way.

140
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.340
We can't even see the icons right now because we need to change the color.

141
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.970
So let's go back here and let's say footer.

142
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.830
So any links?

143
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.710
Obviously, we want to be able to see those.

144
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.120
And then back up here, let's center everything.

145
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:47.650
So a items center justify content center, text a line center and let's set the height of the footer

146
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.550
to 200.

147
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.330
And regardless of the height, it should be centered vertically and horizontal.

148
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.460
All right, let's see.

149
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.750
So the icons are really small.

150
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.330
So I'm actually going to add to those the class of F A to X.

151
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.540
So we'll just grab that.

152
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.620
Okay.

153
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:17.840
And then I also want to add some margin between them because they are very close together.

154
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:28.640
So what I'll do is I'll say let's say footer and then inside the social div just in case they're not

155
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.260
links and you put divs or something else, let's just say anything within there.

156
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:43.820
We want to set margin right to 30 pixels and then on the hover, let's say footer.

157
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.870
So footer on the link covers.

158
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.370
I want to change the color.

159
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.750
To that green color.

160
00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.370
Okay.

161
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.440
So if we put that in here and let's take a look good.

162
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.110
And if we hover over these, we get that green color.

163
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.690
So that's the the base styling of our landing page.

164
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:18.630
So I think what I want to do in the next video before we do the other two simple pages is make this

165
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.500
responsive, because if I make this smaller, it's not too bad.

166
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.880
I mean, this looks fine.

167
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.370
The nav bar obviously does not.

168
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.350
This is too squished together.

169
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.180
This is too squishy.

170
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.720
We just want to stack all this stuff so it's not going to be too difficult.

171
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.050
So in the next video, we'll go ahead and get to the media queries.
