00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.680
All right, guys, we're going to get started.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.730
So you should have in your section files, you should have this project resources folder, which has

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.550
all the images that we need for the project, as well as the typewriter script that we're going to include

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.290
for the effect on the home page.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.220
So what we're going to do is create a new folder for our website.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.490
I'm just going to call this portfolio website and inside here we're going to have a dist folder.

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.650
So I'm going to create a folder called Dist, which is going to be all the files that we would deploy,

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.380
the standard CSS files and so on outside of this will have our SAS files and everything.

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.170
So in this DIST folder we want to take the image and the JavaScript folder and just bring that in.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.880
So now what I'm going to do is open up our portfolio website folder with V's code and we should have

11
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.670
a DIST folder with the image and the JavaScript.

12
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.390
All right.

13
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.390
So in addition to image and JavaScript in our DIST folder, I'm going to create for now just our index

14
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.349
HTML.

15
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.470
We'll create the rest of the HTML files later.

16
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.170
Now we need to get SAS set up.

17
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.600
So I'm going to be using Node SAS.

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.080
So I'm going to open up my integrated terminal here and to install Node SAS, we need NPM installed,

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.580
which comes with Node.js.

20
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.760
So if you don't have that on your system, just go to Node.js dot org and download and install it and

21
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.730
then just do an NPM dash dash version just to verify that you actually have NPM installed.

22
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.690
So first thing we want to do here is do NPM init, which will initialize a packaged JSON file, which

23
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.390
is basically like a manifest file that has some info about the app as well as the any packages we install

24
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.770
such as Node SAS.

25
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.680
So let's just hit enter here description.

26
00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:02.100
I'm going to say portfolio website and we'll just go through all the rest of this.

27
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.800
So that will create a package JSON outside of your DIST folder.

28
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
And what we want to do now is install node SAS.

29
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.110
So we're going to say NPM, install node dash SAS and we can install this as a dev dependency.

30
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.520
So we're just going to do Dash DD because it's only used in development.

31
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.310
And that should get.

32
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.810
That should show up right here.

33
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.410
Good.

34
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.580
And so in order to, you know, use Node SAS, we need to create a script.

35
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.420
So I'm going to replace this test with SAS so that we can just do NPM, run SAS, and we want it to

36
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.410
run Node SAS, we want it to watch.

37
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.690
So we're going to do w a folder called SAS Slash.

38
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.570
So it's going to watch that folder for any SAS files.

39
00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:00.250
And then the output of the regular CSIS is going to go to DIST slash CSIS like that.

40
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.600
And then we're just going to add dash dash recursive on the end.

41
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.990
So that's the command that we want to run when we run Node SAS or I'm sorry, end PM run SAS.

42
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.000
So let's save that.

43
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.960
And now what we'll do is create our success folder, make sure this is outside of your dist folder.

44
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.650
You want it outside because this isn't something that you're going to deploy when you put this on a

45
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.130
server.

46
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.630
This is just for development.

47
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.490
This stuff gets compiled down to regular CSS inside of our DIST folder.

48
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.070
All right, so let's create our main SAS file.

49
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.040
We're going to have a couple of them, but we're going to create our main one.

50
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.310
So I'm just going to call it main CSS.

51
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:51.370
And let's just do for now just to make sure everything works, we'll create a variable called color

52
00:03:51.550 --> 00:04:01.210
and let's set that to red and then let's just put in our body and let's do background and set that to

53
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.890
the variable color.

54
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.530
So I'm going to save this and nothing's going to happen because we didn't run PM Run.

55
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.839
SAS So I'm going to clear this up down here and just do NPM, run SAS.

56
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.850
And now what it's doing is watching the SAS folder and in any time we save it's going to then compile

57
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.100
it into dist CSS.

58
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.910
Now we didn't create CSS in DIST, it'll actually create it for us.

59
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.190
So if I just do anything, just put a character in and delete it and save, you'll see.

60
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.680
Now it created a CSS folder with a main CSS file and it's just standard CSS and that's what we would

61
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.280
deploy.

62
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.980
So from here on out, you don't want to touch this CSS file, you want to strictly deal with SAS.

63
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.240
All right.

64
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.420
Now, the next thing I want to do is go to our index HTML.

65
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.180
Let's put some boilerplate in here and let's say we'll just do for the title.

66
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.940
Let's say I'm going to put John Doe, but you can put your own name and let's just say UI, UX designer

67
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.120
and photographer.

68
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.400
So that's that's basically what this fictional character specializes in, if you're going to use this.

69
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.010
I mean, I give you guys permission to use this as your portfolio if you want, you'll just have to

70
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.880
change things around to whatever it is you specialize in.

71
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.260
So let's see, we want to include our main CSS files.

72
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.400
So let's do that.

73
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:43.060
We'll put in a link to CSS slash main CSS and we also want font.

74
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.540
Awesome.

75
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.560
So I'm just going to jump into Chrome real quick.

76
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.070
And let's go to font.

77
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.510
Awesome.

78
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.530
Dot com.

79
00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:02.500
Start using free and then we'll grab this link right here and let's put that right above the main CSS

80
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.220
like that.

81
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.390
All right.

82
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.190
And then in the body for now, let's just put an H one and we'll just just say hello, just to make

83
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.260
sure that we can that this works.

84
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.650
All right, so if I go ahead and run this with live server, I'm going to right click and say Open with

85
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.730
live server.

86
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.740
We should get a red background.

87
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.030
And the reason for that is because in our SAS file we set the variable to red, we set the body background

88
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:37.430
to that variable node, SAS compiled it when we saved it into CSIS, main CSIS, and then that's being

89
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.490
included in our index HTML.

90
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.400
So that's going to be our workflow from now on.

91
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:51.020
Now what I'd like to do before we start with the markup with the HTML is import our font.

92
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.980
We're going to be using a font called Dosis or dosis.

93
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.510
I'm not exactly sure out of how you probably pronounce it and then set up some variables and also just

94
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.670
set some of our core styles like the Reset, some of the body styles and so on.

95
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.180
All right.

96
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.230
Now I'm going to close this main course because I want to be careful not to touch that.

97
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.370
We only want to be dealing with our SAS files, so let's first grab the font.

98
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:23.630
So I'm going to go to Google Fonts or what is it fonts dot Google and we're going to go ahead and do

99
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.640
a search for Dos.

100
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:38.240
Dos is hit this plus sign and go down here and let's grab the link right here and paste that in.

101
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:46.040
Let's go right above our CSS main CSS file and now we should be able to use this font family.

102
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.700
So I'm going to grab that.

103
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.940
And then we'll go into our main dot Cece file.

104
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.750
Let's get rid of this.

105
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.280
We're not going to be using that.

106
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.130
And in our body, let's say font actually we just paste that in.

107
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.930
So font family dosis sans serif.

108
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.190
And if I save that, it should show up.

109
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.640
If we go back and you can see now the fonts changed.

110
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:22.780
So let's add just some, some core styling here as far as the reset goes, the body, stuff like that.

111
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.250
So I'm just going to put a comment here and just say General Styles.

112
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.470
So our reset, I just want to clear the margin and padding for everything.

113
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.909
So margin zero, padding zero.

114
00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.289
And let's take for the body we're going to set.

115
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.640
Whoops, we already did the body.

116
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.330
What am I thinking?

117
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.590
We get to move this.

118
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.770
Let's actually just move this down here.

119
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.080
That.

120
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.440
And aside from the font family.

121
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.910
Oops.

122
00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.770
Let's add a line height.

123
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.060
And let's make that 1.6, and then the background is just going to be white.

124
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.230
Now for links, I want all links to I want to remove the underline.

125
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.500
So I'm going to do text decoration none.

126
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.470
And for the color, we're going to use the dark color variable.

127
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.040
So before we move on, I'm going to go into my sex folder.

128
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.330
I'm going to create a new file.

129
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.770
I'm going to call this underscore config dot success.

130
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.050
So this is going to be a partial that we include.

131
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.780
And this is where I want to put all of our variables.

132
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.500
All right.

133
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.260
So let's go ahead and say variables

134
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:51.910
and let's see, we'll do I want to have a website width so we can change that easily if we want.

135
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.470
So we're going to change that.

136
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.210
We're going to set that to 1280 pixels by default.

137
00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:59.080
All right.

138
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:07.300
And then let's do the main dash color and we'll set that to F, B, C, zero zero.

139
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.550
So it's kind of like a yellowish color.

140
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.670
And then I'm going to set a light and a dark color.

141
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:19.210
So the light color is going to be f four, three times, which is a light gray.

142
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.670
And then the dark color is going to be three, three, three.

143
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.820
Let's also do a medium color as well.

144
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.910
So we'll say medium color and that's going to be sexy.

145
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:35.320
All right.

146
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.670
And then the last thing I want to set is the background image so that we can easily change that.

147
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.660
So big image and set that to URL.

148
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:51.730
And in here we want to do a dot, dot, slash, IMG slash, and it's going to be the showcase image.

149
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.210
So showcase dot jpeg.

150
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.640
All right.

151
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:05.320
Now, you might notice that this location doesn't pertain to where we currently are in this in the SDSS

152
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.040
folder.

153
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.480
We're not going out and then into image because the image is actually in the disk folder.

154
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.730
However, when we compile our SAS, we're going to be in this CSS folder.

155
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:21.250
So we want to make sure that our location to any images pertain to being in this file.

156
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.140
So hopefully that makes sense.

157
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.880
We want to go out of this CSS into the I'm sorry, into the image folder.

158
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.580
So keep that in mind when you're dealing with SAS.

159
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:37.000
So let's save this and let's bring this in to our file here.

160
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:44.320
So remember to bring in a partial we just use at import and then we use just the name, not the underscore

161
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:50.440
or the dot CSS, just simply config and that should bring in our variables.

162
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:57.190
And then for the a tag, I'm going to set the color to the dark color.

163
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:04.150
The downside about putting the variables in a separate file when using vs code is they don't show up

164
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.050
automatically.

165
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:10.660
Like if you put a number sign, I'm sorry, a dollar sign and you had the variables in the same file,

166
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.890
you'd get a little drop down with the variable names, but we're not going to get that because they're

167
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.180
in a separate file and you don't have to put them in a separate file.

168
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.830
If you guys see something that you want to do differently, that's absolutely fine.

169
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.420
In fact, I encourage that.

170
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:31.330
I don't encourage just straight copying everything if you have your own ideas or your own your own ways

171
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.350
of doing things.

172
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:39.760
So let's for the ULS, let's do a list style none because I don't want any bullets anywhere on the site

173
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.890
and then I actually want all of the headings to be uppercase.

174
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.810
So I'm going to say h two.

175
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.020
H three, h four.

176
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.390
Um.

177
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.540
Wait a minute.

178
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:55.860
Yeah.

179
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.550
Do I want the H ones?

180
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.020
Yeah, it's just the H two, h three and H four that I want uppercase.

181
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:09.400
So let's do text transform and set that to uppercase.

182
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.790
And then all the images by default should have a width of 100%.

183
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.280
So we're just keeping them in their containers.

184
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.140
So I think that's pretty much it as far as just the core styles.

185
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.210
And obviously we haven't done any nesting or anything because we haven't had to.

186
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.210
These are just these are just core general styles.

187
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.540
So let's go ahead and save that and it should update.

188
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.580
So if we take a look, I mean, actually, there's nothing really to update because we don't have any

189
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.030
content, but those styles should be in effect.

190
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:49.960
In fact, if we look at the source code and we look at our main CSIS, you'll see we have those styles

191
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.870
and we have three, three, three for the color for the a tag, which is actually our SAS variable for

192
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.680
dark color.

193
00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.270
All right.

194
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:04.000
So I think that that's as far as I want to take it in this video and the next one, we're going to start

195
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.650
working on our markup.

196
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:12.340
So we'll start down here, start creating the header area with the nav bar, the logo and all that stuff.

197
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:12.730
All right.

198
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.260
So I'll see you in the next video.
