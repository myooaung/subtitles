00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.780
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.050
So now we're going to look at transitions which are similar to how keyframe animations work, except

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.900
transitions happen basically on an event.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.560
So if you hover over something that's a good example.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.810
You would have a transition with with a property that is animate able.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.030
So like the width, the color, basically anything that we can do with the keyframe animations.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:33.900
So let's create a new file here called zero nine, underscore transitions dot HTML and we'll put in

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.460
our boilerplate here.

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.560
I'll close that up.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.600
Let's put our style and for the body again.

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm just going to have a class of box.

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.300
We're going to use this element to display transitions.

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.730
Now I'm going to add some other styling as well.

14
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.880
So for the body, I'm going to do background, three, three, three, just like we did before.

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.680
I'm also going to display it as a flex because the item, I want to put it directly in the middle.

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:14.670
So I think this is one of the easiest ways to do that is just displaying is flex doing a line items

17
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.900
center, justify content center and then we need a height on it.

18
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.930
So we'll say 100 viewport heights.

19
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.920
All right, so let's open this with live server.

20
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.620
It actually opened in the wrong browser.

21
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.730
Let me bring it over.

22
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.390
Okay.

23
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.040
So we just have a dark background.

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.280
Now let's add the style for the box.

25
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.410
So I'm going to do background white.

26
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:52.530
We'll use color names and let's do a width of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels.

27
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.320
So this should give us a square right in the middle of the page.

28
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.460
All right.

29
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.090
Now we're going to take a look first at the different transition properties, and then we'll look at

30
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.080
compacting it into the single transition property.

31
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.480
Just like with with the animation, you have a bunch of different properties and you can combine them

32
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.300
just like background properties, all that stuff.

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.830
Borders There's a shorthand way for just about everything, margin padding.

34
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.490
So let's first look at the it's actually called transition property.

35
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.300
So we're going to say transition dash property and here's where we specify which properties we actually

36
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.050
want to have a transition on a hover or something like that.

37
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.780
So we could do all or we could specify a specific property.

38
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.620
So I'm going to start off with just a specific property of background.

39
00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:01.020
So that's the property that I want to add a transition to and then let's add a transition dash duration.

40
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.090
So this would be in seconds.

41
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.670
Let's say we'll say 2 seconds.

42
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.030
Now, if I save that, nothing happens because the way that this works is, like I said, it has to

43
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.410
be on some kind of event.

44
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.150
So we're going to add a hover.

45
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.610
So let's say box hover and I'm just going to set the background to red.

46
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.200
That's it.

47
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.240
Now, if I save this and I hover over it, let me just show you without the transition first.

48
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.450
If we get rid of that and I hover over it, it just just goes to red.

49
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.020
Right?

50
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.460
We've seen this before.

51
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.470
If I use a transition, it slowly transitions into red.

52
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.710
And then when I come off it, it transitions back to white.

53
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.040
Okay in the in the duration of 2 seconds.

54
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.940
So you can just use this on simple button hovers maybe put like 1/2 on the button hover and it just

55
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.080
gives it a smoother effect rather than just shifting right to red.

56
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.410
Now we can also add delays if we want.

57
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.860
So we could say transition delay, say 1/2.

58
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.030
And now if I if I hover over it, nothing's going to happen for 1/2.

59
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.860
Actually, that wasn't really noticeable.

60
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.529
Let's do 3 seconds and I'm hovering over it and after 3 seconds it starts.

61
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.320
So that's the transition delay.

62
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.090
We also have the timing function.

63
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.720
I'm going to put that right here, transition dash, timing function.

64
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.630
And this we're going to use ease in out.

65
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.480
So basically just like what the key frames and let's comment out the delay and just ease is in and out

66
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.960
so it starts off slow and ends slow.

67
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.850
Now, of course, you can take all of this and put this all together in just the transition property.

68
00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:03.870
We can say background, then we can do the duration, which we'll say 2 seconds and the timing function

69
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.340
is in, out.

70
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.760
And if we wanted to delay, we could add that on here as well.

71
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.140
But I don't want to delay.

72
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:17.580
So doing this, we should be able to comment all this stuff out because it does the same exact thing.

73
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.070
So we'll save and then we go.

74
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.680
Now there's other other things that we can add that we can transition.

75
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:34.860
So let's, let's go ahead and say border dash radius and we'll set that to 50%.

76
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.790
Now, if I hover over it, notice that the transition is only working on the the background color,

77
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.690
the border radius is just switching right away.

78
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.390
That's because we didn't specify that here.

79
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:55.020
Now, what I could do is I could add a comma and I could say we also want to transition border radius

80
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.450
like that.

81
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.190
And now you can see that it transitions.

82
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.590
But what I would probably do here is in all, unless there was something you didn't want to transition

83
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.320
for some reason, but I want everything here to transition so that works the same way.

84
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.910
We get a cool little effect.

85
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.880
Now we can also do like the height and the width.

86
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.470
So let's say we want to make it bigger.

87
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:30.480
We'll say 300 pixels and let's say width, 300 pixels and save.

88
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.320
And now.

89
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.500
It goes from a little white square to a big red circle on hover, and it does it very, very smoothly.

90
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.410
All right.

91
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.960
And again, just experiment with it.

92
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.000
You know, we use some other properties.

93
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.850
In fact, all the transitional properties.

94
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.100
I'm actually going to paste in this file for you guys.

95
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.850
So you have it.

96
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.030
So I'm going to go right here and paste this in.

97
00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:02.080
So transitional properties, they have to have an identifiable, identifiable and identifiable halfway

98
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.530
point.

99
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:09.550
So things like colors, positions, width, font weight, font size.

100
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:18.640
Max height max width opacity outline color visibility width word spacing z index.

101
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.240
All these things can be different values that can have a halfway point.

102
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.760
It's not just like it's not binary.

103
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.260
It's not one or the other.

104
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.950
All right.

105
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.150
So these are all the properties that you can experiment with.

106
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.390
So I'll save that.

107
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.810
And you guys will have that for for reference.

108
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.540
So in the next video, I want to look at the Transform property, which you can use in conjunction with

109
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:48.160
transitions to do some really cool stuff as far as rotating and moving things around the page, things

110
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.830
like that.

111
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.150
All right.

112
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.310
So we'll take a look at Transform next.
