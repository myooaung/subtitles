1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,960
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,020
So in this video, we're going to start to work on the articles down below, basically our grid of articles.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,770
And there's quite a bit of HTML here, quite a bit of markup.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,520
I'm actually going to just make this a little bigger so that you guys can read it better.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:23,460
So under the header, let's say home articles and we're going to give this is going to be a section,

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,390
so we're going to use the HTML five section tag and we're going to give it an idea of home dash articles.

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,600
And we're also going to create padding classes.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,240
So we're going to give a class of py dash two just to give it some padding on the top and bottom.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,560
And the way that these are going to be set up is they're going to be a little different.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,540
So for instance, this first one, we're actually going to make this a grid within a grid so that we

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,070
can align it this way.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,650
And then some of these will be adding a background color to some of them will have an image on the top,

13
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,700
some on the bottom.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,850
So they'll be formatted a little bit differently.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,360
So let's go let's create the first one, which is this one here, which, again, is is going to be

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,770
a grid within a grid.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,100
So I'll actually let's put our heading first.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,140
We're going to say editors picks or editor picks.

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,720
And then what I want to do is create a container for our grid.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,220
So we're going to call this one.

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,060
Let's call it articles or articles excuse me, articles container.

22
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,260
And then each one is going to be an article tag and I'm going to give it a class of card.

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:45,060
So card is something you see often in frameworks like Bootstrap, where you have maybe a background

24
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,520
like this and some padding, just something to put your content into rather than just having the text

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,140
and images just, you know, just just floating there with just the background.

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,760
Sometimes you'll have a like a colored heading, like maybe a background with a heading, something

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,510
like that.

28
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,430
But yeah, that's going to, those are going to be cards.

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,980
So each one of these articles will have a class of card and we're going to put our first image in,

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,500
which is going to be in IMG slash articles and it's going to be in t one.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:23,850
So this is an entertainment article and this, this right here, this is going to actually this is going

32
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,760
to be a grid container and then this will be a one grid item and then we'll have a div that will have

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
the rest of the stuff inside of it.

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:43,200
So for instance, the category which is going to be have a class of category dash in T, we'll say entertainment.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,120
And underneath that we're going to have our H three, our title, which is going to be a link and it's

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,580
going to go to article HTML.

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,520
We'll just say form five for the article or for the title rather.

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,560
And then under the H three, we're going to put a paragraph and we'll say Lorem 20 I think is it 20?

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,120
Yeah, it looks like 20.

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
So that's going to be our first one.

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,080
And if I save it and we take a look, it's the image is going to be giant because the images have have

42
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,060
width of 100%.

43
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,760
Now one thing I forgot is the main container.

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,320
You see how this is up against the edge like this because we didn't add the container class.

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,110
So right under the section I'm going to have a class of container that's going to wrap around everything.

46
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:42,000
So we just want to take all this and cut that out and put that inside the container and save.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,980
And now you can see that there's some padding on the edge here and it'll also align it to the middle.

48
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,160
So let's add our next article.

49
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm just going to copy this.

50
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,160
Now, this one is not going to be its own grid.

51
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,520
So we're talking about this right here.

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,000
So we don't need to have this extra div.

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,400
So we're going to take that out and we're not even going to have an image.

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,690
We can take that out.

55
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,350
And that should be good.

56
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,810
Let's move this back a little bit.

57
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,550
And the category is sports.

58
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:24,420
So we're going to change this to sports and change this to sports and we'll leave the title and the

59
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,470
paragraph.

60
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:27,750
All right.

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,690
So if we take a look, we should have something like this.

62
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,740
The next one is going to be similar to what we just did, only it's going to have an image up top.

63
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,260
So let's copy the one we just did and paste that in.

64
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,600
And let me just fix this.

65
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,670
So this one is going to have an image right above the category.

66
00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:02,030
So let's say image and it's going to be IMG slash, articles slash and it's what is it, technology.

67
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:12,020
So we want to check one JPEG and we'll change this to tech and this to technology.

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
We'll save that.

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,330
Let's make sure the image shows up and then we have the content under it.

70
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,960
So the next one is similar, except the images at the bottom.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:31,190
So I'll just copy what we just did and let's paste that in and we're just going to take all the image

72
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,250
is actually going to be, let's see what is this is sports.

73
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:42,560
So this is going to be sports one jpeg, but we're going to move this to the bottom of the article.

74
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,480
So right under the paragraph and we'll change the category.

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,710
Change this right here.

76
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,960
Good.

77
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:00,620
And then the next one is this one here, which is basically the same thing as this, just a different

78
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,190
image.

79
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,080
So we'll go ahead and copy that one with a tech one image and paste that in.

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,300
And we'll change this to tech to.

81
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,840
Okay.

82
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,220
Next one is going to be this, which doesn't have an image or anything like that.

83
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,080
So I'll copy the one that we did with no image, which is the second one.

84
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,910
So this is the first one.

85
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,320
This is the second one.

86
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,770
And we'll put that right here.

87
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,960
But this is going to be it is sports, so we can actually leave that.

88
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,410
And then this last one is similar to the first one in that it's going to be a grid within a grid.

89
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,260
So let's let's copy the first one.

90
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,550
And I know this is a lot of markup and hopefully it's not too confusing.

91
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,630
If you want, you can just get the finished files from the first lecture of this section and you can

92
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,890
just copy this whole thing.

93
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:10,040
I probably should have said that before, but yeah, this is going to be in t to only I want to take

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,800
the image and put it after the div.

95
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,950
So put the image right here.

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,910
All right.

97
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,930
So we'll save that.

98
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,090
And if we take a look, it's going to look pretty bad.

99
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,800
It's just all all in one line because we haven't added the grid yet.

100
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:31,730
So let's jump into style CSS and let's start to add our grid.

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,090
Actually, first thing I'm going to do is add the the utility classes like the card class.

102
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:48,650
So let's see, we'll go right below the buttons and say, card, I'm going to give this a background

103
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:55,280
of white and let's do a padding of one ram.

104
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,580
So if we save that now you can see that each one of these articles, they're all wrapped in the in the

105
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,770
white container or white card.

106
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,000
So I think yeah, we'll just we'll do, we'll leave that for now and then we'll go back down and let's

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,280
style our home articles.

108
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:24,440
So we have an ID of home dash articles and remember we have a class in there called articles dash container

109
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,650
and that's what we want to set the grid on.

110
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,400
That's going to be the grid parent.

111
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,390
And then as far as the the template columns, we're going to say grid template columns and we're going

112
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,659
to set repeat and we want three one FR.

113
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,350
So if I save that automatically, they're going to set to three in a row.

114
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,510
Now I want some spacing in between.

115
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,090
So let's add a grid gap of one REM and whoops.

116
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,080
Yeah, there we go.

117
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,350
So now we have some spacing and I mean, that's that's not too bad itself.

118
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:08,150
But what I do want to do is, like I said, turn this one into its own grid and then span it over one

119
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:18,500
just to just to give it a little a little bit of style so we can grab on to this without giving it a

120
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,230
special class by using first child.

121
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,430
Same with the last.

122
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,230
We want this to do the same thing.

123
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:31,130
So what I'll do is I'll go down, I'll say home dash articles.

124
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,720
Articles.

125
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,720
Dash container.

126
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,390
Now I want the first article.

127
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:40,690
Right.

128
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:46,990
So I could say article first dash child.

129
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,920
I could do that.

130
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,610
But what if I.

131
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,920
What if I wanted to change it to a div or something?

132
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,730
I think I want to.

133
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm going to make this a little more flexible and I'm going to use an asterisk here, meaning any any

134
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,000
element.

135
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,270
It doesn't have to be an article, but I only want the the direct child.

136
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,000
So I'm going to use the the greater than.

137
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,470
So we're just saying any anything, whatever this is.

138
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,810
Even if even if this was changed to a div, we're still going to target this first element here and

139
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,280
only this first one.

140
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:28,750
So let's add display grid to this and we're going to add grid dash template columns.

141
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:36,370
And we just want to repeat oops, we want to repeat to one FR.

142
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,580
So we want basically the image is going to be in one FR and then the text, the div with the text will

143
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,750
be in one FR.

144
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:54,640
And let's just add a grid dash gap and let's say one ram and save that.

145
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,020
All right.

146
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,920
So.

147
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,190
What we've done here is we've turned this item, the first child, into a grid, and we've set it to

148
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,770
repeat to one FR with some grid gap.

149
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,240
Now, obviously, this doesn't look very good.

150
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,170
What we need to do is span this across.

151
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,050
We want it to take up two columns.

152
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,610
So what I can do is let's see.

153
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,530
Yeah, we'll just put it right in here.

154
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:27,830
So we'll say grid column from one.

155
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,450
We want to span it to a cross, so we'll save.

156
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,380
And there we go.

157
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,530
It spans across.

158
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,070
Now the images is kind of up too far.

159
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,750
I want to basically center it.

160
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:50,150
So I'm going to add a line dash items to the center and we'll save that now the images in the center.

161
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,710
So I want to do basically the same thing to the last.

162
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:03,620
So I'm going to copy this whole thing right here and just put a comma, paste that in and change this

163
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,040
to last child so that we can target that and save.

164
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,430
And now you can see we get the same thing.

165
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,470
Now, actually, you know what we need to.

166
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,950
Right now we're saying start at one and span two.

167
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,610
And that's not what we want because we want it to start here.

168
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,790
So we actually wanted to start at two and span two.

169
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:39,270
So we're going to have to also just grab this, go down here and take this and say we want to start

170
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,980
at two and span two.

171
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,240
So we'll go ahead and save that.

172
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,780
And there we go.

173
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,460
So now let's put in this place.

174
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,040
All right.

175
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,660
So that looks pretty good.

176
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,060
Last thing we want to add our background classes and our padding classes.

177
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,350
So this should have background dark, this should have background primary.

178
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:04,580
And we also need that the padding classes because this right here is just too close to to the showcase.

179
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:13,760
Remember, we added the PI to class, so let's go up top and we're going to add in all the background

180
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,310
classes which we're going to have three.

181
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:28,610
So let's say BG Dark and we're going to do a background, we'll use our our dark color variable and

182
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,580
let's do a color white.

183
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,350
All right.

184
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,230
And let's go ahead and just we'll go ahead and copy this down twice.

185
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:51,950
Let's change this to primary and change this to secondary, and then we'll add our padding classes.

186
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:58,130
So I'm going to do p, y, let's do class p-1.

187
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,460
And for padding for this, I'm going to do 1.5.

188
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:05,840
Yeah.

189
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,120
1.5 rem top and bottom.

190
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:17,450
Copy this down a couple of times, this one will be two and then this one will be three and we'll change

191
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,870
these to two and three.

192
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,850
And then I'm going to copy this.

193
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:29,090
And we want we also want padding classes for all around, which will be P one, P two and P three.

194
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,410
And then we'll just take the zero away, which will make it padding all the way around.

195
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,360
So those are our padding classes, so let's save that.

196
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,240
Now, we haven't added the BG color yet.

197
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,960
You can see the padding is now there, but let's add our BG color classes or BG backgrounds.

198
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,480
So let's see.

199
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,210
We have the first one, which is right here.

200
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,680
The second one I'm going to give a class of BG Dash doc.

201
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,150
Save it.

202
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,810
And let's see, that didn't work.

203
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,590
But why didn't that work?

204
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,080
Class B g dark.

205
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,500
Um hmm.

206
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,030
It's because of the card.

207
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,410
Dark color background.

208
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,730
BG Dark.

209
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,990
Article class.

210
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,140
BG Doc, I'm not sure why that's.

211
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,280
Oh, wait a minute.

212
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,770
I put it on.

213
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,810
I put it on this one.

214
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,860
It's the wrong one.

215
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,560
It's going to be right here.

216
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,260
Here we go.

217
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,930
So we have an issue here.

218
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,180
The heading is not white.

219
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:56,050
Even though we put color white, we have to specifically target the heading or if there's any links.

220
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,870
We also want to set those to white.

221
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,900
So actually what I'm going to do is just create a bunch of styles here.

222
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,240
We'll do BG Dark H one.

223
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,420
BG Dark.

224
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,200
Sorry about the length of this video, guys.

225
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,160
We're just doing quite a bit here.

226
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,340
Hoops that should be BG Primary?

227
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,450
Nope.

228
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,110
BG Doc, we're doing H.

229
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,740
Let's just do h one, h two and h three.

230
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,530
And I know we only have an H three, but we might use BG Dark somewhere where there's an H one or an

231
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,460
H two as well.

232
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,150
So I'm just trying to make this scalable basically.

233
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,640
And then let's take care of any links.

234
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,420
So BG Dark A.

235
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,900
And then let's take care of the primary and secondary background.

236
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,250
So I'll paste this in.

237
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,220
Let's do primary paste that in

238
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,580
secondary.

239
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:06,380
By the way, I'm using Control DX to select the next one down and then we'll just set that to color

240
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,060
white and save.

241
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,950
And now you can see that this the heading is white.

242
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,310
So I want this one right here to have the BG primary.

243
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,440
So let's go back.

244
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,599
So it's the it's the second to last one.

245
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,720
So this is the last article.

246
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,760
Let's go to the second to last and say BG Dash primary and save.

247
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,950
And there we go.

248
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,000
So that looks pretty good and obviously it's not responsive yet.

249
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,830
We're going to get to that probably last, but I think that looks decent.

250
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,110
So in the next video, what I want to do is take care of the footer, which we're also going to use

251
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,740
the grid in.

252
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,380
We're basically going to have five items.

253
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,880
So one, two, three, four and then the fifth one, we're going to span all the way across like that.

254
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,600
All right.

255
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,370
So I'll see you in the next video.
