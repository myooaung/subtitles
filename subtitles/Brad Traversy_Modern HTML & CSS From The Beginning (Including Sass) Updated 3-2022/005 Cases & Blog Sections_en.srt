1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,600
Okay.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,570
So now we want to start on our cases, which is basically our photo gallery section and also the blog

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,110
section.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:17,280
So let's go into our HTML and under the solutions, let's say cases and we'll have a section.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,710
We're going to give this an ID of cases because it's part of the menu and then a class of cases.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:31,050
And we're going to use a class called Flex Grid and also a class of section padding.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,570
Now in here, we're going to have a header with a class of section header.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,800
And headers don't have to be just for the main website header.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
You can use them for articles or for whatever.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,430
And then here we're going to have an H for and say this is what we do.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:59,040
Underneath that will have an H two and let's say business cases, then a paragraph and we'll do law

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,300
M ten here.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,860
So that's our header.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,099
Now underneath that we're going to have our row.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,970
So class of row and then a column.

16
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,240
Column.

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,560
So within each column, we're actually going to have two images.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,660
So let's have our first image here, which is going to be, say, images, slash cases, and then cases

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,150
one, and then the second one will be cases two, and then we'll just grab this column.

20
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,980
So we're going to have four columns.

21
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,970
So that's one, two, three, four with two images each.

22
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:45,080
So this will be image three or cases three, four, five, six.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,270
Seven and eight.

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,630
So that should be it as far as the HTML goes here.

25
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,920
So we'll save that.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:05,050
And if we take a look, we're just going to have large stretched out images and this is the header which

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,090
also we need to style.

28
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,630
So let's go into style, CSS.

29
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:21,070
And as far as what we need to do here, actually the only thing we need to do here is for the image.

30
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,020
I want to add a hover effect.

31
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,150
And set the opacity to let's do 0.7.

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,320
So we just have that hover effect.

33
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,740
The rest of the stuff is going to basically it's going to be for the header, the section header, and

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,730
then the grid.

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,770
So let's go into utilities because we're going to reuse these classes later.

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,220
Anything that we're going to reuse is going to go into utilities.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,520
So let's do the section

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
header first.

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:10,870
So section header, we're going to add padding 30 pixels, let's display flex, but we're going to change

40
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,800
it to a column.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,230
So Flex Direction column and we want to align everything to the center.

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,440
So align items to the center.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:29,470
We want to set the justify content to the center and text align to the center.

44
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:38,050
So if we take a look at that, everything is now centered and then let's style the H two.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:47,860
So section header H two, let's give that font size of 40 pixels and then let's add margin, we'll say

46
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,350
20 pixels on the top and bottom.

47
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:56,740
Now we also have a class of section padding, so I'm going to add that as well.

48
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:09,720
So section padding and let's do 20 on the top.

49
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,210
Yeah, we'll do 20, 20 left and right, 40 on the bottom.

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,720
So if we take a look good.

51
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:26,640
Now we want to do the flex grid class that we created that has a row and a column class in it.

52
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,090
So right here we'll say flex grid.

53
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,740
And we want to style the row.

54
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:48,430
So as a class of row and we're going to display flex and set the flex wrap and let's just say padding

55
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,100
for pixels on the sides.

56
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,270
So that's the row.

57
00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:02,320
And then for the column, let's say flex grid column, we want these to have we want these to be 25%

58
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,590
each.

59
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,740
Because, remember, there's there's four images across.

60
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,040
I mean, there's eight images, but we have two in each column.

61
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,900
Whoops, that shouldn't be column two.

62
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,250
It should just be column.

63
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,040
So flex grid column, we're going to set the flex to a percentage.

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,900
So instead of like flex one or whatever, let's do 25% and make sure that we have a max width of 25%

65
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:32,740
so it doesn't go over that and then add padding on the sides for pixels.

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,110
All right.

67
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,240
Now we want to do so.

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,770
Take a look at this.

69
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,710
So looks pretty good, actually.

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:44,930
Yeah.

71
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,840
So we'll just keep that if we make this smaller, you know, the images get real small, but we're like

72
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,970
I said, we're going to add media queries later to stack stack everything on top of each other.

73
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,730
So that should do it for that.

74
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:05,270
Now, the next section is this blog section, which is very similar to the solutions.

75
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:16,730
So what we'll do is in our HTML, let's just copy the solutions section and paste that in here.

76
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,950
And this is going to be blog.

77
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,420
We're just going to change.

78
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,480
First of all, let's add an ID of blog because we have the menu pointing to it and then also the class.

79
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,520
Say blog.

80
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,620
And then we just have to change.

81
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,940
Basically change the content so the image here will be in home blog and then for the the text, it's

82
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,570
going to be formatted the same way, but we'll just change the actual content, let's say April 16,

83
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,560
2020.

84
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,100
So we'll just pretend that this is like a teaser for the first blog post or the latest blog post or

85
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,760
whatever.

86
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,370
And we'll leave this.

87
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,640
We'll just say, read our blog.

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,810
Now, I do want the image to be on the other side.

89
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,670
We could change the HTML like we could take this image, put it here, put the text here.

90
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,930
But I don't want to do that.

91
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,010
I'd rather just add a class of flex reverse.

92
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:25,860
So if I add that, let's go to utilities and four for flex reverse, we can just go.

93
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,350
So that's the that's flex columns.

94
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,650
Right.

95
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,640
So I'm going to go.

96
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,060
Up to the top here.

97
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:49,470
And let's say so if it's flex columns and it has a class of flex reverse, then we want the row to change.

98
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:56,000
You want to change the flex direction to row reverse because it's just going to switch it.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,320
So if we take a look now, the image is on that side.

100
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,380
Now, I also want this to be a different color, which we made it really easy to do that because we

101
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:13,130
have utility classes for backgrounds, so we can simply change it to secondary or dark or whatever you

102
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,700
want.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,180
So now we have that blue background.

104
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,630
So I mean, hopefully you can see the pattern here.

105
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:27,170
We just create these classes that we can reuse whenever we want these specific types of layouts.

106
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:34,610
So the next one is the team which again has a section header which is identical to this section header.

107
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:35,390
All right.

108
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,010
So that will make it easy to do that.

109
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,470
And then we just have these flex items so we can use the flex items class that we used here with the

110
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,400
icons.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,780
So it makes it really easy to just keep adding sections.

112
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,870
So in the next video, we'll go ahead and get into those.
