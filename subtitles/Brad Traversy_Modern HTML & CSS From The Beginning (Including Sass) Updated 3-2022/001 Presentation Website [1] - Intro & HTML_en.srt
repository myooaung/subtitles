1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,690
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,950
So we're going to start a small project here and this is a presentation website.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,280
So this is not really like a mainstream website, but something that maybe you would do at some kind

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,270
of conference if you want to if you want to have some kind of presentation, but you don't want to use

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,760
PowerPoint, you want to build something custom.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,770
Obviously this is very simplified, but you could add graphics to it, charts, stuff like that.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,260
So basically we're going to be using a bunch of stuff that we've we've already learned.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,470
So we're going to use variables, we're going to use a little bit of keyframe animation, transition,

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,440
stuff like that.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,890
So basically when the page loads, I'm just going to reload it.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,160
The top comes in, the side comes in.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:41,790
All right.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,250
And then we also have a transition on the button.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,140
You can see it kind of fades nicely.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,980
And this is like the landing page, so the greeting page and then notice there's no scroll bars, I

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,420
can't scroll up and down.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,480
We actually have to click the button to go to the next page.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,739
And what I've done is I've integrated that smooth scrolling jQuery script or jQuery code that we used

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,489
a while back.

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,080
But you don't have to do that.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,070
If you don't use it, you'll just click and it'll just it'll just go to the next page.

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,200
It won't have the scrolling effect.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,240
So it's up to you if you want to use that or not.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,700
And then notice that this is just page two.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,460
You would change the title here and the content.

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,770
You could add any content you want we have previous which will bring us back up and then we have next,

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,090
which will bring us to the next page, which is a different color background.

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,480
We're going to use variables for that and then the next page.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,030
And of course, if you wanted to add more, you could.

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,940
But I just I just have four pages now.

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,100
These are not separate HTML pages.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,900
It's all in in this.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,220
Well, I called it landing HTML, but we'll be calling it indexed HTML.

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,520
But it appears to be multiple pages.

35
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,320
So this is what we'll be building.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,610
So let's get started.

37
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,390
So I'm going to go ahead and close that up, open a new tab.

38
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,730
Let's go to about here.

39
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,030
Just because I want to have both on the same screen and I just have an empty folder called presentation

40
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:16,790
website and we're going to create an index HTML file and let's create I'm just going to do a style dot

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,580
CSS.

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm not even going to create a CSS folder because this is a very small project.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,100
So in our index, HTML is it's generate our boilerplate.

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm just going to close this and let's just say presentation for our title and we'll put in actually,

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,460
you know, what we're going to do is link our style sheet.

46
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,730
So let's go above the title and link and let's link to style CSS.

47
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,780
We don't have a CSS folder, so we don't have to do CSS slash style.

48
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,540
And then for the content, the content is going to be pretty simple.

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,710
So we're going to have a section actually, let's put a comment here.

50
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,770
We'll say this is going to be page one, which is the intro, and it's going to be a section.

51
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,170
These are all going to be sections with IDs.

52
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,280
So we're going to give it an ID of page dash one, and then each one is going to have a class.

53
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,020
I don't want to put the word class.

54
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,230
We want to say dot and then the class name, which is Page.

55
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay.

56
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:30,210
And then we'll have an H one and let's say welcome to my presentation.

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,130
And then under that let's put a paragraph and I believe I did lorm, I think I did 40 it sounds about

58
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,670
right.

59
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:48,750
So lorem 40 and underneath the paragraph we're going to have a div in this div is going to have whatever

60
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,460
buttons there are now on the first page we're just going to have one button because it's just a next.

61
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,390
There's no previous.

62
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,910
We're on the first page, so let's do an A tag, let's give it a class of BTN because we're going to

63
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,840
style that.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:11,790
And then this is going to go to the ID of page dash to OC and then inside here, let's say next page

65
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,230
now we are going to be using font.

66
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,740
Awesome.

67
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:22,380
So I'm actually going to go to font awesome dot com and we're going to grab the link here so that we

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,580
can use these icons.

69
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,730
So let's put this right above our link to our style sheet.

70
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,890
Excuse me.

71
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,410
Okay.

72
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:38,190
Now we should be able to use icons, so I'm going to go after the text of next page and I'm going to

73
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:50,670
put an I tag with a class of f, a s and let's do a class of F, a dash, arrow, dash, circle, dash

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,870
down.

75
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,480
So that will give us a down facing arrow.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,930
So if I save this and we open this with a live server.

77
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,440
We're going to see something like this.

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,790
So notice the the arrow coming from font.

79
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,500
Awesome.

80
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:12,110
So for the next page, I'm going to copy this whole section and go right under it.

81
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,250
And this is going to be page two and get rid of that.

82
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,700
And this is going to have an ID of page two and for the title or the H one, I should say.

83
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,850
I'm just going to say page two, I'm going to leave the same text.

84
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,420
Obviously, it would be different content if this were a real life project.

85
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,070
And then down here the next this is I'm going to have this go to the previous page.

86
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,710
Well, actually, you know, what I'll do is just copy the entire a tag here and paste it under.

87
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:47,060
And this one is going to go to page one and this is going to say previous or prev page.

88
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,770
And then for the icon it's going to be a circle up.

89
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,770
And then this one here is going to go to page three and this is going to be circled down and it's going

90
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,060
to go to the next page.

91
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,880
So now let's copy page two.

92
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,560
We'll copy that section.

93
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,230
Paste that in.

94
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,970
And this is going to be page three.

95
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,880
Change that all to page three.

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,670
And then as for the previous, it's going to go to page two and this is going to go to page four.

97
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,710
All right.

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:27,050
Actually, one thing I wanted to do is for the let's see for the previous page button.

99
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,470
Let's let's give also give that a class of button dark because I don't want them to be the same color.

100
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,820
So that will be button dark.

101
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,140
This one also.

102
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,060
Button dark.

103
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:39,890
All right.

104
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,170
And then we have one more page to do.

105
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,880
So we'll paste this in.

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:52,910
This will be page four, giving an idea of page four, and then the previous is going to be page three.

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,830
And then we're not going to have a next.

108
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,280
So we can we can get rid of this whole a tag.

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,010
All right.

110
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,210
And let's see.

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,590
We won't do the button doc here just because it's the only button.

112
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,300
All right, so I'm going to save that.

113
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,100
And that's what that's what we're going to get.

114
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,020
And you can see just how much CSIS does, because this is the HTML.

115
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,350
And just look at this.

116
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,140
It's absolutely horrible.

117
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,560
So CSS is very important when it comes to shaping up a website or an application.

118
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240
So that's the HTML.

119
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,940
In the next video, we're going to start on the CSS.
