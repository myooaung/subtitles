1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.840
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.840
So in this video, we're going to look at links and images.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.370
And what I've done here is I've put the bra, I've made the browser smaller so that I could fit it on

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.910
the same screen as as the editor so that we can see what's going on at the same time because we have

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.850
auto reload with live server and I won't do this for every video, just the ones that where we don't

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.360
need a lot of real estate in the browser window here.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.270
So let's go ahead and create a new file.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.670
I'm going to call this zero five, underscore links, underscore images, HTML.

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.570
All right.

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.580
And I'm just going to close this up to give us some more room and we're going to generate a boilerplate.

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.970
And when I say boilerplate, it just means, you know, our our starter template, whatever, our structure.

12
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.870
So the title I'm going to say links and images.

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.720
And let's go ahead and let's first start with an external link.

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.770
So if you want to link to another website, you can do that.

15
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.950
So I'm going to put a paragraph in between all these links.

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.640
Actually, you know what?

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.800
I won't do that because I want to show you something.

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.540
So a link is is represented with an A tag.

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.710
So I'm going to say a tab or a enter and notice that with V's code it gives us this a ref attribute

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.520
right away.

21
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.800
And that's because every link needs an RF attribute, because that's the location that you're linking

22
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.400
to.

23
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.420
So in this case, let's link to HTTP, Google dot com.

24
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.560
And inside here is what we want to put whatever we want to click to link like some text or an image

25
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.040
or whatever.

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.210
That's what we want to put in here.

27
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.330
So let's, let's just say click for Google and we'll save this.

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.880
I'm just going to add a comment here.

29
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.670
We'll say external link and let's go ahead and save and run with live server.

30
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.790
So we have this link here that says Click for Google.

31
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.070
By default, it's going to be colored differently.

32
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.480
It's going to have an underline.

33
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.610
And if I click, it brings us to Google.

34
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.770
Now notice it opens in the same tab.

35
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.830
And when you link to an external site like this, usually you want to open it in a new tab because you

36
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.910
don't want to you don't want people to drift away from your website.

37
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.500
You're trying to show them something, but at the same time you want your website to stay open.

38
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.380
So what we would do is add a target attribute.

39
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.680
Now, I'm going to show you a little another little trick here, keyboard trick.

40
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.760
If you want to copy this whole line down, what you can do is hold shift option or shift alt on on windows

41
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.440
and then hit the down arrow.

42
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.750
And that will just copy that line for you.

43
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.350
And another tip if you want to.

44
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.130
You see how I'm just going back and forth here, one character at a time.

45
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.740
If you want to go by by word, you can hold down alt or actually on windows.

46
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.890
It's control I believe, but on a mac it's option.

47
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.390
And if you hit the the over arrow, notice how it goes across the whole word.

48
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.450
So to go from here to here, so you can go across much faster.

49
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.190
All right.

50
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.610
And if you want to go all the way to the beginning, you can hit the home key.

51
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.360
If you want to go all the way to the end of the line, you can hit the end key.

52
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.040
So it's very helpful to be able to navigate very quickly like that.

53
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.150
So again, like I was saying, if we want to open in a different tag, we can use the target attribute

54
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.390
and for a value we want to do underscore blank.

55
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.220
So we'll save that.

56
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.610
And what I wanted to show you is notice how this the next link here is not on a separate line.

57
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.070
The reason for that is on a tag is actually what's called an inline element.

58
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.320
So it doesn't knock it on to the next line.

59
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.860
Like if it were a paragraph, which is actually a block element.

60
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.110
And we're going to talk about inline and block elements, I think two videos from now, but I wanted

61
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.880
you to know that there are some inline elements and there are some block elements.

62
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.000
Now, if I want this on a new line, I could put a line break or I could just wrap them in a paragraph

63
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.570
tag.

64
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.320
And another tip is, if I want this moved up here, I can actually just hold either alt on windows or

65
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.450
option on a mac and I can just bring it up.

66
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.550
I can move this line wherever I want.

67
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.110
All right.

68
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.870
So we'll do that and let's put another paragraph tag and we'll bring that up into here.

69
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.020
So now if I save there on separate lines, because the paragraph is actually a block level element,

70
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.980
and if I click the second one, it opens up in a new tab because of the target attribute, because I

71
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.210
set it to blank.

72
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.890
All right.

73
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.930
So these are external links.

74
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.290
Usually your links are going to be internal because you're going to be linking to other pages in your

75
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:54.170
website, like, let's say in a boat page or a services or contact page, something like that.

76
00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.020
So since we have these HTML files in the same folder, let's link to one of these.

77
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.600
So we'll link to the zero for typography.

78
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.880
So I'm going to close that back up.

79
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:16.310
Let's say internal link, put a paragraph and we'll put a an H in a tag with an H ref that points to

80
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.540
slash, meaning the current folder that we're in.

81
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.000
And then with V's code, notice that it actually shows us the HTML files that are in this folder.

82
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.970
The slash means the current folder we're in.

83
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.790
So I'm going to choose the topography HTML.

84
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.780
And in here, let's just say typography and we'll go ahead and save that.

85
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.710
And then if we click topography, it brings us to that page.

86
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.920
We don't have to put the whole like 127001 5500.

87
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.670
We don't have to put that in here because we're already in the same folder.

88
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.710
So we just need that slash.

89
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.850
All right.

90
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.080
And I'm just going to click the back button so we can link to any inner page that way.

91
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.350
So now let's take a look at images.

92
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.740
So this is our folder right here, HTML sandbox.

93
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.550
And I'm going to just create a new folder here called Images.

94
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.480
Usually you'll see this or they might it might be called IMG.

95
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.590
A lot of times you'll see that on in websites and applications.

96
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.230
But in this images folder, I'm just going to bring over a sample image which you should have in your

97
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.550
your your HTML sandbox in the project files.

98
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.900
And I'm going to bring this on to our Web page.

99
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:42.320
So I'll go down here and let's say local image and I'm saying local image because it's actually in our

100
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.390
folder, it's in it's in our file structure.

101
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.510
You can also link to remote images that are elsewhere, and I'll show you that in a second.

102
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.530
But let's go ahead and do an image tag, which is IMG and then.

103
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.480
If I do IMG Enter Tab, it's going to give me two attributes.

104
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.160
One is the source, which is the location of the image and the image name.

105
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.760
And then one is the basically the alternative text.

106
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.250
So for some reason the image doesn't show up.

107
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.030
If it's not there or something, this will be the text that's shown.

108
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:22.040
So for the alt I'll just say my image and then for the for the link here we want to go into the images

109
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.900
folder notice with VTS code.

110
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:30.470
If I do a forward slash brings down this dropdown and I can choose the images folder and it even shows

111
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.400
me what's in there.

112
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.900
The sample jpeg.

113
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.040
So I want that.

114
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.150
So the location and the image name itself.

115
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.120
So if I go ahead and save, there it is.

116
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.640
The image shows up now it goes out of view here because we have no CSS.

117
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.220
So it's just going to show the full size image.

118
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.860
But with CCIS, we can actually change actually we can change it with HTML as well.

119
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.950
If I wanted to, I could add a width here.

120
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.080
This isn't really something I'd recommend doing.

121
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.490
Usually you would use CSS, but you can set the width and height in HTML.

122
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.870
So if I set this to 200 and save now you can see that it's smaller and you can do height the height

123
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.440
as well.

124
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.320
But the height will auto adjust if you add a width.

125
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.590
So we can also do remote images.

126
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.390
So same way, IMG and all.

127
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.640
I'll just say my image too.

128
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.270
And for the source I could do any source I want.

129
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:43.250
Actually, there's a really good image sharing site if you go to source dot unsplash dot com and we

130
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.780
go down here, you can get random images from a specific user of the site.

131
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:55.280
What I want though is let's see, there's a fixed daily, weekly photo so you could grab any of these

132
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.480
URLs right here, random search term.

133
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.480
So if you want a random image like of nature and water, you can just grab this URL and put in nature

134
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.220
and water.

135
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.520
So let's do that.

136
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:17.280
So if we go back, if I save, it's going to give me an image that's 1600 pixels by 900 pixels of nature.

137
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.610
Water.

138
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.930
Let's make this smaller.

139
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.620
We'll say 200.

140
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.180
Okay.

141
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.230
So there we go.

142
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.840
And this only works because Unsplash.com allows us to do this.

143
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.570
They they basically allow us to specify the size in here.

144
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.130
This you can't do this with just any link, any image link.

145
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.710
Same thing with keywords here.

146
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.140
If I wanted like, let's say building.

147
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.080
And then we go, we get some kind of picture of a building.

148
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.970
I think it's yeah, it's random.

149
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.630
So if I click reload, it's just going to be a random building.

150
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.020
And again, this has nothing to do with HTML.

151
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:06.730
It's just the Unsplash service is an image sharing service or an image placeholder service that allows

152
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.450
us to do this.

153
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:12.730
So it's pretty cool if you're building something and you just need some, some kind of random image

154
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.440
and you don't want to have it local, you can just link to Unsplash like this.

155
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.520
All right.

156
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.050
So I think that's going to do it.

157
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.400
Guys, in the next video, we're going to start to look at lists and tables.
