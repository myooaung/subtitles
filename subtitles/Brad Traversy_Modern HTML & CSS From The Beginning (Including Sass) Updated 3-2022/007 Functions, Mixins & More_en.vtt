00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.870
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.890
So now we're going to get into functions and mix ins.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.390
Now, if you've ever worked with a programming language, whether it's JavaScript, PHP, any language

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.150
at all, you've probably worked with functions.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.550
It's basically just a block of code that you can keep calling so you don't have to keep repeating yourself.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.600
So what I want to do is create a new sass file, a partial.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.510
So I'm going to say new file underscore.

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.790
We'll call this underscore functions, CSS.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.870
And then and here I want to create a function to set the text color.

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.900
Now the difference between the main difference between a function and a mix in is a function actually

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.990
returns something you have to use the return keyword.

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.640
A mix in is just basically a set of styles that you want to include.

13
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.430
And I'll give you some examples of this.

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.150
So to create a function, we use the symbol when we say function and we're going to call this set dash

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.530
text, dash color.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.570
And by the way, this is a very helpful function that I use all the time in SASS, and it's going to

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.000
take in a parameter of a color.

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.680
All right.

19
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.030
Now we're going to use what's called a color function, along with a conditional to see the lightness

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.920
of the color that's passed in.

21
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.670
So to create a conditional, we do what we do at the add symbol and then if and then our condition goes

22
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.060
in here.

23
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.000
So what we're testing is going to be the lightness.

24
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.550
So we have lightness of the color.

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.000
So basically whatever is passed in here, we're checking the lightness and we want to see if it's greater

26
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.100
than 50.

27
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.970
So greater than basically 50% lightness.

28
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.600
If that's true, then we want to return.

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.150
So we say at return and we want to return a dark.

30
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.690
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.980
Yeah.

32
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.450
A dark color which will just do black.

33
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.760
Else.

34
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.100
Think should we need to do at ll?

35
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.050
So always forget that at LL.

36
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.800
Then we want to add return a light color.

37
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.060
So we'll do white.

38
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.350
So it's going to get passed in the color, which is going to be the background color.

39
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.660
Actually, maybe we should call this.

40
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.870
Well, the color is fine.

41
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.100
Just know that it's going to be the background color and it's going to check the lightness of it.

42
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.140
If it's greater than 50, meaning it's light, then we want to return a dark color.

43
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.420
If it's less than 50, meaning it's dark, then we want a light color because obviously we want the

44
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.980
text to contrast.

45
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:48.820
So I'm going to save this and I'm just going to restart this down here and PM run sass and I'm going

46
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.140
to go into my main dot success and I'm going to import.

47
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.180
The functions file.

48
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:07.940
And then I want to let's go to the header where we have right here the color of this h one of this of

49
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.910
this will basically have anything that's in the header and I'm going to replace this with set dash text,

50
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.170
dash color.

51
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.030
All right.

52
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.390
Now this set text colour takes in, remember a background colour and we want to put in whatever we used.

53
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.570
Here is the background, which in this case is dark colour.

54
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.490
So we'll paste that in there.

55
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.320
And now let's save file to import not found or unreachable.

56
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.290
Unreachable.

57
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.740
It's because I called the file function.

58
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.870
I actually want to call it functions.

59
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.840
All right.

60
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.410
So we're just going to restart in PM run SAS.

61
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.430
All right, so let's reload now.

62
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.540
It's going to look the same.

63
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.860
But if I now change the the header background to something light like let's change it to.

64
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.620
Light color and then we pass in the same the light color here and we save the text is now dark.

65
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:22.650
OC If I do background primary color, primary color, it's going to evaluate the lightness of it.

66
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.240
And it found that the lightness is less than 50, so it gives it a white background.

67
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.850
Secondary color is a brighter color.

68
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.540
So I'm going to bet that the text is going to be dark.

69
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.470
So secondary color for the background and now the text is dark, so it makes it dynamic.

70
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.760
So you don't have to if you if you want to change the background, then you can it'll dynamically change

71
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.430
the text to whether it should be light or dark.

72
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.610
You don't have to decide that this function does it for you.

73
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.390
All right.

74
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.920
So I'm just going to put this back to dark like that.

75
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.910
All right?

76
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.050
And then I just want to use this sex set text color pretty much everywhere.

77
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:15.090
So we'll go down here and paste set in and we just want to pass in whatever the background is.

78
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.100
Okay.

79
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.040
So we'll do it here as well.

80
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.460
And we'll set this to secondary color.

81
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.990
And let's do it here.

82
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.800
This has light color as a background.

83
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.730
And then down here this has dot color as a background.

84
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.540
So once I save this, it should all still be correct.

85
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.470
So I'll save.

86
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.160
And this actually changed to dark because of the light background and that.

87
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.180
Yeah, that's it.

88
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.180
So hopefully that makes sense guys.

89
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:10.210
It just this is helpful because it allows us to basically set the color dynamically, but functions

90
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.310
in general are helpful so that you don't have to keep repeating code and so are mixed in.

91
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.400
So now we're going to look at creating a mix in and all I want this mix in to do we're going to put

92
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:31.410
it right in the functions file is I want it to add a transform so basically if we want like if we want

93
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.300
it to add a transform to make this button curve or something like that, we can do that.

94
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:45.040
So let's say this is going to be the transform mix in and once we start doing this stuff in the next

95
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.440
project, it'll make more sense as well.

96
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.700
So a mix in, we're going to say add mix in and then name it.

97
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.890
I'm just going to call it Transform and it's going to take in a property.

98
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.590
Now, in some cases, you may want to use prefixes for for newer CSS.

99
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.910
And that's another good reason to to use mix ins.

100
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:16.600
We can like let's say we wanted to do web kit, dash transform.

101
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.130
It should be a dash.

102
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:29.200
So Web kit transform, set it to property and maybe we want to do dash MZ Dash transform.

103
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.790
And set that to property.

104
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.000
And then, of course, just transform, set that to property.

105
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.680
So if you have a block of styles that you don't want to keep repeating in your your sass, you can just

106
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.220
put it into a mix in.

107
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:58.370
So now if I want to go back to my main JS and let's say on the hover state of these buttons, I want

108
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.940
to add a transform that rotates them a little bit.

109
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:11.990
So I'll go right here and let's put in ampersand hover and let's set.

110
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.520
The mix in now to include a mix and you actually have to do the act include and then the name of the

111
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:28.550
mix in which is transform in the property we want to pass in is going to be let's do rotate and let's

112
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:39.240
rotate it 20 degrees and I'm going to do the same thing for the doc, so I'll paste that in if it's

113
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.700
stuck though, let's do, let's do -20, we'll rotate it the opposite way.

114
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:49.880
So if I save now when I hover over this you'll see it rotates 20 degrees, this one rotates that way.

115
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:59.870
So instead of using this, these three lines in both of these places, I can put it in a mix in and

116
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.220
just include that.

117
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.950
I mean, you don't really need web kit and RMS anymore for Transform.

118
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:17.240
However, if it's a different if it's a newer CSS property that you do need prefixes, this is a good

119
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.770
way to include them.

120
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.740
And not just for prefixes, but for anything, any set of styles that you're going to reuse.

121
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.990
So let's see.

122
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.460
The last thing I want to show you is some of the color functions.

123
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:38.360
So we have lighten and darken, let's say in addition to just tilting these, we want them to either

124
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.010
darken or lighten a little bit.

125
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:46.820
So in the hover here, I'm going to set the background dash color.

126
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.970
So the background color is, is this light color by default, let's say I just want to darken it a little

127
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.260
bit so we can say darken.

128
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.720
So this is a pre defined function.

129
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.920
I don't have to create it and we just pass in two things the color we want.

130
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.550
So we'll say light color and then how much we want to darken it.

131
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.790
So we're going to do 10%, so I'll save that.

132
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.870
Now when I hover over it, notice that the color darkens 10%.

133
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.180
We also have lighten.

134
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:24.140
So I'm going to just copy what I just did, go down here to this hover and let's change this to lighten,

135
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.870
oops, lighten.

136
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.150
And this has the dark color and we're going to lighten it 10%.

137
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.020
So we'll save.

138
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.170
And then when I hover over it, you'll see that it lightens 10%.

139
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:37.920
All right.

140
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.750
So you can see that there's some really cool functionality with SAS.

141
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.780
It really allows us to write our CSS more like a programming language.

142
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.800
Conditionals.

143
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.810
You can't do this stuff with standard CSS, pre-made functions and mix ins.

144
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.820
You can do variables.

145
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.840
However, you can see that the variables with SAS are much more elegant.

146
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.100
You know, you don't have to do the Var and the parentheses and, you know, stuff like that.

147
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.880
All right.

148
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.440
So hopefully this little crash course or the sandbox made sense.

149
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.860
In the next video, we're going to start to build a real project using SAS, which will be a portfolio

150
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.660
website.

151
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.100
All right, so I'll see you in the next project.
