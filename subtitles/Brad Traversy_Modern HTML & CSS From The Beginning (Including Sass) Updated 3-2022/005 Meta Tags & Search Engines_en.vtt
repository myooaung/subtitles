00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.420
All right.

2
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.490
In this video we're going to talk about and look at meta tags, which are tags or snippets that describe

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.560
a page's content and they don't appear in the body of the Web page anywhere.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.640
Nobody sees them.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.970
It just describes some stuff about the page.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.860
So we're going to look at some of the popular ones, including the ones that are used in search engines.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.690
So let's create a new file.

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.820
We'll call it zero three, underscore meta, underscore tags, dot HTML.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.640
And I'm going to generate my content with Emmett.

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.970
So I'm going to use exclamation tab or enter and notice that it adds three meta tags.

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.760
It also adds a laying attribute which you don't need in your HTML tag, but it just describes the language

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
as English, and these are all attributes.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.890
So tags have attributes.

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.610
We're going to be using them along the way and they describe basically their properties of the tag.

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.770
So all of these are meta, right?

16
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.740
So the only difference is the different attributes.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.830
That's how we can tell what what each one is.

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.370
So the first one here is char set, which is the character set, and this specifies the character encoding

19
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.210
of the page.

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.000
So UTF eight is actually the default, it's the character encoding for Unicode.

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.720
It's not extremely important to understand how this works or what it is.

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.560
It's we could actually remove this and it would still be UTF eight.

23
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.040
And the Unicode standard covers almost all characters punctuation, punctuation, symbols, things like

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.550
that.

25
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.930
So that's what that is.

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.510
It's the character set that this page uses.

27
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.960
The next one here is pretty important for responsive design.

28
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.480
This is the viewport tag and responsive design it.

29
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.870
It's all about making your your website or your user interface responsive to different screen sizes.

30
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.130
So you want your website to look good on a desktop, a laptop, smartphone, a tablet, and there's

31
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.340
different strategies mostly to do with CSS on making your site look good on these devices.

32
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.430
But one of the things you want to do is add this viewport tag and you want to set the content value.

33
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
You want to set a couple of things in the content, which is, one, the width you want to set it to

34
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.480
whatever the width of the device and the scale should be set to 1.0.

35
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.880
So if you've ever gone on a non responsive site on a smartphone and you had to drag your finger over

36
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.190
to kind of see the rest of the site that probably doesn't have the viewport set.

37
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.380
So you want it to actually show the entire website or the entire interface.

38
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.060
So that's what the viewport tag does.

39
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.680
It's actually really important.

40
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.860
So this next one has to do with browser compatibility.

41
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.870
This http equiv, you can see the content equals i.e. equals edge.

42
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.640
So IY is referring to the old internet explorer browser which is not used very much at all anymore.

43
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.470
Windows now ships with edge.

44
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.440
So we're basically saying we want to use the edge standards.

45
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.350
And Microsoft browsers have been just a nightmare since since the beginning of Web development.

46
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.750
Back when I started, it was Internet Explorer six, which never rendered things correctly.

47
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.240
You always had to do little hacks here and there and your CSS and your JavaScript to get things to work.

48
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.260
So even now, Ie11, which is the latest version, is still very clunky, but not too many people use

49
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.380
it.

50
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.620
I think if I look at my analytics on my website, it's like 0.3% or something ridiculous like that.

51
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.250
So it's not it's extremely important to support those browsers anymore unless you're building a website

52
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.730
that may have like a lot of elderly people as viewers because a lot of them have older computers that

53
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.930
they haven't updated.

54
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.860
That's still run.

55
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.860
IEEE All right, so now what I want to look at is meta tags that have to do with search engines.

56
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.960
So we're going to talk a little bit about search engines and the title is actually really important.

57
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.260
I'm just going to put meta tags here, but you're in your title.

58
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.480
You want to have you want to put something that really describes the page.

59
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.510
You also want to put keywords that you want to rank for.

60
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.690
Well, in the search engines now, SEO, which is search engine optimization, has changed dramatically

61
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.640
from years ago.

62
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.450
Like there's certain things that used to be really important are not anymore.

63
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.170
And I'm not an SEO expert, so I'm not going to speak too much on that.

64
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.170
But the title is What Shows In the Search Engine.

65
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.260
So if we jump into Chrome here and let's open up a new tab, and by the way, this time that you see

66
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.300
here in the background, this is a chrome a Google Chrome extension called moment, if you're interested.

67
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.040
I know a lot of people will ask me about it.

68
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.430
So I figured I just tell you guys it has to dos and stuff like that.

69
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.390
It's pretty cool.

70
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:51.540
But let's go ahead and go to Google.com and let's search for like, let's say, Miami Web design.

71
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.790
And when we look at these websites that show up, this large text here, this is the title.

72
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.320
Whatever you have in the title for the page is going to show up here most of the time.

73
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.230
If it doesn't match the page's content, Google might take it upon itself to put something in here.

74
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.120
But usually it's going to be your title.

75
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.430
And then this text here, the smaller text is actually the description meta tag, which I'll show you

76
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.120
in a second.

77
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.750
But if we go to this site and which I'm not affiliated at all with, and if we go ahead and view the

78
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.500
source code with command option you or control you on a Windows machine, and we look at the title,

79
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.720
you'll see it's Miami website, design company, digital agency and then the name of the company.

80
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.820
So that's a good choice for a title.

81
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.260
It has some keywords in there.

82
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.860
It also has the company name and you can see if I hover over the title.

83
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.970
That's exactly it should should pop up here.

84
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.640
I'll usually does.

85
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.860
I'm not sure why it's not popping up, but usually it'll pop up and show you the whole title.

86
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:55.520
Here we go.

87
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.640
And you can see that it matches what is in the HTML.

88
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.880
And then if we look at the meta description tag, which is, let's see, where is it?

89
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.720
Uh, here's the viewport.

90
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.220
Let's search for it.

91
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.980
So if we do a control f in search for description.

92
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.000
Here it is.

93
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.880
So meta name equals description and then the content you'll see this is exactly what is showing up in

94
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.810
the search engine.

95
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.050
So Fuze is a full service Miami website design company.

96
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.920
If we go back to the the results here, Fuse is a full service Miami website design company.

97
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.920
So this is going to be your description, this is your title.

98
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.460
So let's go ahead and add in a description.

99
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.350
So we're going to say meta and we want to use the name,

100
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.290
description and content.

101
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.870
You'd say, whatever, I'm just going to put this is my website description, but you would want to

102
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.110
put something that's that's specifies what's on the page.

103
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.660
You also want to put some keywords in here.

104
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.360
I don't think the description holds too much weight, but it is what what the user sees when they search

105
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.900
for your site.

106
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.220
So that's pretty important.

107
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:20.540
And another search engine related tag is the keywords meta tag.

108
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.480
Now this keyword is tag used to hold a lot of weight like years and years ago.

109
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.580
But now it's not it doesn't really matter.

110
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.820
It's just for describing the page's content.

111
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.640
So it's not like it's going to make or break your site in the search engine, but generally you want

112
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.950
to keep between like eight and 12 words.

113
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:47.240
So let's say this was a Web Web development company we put like Web development, maybe web design,

114
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.730
maybe your company name or something like that.

115
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.930
So you generally want to have around eight or so of these keywords.

116
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.040
All right.

117
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:05.660
So let's see, the last one that I want to show you is, is if you don't want your site to rank in search

118
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.890
engines, if you don't want it to show up at all, you would use the robots meta tag.

119
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.230
So let's say meta name equals robots.

120
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:22.700
And for the content, you would want to put no index so that it doesn't index your site in the search

121
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.590
engine and then no follow so it doesn't follow any links on the page and indexed those.

122
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.250
All right.

123
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.990
So for some reason you don't want your site to show up in Google and Bing and all the other engines.

124
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.350
You would just put this in here and I'll just put a comment.

125
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.289
Do not index or page.

126
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:42.980
All right.

127
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.410
So that's pretty much it.

128
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.880
I'm going to go ahead and save that.

129
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.560
I'm not going to go over any of the other ones right now because they're really not that important.

130
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.520
If you want to look, look, look up some of the other ones on your own, you can do that.

131
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.120
But I don't want to throw too much stuff at you that you don't really need right now.

132
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.770
So that's it, guys.

133
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:06.230
In the next video, we're going to start to look at typography, look at creating headings and paragraphs

134
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.810
and bolded text and stuff like that.
