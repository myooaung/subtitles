1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,740
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,380
Now I'm going to show you how to take a grid item and span it across multiple rows and columns.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,950
So we're going to create a new file here called zero three, underscore grid, underscore span, HTML.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,990
And let's go ahead and generate our HTML head body tags.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,630
We'll say grid span and style.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:34,350
And as far as the markup, let's just do our parent call it grid and then let's do a class item.

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,870
Just say item money sign and let's do a bunch of them.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,060
So we'll do times 15.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,480
So we have 15 grid items here.

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,850
So let's say grid and display grid.

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:01:01,250
And then I'm going to add grid template columns and I'm going to just do a repeat of four one half hour

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,280
items.

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,260
So we'll save that.

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,370
Let's open it up.

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,720
All right.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,560
It's going to look like that.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm just going to grab the styling of the item from one of the other files just so we can clearly see

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,630
see them as boxes.

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,410
Why is this not copying?

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,910
All right, so save that.

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,420
Good.

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,830
Now, what I want to do is take one of these items.

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,210
We'll take the first one.

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:39,000
And I want to show you how we can span it across across the columns and also down through the rows.

25
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,760
So I want to take this item one and I want to have it go like this, fill up this whole area and basically

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,490
push the rest over so we can do that.

27
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,200
Using I'm going to show you the kind of the long way first and then I'll show you a shorter way.

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,490
So let's first target this first item.

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,880
We could give it a special class, but well, let's just use our pseudo selectors.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
We'll use first child.

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,450
So I'll say class of item.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:16,950
We want the first child and we have a property called Grid Column Start so we can specify where we want

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,960
it to start in terms of the column.

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,630
So it starts at one right now, let's say let's just put it to two and save and you can see that it

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,440
gets pushed over so we can start it wherever we want.

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,950
But I'm going to start it at one and then I'm going to use another property called Grid Column End,

37
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,950
and we can basically tell it where we want it to end.

38
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:47,250
And I'm going to put in here for and you can see what happens is it's spanned across what looks like

39
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,860
three, but what you're going to do is you're going to look at the lines.

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,140
So you have one, two, three, four.

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,240
So if you use this grid column and start and then that's what you're going to look at is you're going

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,680
to count these lines.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,300
Now, we can also go down and that's that's the big difference between the grid and Flexbox or one of

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
them is that you can't do that with Flexbox.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,540
You have your rows and that's it with with the grid.

46
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,250
We can, we can be multi dimensional and we can span this down into the next one.

47
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:30,750
So let's add grid dash, row dash start and we'll start at one, which is where we currently are.

48
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:40,110
And then let's say grid dash row, dash end and let's say we want to end at three and I'm going to save

49
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,440
that.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,700
And now you can see that this is now spanning basically what looks like two rows.

51
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,250
But again, if you look at the lines, it's going from 1 to 3.

52
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,730
Now, this is kind of a long way to do this.

53
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,270
There's a shorter way, much like with many things in CSS.

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,190
So I'm going to comment this out and I'm going to show you how to do the same thing by using the grid

55
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,030
column and the grid row property rather than start an end.

56
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,240
So let's say grid dash column.

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,540
So it's basically just a shortcut and we're going to say start at one and then we want to do a slash

58
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,029
and we want to span three.

59
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,079
So I save that.

60
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,070
You can see it's doing the same thing that these two lines are doing.

61
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,350
And even though I put four here, when I put three, it does the same thing because here we're saying

62
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,460
we want to take we want an item to start at one and go to four.

63
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,360
When here we're saying we're taking item one and spanning it three and item one is here, so we're spanning

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,080
it three.

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:54,000
Now, if we want to go down like we did before, down, down a row, we can do grid row and let's start

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,540
at one and we want to span two and we'll save and we get the same result.

67
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,380
So this is just a shorter way of doing this.

68
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,180
Let's grab another one.

69
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,890
So let's let's get a random one.

70
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,510
We'll just take nine.

71
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,270
So we'll use Nth Child.

72
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:19,680
So we'll say item and let's say ninth child and we'll do nine.

73
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,140
And I want to keep it in its place, but span it across all the way to the end here.

74
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,520
So in terms of columns, it's in the second column, right?

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,580
So we want to do grid dash column and we want to set two.

76
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,340
We want to start at two and then we want to span two.

77
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,740
We'll go ahead and save that.

78
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,150
Actually, I wanted to go all the way over.

79
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,560
So we want to span three.

80
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,550
All right.

81
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,880
And then if we want to span it down, we could do grid row.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,650
And let's start it.

83
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,700
So we're at one, two, three, four.

84
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,830
So let's say start at four and let's span two and save.

85
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,390
And now it gets pushed down.

86
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,230
So, I mean, you can start it wherever you want.

87
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,430
Like we could do grid row two and span two.

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,830
And it's going to get it's going to get pushed up here.

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,640
All right.

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,760
And notice that it's completely out of order.

91
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,740
But you may want that.

92
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,370
You may you may want your markup to be a certain way, but you want to move the the element visually

93
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,380
without changing your markup.

94
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,570
So the grid is good for that as well.

95
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,020
All right.

96
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,670
So in the next video, we're going to take a look at auto fitting and min Max.
