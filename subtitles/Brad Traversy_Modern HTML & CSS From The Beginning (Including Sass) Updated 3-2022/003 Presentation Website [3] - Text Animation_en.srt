1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,810
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,070
So now we've come to the part where we're going to animate the the landing page here a little bit.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,160
Now, what I'd like you guys to do is to to pause the video and try this out.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm going to give you some some some hints on what I'm going to be doing.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:25,620
So if you remember, we have the transform property and we have translate Y and translate X.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,400
And what that does is it brings it from one point to another.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,860
So what I'm going to do is use keyframes and I'm going to initially set I'm going to initially set the

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,230
translate X value of the header to be way up here, basically out of the screen.

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,970
I'm going to set this to be way over here, out of the screen, and then on the on the animation, I

10
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,590
want to set it to come to come to its original spot, which is basically zero.

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,220
All right.

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,070
So if you want to take that information and try this yourself, feel free to do that.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,769
And if you want to pause video and come back.

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,540
So let's go ahead and do this.

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,990
Now, remember, we're only animating page one because we're only using HTML and CSS.

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,250
If you got into JavaScript or jQuery, you could make it.

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,850
So when you hit a certain point, you could animate the next one and the next one, but that's you can't

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,760
really do that with just CSS in this case.

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,480
So we just want the the landing page to animate.

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,300
So remember, it has an ID of page one.

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:40,410
So I'm going to go over here in the CSS and say page animation and we're going to take the ID of page

22
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:55,020
dash one and we want the H one and I'm going to add a transform, oops, transform and then translate.

23
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,890
We want to translate y and we want to set this to be off the page.

24
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,170
So I'm going to do negative and let's do 1200 and save.

25
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,360
Uh.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,130
Wait a minute.

27
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,479
Transform.

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,050
Translate.

29
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,740
Why?

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,510
I forgot pixels.

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,000
So now what happened is we moved it on the y axis.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,960
We moved it up since we did a negative value, 12, 1200 pixels.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,480
So basically it's just up off the page.

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,900
Now you want to make sure you go up high enough.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,020
I think 1200 pixels is is pretty good.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,750
If you don't go up high enough and someone uses it on a very large screen, then they're still going

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,920
to be able to see it.

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,320
So you really have to take that into account.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,310
But I just want to I just want you to know basically how to do this.

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,490
Now we're going to want to animate this.

41
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,980
So let's say animate and let's call this.

42
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,520
We'll just call the animation heading since that's what we're animating.

43
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,570
I'm sorry, not animate animation, so we'll call it heading and then we want the speed.

44
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,970
Now remember we put the speed inside a variable.

45
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,450
So we're going to say speed actually.

46
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:09,990
What do we say?

47
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,160
Animate speed.

48
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,620
Animate speed.

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,160
And then we want forwards because we want it to stay there.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,280
Otherwise it's just going to come down and then it's going to disappear.

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,350
And then let's do an ease.

52
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,760
We'll do an ease in.

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,890
All right.

54
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,560
Now, if I save this, nothing's going to happen because we haven't created the animation or the keyframe,

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,100
I should say.

56
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:42,930
So let's go down here and let's say at Keyframes, and we called it heading.

57
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,020
And this is going to be very simple.

58
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,990
All we need to do is bring it to its original space.

59
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:58,050
So let's grab this and we want to set the translate Y to simply do zero, which is it's a original spot.

60
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,670
Well, I forgot the two.

61
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,590
So we'll move this up into here.

62
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,240
And now let's save.

63
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,260
And there it is.

64
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,700
And that's that's pretty fast.

65
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:25,820
I guess we could change the speed to let's try 2 seconds we save that comes in a little a little slower.

66
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,510
All right.

67
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,090
Now we just need to do the same thing for the paragraph, but we want to do translate X because we're

68
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,380
on the X axis.

69
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,780
So if you couldn't figure it out before, maybe you want to pause the video now and try it out because

70
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,910
we're basically doing the same thing just along the x axis for the paragraph.

71
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:58,100
So I can even copy this and changes to paragraph and let's do translate X and let's do just in case

72
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,400
it's a really wide screen, let's do -1800 pixels and then animation.

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,270
We want to change this to let's call this text.

74
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,950
Now, you could have different speeds for each one if you wanted to, but I'm just going to leave it.

75
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm going to leave at the same speed.

76
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,780
One thing I do want to do, though, is add a delay, because I want the heading to come down and then

77
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,150
the paragraph to come in after.

78
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,680
So let's add a delay of 2 seconds.

79
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,630
We'll see how that does.

80
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,490
And then just down here, we're going to set a new keyframe.

81
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,930
I'm going to copy this and we'll call this text.

82
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,990
And we just want to change this to translate X.

83
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,750
So let's save it, try it out.

84
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,250
So comes in from the top, comes in from the side.

85
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,800
So that's pretty much it.

86
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,540
And you can experiment with it if you want, if you want it to be faster or slower, if you want to,

87
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,770
you know, move it up higher or lower or whatever you want to do is is fine.

88
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,600
And you can also animate other things, like you could change the colors and stuff like that.

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,880
So experiment with it a little bit.

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,540
So last thing I want to do is implement the jQuery scroll because right now it just goes right to the

91
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,160
page, which is fine, but I just want to add that little bit of flair to it.

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:33,140
So let's, let's Google jQuery, jQuery CDN, which is I don't know why I don't just go to code jQuery,

93
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,070
but we're going to choose the minified version here.

94
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm going to grab the script tag and let's put this in the index html.

95
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,830
It's going to go right above the ending body.

96
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,840
And then instead of creating a whole new JavaScript file, I'm just going to put a script tag here and

97
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,770
we're going to add that, that bit of JavaScript here.

98
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,940
So let me just grab that real quick, paste that in and I'm pasting it in because this is not a JavaScript

99
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,420
course.

100
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm not going to get into jQuery and JavaScript and all that stuff, but it's a handy little snippet

101
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
if you want to use it.

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,480
So let's save that.

103
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,070
And we have our animation.

104
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,040
Maybe 2/2 delay is a little too much.

105
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,020
So change that to one.

106
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,880
That's good.

107
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,410
So now when I click the next page, it scrolls down.

108
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,050
All right.

109
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:40,650
And the reason it's doing that is because we're saying for anything with class button on click, we're

110
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:48,300
going to run a function and we're basically going to check the hash which which is the the the ID.

111
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,130
So we're going to check that.

112
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,400
Or I should say right here, it's going to check this and it's going to scroll to that area using the

113
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,570
animate method.

114
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,930
And you can change that speed right here as well.

115
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,950
So if we change this to like 400 and we try, this goes faster.

116
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,700
If we change it to 1400.

117
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,550
Go slower so you can change that to whatever you want.

118
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,320
I think 800 is pretty good, but that's it.

119
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,290
So now we have a nice little presentation website.

120
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,590
And again, if you had some kind of conference, you could use this.

121
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,910
You'd probably want to add some charts and maybe some images and stuff like that.

122
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,110
But this gives you kind of a boilerplate for that type of website.

123
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,380
All right, guys, hopefully you like this little project and that's it.

124
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,730
I'll see you in the next one.
