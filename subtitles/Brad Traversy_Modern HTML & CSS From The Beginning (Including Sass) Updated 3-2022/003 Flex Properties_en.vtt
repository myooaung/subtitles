00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.600
Okay.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.030
So in this video, I want to look at some of the different properties that we have that have to do with

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.930
basically the widths of the flex items.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.460
So I'm going to just keep the same file here, flex basics and work in this file.

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.080
And we have a width of 200 pixels, so each one is set to a specific width.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.450
Let's go ahead and make it so we can target each item in the flex box.

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.140
So we have item one, two and three.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.440
And the first property I want to look at is called flex shrink.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.040
So let's go ahead and actually first I'll just show you I think I already showed you the default behavior

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.290
is just to shrink them all at the same rate.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.490
They're all the same width.

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.570
But let's say this item one here, we actually don't want it to shrink.

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.640
So we could set flex shrink to zero.

14
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.860
And now if I go and I do that same thing, you'll see that the first one stays where it is.

15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.710
It stays at that 200 pixels because it has a flex shrink of zero the other to shrink along with it.

16
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.650
And of course, you could put this on all of them.

17
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.940
In fact, you could put this on this item is on all three of these.

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.630
So now if I make this smaller, none of them are going to shrink.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.310
So that's flex shrink.

20
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.440
I'm going to remove this here.

21
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.960
The next one I want to look at is flex grow.

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.010
So for item two, I'm going to set Flex Grow to, let's say one.

23
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.880
And what that's going to do is fill up the remaining space of the container.

24
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.900
You can see now even if I make this, even if I make this browser super big, you can see it just it

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.400
fills up the rest of the space.

26
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.810
These are 200 pixels.

27
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.300
This is going to take up the remaining space.

28
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.800
And you might just set all of them to flex, flex, grow one.

29
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.850
In fact, if I go to item and say flex grow one, then they're all just going to be even.

30
00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.630
And this is what you might do in many cases when you have layouts where you might have an icon with

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.980
some text and a button custom cards, you might want to just stretch all the way across.

32
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.390
So it's as easy as that.

33
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.530
But I want to show you how you can change the widths of some of these.

34
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.110
So for item three, let's add a flex grow of two.

35
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.730
Now what this is supposed to do is make this one twice the size or width of item two, which is flex

36
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.600
grow one.

37
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.330
And notice that it's not quite twice the size when we're on smaller screens.

38
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.800
And that's because we started with an initial width of 200 pixels.

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.350
So the last property I want to show you in kind of this trio is flex basis.

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.550
Now flex basis is is kind of like setting the width of the item.

41
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:54.420
So if we set flex spaces to zero here and here and I save now notice that this is exactly twice the

42
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.800
size of flex one.

43
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.890
Flex two is twice the size of Flex one.

44
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.930
And it doesn't matter if I make this bigger.

45
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.900
You can see they both stretch, but one is twice the size and the other even if we go down to really

46
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.830
small and of course this is still set to flex shrink zero.

47
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.980
So this just stays at 200 pixels no matter what.

48
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.950
Now you might not see these particular properties written out like this very often because we also have

49
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.580
the flex property which implements all three of these.

50
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:31.500
So up here in the item, let's get rid of the 200 pixels and let's let's comment this out here.

51
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.370
So right now we're back to square one, but let's set the flex property to one.

52
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.150
And just by doing that, it's going to take up the whole width.

53
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.380
Now what this means right now is just flex grow one.

54
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.410
However, we can add shrink end basis as well.

55
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.490
So this can take in three properties or three I should say three values.

56
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.370
So the shrink we can set to zero and then the basis will set to 200 pixels.

57
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.070
So what that's going to do if I save it looks the same.

58
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.850
However, when we get down to 200 pixels, you notice that it doesn't shrink because we have the shrink

59
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.660
set to zero and we have the basis at 200 pixels.

60
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.480
So it's not going to go there, not going to go any smaller than that.

61
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:28.080
So remember flex is grow, shrink and basis, but a lot of the times you're just going to see like flex

62
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.660
one because you won't need the the shrink or anything like that because a lot of times you'll implement

63
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.710
media queries and you'll have them stack on top of each other anyway.

64
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.790
Now if we wanted to have, let's say, item three.

65
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.600
Larger.

66
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.770
We could do Flex two or we could do even flex three, which is going to be three times the size.

67
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.330
So you can change these up so you can create whatever layout you want.

68
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.740
Now, in the next video, I want to get into alignments so we can if we want to move these down here

69
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.180
or move them this way, if they're in a column, things like that.

70
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.060
So we're going to look at properties like align items and justify content and align self.

71
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.830
So we'll get into those next.
