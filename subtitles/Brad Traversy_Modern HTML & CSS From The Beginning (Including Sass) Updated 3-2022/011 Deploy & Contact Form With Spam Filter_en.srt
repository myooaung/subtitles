1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,690
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,920
So our project is now finished, so I want to go ahead and deploy it.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,350
I also want to give functionality to the contact form using net forms.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,060
So I'm in my notify panel.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,830
So you just have to sign up if you don't have an account and then log in and you can do all this for

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,430
free.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,570
And then this is the forms documentation because we want the contact form to actually work.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,580
So there's a few things we need to do.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,390
First, we need to add a method of post and then this data nullify true to our form tags.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:42,480
So I'm just going to grab that and go into our contact page, contact HTML and right here I have the

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,310
form tag we want method equals post and data and PHI equals true.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,370
Now we also want name attributes for each input.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,810
So let's say name.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,700
This is the name field.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,160
Let's do name equals subject.

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,560
Let's do name equals email.

17
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,950
Name equals.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,660
What is this phone?

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,730
And then name equals message.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,740
Now we also want to add some spam filtering with reCAPTCHA.

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,120
So I'm going to go back to the forms documentation and go down.

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,160
Uh, let's see.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,160
We're going to go down to spam filtering.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,590
Honeypot field.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,550
No, we don't want that.

26
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,510
We want this explicit reCAPTCHA.

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,110
So basically, you guys have seen this before and it says, I'm not a robot.

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,430
You have to check it and sometimes you have to do those pictures.

29
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,630
So we want that just to stop spam from from coming in.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,380
So what we have to do is add this attribute data, nullify reCAPTCHA equals true.

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,530
We want to add that to our form tag.

32
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,730
Which is right here.

33
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,770
So I'm going to paste that in.

34
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,790
And then wherever we want to put it, I'm going to go under the text area and I'm going to put a div

35
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,230
with the class of my dash to just to give it some margin around it.

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:25,570
And then we want to grab this this div right here with data recapture.

37
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,380
True.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,100
And I'm going to put that right in there and save.

39
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,710
Now, this won't show until we deployed a PHI because the platform looks at these attributes and then

40
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,080
puts in the reCAPTCHA.

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,340
And I believe that's all we have to do here.

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,820
Ajax form submissions.

43
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,020
Yeah.

44
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,380
So we should be okay.

45
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,840
Now we have to upload this to GitHub or we have to push to GitHub.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:03,960
So I'm going to go to GitHub dot com and I'm going to create a new repository.

47
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,810
I'm just going to call this portfolio underscore website.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,010
I'm actually going to make this private, but you can do public if you want.

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,000
We'll just say.

50
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,240
Portfolio website.

51
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,110
And let's go ahead and create repository.

52
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,960
So now I have an empty repository.

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,320
So we want to go back into our project and I'm going to just use the integrated terminal down here.

54
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,550
But before I do anything with Git, I'm going to add in a file in my root here.

55
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,390
New file, I'm going to call it Dot get ignore.

56
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,480
And what this does is it allows you to specify files and folders that you don't want to push to GitHub.

57
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,440
Now we installed Node SAS, which is located in this Node Modules folder.

58
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,940
You don't want to push this node modules folder.

59
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,490
This is just dependencies of your project.

60
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:12,530
If someone wants to use your project, they'll pull it from GitHub and they'll run NPM install, which

61
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,380
will look at any packages you have such as Node SAS, and it will then create the Node modules folder

62
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,329
with those dependencies.

63
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,150
So we don't want to push the node modules folder.

64
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,470
So we're just going to put in here node underscore modules and save.

65
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:37,100
And I do want to push the dist, I want the, the sass and that's that should be it.

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,930
So we just want the node modules not to be committed.

67
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:48,020
So now let's initialize a git repository with get init and make sure you have git installed if you don't

68
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,580
go to get dash sim dot com and install it.

69
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,160
So we initialize our get repository.

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,040
Now let's do git add all.

71
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,100
Okay.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
So now it's added to our local repository.

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
Let's commit it.

74
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,740
So get commit and we want to do dash m and then a comment.

75
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,610
I'm just going to say initial commit.

76
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,900
So it added it committed it to our local repository.

77
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,560
Now we want to add our GitHub repository as the remote repository that we want to use, which is this

78
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,490
line right here.

79
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,650
So you want to grab that and paste that in and run it.

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,520
So now that's added as our remote repository.

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,120
And then the last thing we want to do is this last line which is get push dash u origin master.

82
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
So we want to push to the master branch.

83
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:52,850
So clear this up and I'll say get push dash u origin master.

84
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,790
Okay.

85
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,320
So it's just pushing it to the remote repository.

86
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,850
Now, if I go back and I reload this page, you'll see that our project is now uploaded to GitHub.

87
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,660
I probably should have put this DZ store file in the git ignore as well, but that's fine.

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,860
All right.

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,550
So the project we want to deploy is in the dist.

90
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,840
This is what we want on net fi.

91
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,470
So when we deploy to nullify, we want to specify this as our build folder.

92
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:34,090
So now let's head over to Fi and I'm going to say new site from get GitHub.

93
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,380
And I'm going to search for portfolio.

94
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:43,970
Okay.

95
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,200
Let's see.

96
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,720
Portfolio website and the branch I want to deploy.

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,850
I only have one branch which is master.

98
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,360
Now the published directory is going to be DIST and it even says right here some examples are dist public

99
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,750
site.

100
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,150
So we want to do DIST because that has the HTML and our compiled CSS.

101
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,880
So let's go ahead and say deploy site.

102
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,940
Site deploy in progress.

103
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,100
So it should just take a second.

104
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,830
There we go.

105
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,330
So now we have our domain here.

106
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,380
So I'm going to go ahead and open this up and there we go.

107
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,380
And you can see we have a subdomain of nullify, but we could easily set up a custom domain.

108
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,750
I'm not going to do that in this video, though, but let's make sure that, first of all, all of our

109
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,890
pages show which they do that loads kind of slow.

110
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,230
Well, that's slow.

111
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,000
And you know why?

112
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,470
Because the images are so big, so the first load is a little slow.

113
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,550
So if you're going to actually use this as a production project, you probably want to resize these

114
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,340
images because these are really, really big images.

115
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,450
And I didn't I didn't optimize them at all.

116
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,670
So contact.

117
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,980
You can see we have a little reCAPTCHA here.

118
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,210
Let's go ahead and try this out.

119
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,700
So I'll say.

120
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,980
Kevin Smith Email address.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,210
Kevin Subject We'll just say hello.

122
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,130
Phone number.

123
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,230
Hello.

124
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,420
This is a test.

125
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,620
I'm not a robot and submit.

126
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,700
Thank you.

127
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,350
Let's go back to our site.

128
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,890
Now, if we go back to our notify panel and let's reload this page.

129
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,590
And go down here.

130
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,850
There's our form submission.

131
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,900
Kevin Smith.

132
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,910
Name subject.

133
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,390
Hello.

134
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,820
Email, phone and message.

135
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,780
So we have a fully working site that we built with SAS, that we deployed with working contact form

136
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,240
that has spam filtering.

137
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,850
And of course you could add any fields you want.

138
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:09,930
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this project and learned a lot from it and hopefully you'll use it in

139
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,430
your career and in your life.

140
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,470
So thank you so much for watching, guys.

141
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,670
I really appreciate it.

142
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:22,800
And I will see you in the wrap up video that we deployed with working contact form that has spam filtering.

143
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,410
And of course, you can add any fields you want.

144
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:32,490
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this project and learned a lot from it and hopefully you'll use it in

145
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,990
your career and in your life.

146
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,060
So thank you so much for watching, guys.

147
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,230
I really appreciate it.

148
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,600
And I will see you in the wrap up video.
