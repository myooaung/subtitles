1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,540
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,720
So we've completed our initial age, HTML and CSS, but I want to just add a little bit of JavaScript

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,370
here to make this dynamic.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,430
So we're going to add some lines of JavaScript in a in a JS file, and then we're going to edit the

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,050
CSS a little bit because we need to kind of change how this works.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,650
Basically what we need to do is check to see as we scroll down, we need to fire off an event that's

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,800
going to check to see if a certain list, item, certain box here is actually in the viewport.

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,630
So right now, put the python.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,930
One is not in the viewport, but when I scroll down it starts to enter.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:44,340
It is now when it hits that point, we want this to basically just come in, fade in from the right

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,990
or from the left on this side.

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,090
And the way that we're going to do that is with JavaScript, we're going to add dynamically add a class

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,560
called show, which will add a transform to to bring it in.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,890
We're going to initially hide these things at first, and then the show class will allow them to basically

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,970
animate in.

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,900
So let's create a new file called Main JS the JavaScript file, and I'm going to paste this code in.

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,790
And again, this is not a JavaScript course, so I'm not going to explain every single line here.

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,110
But basically what's going on is we're grabbing on to all the timeline list items.

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,370
So basically each of these and we're putting it in a variable called items.

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,170
And then down here we have a function called run which is looping through those items.

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,920
So it's going through each one and it's checking to see if it's in the viewport.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,080
That's what this function does right here.

23
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,190
And if it is in the viewport, it's going to add the class of show.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,030
All right.

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,530
So that's exactly what this does.

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,340
It loops through all of these list items, checks to see if it's in the viewport.

27
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,680
If it is, it adds the class of show.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,290
Now, down here, we're just firing it off.

29
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,050
We're firing off this run when the page loads.

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,630
So when the page loads, if anything is in the viewport, it's going to just slide in also on resize.

31
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,830
So if we resize the browser, it'll run and then if we scroll it'll also run.

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,570
So every time something enters the viewport it should add the class of show.

33
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,440
Now that's all JavaScript is doing is adding this, this class of show.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,330
We have to handle the rest of it in the CSS so you can see all they work together.

35
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,390
So let's save this file and let's go to index HTML and make sure we include it and JavaScript files

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,430
for 99% of the time.

37
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,700
You want to include them at the bottom of the page, right above the body.

38
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,980
So we're going to put a script tag and we're going to add a source attribute pointing to main JS and

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,880
we'll save.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,570
Now, nothing is going to happen yet because all we've done is included the JavaScript.

41
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,270
But I can show you if we open up our chrome tools here, let's actually just make this bigger.

42
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,710
Now I want to show you what the JavaScript file is actually doing.

43
00:02:52,710 --> 00:03:00,360
So I'm going to go to Elements and if we look at our you'll notice that these lines all have a class

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,170
of show.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,080
So even though this this fourth one here is in the viewport, it's, it's, it has to be fully in the

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,590
viewport.

47
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,540
So if I scroll down a little bit as soon as it's fully in the viewport, notice that the class of show

48
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,440
got added.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,070
If I keep scrolling as soon as the next one is fully in the viewport, just watch over here on the right.

50
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,940
Keep scrolling.

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,050
There's that one.

52
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,980
That one.

53
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,670
So it's just.

54
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,290
It's just adding that class of show to the document object model.

55
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,300
So it's adding that class to the lie.

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,850
And that's exactly what we want the JavaScript to do.

57
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,190
Now we have to handle the rest in CSS.

58
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,240
So let's jump over to Styles CSS.

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,240
And I'm going to add a couple of things in a few places.

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,890
So I mean, by default, we don't want this stuff to show unless the class of show is added to it.

61
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,220
Right.

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,130
So let's go to the div.

63
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:11,910
So this box is the ul ly div and we want to add on here a visibility of hidden and then we want to also

64
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,150
add an opacity value of zero.

65
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,660
Now when I save this and we go back, everything disappears, which is what we want because we're going

66
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,000
to make it so they only show if the class of show is on them, which they are right now.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,600
But we haven't added the rest of the the CSS that we need.

68
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,540
So right here.

69
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,320
For the the right side and the left side.

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,060
We actually want to have these pushed over a little bit.

71
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,770
So actually, I'm going to comment what we just did out these two lines for a second, because I do

72
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,540
want these to show I'm going to just close this up so we can see both at the same time.

73
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,030
So we'll go like right here.

74
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,140
All right.

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,780
Now for the left and right.

76
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,610
We want these to come in.

77
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,140
This will come in this way.

78
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,280
This will come in this way.

79
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,210
So I'm going to add an initial transform value.

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
Of translate.

81
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:18,400
And we want to say we want to we want to do 200 pixels on the x axis.

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,480
I guess we could do translate x, but we'll just do it this way.

83
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,180
So translate on the x axis, 200 pixels.

84
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,580
Now, if I save this.

85
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,440
Over here, you can see that this is now pushed over 200 pixels.

86
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,400
And we want to go to the left side and we're going to paste this in same thing, except we're going

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,000
to do -200 pixels because we want it to be pulled over that way.

88
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,260
Now, once the show class hits, we want these to come in.

89
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,830
So basically, we want them to go to transform, transform, translate zero to bring them back.

90
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,440
So let's add the show class.

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
We'll go.

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,790
I guess we'll go right.

93
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,860
We'll go at the bottom here and we'll say show boxes.

94
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:13,360
We want to grab the timeline ul lie with the class of show and then the div.

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,050
Remember, the div is what is is the box really.

96
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,020
So we want to set transform.

97
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,030
To none.

98
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,110
Okay, because we set the transform to be offset on each side initially.

99
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,010
But as soon as they're shown, we want them to come in to transform none, which would just be set them

100
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,040
to their their natural spot.

101
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,600
So if I save this and I reload, you can see that the ones that have the class of show are coming in.

102
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,740
Now we want to make these disappear.

103
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,350
So let's go back up to the visibility in opacity and let's uncomment that.

104
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,830
So now if we save that, everything should disappear.

105
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:07,740
But if we go back down to the show, we want to set the visibility to.

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,550
Visible.

107
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:16,780
We also want to set the opacity to one which is which is just solid opaque.

108
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,650
All right.

109
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,090
So let's save this.

110
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,790
And now remember the when the page loads, the first three already have the class of show because they're

111
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,480
in the viewport.

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,610
And then I'm going to scroll down a little bit.

113
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,640
And as soon as the Ruby on Rails one gets in the viewport, it slides in.

114
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,990
Next one slides in.

115
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,310
Next one slides in.

116
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,930
So what's all that's going on with the JavaScript is it's adding the class of show.

117
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,190
And then in the CSS we're saying, you know, initially make everything disappear.

118
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:52,620
But as soon as that show is added to the to the DOM here to the list item, we want that div to transform

119
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,800
non meaning come back to its original spot and also display with the visibility visible and opacity

120
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,340
one.

121
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,880
Now the last thing I want to do is I want these dots here to be white by default.

122
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,130
And then as soon as the show class is comes in, then it will be blue.

123
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,360
So let's go up to where we created the dot, which is right here.

124
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:24,180
We used ly after and we created the 25 pixel height with border radius 50% and we have the background

125
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,890
set to the secondary color.

126
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:33,120
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this background secondary color and then change this one

127
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,070
to just inherit.

128
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,700
So if I save that now, they're going to be white.

129
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:50,350
But down here let's go right under where we put the the light show div and we're going to do timeline

130
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,190
ul ly dot show and remember the after.

131
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,510
That's where the dot is.

132
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,160
So we're going to do after and then we'll paste in the background secondary color.

133
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:10,330
So this dot is going to get the background of the secondary color when the show class is added.

134
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,680
So let's save.

135
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,470
And now you can see that the first three are blue.

136
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,120
This one down here is white, but as soon as it comes in, it turns blue.

137
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,510
All right.

138
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,710
So that's going to be it, guys.

139
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:27,370
Hopefully you enjoyed this little project here and learn quite a bit about CSS and transitions and how

140
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,840
to integrate it with JavaScript.

141
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,140
And don't worry if you don't understand every line of the JavaScript.

142
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,580
Basically though, it's just looking to see if an element, if a list item is in the viewport.

143
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,590
If it is, it's adding a class of show.

144
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,240
That's all the script is doing.

145
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:40,810
All right.

146
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,620
So that's it.

147
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,140
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
