1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,450
All right.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,210
So we've built a couple of small projects on our local machine.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,110
Now I want to start looking at how to actually get a website online.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,220
And we talked a little bit about this in the beginning of the course, you're usually going to register

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,680
a domain name and then buy some kind of hosting account, although many hosting accounts do include

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,850
a free domain name.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,860
So in this video, I just want to go over the different types of hosting there are as well as the pricing

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,520
points.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,010
So these are the most common types of hosting we have shared hosting veeps, which is a virtual private

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,800
server, dedicated server reseller hosting, cloud hosting and static hosting.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,250
So we're going to go over each of these and talk about what they are.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,360
So aside from from free tiers of static hosting, which I'll get to in a bit, shared hosting is definitely

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,110
the cheapest, ranging from around $3 to $15 per month, although a lot of times you'll have to pay

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,860
by the year.

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,300
So it'll be around 70 bucks, 70 to 100 bucks a year, which isn't bad.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,750
And shared.

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:05,489
Hosting means that you get one of many accounts on the same server and on the same operating system

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,970
environment, and this is suitable for most small websites.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,520
So anything that we build in this course would be just fine on a shared host in terms of data and size,

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,830
however, they usually restrict bandwidth.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,010
So if you have a site where you're expecting tens of thousands of users every day, it's probably not

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,550
the best thing you probably want to go with with something of a higher tier.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,540
But if it's some local business, like a flower shop or something like that, in most cases it's going

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,140
to be fine.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,350
I built websites for local businesses for a long time and I would say 90% of them use the shared web

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,010
host.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,390
So this is definitely where you're going to want to start, I should say probably where you're going

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,530
to start or maybe static hosting, which I'll get to in a little bit.

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,120
And this is this is what we'll be doing in this section.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,120
We're going to set up a shared host shared host account with In Motion, which is a great service,

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,790
great company that I've used for years.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,180
Now.

33
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,890
Most of these these types of accounts are managed and they include email servers.

34
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,860
So you'll be able to set up your email with your domain name.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,700
You get a control panel to view analytics, create FTP accounts, you can upload files, you can even

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,080
create databases.

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,150
A lot of them come with like one click installs for things like WordPress.

38
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,790
So shared hosting is great for small local businesses and like I said, I suggest in motion.

39
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,800
But there's also HostGator, Bluehost, these these are some other companies that I've worked with that

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,060
are really good as well.

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,320
All right.

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,610
So next up, we have VPNs or virtual private server.

43
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,010
And this is a step up from shared hosting.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,020
You're going to get a it's basically an account that's on a physical machine, but it's a virtualized

45
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,010
environment.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,280
So with shared hosting, you have the same environment.

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,130
You just have different accounts on a veeps.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,380
You have you have less people on the same server and they're all their own environments.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,350
So it's more secure, you know, it's less prone to issues from other accounts, things like that.

50
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,500
You also get much more access with a shared account.

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,490
You usually can't log in through SSH or through the shell as a route user and with a veeps you have

52
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,540
much more control.

53
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,970
You can log in as route, you can install things, and these range from usually range from about 20

54
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,710
to $100 per month.

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,890
And obviously different packages have different disk space and bandwidth restrictions just like a shared

56
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,230
host, a VP is great.

57
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,540
If you plan on having more than one website, you can actually create your own smaller shared accounts

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,620
with their own separate control panels, and you could even sell shared accounts.

59
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,460
But a reseller is better for that, which I'll talk about next.

60
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,140
So a reseller account is very similar to a veeps.

61
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,590
It's except it's more geared towards reselling shared hosting to third parties.

62
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,610
So you'll basically get a panel where you can create and terminate shared accounts and you can sell

63
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,490
those to to users on your website.

64
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:17,880
And most reseller packages come bundled with a piece of software called W.H CMS, which is used for

65
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,630
billing.

66
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,030
You can actually make it so when a user pays through the system, which you can integrate into your

67
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,690
website, a new account gets set up on your reseller server and then they'll get sent an email and they'll

68
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,220
be able to log in and all this.

69
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,790
I actually did this for about three or four years when I had my web dev company, but I wouldn't suggest

70
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,400
doing it unless unless you really know what you're doing.

71
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,210
You know, you need to really know about things like DNS and and DevOps and stuff like that.

72
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:49,880
All right.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,430
So a dedicated server is an actual physical machine sitting in a data center that you rent out.

74
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,940
So as opposed to just basically having an account on a server with other people, you, you actually

75
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,080
not own but rent the machine and these are definitely the most expensive.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,230
They range anywhere from 100, which is very, very cheap.

77
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:15,290
You're lucky to find a dedicated server for 100 bucks to 400 and even more than that.

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,070
Now, these are great for large sites and applications that are going to have tons of users.

79
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,810
You get full freedom.

80
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,620
You can usually install whatever operating system you want, stuff like that.

81
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,800
Most likely Linux, Linux rules, the hosting world.

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,080
So most of the time your servers will run Linux some some distribution of Linux.

83
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,570
The downside is they're much harder to manage.

84
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:45,650
And in most cases you'll probably have like a designated DevOps person on a team managing a dedicated

85
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,310
server.

86
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,870
All right.

87
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,430
So next is cloud hosting.

88
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,540
And this is more for web applications, more so than just static websites.

89
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,780
So if you build something like a social network or an E commerce site using a language like Python,

90
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,910
PHP or something like Node.js, cloud hosting is great for that.

91
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,910
It's basically having multiple servers working together and it's extremely powerful and scalable.

92
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,660
Digital Ocean is one of my favorite providers for this.

93
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,380
The downside is you have to know a lot to manage cloud hosting.

94
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,670
You need to know a bunch of Linux terminal commands.

95
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:28,520
You need to know how to set up things like Engine X servers, firewalls, and it gets really, really

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,900
advanced and way beyond, you know, what we're doing in this course.

97
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,430
All right.

98
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,680
So lastly, we have static hosting, which is fairly new and a good example of this is NetFlow Phi and

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,940
GitHub pages.

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,890
We're actually going to be deploying to Net Phi a little later, which is a fantastic service.

101
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,900
They offer hosting, but they also have additional features like serverless functions if you want to

102
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,650
add some dynamic functionality and also contact form submission, which is really cool and they're used

103
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:04,480
for both front end applications and static websites, including sites that want to have backend services.

104
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,000
NetFlow find GitHub pages, both have free tiers.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,640
So if you just want to host your site without having the bells and whistles of a control panel, you

106
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,480
know, email and all that, you can do that for free.

107
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,230
But if you I mean, you could still have email on that domain.

108
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,750
You'll just most likely have to have it connected to some other service, some kind of email service.

109
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:34,280
Now, you will need to know at least the basics of Git, which is a version control system to deploy

110
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,830
to either nullify or GitHub pages.

111
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,720
But we're going to do that later.

112
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,820
I'm going to teach you some of the basic commands, and it's really not that difficult.

113
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,810
All right.

114
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,870
So for now, what we're going to do is jump in and we're going to upload our Edge Ledger website to

115
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,450
In Motion hosting to a shared account.

116
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,730
And it'll show you how to create FTP, how to upload your files and all that good stuff.
