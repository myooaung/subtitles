1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,720
Okay.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,550
So now that we've done the home page, the about page, now we just have the contact.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,640
So I'm going to copy everything on the about page.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,210
It makes sense to to copy the about page because it has the nav bar without the showcase and stuff like

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,750
that.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:26,100
So let's jump over to contact HTML and paste that in and let's just change the title to contact and

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:35,520
let's take the class of Current off of a boat and let's put that on to contact and then we can get rid

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,380
of everything down to the footer.

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,450
And we'll save and then we'll go to contact and we should see this.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,230
Now, one thing that we need to grab is the font awesome link to this font, awesome CSS because we

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,270
are actually using icons here.

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,390
So from the index page in the head, I'm going to grab the link for font.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,140
Awesome.

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,190
So this right here, I'm going to copy that and bring that over to contact.

15
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,860
Put it right above our link to our style sheet.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,030
And that should be good.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,230
So now let's go down below the header and we'll start to create our form.

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:28,220
So let's put in our section and we'll give it an ID of contact dash form and I'm going to give it our

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,400
padding class, our p-3 class and let's add a container.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,650
Push everything to the middle.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,450
Let's put an H one.

22
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,120
Let's use a class ll heading class.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,970
So you see how we keep reusing these classes.

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,600
That's, that's the idea of a class and ID is more for identifying a section like we're doing here.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,360
So hopefully that that starts to really make sense.

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:02,630
So this, this h one is going to say contact us, but I want the word contact to be that, that primary

27
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,020
color.

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:14,210
So we're going to put in a whoops, we want to put in a span with a class of text dash primary and we

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,520
just want to put this span on the other side of contact.

30
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:30,590
And then below the H one, we're going to put a paragraph and just say, please fill out the form below

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,810
to contact us.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,500
We'll save that should look like that.

33
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,840
And then we're going to create our form.

34
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,390
So the form will, will go somewhere.

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,550
I mean, we'll just put like process dot up for now for the action.

36
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,060
But it's not we're not actually handling the submission right now.

37
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,330
And for the fields, we're going to have a name, email and message and I'm going to wrap the label

38
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,190
and input inside of a div with the class of form dash group.

39
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:12,680
So inside the form group we'll have the label, the for attribute will say name, name, and then under

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,940
that we'll have an input.

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:23,360
So let's give it a type of text and the name will be name ID will also be name, and then we'll have

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,410
another form group.

43
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:33,350
Actually, we can probably just copy this div, paste that in and this will be the email.

44
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,720
So for email we'll change the type to email.

45
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:48,870
That and the ID and then we'll have one more, which is going to be the message.

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,970
So paste that in and change this to message

47
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,020
message.

48
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,410
Let's take this another little little trick here.

49
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,330
Keyboard shortcut.

50
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,070
If you want to highlight something without the mouse, you can hold shift and I'll hit the back arrow

51
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,240
and you see how it's highlight.

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:16,649
If I go the other way, it'll highlight it so I can highlight name and then do a controlled DX to choose

53
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,420
the next version of name.

54
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,700
And I'm going to change it to message.

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,960
Except we want this to be a text area, not an input.

56
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,830
So I'll just take this and change it to text area and text areas have a closing tag.

57
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,630
So we just need to add that in there.

58
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,910
All right, so that looks good.

59
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,620
And then we just want our submit button.

60
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:48,490
So we're going to go below this last div here with still within the form we'll do button and remember

61
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,840
our class of BTN.

62
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:58,780
We want to use that on this button and we just want to give it a type as well of submit type equals,

63
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,020
submit and let's say submit for the text.

64
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,000
Go ahead and save.

65
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,870
Take a look.

66
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,670
It looks absolutely horrible.

67
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,610
So we have to add our styling.

68
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,280
So let's go to our style CSS.

69
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:24,670
I'm actually going to make this smaller so we can see it and we'll go below our testimonials, let's

70
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,100
say contact form.

71
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,020
So an ID of contact form, that's our section.

72
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,270
And then let's style the form group which wraps the label and the input.

73
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,990
And I just want to do a margin bottom just to push each field down.

74
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,910
So we'll do 20 pixels.

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,100
All right, then we'll do the label.

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:56,230
So contact dash form label and we want that to be display block so that it pushes on to the next line.

77
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,190
And then let's do a margin bottom of five pixels.

78
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,930
We'll save that.

79
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,500
Good.

80
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,990
Now let's do the input and the text area.

81
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,440
So contact form input.

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,560
We also want to do contact form, text area.

83
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,830
And let's put this on a separate line just to make it a little neater.

84
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,830
And we want a width of 100%.

85
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,040
We want it to go all the way across, save that, let's add some padding to make them thicker.

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,800
So we'll do ten pixels on all sides.

87
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,630
Let's do a border.

88
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,290
Notice the message has a thicker or a darker border.

89
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,940
We want them all to match.

90
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,740
So we'll do one pixel.

91
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,690
Let's do DX and solid and save.

92
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,280
Now the text area.

93
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,890
I actually want to be a little bigger.

94
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:58,000
I want to increase the height, so I'm going to take just the text area selector here and just set a

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,440
height of 200 pixels like that.

96
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,620
And notice that our button looks just like the other links that have the BTN class.

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:16,630
All right, now I want to show you guys that you see, when I when I click on one of these, it has

98
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,860
the blue outline.

99
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,410
We can actually change that color if we want.

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,780
This is something I haven't gone over yet.

101
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,410
So these are these are the focus states of these inputs.

102
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:35,410
So I'm going to actually copy this that the input and the text area selectors and I'm just going to

103
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,200
add on this pseudo selector of focus.

104
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:50,290
So we want to say in the focus state we want to set the outline to none and we want to set the border.

105
00:07:52,510 --> 00:08:01,870
Color to that f right here f7c, z, 08a and save.

106
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,750
And now when I, when I click on one of these, you'll see that the outline is that same color.

107
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,440
So we can target that focus state and style it how we want.

108
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:21,040
So the next part we have is the, the, this part right here with the icons and this is going to resemble

109
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,360
the boxes on the home page.

110
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,670
We're actually going to use the box class.

111
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,900
So let's head over to contact HTML and let's create our section.

112
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,840
So we'll call this, we'll give it an ID of contact dash info

113
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,110
and I want this to have a dark background.

114
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,990
So we're actually going to also add the class.

115
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:56,260
Let's do class equals BG dash dark and inside the section we'll put our container and let's add our

116
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,800
boxes.

117
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,580
Now I'm actually going to copy from the index HTML.

118
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,100
Let's grab those, those boxes.

119
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:09,190
So let's see under features we have the div class box so we have three of these.

120
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:16,240
Let's grab all three, all these divs and we'll bring them to the contact, paste them right in there

121
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,470
and we're going to change great location to just location.

122
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,300
We're going to keep the same same icon, the hotel icon.

123
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,560
But I want to change this paragraph to be the actual location.

124
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,250
So we'll say 50 Main Street, Boston, Mass.

125
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:42,280
And the next one here, I'm going to change the the icon to a phone icon, which is going to be a phone.

126
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,830
And you can look up all these classes at font.

127
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,220
Awesome.

128
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,620
We're going to change this to phone or phone number.

129
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,380
And inside the paragraph, let's put a fake phone number.

130
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,490
We'll say 617555.

131
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,960
We'll just do all fives.

132
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,370
And then this last one, I want it to be the email.

133
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:15,730
So there's actually an icon called F a dash envelope and we'll change this h three to email address.

134
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,380
And then let's just add in a fake email address here.

135
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:28,570
We'll do like front desk at let's do hotel B t.co.

136
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,090
All right.

137
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,410
So we'll save that.

138
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,780
Now, these boxes actually have the the BG light.

139
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,680
BG primary.

140
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,760
We want to get rid of those because we want it to be just dark behind all of them.

141
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,690
So I'm going to get rid of that.

142
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:50,890
BG Primary, get rid of that class, but make sure you keep the box class and save.

143
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,420
And there we go.

144
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,620
Let's make this a little bigger.

145
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,180
Make sure it looks okay.

146
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,680
And that's our contact page.

147
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,780
So that's it, guys.

148
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,820
Our project is complete.

149
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,820
We have our little hotel website and hopefully you learned quite a bit from this project, especially

150
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,170
if you're brand new to HTML and CSS.

151
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,950
Hopefully you can see now how things come together because I know with the sandbox sections we just

152
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,980
kind of looked at at individual parts of HTML, CSS, and now we're actually putting it all together

153
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,120
to build something.

154
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,030
So what I'd like to start to do now that you know the basics, you know, HTML and the basics of CSS,

155
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:37,780
I'd like to get into more modern parts of CSS like media queries for responsive design, the grid system,

156
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,980
Flexbox.

157
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,620
Later on we'll get into like transitions and animation and then of course deploying a website.

158
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,880
So we have quite, quite a bit to do.

159
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,320
All right.

160
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,400
So that's it, though.

161
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,190
At least now, you know, HTML, you know the basics of CSS and we're ready to dive in more.
