1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,670
So before we jump in and we start writing our HTML and CSS for this project, I just want to talk a

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,460
little bit about design and ideas.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,070
So it really depends.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,830
Sometimes you'll get a job as a front end developer and you'll have a designer on your team that will

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,830
create the UI and create the designs and then hand them off to you.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,670
So usually it'll be like maybe a Photoshop file or a sketch file illustrator or some kind of graphic

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,810
design program.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,520
And then it's your job to take that design and use HTML and CSS and possibly some JavaScript to recreate

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,000
that.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,260
So, so that it actually runs in the browser as a website or a web app.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,910
Now, a lot of the times you don't have the luxury of having a designer.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,560
You'll have to actually create everything, come up with the ideas on your own, especially if you're

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,450
doing freelancing where you do absolutely everything.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:59,160
So what I usually do is I look at other websites and other themes for inspiration, and a good way to

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,230
do that is to search like theme sites.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,099
So, for instance, Bootstrap has a lot of really nice themes.

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,570
Bootstrap is actually a framework in each HTML, CSS framework.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,720
I have an entire course in bootstrap if you want to learn more about it.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,960
But let's say we search for bootstrap themes and there's going to be all types of sites that have different

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,890
themes.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,270
Let's just go to this one here.

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,160
Themes dot get bootstrap and we can go down here and you can see some examples.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,720
Some of them are websites and some are like admin interfaces like this.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
That's not really what we're interested right now.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,930
But let's take this site, for example, and this is actually selling for $50.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,910
And that's another idea for you guys.

28
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,500
If you get good at this after this course and you can create some decent layouts, you can actually

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,760
sell them online.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,220
But most of these sites have a live preview.

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,600
So let's take a look at that.

32
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,040
So what I would do is I would take a look at this layout and I would just get some ideas.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,260
So look at the header, look at how things are laid out, how the logo looks, the background image.

34
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,540
Okay.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,890
So that's that's really the, the what's popular right now is to have the main large image with just

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,110
a little bit of text and maybe some buttons.

37
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,850
And then underneath that, have some boxes and you'll see that over and over.

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,710
And that's really what's in right now.

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:21,770
It's to keep it very clean, you know, not not crazy colours, just maybe, you know, two, two or

40
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,520
maybe three colours with some light greys and and some dark colours.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,800
But it's pretty simple.

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,340
And down here we have some demo pages like the services page, which again we just have a large background

43
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,560
with some, with some text over it.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,830
If we go down we have three boxes with some icons.

45
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,040
So icons are really big down here.

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,340
You can see just have some text, some images laid out.

47
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,540
There's some animation in this theme, but of course you don't need to add the animation.

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm actually not a fan of a lot of animation and again, just icons in text, just like we have right

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,810
here.

50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,760
So you'll see this over and over.

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,000
So just go to different theme sites and get some ideas, get some inspiration and don't copy them.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,790
I'm not saying just, you know, take exactly what they did and redo it, but take in some of the ideas

53
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,840
from maybe four or five different themes and create something of your own.

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,950
So that's what I do.

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,040
That's how I create my websites and user interfaces.

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm far from a graphic designer, but I think I have at least some some eye for design.

57
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,350
And it's not that hard.

58
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,800
Just take some some examples for inspiration.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,220
All right.

60
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,760
So that's it.

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,060
I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about that before we get started.

62
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,510
So in the next video, we're going to start to write our HTML.
