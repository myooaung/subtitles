1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,019
So in the last video we started the about page.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,510
So now we're going to move on to the progress section of the about page, which goes underneath this

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,470
info section.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:18,330
So let's go to the about HTML and go down below the last section.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,200
We'll say section B, which is the progress bars.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,210
So this is basically like level of skill for four different technologies or topics, whatever it may

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:33,720
be.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:41,820
So let's do section, we'll call this A boat dash B and I want this to have a dark background.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,030
So I'm going to add the class of BG Dash Dock and p-3.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:01:00,480
So let's do class container and H two with the class of section, dash title and let's say technical

12
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,750
skills.

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,600
And we're going to do the bottom line.

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,350
Oops go under that neath that.

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,020
So each progress bar we're going to have an H for for each skill label.

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:27,610
So let's say photography do photography colon and then under the H for let's do a class of progress.

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,770
Now within this progress class, we're going to have a DIV and I'm actually going to use inline style

18
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,990
here because we need to set the width.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,280
So the style is going to be basically how how full the progress bar is going to be.

20
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,410
I'm going to say for this, it's going to be 100%.

21
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,350
So 100% full for photography.

22
00:01:51,560 --> 00:02:00,440
Now let's copy the H four along with the div here and let's do two, three, four, five, six.

23
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,840
So the next one after photography, let's do Adobe Photoshop.

24
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,720
And for that, let's do 80%.

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:12,890
Okay.

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,410
And then for this one, let's do Adobe Illustrator.

27
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,790
And of course, you can change these up.

28
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,720
I just basically just thought of these randomly.

29
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:36,340
So let's do 70% and then let's do HTML and CSS.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,670
Let's do 100% for that.

31
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,260
Let's do WordPress.

32
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:58,300
So WordPress will say 80% and then let's do Magento, which is an E commerce platform and we'll do 70%.

33
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,860
So if we were to take a look at this, you'll see that we just have we have a dark background and we

34
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,630
just have each label.

35
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,390
So let's go into our main dot success and it's up to you.

36
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,760
You could see the progress bars, I guess could be a utility if you wanted to use them other places.

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,250
But I'm just going to I don't plan on using them anywhere else, so I'm just going to put them in the

38
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,190
about Dash B section.

39
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,720
So I'm going to go under the Dash A here, which ends right here.

40
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:39,740
Say about B, we'll label this one as well.

41
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:57,100
So we'll do Ampersand B and then we want the progress class and I'm going to set the overflow to hidden

42
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,110
so that it stays contained.

43
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,370
And let's set a height of 20 pixels.

44
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:12,850
And then the background is the background is going to be the medium color, which is a gray.

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,490
Now the div inside of it with the style, with the percentage, with the width, with the percentage

46
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,459
is going to be the main color.

47
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,340
However, the empty progress bar is going to be the medium color.

48
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,860
And then I just want rounded edges.

49
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,640
So I'm going to do a border radius of five pixels and then let's do a margin bottom just to push them

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,390
down.

51
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,790
So we'll do 0.3 REM.

52
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,580
Now we want to focus on the div inside.

53
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,350
So we want to be within the progress style here and then add in our div.

54
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,450
So this is remember, this is the one with the the style, with the width.

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
We want the height of this to be 100%.

56
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,140
So it fills up, you know, vertically.

57
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:07,420
And I'm going to set the color to white in case we put any text in there and let's do a text, a line

58
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:15,250
center, and then we want to set the background color, which will actually be the color of the progress.

59
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,490
So I'm going to set that to the main color.

60
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,540
All right.

61
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,560
So we'll save that.

62
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,350
We'll take a look and there we go.

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,750
So that looks pretty good.

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,870
Let's add a little more to the margin bottom.

65
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,690
We'll do like 60.6.

66
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,340
Push it down a little more.

67
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,580
And that's how we can create progress bars.

68
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,880
So pretty easy.

69
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,480
You see these in frameworks like bootstrap and stuff, but they're actually pretty easy to create on

70
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,080
your own.

71
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,290
So the next part of the about page is going to be the logos.

72
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,330
So let's work on that.

73
00:05:52,330 --> 00:06:00,730
We're going to go back to about HTML, close this up in that I don't think we have any more utilities,

74
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,010
but we'll come back to it if we do.

75
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:13,360
So under the section we just did, let's say section and this is going to be section C logos.

76
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,270
So basically like logos of like the technologies that this person has worked with, stuff like that.

77
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,640
So we're going to do Section.

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:33,100
Let's do an ID of about C and let's do a P Y for class for padding.

79
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:43,360
And I want a big light background and then we'll do a container and let's do a div with the class of

80
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,510
a boat dash logos, which we're going to use the grid for and then we just want our images.

81
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,470
So this is going to be image slash and then in their own folder called about logos and we're going to

82
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,990
grab the Envato logo and then let's paste this down, copy this down.

83
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,310
Four times next one is going to be WordPress.

84
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:15,760
Next one is WooCommerce, which is a WordPress plugin for eCommerce and then Magento.

85
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,220
All right, so that's our logos.

86
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,070
And if we take a look at it, they're just going to be giant.

87
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,980
They're going to fill up the whole section.

88
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:33,190
So let's go into our CSS and we want to work on C, so let's go outside of Dash be.

89
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,460
So we'll do ampersand.

90
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,400
Dash.

91
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,690
See?

92
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,950
And let's grab the boat logos.

93
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,080
Let's use a grid.

94
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,950
And let's set the grid template columns.

95
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,530
We have four.

96
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:06,900
So we're going to do a repeat four times one fraction and let's add a grid gap of two REM.

97
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:15,600
And then the image I'm going to take the image and set a width of 70 because 100 is a little too, too

98
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,370
much.

99
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,420
So we'll do width of 70.

100
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,280
And if we take a look there we go.

101
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,630
It looks pretty clean.

102
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,180
So next section is going to be the testimonials here.

103
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,580
So let's add those.

104
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,570
So we'll go back and let's go to a boat.

105
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,100
C Section D

106
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,059
testimonials.

107
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:55,570
Do a boat dash dx As far as classes, I'm just going to do a Pi Dash four and do a container.

108
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:04,040
I know this is very repetitive, guys, but it's good because you'll get it in your head, you know,

109
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,350
at least if you want to lay stuff out like this, which is what I would recommend, having just separate

110
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,070
sections, you know, using utility classes and so on.

111
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:22,100
So let's do H two with a class of section, dash, title and testimonials.

112
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,550
Okay, we'll do our bottom line.

113
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,270
And let's do a paragraph with the class of lead.

114
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,490
And I also want this centered.

115
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:44,690
So let's say take a look at what my clients say.

116
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,360
All right.

117
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,420
And then underneath that, we'll have our class of testimonials, which will be a grid.

118
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,850
So we'll have Divs and just a paragraph.

119
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,950
We'll do like form 30.

120
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,870
And underneath that, underneath the paragraph, I'm going to put a UL on unordered list and we're going

121
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,620
to put an ally with an image.

122
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:23,720
So this is going to go image slash, testimonials slash and then this is person one JPEG and then I'm

123
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,380
going to copy this div and we have four testimonials.

124
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,860
So two, three, four and we're just going to simply change the name and the image.

125
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,660
So this will be person to person three, person four.

126
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:40,700
All right.

127
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,500
Actually, you know what I forgot is the name.

128
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,350
So we also want to list item with the names.

129
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:57,950
So for the first one here, let's say Sam Smith and we'll say location, just say New York and let's

130
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,940
go here.

131
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:08,300
We'll say Sarah Williams, say Michigan.

132
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,180
Jill Johnson.

133
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,320
London.

134
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,140
And let's do.

135
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,790
I don't know, Steve.

136
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,000
Steve Thompson.

137
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,630
And let's say Boston.

138
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,050
So if we look at this without styling, it doesn't look very good.

139
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,690
So let's go ahead and jump into.

140
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Main asks, and we're going to start to work on the D sections, so we'll go right under here.

141
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,570
So am DD and we're going to grab the testimonials.

142
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,030
So testimonials is going to be a grid.

143
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:16,420
And let's do a grid template columns again for columns.

144
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,700
Grid gap 0.5 REM.

145
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,520
Now let's style the UL.

146
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,310
So we want to make sure there's no bullets.

147
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,520
So list style none.

148
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,600
And let's do a margin top of one REM just to push it down a little bit.

149
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm going to display it as flex and let's align items to the center.

150
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,210
Now for the paragraph.

151
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,770
Uh, let's see for the paragraph inside testimonials.

152
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,340
I'm actually going to put a border around the whole thing.

153
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:11,630
So one pixel solid and let's use the medium colour, let's give it some rounded corners.

154
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,690
So we'll do five pixels and then let's do some padding.

155
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:26,840
Padding will do 0.5 rem and then the image, obviously the images are giant.

156
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,830
So we're going to say width, let's do 50 pixels.

157
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,830
We want these really small height.

158
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,740
50 pixels.

159
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,750
Let's do a border, let's make them circle.

160
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:46,100
So we'll do border radius 50% and let's do let's move them over a little bit.

161
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,150
So margin, right.

162
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,490
We'll do 0.5 REM.

163
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,170
That's it.

164
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,820
Take a look.

165
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,810
Let's see.

166
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,920
That's not right.

167
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,410
Looks like the grid messed up.

168
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,430
What did I do?

169
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,420
Oh, I forgot.

170
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,140
Repeat.

171
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,790
And there we go.

172
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,850
So I think this page looks pretty clean.

173
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,840
Looks nice.

174
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,050
So that's that's it for the about page.

175
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,390
Next thing we're going to work on is the work page where we have all those the transition effect and

176
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:21,990
all that stuff.

177
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,470
So there's some pretty crazy CSS involved in that.

178
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,510
So we're going to start on that in the next video.
