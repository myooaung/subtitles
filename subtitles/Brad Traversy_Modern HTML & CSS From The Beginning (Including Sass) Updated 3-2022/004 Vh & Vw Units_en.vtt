WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:00.910
All right.

2
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.980
So in the last video we talked about REM an m units.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.220
Now we're going to talk about V, H and VW, which is viewport height and viewport widths.

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.760
So the viewport is this whole area inside the browser, basically the browser body.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:26.290
And when we say, for instance, 50 VH, which is 50 viewport height, it's going to take up 50 of 100

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.480
viewport heights.

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.700
And the way I want you to think of this is slices.

8
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.480
So each viewport height is a slice across.

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.510
It goes up and down and slices across.

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.860
And there's always going to be 100 of them, no matter how big or small the browser is.

11
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.870
You can make it tiny.

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.610
You could stretch it across your whole screen.

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.990
There's always 100 viewport heights and each one is a slice.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.450
Now for viewport widths, it's the same thing, only it goes across and the slices go down.

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.790
So there's 100 slices that go this way and you can set your content to take up to or 100 or anything

16
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.760
between zero and 100 viewport heights and viewport widths.

17
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.380
So we're going to create a tiny little project, kind of a landing page using.

18
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.590
And so I can give you an example of how to use these in viewport heights are used much more than viewport

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.190
widths because for the most part things go all the way across anyway.

20
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.680
So we're going to create a new file here.

21
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.760
Let's call it one five, underscore VH, underscore VW dot HTML.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:46.630
And we're going to put our head and body tags, let's say VH and VW units and we'll put in our style.

23
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.550
So let's, let's add our HTML first and we're going to put in a header tag.

24
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.540
And inside the header let's do an H one.

25
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:07.150
We'll just say welcome to our website and we'll put a paragraph.

26
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.560
Let's do Lorem.

27
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.510
We'll do lorm 15.

28
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.150
And let's see.

29
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.410
Underneath that, let's put a link with a class of BTN.

30
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.790
Oops, we want a link.

31
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.610
So it's going to be an A tag, the class of BTN and it's not going to go anywhere.

32
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.140
And inside the link we'll just say Find out more.

33
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.220
All right.

34
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.920
Now in the style, first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of reset.

35
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.020
So we're going to use an asterisk, meaning target everything and let's set the box sizing to border

36
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.580
box and then let's remove the margin and padding from everything.

37
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.460
Okay.

38
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.230
And I'm just going to open this with a live server.

39
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.660
So this is what it should look like.

40
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.600
And notice the margin and padding is removed from everything.

41
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.610
Let's add in a body style because I want this to look decent.

42
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.820
So we'll say font family and let's grab this right here.

43
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.400
This is to go UI to Homa and for the header

44
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.480
I'm going to do you know what, let's do a background, I'm going to add an image, but for now I'm

45
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.590
just going to add a color.

46
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.030
So just a dark color and let's make the the color of the text white and let's save that and see what

47
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.720
we get.

48
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:47.590
So by default, it's just going to the background color is going to wrap it's going to wrap the content.

49
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.840
If we add more paragraphs and stuff, it's going to just go down along with the content.

50
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.620
What I want is the header background to take up the entire thing, the entire screen, and you might

51
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.720
think, well, let's set the height to 100% of its container, which is the body.

52
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.130
So let's save that.

53
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.010
I saved it and there's no difference.

54
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.970
And this is kind of kind of a gotcha I'm just going to show you that if we look at the body.

55
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.840
Right, let's let's click on the body here.

56
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.910
So the body is being highlighted.

57
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.910
You may think the body takes up the entire browser body, but it's not it's just wrapping whatever the

58
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.010
whatever is in the content.

59
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.730
Right.

60
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.210
So setting it to 100% of the body is is literally just doing what what it's already doing.

61
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.280
It's just coming down to here.

62
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.680
We want it to cover everything.

63
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.690
This is where viewport heights come in.

64
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.780
So I'm going to go ahead and change this from 100% to 100 VH and save.

65
00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.520
And now you can see it can it covers everything regardless of how big or small the browser is.

66
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.620
You can make it bigger or smaller.

67
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.850
It doesn't matter.

68
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.890
It's taking up 100 viewport heights.

69
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:13.480
Now, if I change this to 50 viewport heights and save, it takes up exactly half because remember,

70
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.130
there's 100 slices, right?

71
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.580
This is taking up 50 of those 100 slices.

72
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.740
If I change this to 20, it's going to take up 20 of those 100 slices.

73
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.670
So this makes creating landing pages very easily.

74
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.030
You know, it's very popular now to have a like a whole big image with some text and a button that's

75
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.590
a very popular look.

76
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.800
And VAR allows us to do that very easily.

77
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.860
So let's make this an actual image.

78
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:53.200
I'm going to grab a remote image from source dot unsplash.com and if you go down here, let's see.

79
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.050
So random from a collection.

80
00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.510
You know what?

81
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.450
Let's grab let's grab the daily photo.

82
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.030
So this right here, this will give us a random daily photo.

83
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.040
I'm going to grab that and I'm going to add this to the background.

84
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.620
Now, I don't know if I've showed you this before, but you can have a background color and then put

85
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.270
a URL after it.

86
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.870
So basically you have the color and then you have the image on top of it.

87
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.790
So let's, let's put in here that link, let's save it and go back.

88
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.860
And now you'll see we have a background image.

89
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.900
Yours will probably be different.

90
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.480
Close that up.

91
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.730
Yours will probably be different because it's a daily photo and they change it daily.

92
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.500
Now notice that it's repeating and I don't think I've had the chance to even show you this.

93
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.790
Let's see the repeat.

94
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.880
Since our window is bigger than the actual image, then it repeats.

95
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.940
So we're going to add some other properties to this background.

96
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.530
So one is going to be no repeat, save that.

97
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.600
And now you can see it doesn't repeat.

98
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.260
OC Another thing I want to do is I wanted to cover I want to center it and I want it to cover the whole

99
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.280
page, the whole background.

100
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:20.260
So in addition to no repeat, let's do center, center on the x and y axis and then slash cover and

101
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.830
save.

102
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.600
And now it covers the entire thing.

103
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.230
If I stretch this out, it's just it's still it's always going to cover.

104
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.000
So that's going to be your most popular your most popular way to do this or the most common way to do

105
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.540
this.

106
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.740
Now let's work on actually centering the text.

107
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.810
Now, this is where Flexbox actually works really well, but we haven't gotten to that yet, so we're

108
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.120
just going to use padding and stuff like that.

109
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:53.560
So for the header, first of all, I want to text a line everything and I could stop here.

110
00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.670
I mean, I showed you guys what V and why I didn't show you VW yet, but yeah, actually let's do that

111
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.030
first.

112
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:11.680
So let's add in a width of let's say 50 v w and save and now you'll see it's only going to take up half.

113
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.390
So it's the exact same thing, only it goes horizontal instead of vertical.

114
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:24.570
But I personally don't use VW that much because as you can see, it goes all the way across anyway.

115
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.050
The heights of different story.

116
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.230
It doesn't it's not going to go all the way down on its own.

117
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.720
But yeah, that's VW.

118
00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.809
So let's go ahead and text a line to the center.

119
00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.890
So we'll save that.

120
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:45.460
Now everything is aligned to the center, make this a little bigger and let's see now what I want to

121
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.040
do is add some padding within the header.

122
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.620
Let's do two REM.

123
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.620
So now there's two REM padding all around.

124
00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.000
But I want to push this down more and there's better ways to do this with Flexbox.

125
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.350
We could we could align it directly in the middle, but we haven't gotten to that yet.

126
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.720
So I'm just going to add padding top.

127
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.320
Let's do padding top.

128
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.480
Let's try 200 now.

129
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.970
Well, we use REM units.

130
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.050
Let's do five REM.

131
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.880
No, we want more than that.

132
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.690
Let's do.

133
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.100
Ten.

134
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.660
That's still still not low enough.

135
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.970
Let's do 15.

136
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.740
All right.

137
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.840
And if I were to make this smaller.

138
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.470
Good.

139
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.410
So let's let's make this look somewhat decent.

140
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:45.020
We're going to target some of these other elements like the H one, the paragraph, the button and style

141
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.860
those a little bit.

142
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:57.920
So let's say header actually we want header h one and we're going to change the font size to three REM.

143
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:04.700
So that's going to be 616 is the default route font size, it's going to be 16 times three.

144
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:14.090
And for the paragraph, say header paragraph, let's do margin and let's do one REM, top and bottom

145
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.680
zero left and right.

146
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.040
That way it pushes the link down and pushes the header up.

147
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.890
And then for the button or the I should say the link with the class of BTN where we'll just make that

148
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.820
look decent.

149
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.670
And I know that this doesn't have anything to do with V, H and VW, but I want to reiterate things

150
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.140
we've already gone over.

151
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.050
So we want this button to be in line.

152
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:45.170
BLOCK Because by default links are inline and then we're going to add text decoration none.

153
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:56.210
Let's do a background of light gray, change the color to dark gray and let's do padding.

154
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:05.870
We'll use REM, we'll do 0.75 on the top and bottom and two REM on the left and right and save.

155
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.070
And there's our button.

156
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.840
So it looks a little better.

157
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:15.440
And I mean, the text might blend, not blend well with the background image, but later on, I'm going

158
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:22.010
to show you how we can use CSS overlays, where we can have like a dark overlay over the image so that

159
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.600
the text is more readable.

160
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:32.240
So like I said this the viewport heights, it's always going to be 100 even if we have content below

161
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.360
it.

162
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.100
So let's go below the header and let's add a section and we'll put an H three.

163
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:46.370
We'll just say like about our company and then we'll put a paragraph, let's do lorem 50

164
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:57.050
and then I'm just going to add for that section, I'm just going to add padding of two REM just so it's

165
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.760
not right up against the edge.

166
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.080
So notice that it's still, it's still going to take up 100 viewport height.

167
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.740
And then immediately when I scroll down, we're going to see that content.

168
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.410
And it doesn't matter how how tall or short the browser is.

169
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.610
So right now you might think that as we scroll we'll see more of the image.

170
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.450
But no, as we scroll, it's going to go right to that content.

171
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:31.100
So Viewport Heights is great for landing pages like this where you have this the large image because

172
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.140
it doesn't matter where, how, how tall or short your browser is.

173
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.140
As soon as you scroll down, you're going to see the content.

174
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.570
It only takes up 100 viewport heights of whatever the current browser size is.

175
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.850
All right, now let's see if we make this smaller like that.

176
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:51.770
Still looks good.

177
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.980
So it's this is actually pretty responsive.

178
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:02.420
Let's see let's actually check it out with with the Chrome Tools Device Toolbar.

179
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.890
So we're going to hit that.

180
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.200
Okay.

181
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.760
So that looks pretty good.

182
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.080
If you look on it on an iPad, good.

183
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.390
Now let's try an iPhone landscape.

184
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.900
So we need to make this a little bigger and we'll click the landscape.

185
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.630
So in this case, I would probably want this to yeah, that doesn't look very good.

186
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.940
So I'd want this to be moved up.

187
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.900
So let's, let's practice our media query and we don't have to do much.

188
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.930
We always, we just need to change the padding of the header.

189
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:41.280
So let's say media and I would say max height.

190
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.120
So max height, let's do 450 pixels.

191
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:55.860
What this means is that when the viewport is 450 pixels or less, then this styling will kick in.

192
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.450
So we'll say header.

193
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:06.780
And let's see, we initially set the padding top to what I think it was 15 REM.

194
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:12.240
So let's, let's try five REM and save and there we go.

195
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.940
So now it looks good on landscape and if we go back, you can see it goes back to 15 REM.

196
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:24.060
So it's a good example of of where and when to use a media query.

197
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:25.980
All right.

198
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.980
So I think that's going to be it, guys.

199
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:34.830
What I want to do in the next video is take our hotel website project and I want to make that responsive.

200
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:42.030
So we're actually going to be adding media queries to that project and just making it overall, making

201
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.630
it better.

202
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:42.960
All right.

203
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.430
So I'll see you in the next video.
