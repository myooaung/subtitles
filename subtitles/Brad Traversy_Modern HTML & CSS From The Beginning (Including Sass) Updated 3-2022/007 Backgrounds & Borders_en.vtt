00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.780
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.480
In this video, we're going to talk about backgrounds and borders, and I'm going to use the full screen

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.890
editor and full screen browser because I want to utilize all the space here.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.190
Now, notice that I have a folder called IMG.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.620
This is an image folder and I have two images.

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.080
One is a star's JPEG file, which is this image here I'm going to use as a background.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.450
And then I have a leaf PNG, which you can't really see because it's transparent and it's on it's on

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.650
a dark background.

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.390
Now, one thing to remember is JPEG files or JPEG images.

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.740
They can't be transparent like this one is PNG files can have a transparent background where you can

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.170
put it on any web page like let's say the web page is a red background and it will show red behind this

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.830
image.

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.100
If it were a jpeg, it would have to have a solid color.

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.420
It couldn't be transparent.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.560
So just remember that if you want transparency, then use a PNG image.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.490
All right.

17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.790
So what we're going to do now is create a file called zero five, underscore backgrounds, underscore

18
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.370
borders, dot HTML.

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.940
And let's put in our boilerplate here.

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.630
And for a title, we'll say backgrounds and borders.

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.480
Let's add in our style tags.

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.230
And as far as the HTML goes, we're going to have four divs.

23
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.570
So the first one is going to have an ID of box dash one.

24
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.140
So you want to div with the idea of box one, we're going to put an H three and just say box one for

25
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.690
the title and we want a paragraph with, let's say 20 words, so we'll do lorem 20 and then what I'm

26
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.090
going to do is just highlight this whole div and I'm going to copy it down with shift shift option or

27
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.760
shift alt on windows.

28
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.450
And then we're going to hit the down key three times.

29
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.760
So now we have four divs and then we're just going to change the ID, so one, two and three and four

30
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.220
and then we'll change the text as well.

31
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.570
And we'll probably use this HTML in a couple of different lectures.

32
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.750
That's three and four.

33
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:15.240
So let's save this and let's open it up with live server and it should look like this.

34
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.140
So we have our four divs and we're going to style the first one.

35
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:28.710
So let's go back and let's target the ID of box one and we're going to use the background.

36
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.750
Oops, if I spell background right, we want to use the background color property.

37
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.230
Now when you want to assign a color to text, obviously we use the color property.

38
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.430
We've already talked about that.

39
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.100
If you want to style the background or color the background, you use background color and I'm just

40
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.390
going to choose this blanch almond.

41
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.330
It doesn't really matter what what color we use, but if I go ahead and save this and we take a look,

42
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.600
notice that this whole div now has that background color and it's going to take up however, however

43
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.610
much space that the element takes up or the div and remember divs are block level.

44
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.400
So this is going to go all the way across by default unless we set a width on it or something like that.

45
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.300
And I know the text is right up against the edge.

46
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.830
That's because there's no padding.

47
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.870
I'm going to go over margin and padding in a lecture very soon.

48
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.690
So let's head back into our editor here and I want to go over border.

49
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.920
Now, border has three mandatory properties, so the first one is going to be width and this can be

50
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.870
in any order, but we're going to do width first.

51
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.640
So let's say three pixels.

52
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.360
Now, if I just just do that and take a look, we have nothing.

53
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.600
There's no change because we need all three properties.

54
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.460
The next one is going to be the color.

55
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.920
So we want to say border dash color and let's just do red.

56
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.490
And then the last one is going to be border style, which can be dashed dotted double groove.

57
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.320
The most popular is going to be solid.

58
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.060
That's probably the most common that you'll use, which is just a solid, regular border.

59
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.250
So let's save that and let's take a look.

60
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.970
And now we have a three pixel wide, red solid border.

61
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.360
And just to give you an idea of some of the other styles we can do, like dotted if we take a look at

62
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.190
that, that's the dotted border.

63
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:29.280
And what else we have dashed that's dash is similar to Dotted, but it's there wider lines.

64
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.760
But for the most part, you're probably going to be using solid the most now using all three properties

65
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.450
like this.

66
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.780
We don't have to do it this way and this isn't the preferred way.

67
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.580
What we can do is just use the single border property and we can actually add all three of those in

68
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.910
here.

69
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.110
So three pixels, solid red and it doesn't matter the order either.

70
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.750
You can use any order and if I comment this out, I'll highlight this and do control forward slash or

71
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.280
control question mark that will comment that out if I save with.

72
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.730
Roll -- and take a look.

73
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.870
We have the same thing.

74
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.940
So this is the exact same as doing this.

75
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.960
It's just less lines of code.

76
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.940
So that's border.

77
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.400
Let's say we want to do just a border on the top.

78
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.150
Actually, you know what?

79
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.760
We'll grab the next one.

80
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.320
Let's do box two and let's actually give this a background.

81
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.840
Now, we can also use just background if we want to add a color or a background image, which I'll get

82
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.920
into in a second.

83
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.130
But let's give this a dark background and let's give it a color text color of white.

84
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.290
And let's say we just want a border on the top.

85
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:49.690
We can just do border, dash, top, and let's say we want to do blue solid three pixels.

86
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.960
So we save that and we take a look.

87
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.970
Now we just have a border on the top.

88
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.240
So you can do border top, border, bottom, border left and border right.

89
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.950
All right.

90
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:07.460
So now I want to take a look at the border radius property, because by default, our corners are just

91
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.340
straight corners, but we can round it off if we want.

92
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.770
So I'm actually going to comment out the border top or no, I'll leave it.

93
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.340
I'll leave it.

94
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:28.760
But what I do want to do, what I do want to do is just add a line break between these two, box one

95
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.810
and box two.

96
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.870
There we go.

97
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.450
So let's say that this top one here, I want rounded corners.

98
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.420
So for that, I would use a border radius.

99
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.470
So I'm going to go to box one and I'm going to say border radius.

100
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.260
And we can put percentages here.

101
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.050
We can put pixels, let's say ten pixels.

102
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.490
That's that's pretty common.

103
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.210
And if we take a look now, we have rounded corners now before CSE three, there was no border radius

104
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.720
property.

105
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.900
We actually had to create little images of corners, rounded corners and then position them perfectly

106
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.980
so that it looked rounded like that, which was a huge pain in the butt.

107
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.910
And if you're just learning HTML and CSS now, you missed a lot of crappy stuff that we used to have

108
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.790
to do before HTML five and CSS three.

109
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.320
Just to just to let you know that now if we wanted to just add rounded corners to like, let's say the

110
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.970
top, we can do that as well.

111
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:34.100
So let's take box two and let's say border dash, top dash, left dash radius.

112
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.790
I know that's a long property and let's say ten pixels.

113
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.930
So if we take a look at that, notice that only the top left is rounded so we can choose which corners

114
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.040
we want to round.

115
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.830
And let's say we just want the whole top.

116
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.040
So we'll just copy this down and we'll do right as well.

117
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.900
All right.

118
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.920
So now if we look at that, both of the top is rounded.

119
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.780
Now, you don't even have to have a border property to use border radius like we could still round these

120
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.570
the bottom edges, even though there's no border.

121
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.580
So that doesn't matter.

122
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.200
So next thing I want to look at is the background image property.

123
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.620
A lot of times you might want to have some kind of images your background.

124
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:23.630
So let's use box three and let's use the background dash image property.

125
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.690
So this is going to actually take in your URL.

126
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:33.409
And in here we could use a remote image like we could do HTTP and then locate some image on the Internet

127
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.250
and use that.

128
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:40.039
But what we want to do is target the stars JPEG file, that's in our image folder.

129
00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:46.820
And since our image folder is local in our directory here, we can just do a dot slash that represents

130
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.020
the current directory.

131
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.750
Then we want to go into the image directory and then we want to call the stars dot JPEG file.

132
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.960
So let's save that and let's go back and notice that it uses the background image.

133
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.670
Now you're not going to you don't see the whole image because it only takes up the space of the actual

134
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.330
element.

135
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.550
And this is the whole div right here.

136
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.900
Now, we can make this bigger by setting a height.

137
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.600
We can set a height and a width in CSS.

138
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.320
Let's also change the color of the text because it's unreadable right now.

139
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:28.970
So we'll say color white and let's give it a height of, let's say 300 pixels and let's give it a width

140
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.260
of 600 pixels, and let's save that and take a look.

141
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.040
And there we go.

142
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.930
So now we have our background image.

143
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:42.200
We have a width of 300 and a height of I'm sorry, width of 600 and a height of 300.

144
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:48.560
So with background image or I should say with background, you have a bunch of other properties just

145
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.640
like with Border.

146
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.160
One of those is background repeat.

147
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:58.700
Now you can't see it here, but let's say this image was only like this big ended right here.

148
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.460
It would repeat both this way on the x axis and this way on the y axis.

149
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.110
And usually you're not going to want that unless it's some kind of seamless texture that you want to

150
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.830
repeat, like as a as some kind of seamless background.

151
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.230
But for the most part, you're not going to want that.

152
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:21.230
So let's go ahead and set the background dash repeat property.

153
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.500
And there's a few options here you can do repeat, which is the default.

154
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.210
It repeats both ways.

155
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.950
Repeat X will only repeat on the x axis, which is horizontal.

156
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.310
Repeat Y will go on the up and down the y axis.

157
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.090
But what we want is no repeat because we don't want it to repeat.

158
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.350
Another property is the position property.

159
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.000
So let's say background position and this will move the image around.

160
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.620
It takes in two values.

161
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.700
The first is going to be the x axis and the second is the y axis.

162
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.950
So let's do 100 pixels.

163
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.960
Let's just do 100 pixels zero and see what happens here.

164
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:05.980
So what happened is on the x axis, it pushed it over 100 pixels and it actually leaves a blank space

165
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.460
here.

166
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.680
Now, if I do 100 pixels on the Y axis, try to try to guess what's going to happen.

167
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.350
So let's save that and take a look.

168
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.250
And it pushes it down 100 pixels.

169
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:26.580
Now, let's say you wanted to move it up and over 100 pixels so that the image didn't actually get pushed

170
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.300
out of out of its context here or its wrappers.

171
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.590
So let's.

172
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.080
Go back.

173
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.170
And what we can do is we can do negative values.

174
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:43.880
So now if we take a look, what happened is the image went up 100 pixels and over this way 100 pixels.

175
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.480
Now you also have keywords you can use like top, center and bottom.

176
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:54.830
So let's say we wanted to center and center on both axes and you can see what it did.

177
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.960
Is it just centered it?

178
00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:01.730
If I wanted to take the y axis and move it up to the top, we could do that as well.

179
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.170
And this might not be the best image to use as an example, because it's just stars.

180
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:11.300
It's not something that you can actually tell what position it's in, but just know that we can move

181
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.480
it top, bottom, center and so on.

182
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:21.830
Now, in most cases, you're going to want the whole image to cover the background.

183
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.240
And that's not what's going on here.

184
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.550
It's just it's the size of the image, which I believe is 1920 by 1080.

185
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.590
So the image is really like this big.

186
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.180
It's like the whole window.

187
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.490
Now, let's say we just want the whole image to show in this spot.

188
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:44.000
What we could do is we could add a background size property and we can set that to cover.

189
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.980
So it's going to cover the whole space.

190
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:51.710
So if we take a look now, the whole image is showing it doesn't matter how what size the image is,

191
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.070
it's going to just it's going to take up the whole space right here.

192
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.450
All right.

193
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.990
So that's a lot of different properties, right?

194
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.950
For the background, there's even more than that.

195
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:06.680
But let's say that we want to do exactly what we're doing here, but we don't want to take up all this

196
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.870
this these lines with all these different properties, we can actually just use background.

197
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.550
So I'm going to use background.

198
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.590
I'm going to do the same exact thing we just did.

199
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:22.670
So we're going to take the URL and then after that we want the know, repeat, and then after that we'll

200
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.930
do the position.

201
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.140
Let's do center, just do center, center.

202
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.820
And then when you want to put the size in, you just do a slash and then cover like that.

203
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:40.220
So if I go ahead and comment this out and save and take a look, we get the same result with much less

204
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.110
lines of code, much less properties.

205
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.440
So let's move on.

206
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.720
I want to look at having a fixed background and I'll show you what I mean.

207
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.990
So let's add in our box four.

208
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.450
And this time I'm going to set background.

209
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.730
Now when you want to set an image, you don't have to use background image.

210
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:07.280
You can use just background even if you don't want to add all all this other stuff we did up here.

211
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:15.590
So let's do a URL and let's go in the current folder and then into the image folder and we want leaf

212
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.340
dot, p and G and I'm just going to do a no repeat.

213
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.580
All right, now let's save this and see what we get.

214
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.780
So notice that it's just because the image is bigger.

215
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.080
Like the image is this big.

216
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.170
It's not going to show the whole image.

217
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:39.090
It's only going to cover whatever the content area covers, which is this this right here.

218
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.940
So let's see.

219
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.390
What I'm going to do is set.

220
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.390
Actually, you know what we'll do is we'll add more content so in box for.

221
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:59.450
Let's take this paragraph and let's just copy it down like a bunch of times a lot, and save that.

222
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.800
And now take a look.

223
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.560
And now notice that it shows the whole image because the content area is bigger.

224
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.870
If we manually set a height like we did here, we'd be able to see the whole image as well.

225
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.290
But I want to show you how we can make make this a fixed image.

226
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.860
And to give you an example, let me just make this smaller.

227
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.960
So we have a more of a scroll.

228
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.450
Now, if I scroll, see how the image just kind of stays in place, we can make it fixed.

229
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.390
So let's go back up to box for.

230
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.620
And let's actually position it differently, too.

231
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.470
So let's let's do.

232
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.620
Center bottom.

233
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.470
Let's see what that looks like.

234
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.220
So now let's see how it's center bottom.

235
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.280
Let's do center.

236
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:49.910
Center.

237
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.760
So now it's it's dead center.

238
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.280
Now I want it to stay fixed.

239
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.330
So I'm going to add a a background attached.

240
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.080
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.800
Background.

242
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.370
Attachment.

243
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.150
Property.

244
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.980
And let's say fixed and let's save that.

245
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.750
And now watch when I scroll.

246
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.510
The image just stays in place and it's fixed to the to the browser window.

247
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.240
So if you want it to do that, then you want to use the background attachment fixed.

248
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.440
All right.

249
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.480
So that's going to be it for this video, guys.

250
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.130
And the next one, we're going to start to talk about the box model, which has to do with margin and

251
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:39.050
padding and just how spacing works in in CSS.
