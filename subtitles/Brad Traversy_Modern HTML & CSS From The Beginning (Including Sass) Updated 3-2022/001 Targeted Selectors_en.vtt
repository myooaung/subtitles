00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.660
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.600
So in this section, we're going to start to look at, I guess, more advanced parts of CSIS or things

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.540
that you're not going to use as much.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.330
They're not as common, but you should still know.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.840
And in this video, we're going to look at targeted selectors or just different ways of selecting elements

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.070
than we've already learned.

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.630
So I'm going to create a new file.

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.710
And what I've done is I've created a folder called CSS Sandbox to just because the CSIS sandbox that

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.990
we've we've been working with is really filling up.

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.720
So I just figured I'd start a new one for this section.

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.760
So let's create a file called one underscore and we'll call this targeted, let's say targeted underscore

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.460
selectors dot HTML.

13
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.020
And we're going to just put in our boilerplate here and let's change the title targeted

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.660
selectors and we'll go ahead and put our style tags in.

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.560
Now the HTML for this is going to be really weird, but I'm doing it for a reason because I want to

16
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.020
show you how to select certain parts of it.

17
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:15.270
So we're going to create a div and in this div we'll have a paragraph with we'll just do lorem something

18
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.830
really short, just form five and then under that I'm going to put a UL and let's do a list item for

19
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.520
the content.

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.980
We'll say item and an increment in number.

21
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.140
So dollar sign and let's do three.

22
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.840
So we'll do times three and enter.

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.380
All right.

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.750
And then under the UL, we're going to put another paragraph with alarm five.

25
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.180
I also want to make this item two.

26
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.050
I want to wrap that in a paragraph tag as well, and you'll see why I'm doing this in a few minutes.

27
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.180
So we're going to do that and then we're going to put one more paragraph under the div.

28
00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:01.770
So outside of the div, so up in the style here, if we do div p like this, you guys, you know what

29
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.520
this is going to do?

30
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.540
It's going to look for any paragraph that's inside of a div, right?

31
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.790
So I'm just going to put a background of let's do Gray, let's save it, let's open this up with live

32
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.420
server.

33
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.650
And I'm actually going to just make this a little bigger so you guys can see it better.

34
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.880
So what's going on here is every paragraph within a div is has the gray background.

35
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.070
If we look at the markup here, this paragraph is in the div, this paragraph is in the div, this one

36
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.670
is then the div.

37
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.870
This last one is not.

38
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.510
So that doesn't pertain to this selector.

39
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:45.360
Now what if we wanted to select a paragraph that was directly in a div it was a direct child of the

40
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.750
div.

41
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.120
So to do that, we just put a comment here.

42
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.780
We'll say direct child to do that.

43
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.250
What we could do is just add a greater than sign an angle bracket here.

44
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.010
And this is this is saying that we only want a paragraph that is a direct child of a div.

45
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.420
So let's save that.

46
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.850
And you can see that the middle one here this disappeared because it no longer pertains to that because

47
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.120
this item or I'm sorry, this paragraph, it's direct parent is a list item.

48
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.180
Oops.

49
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.170
I mean to do that it's a list item even though it is in this div, it's not the direct parent.

50
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.750
The direct parent is a list item, then that parent is the UL and then that parent is the div.

51
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.310
So at the same time we can also select something that is directly after an element.

52
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.200
So something that's on the same level.

53
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.030
So let's say directly after and I'm going to say Div and I'm going to use a plus sign here and then

54
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:54.780
a P and let's change the background to we'll just do dark whoops, we'll do dark gray and then we'll

55
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.030
do color white.

56
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.550
So let's save that and see what happens.

57
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.020
So the last paragraph is affected by this selector right here.

58
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.430
And the reason for that is we're saying we want a paragraph where the element right before it is a div

59
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.140
OC.

60
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.370
Now you might be saying, what about this one?

61
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.490
There's a div here, this is a child of the div.

62
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.300
So this paragraph is inside the div, which makes it a child.

63
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.690
This one is a sibling of this div.

64
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.920
They're on the same level.

65
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.570
This is not inside of it.

66
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.980
So that's what this pertains to is basically a sibling.

67
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.840
So the next sibling.

68
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.070
All right.

69
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.120
Now, the next thing I want to show you is how we can add attributes as selectors.

70
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.330
So I'm actually going to add some more markup down here under the paragraph.

71
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.010
I'm going to put a couple of links.

72
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.040
So this will just go nowhere.

73
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.590
I'm just going to say page one, we'll just pretend it's a link to another page on the site.

74
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.910
So page two and then let's do another link.

75
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.920
For this one.

76
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.430
Let's have it go to Google and for the text, we'll say Google.

77
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.160
All right.

78
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.040
Now, usually when you have an external link, you're going to have a target attribute and set it to

79
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.120
underscore blank.

80
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.090
And that will take it off the you know, it won't redirect you within the same tab.

81
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.710
It'll open up another tab.

82
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.830
And if we wanted to style this based on it having a target attribute, we could do that.

83
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.650
So let's go up here and let's say buy attribute.

84
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.160
So I could say the I want all the add tags that have an attribute of target.

85
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:50.010
And then I want to add a background of let's do red and make the color white.

86
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.870
So if I save that, notice that the Google link now has a red background and that's because it has a

87
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.800
target on it.

88
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:06.810
Now, if I were to add a target to this one here, let's say target this time, let's set it to underscore

89
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.710
self.

90
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.790
We'll save and it gets a red background because it does have the target.

91
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.290
Now, in addition to this, you can also you can reference the actual value.

92
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.780
So if we want to say where the target is equal to underscore blank and save, you'll see that.

93
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.470
Now, Google is the only one that has the red background because we're saying the target has to be B

94
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.110
blank where this one is actually self.

95
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.140
And I'm going to give you a more practical example of this.

96
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.630
So I'm just going to put that back like that.

97
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:48.150
And then let's go down here and let's say specific attribute values.

98
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.910
And where I use this the most is with forms so or form inputs, I should say.

99
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.800
So I'm going to just add some line breaks here and let's add a form.

100
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.410
And we're just going to have a couple of inputs.

101
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:14.040
So let's say input with the type of text and we don't need a name or ID, we'll put a placeholder and

102
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.310
we'll just say name and then I'll copy this down two more times.

103
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.840
This one will be an email.

104
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.490
I'm also going to change the type to email, which is similar to a text field.

105
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.830
This one is actually going to be a submit.

106
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.940
I want this to be a button to submit so it's not going to have a placeholder.

107
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.990
However, it needs a value because that's the text that is displayed.

108
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.590
All right.

109
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.980
So we'll save that and we get this right here.

110
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:47.910
So let's say I want the name and the email input to go to be 100% width and add a little bit of margin.

111
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.310
So if I were to just do input.

112
00:07:52.490 --> 00:08:01.850
And say with 100% and then say margin bottom will do like, I don't know, five pixels.

113
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.190
And if we were to save that, you'll see that all of these this is going to pertain to all of them because

114
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.480
they're all inputs.

115
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.610
They have different types, but they're all inputs.

116
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.730
So we may want to target certain types.

117
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:20.140
And in this case I want the name field and the email to have 100%, but not the button itself.

118
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:27.890
So what I would do, and this is something that I is pretty common for me, is I would say input where

119
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.530
the type equals text.

120
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.809
If I do that only the name extends because it has a type of text.

121
00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:45.440
But then we could put a comma, we could say input where the type where the type equals email and save.

122
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.290
And now both the name and the email are 100%.

123
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:54.470
And a lot of cases, if it's like a contact form, you'd also do the, you know, the text area as well.

124
00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:02.030
But yeah, so that's how we can target specific values of attributes and it doesn't have to be input

125
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.940
with a type, it can be any attribute at all.

126
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.410
Why did that why did that change?

127
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.790
What did I do wrong here?

128
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.370
Up.

129
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:13.860
There we go.

130
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.400
All right.

131
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:22.290
So, I mean, these are just some some other other methods to to target certain things in the DOM to

132
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.070
style.

133
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.980
You're not going to be using these as much, obviously, but you may run into a situation where they

134
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.940
could help you out.

135
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:30.780
All right.

136
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:37.200
So in the next video, we're going to talk about a special pseudo selector or pseudo class called Nth

137
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.010
Child.
