1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,020
All right, guys.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,300
So we have all of our pages done.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,640
Now we're going to start to look at responsiveness and making it look better on smaller screens.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,360
So I'm going to actually create a new SAS file.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,180
So in success, I'm going to create a file called Underscore Media Access.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,400
And this is where I want to put my media queries.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,760
Now I want to bring this in to the main CSIS or CSIS, but I'm going to bring it in down at the bottom

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,460
because that's where I want this stuff to be included.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,640
So at the very bottom here, let's do import media.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,650
So we'll just put a comment here, we'll say import media queries.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:55,080
So let's head over to media success and let's start off with tablets and smaller.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,980
So I'm going to put a media query for a max width of 800 pixels here.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:09,660
So let's do at media and let's say max width is going to be 800 pixels.

14
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,000
And let's start with the header home.

15
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,640
So let's do ID header dash home.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,950
We're actually not going to have very much in here, but what I want to do is make the height much less

17
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,570
than what it is on on laptops and desktops.

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,410
So I'm going to take the height from 100 viewport width, our viewport height to just 30 REM, which

19
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,340
is still pretty big.

20
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,100
It should take a good chunk of the screen, but we don't want it to cover the whole screen on a tablet.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,400
And then I'm just going to take the header content.

22
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,130
And actually, you know what?

23
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,050
We can nest this within header home.

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,500
So we're going to take the header content and just add a padding dash top of five REM.

25
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,910
So let's take a look at that.

26
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:15,960
Now, if if this doesn't show, like if the media query styles do not show, just go ahead and restart

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,100
this down here with control C and then run npm run SAS again.

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:27,720
You might have to just re save media access and then let's go back here and let's make this smaller.

29
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:35,250
And once we hit 800, you can see that it then goes down to the width or sorry, the height goes down

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,660
to 30 REM.

31
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,240
So I think that that's better on a tablet rather than having it take up the whole screen.

32
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,420
So that's pretty much it for the 800 pics me pixels media query.

33
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,790
Now I want to deal with smartphones.

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,280
So anything that's under 500 because right here, I mean things look pretty decent.

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,370
We don't really need to do anything else for this size.

36
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,580
So we want to now deal with smaller.

37
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,860
Actually, what we'll do is open up.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,250
Chrome tools and let's set it to iPhone X.

39
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,220
So there's a few things we want to do here

40
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,480
under the media, max width of 800 pixels.

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:35,020
Let's do smart phones and we're going to do media max width and let's do this, let's say 500 pixels.

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,160
So first I'm going to work on the header and the main nav.

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,880
Now the main nav, I'm going to set the flex direction instead of row.

44
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,530
I'm going to set it to column.

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:58,180
I actually want the the logo on top in the center and then the menu underneath in the center.

46
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:07,690
So let's take the main nav and let's set the flex direction to column.

47
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,980
And I want to align items center.

48
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,360
And I also want the list items.

49
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,070
So I'm going to embed the our nest the list items here.

50
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,230
I'm going to set padding to.

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,600
Let's do one REM.

52
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,660
So now you can see that it's in a column fashion rather than a row.

53
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,320
So we have the the logo in the middle on top, and then we have the the menu in the middle here.

54
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,730
So let's deal with the rest of the header because this obviously doesn't look very good.

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:56,920
So we're going to go under the main nav and let's do header and we're going to do ampersand dash home.

56
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,120
And the reason I'm doing it like this is because we're also going to add some styles for Dash Inner

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,660
as well.

58
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,180
Notice up here, I just put in header dash home because we weren't we don't have any styles up here

59
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,620
for header dash inner OC.

60
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,200
So I mean and you can do it if you want.

61
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,170
Had our dash home, had our dash in or you don't have to do it this way.

62
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,810
I just like to organize it in this way.

63
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,520
But you know, everyone's different, so I'm going to set the height to be much smaller.

64
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,770
So on tablets it's 30 REM on full screen, it's 100.

65
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,290
It takes up the whole thing on smartphones.

66
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,080
I'm just going to do ten REM.

67
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,570
So if we save that, we take a look.

68
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,260
You can see that it's much smaller now.

69
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,140
I'm also going to add a border on the bottom here to kind of separate the rest of the content.

70
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:03,250
So let's do border bottom and let's set that to three pixels solid and we want it set to the main colour

71
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,660
variable.

72
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,410
All right, now I don't want the header content displayed.

73
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,800
All we want is the the logo and the menu.

74
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,050
And it's not shown here just because.

75
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,990
Well it is actually we have you can see the button here.

76
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,530
So we want to just we don't want to show that at all.

77
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,320
So I'm going to nest in here the header content.

78
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,670
And let's just set this to display.

79
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,260
None.

80
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,790
So now if we go back, you'll see that none of that contents displayed.

81
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,810
That button is gone.

82
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,230
And we just have a very simple header with a logo and a menu.

83
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,130
Now, the inner pages, if we take a look here, you'll see that the menu is is covered.

84
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:58,020
So we want the same height for the inner that we do for the home menu or the home header.

85
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:08,460
So let's go back in here and let's go after home and let's say in our and let's also set the height

86
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,050
to ten REM and then if we go back and you'll see the inner pages now are the same as the home.

87
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,460
Actually, you know what we want to do, though, see how the home, the positioning is different.

88
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:28,130
We want to set the positioning of the home to the same to the same X and Y values as the inner.

89
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:42,000
So right here in the home, lots to background dash position which if we look in main dot six is right

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,180
here so 20% 30%.

91
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,910
So we want to set that to 20%, 30%.

92
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,090
And now if we save that, you'll see that now it looks the same on all pages.

93
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,340
So let's start to work on stacking some of this stuff.

94
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,230
So we'll start with the home page.

95
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,950
We'll just have basically one style for everything we want stacked.

96
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:18,120
So anything that has a grid template columns of repeat for one FR or repeat three one if our we just

97
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,090
want to set it to one fr one fraction, which is just one column that will make it stacked.

98
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,440
So I'm going to go let's see, let's go under.

99
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,230
We want to be within the media query.

100
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,140
So this media query ends here.

101
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:41,490
So I'm going to go right here and let's say Stack, we want this to be a comment.

102
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,790
So stack grid columns.

103
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:52,980
So first thing is let's do home dash a specials, which is a grid.

104
00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:07,950
Next, we want home B, so home dash B stats stats and let's do home dash C process.

105
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,600
So these are all grids.

106
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,590
And then on the about page we have our testimonials.

107
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:24,180
So let's do a boat dash D class of testimonials and then we also have our items on our work page.

108
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,040
So let's say items.

109
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:37,640
So within here, I'm just going to set the grid template columns simply to one fraction.

110
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,220
So if I save that, we go back.

111
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,560
You can see that these are all stacked the three sections on the home page.

112
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,240
We'll deal with the footer in a little bit.

113
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,840
And then on the about page, the testimonials are stacked.

114
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,840
We're going to deal with this and then let's see on the work page.

115
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,310
These are all stacked.

116
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,950
So let's see what else we want to do here.

117
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:15,460
I want to add, uh, and the reason that this doesn't look good is because, remember, we used grid

118
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,120
template areas here, so we have to, we have to manage this in a different way to make it responsive.

119
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,660
Same with the contact.

120
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:31,240
But before we do that, I want to make this look a little bit better by taking like these boxes here

121
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,430
and putting a little border underneath each one because they're kind of running into each other here.

122
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,740
So let's do that.

123
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:53,770
Let's go back in and let's go under here and let's do home and let's do Ampersand A and we want to grab

124
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,890
the specials div.

125
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:04,990
So each div inside the specials class, I'm going to add a border bottom to let's do one pixel, I'm

126
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,460
going to use the light color.

127
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:14,230
I want it to be pretty faint and solid and let's add a little bit of padding to push each one down.

128
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,590
So padding bottom, I'm going to set to one REM and I don't want the very last one to have a border.

129
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:26,650
So I'm going to add in here ampersand, colon, last child.

130
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,280
And let's set the border to none.

131
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,860
Whoops, border none.

132
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,220
And let's set the padding bottom to zero on the last one.

133
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,410
So if we save that, we take a look.

134
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,330
Now, you can see it has a very faint border after each one, except for the bottom.

135
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,380
We don't need a border here.

136
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,670
That would look kind of weird.

137
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,060
Now, let's see.

138
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,590
What else do we want to do here?

139
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,970
The stats.

140
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,800
Which are these here?

141
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,350
I want to just lessen the padding a little bit.

142
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,480
So within this a right here, we're going to go outside of the specials, but within the A I'm sorry,

143
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,490
not within the A, it's it's section B.

144
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:19,400
So we want to go after the A, let's say B, and we're going to take the stats, divs.

145
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:30,280
And set the padding to let's do two REM top zero and then one REM bottom.

146
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,900
So that lessens the padding a little bit.

147
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,390
Now.

148
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,900
I think that that's good for the the home page.

149
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,910
I think that we should handle the footer, though, before we move on, because this obviously doesn't

150
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,900
look very good.

151
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,970
So let's.

152
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,820
Go back in and let's go.

153
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,070
Still within the media query.

154
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,780
So we want to go right here.

155
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:04,070
Let's say footer and we have an ID of main dash footer.

156
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:12,380
I'm going to set the height of the footer to seven REM and then I'm going to grab the footer content

157
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,700
and set the flex direction to column.

158
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,790
So we're kind of doing the same thing that we did with the nav bar.

159
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm going to set it to column and then we're going to set padding to one REM and let's set the height

160
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,430
of that to five REM and let's see what that looks like.

161
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,260
So instead of having it in a flex row going across, now they're in a column and we just added some

162
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,020
padding to kind of separate the stuff a little bit.

163
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,970
So I think that that looks pretty good.

164
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,070
Let's see.

165
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,780
Next thing we want to do is let's do the about page.

166
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,460
So we'll handle this part right here, which is which are grid template areas.

167
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,180
So we just want to basically reframe the grid template areas.

168
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:07,460
So I'm going to go here and say about let me just put a comment right here as well for home.

169
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:19,940
So we'll say ID about and we want to deal with about Dash A so let's do ampersand dash a and it has

170
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,080
a class of intro or wait, what was it?

171
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
Let me just.

172
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,300
Check this out.

173
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:34,020
So a and we want the grid which is this oh, it's about info, not intro.

174
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:44,360
So what class about dash info which is already displayed is a grid and it has template areas which sets

175
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,340
the columns.

176
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,940
Now I just want it to be stacked.

177
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,250
So I'm going to take the bio image.

178
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,300
And just to show you what I'm talking about, if we look at about let's see, where is it?

179
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,480
So right here we have bio image, bio, bio.

180
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:07,390
Basically, we want all of these just to go straight down and one, one column or one row.

181
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,330
So let's say bio image.

182
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,860
Wait a minute.

183
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,510
This isn't right.

184
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,700
We have to add in grid template areas and then we're going to do.

185
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,740
Bio image.

186
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,690
Next line here will be bio.

187
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:39,500
Then we have award one, award two and award three and we already have the grid template.

188
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:45,750
The other grid area is set right here so we don't have to redo those or anything.

189
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,470
It's already set.

190
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,990
We just simply want to change the orientation.

191
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,800
All right.

192
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,700
And then.

193
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,250
Four, see?

194
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,760
Let's see this right here.

195
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,030
This is see the logos?

196
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm just going to remove this whole thing because I don't it's not that important.

197
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,070
And I mean, we could we could stack the logos on top of each other, but that's just too much room

198
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,610
just to show some logos and they're way too small to leave it like this.

199
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,200
So I'm going to just get rid of that.

200
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,910
And of course, again, if you guys want to do something different, that's absolutely fine.

201
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,040
But that's what I would do in this situation.

202
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,240
So I'm going to go actually, let's add a semicolon right here.

203
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:42,310
I'm going to go below the oops, below the A, which ends here and do dash and dash, see which is the

204
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,300
logo section.

205
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,110
And I'm just going to display none, get rid of it completely.

206
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,900
So now if we go back, that part is now gone so the about page looks pretty good let's go to the work

207
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,390
is good let's go to the contact page.

208
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:06,940
So let's see, let's head over here and let's add a section for contact.

209
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:20,319
So we have ID contact and let's target contact, dash a and I'm going to grab the text fields class.

210
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,310
So text fields and we want to change the orientation of the, the inputs.

211
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:33,490
So again, we're going to do grid template areas and.

212
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,960
Let's set name.

213
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,590
Email.

214
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,940
What you will do.

215
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,650
Subject.

216
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,370
Email.

217
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,750
Phone and message.

218
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,260
So we're just kind of stacking all those inputs.

219
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,450
So if I save that, we go back.

220
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,580
Now, you can see that they're all stacked.

221
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,670
So the next part is this.

222
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,960
This right here.

223
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,180
I also want to stack these.

224
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,680
So we can actually.

225
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,240
Let's actually add that up above where we put all the other stuff we want stacked.

226
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,450
So what is the selector for this?

227
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,020
So it's contact info is the grid.

228
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,190
So we can just go back here and I mean here.

229
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,640
Uh.

230
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,680
Let's say.

231
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,610
Dot.

232
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,640
Contact info.

233
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,980
And now if I save that.

234
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,600
Wait a minute.

235
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,400
Why is.

236
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,800
Contact info.

237
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,430
Hmm.

238
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,840
Actually, we might have to add the section.

239
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,310
We should do that anyway.

240
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,480
So contact B.

241
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,400
So let's do ID contact.

242
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,250
Be contact info.

243
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,210
There you go.

244
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,050
So now these are stacked.

245
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:26,200
And the reason for that is because that's the selector we used to add the the the repeat three one fa.

246
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,040
Now, that still doesn't look very good.

247
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,860
I want to separate these a little bit.

248
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,400
I also want to add a little a faint border below each one like we did on the home page.

249
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:45,920
So let's jump down here and let's target contact B

250
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,070
and we want to target the div or the divs inside.

251
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:00,320
And let's set a margin bottom of one REM.

252
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:10,250
Let's do a padding bottom of one REM and let's do a border border bottom.

253
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:19,010
So the border bottom, I'm going to set to one pixel and I'm just going to use a hard coded color.

254
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,820
I'm going to use five, five, five solid.

255
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,020
I mean, we could use a variable, but.

256
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,140
It has a dark background, so we can't use dark.

257
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,210
And I think medium is a little too light.

258
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,580
I want it to be very faint.

259
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,260
So that's why I hardcoded this.

260
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,710
But again, you can do what you want and then we don't want a border for the last child or margin or

261
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,190
padding.

262
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:53,700
So let's do ampersand last child and let's set the border to none.

263
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:01,710
Let's set margin bottom to zero and padding bottom to zero.

264
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,070
So we'll save that.

265
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,540
Go back and there we go.

266
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,610
It looks pretty good.

267
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,320
Now, I do want to make this text smaller, so I'm going to go let's see.

268
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,430
So that's section C.

269
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,500
So we want to be in contact.

270
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:26,730
We'll go under B and let's do ampersand C and we want to target the H one and it's for REM by default,

271
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,210
I believe.

272
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,730
So I'm going to set it to two REM.

273
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,430
All right, we'll save that.

274
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,150
And there he goes.

275
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,310
That looks better.

276
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,310
So this looks pretty good.

277
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,410
Let's check it out on an iPhone five.

278
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,370
So if it passes the iPhone five test, I think we're good.

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,240
And looks nice about.

280
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,530
Work.

281
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,780
Contact.

282
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,770
Good.

283
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,310
Now, the last thing I want to look at is landscape mode.

284
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,510
So I'm going to go to iPhone X and turn it.

285
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:10,430
Now, I'd like this to be in the middle on landscape mode, and you can see that the button is actually

286
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,780
outside of the the container here or the it's below the fold.

287
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,790
So we want to just move this.

288
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:24,410
So I'm going to jump in here to media success and I'm going to go with the very bottom and let's do

289
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,690
a media query for landscape.

290
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,420
So to do this, we want to target the height.

291
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:36,320
So let's do media and let's say max height of 580 pixels.

292
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,610
And we want to grab the header home.

293
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,570
So header dash home.

294
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,470
And then we want the header content which is inside of it.

295
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:57,410
So class header content and I'm going to set the padding top to just three REM.

296
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,860
So that should move it up if we go back.

297
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,280
There we go.

298
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,140
So everything is now in view.

299
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,480
All right.

300
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:13,190
And even if we go to the let's go to the galaxy and it looks good.

301
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,720
iPhone five.

302
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,500
So the iPhone five.

303
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,380
I mean, I guess.

304
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,250
It's so small, it's it's kind of hard to to deal with.

305
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,070
I guess what we could do is set another media query for the height, see how it's 320.

306
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,480
It's really small.

307
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,080
The iPhone X height is 325.

308
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,320
Let's see, the galaxy is 360, pixel is in, landscape is 411.

309
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,080
So let's set that.

310
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,150
Oops, I want to go to iPhone five.

311
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,310
Let's set 143 20.

312
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:57,800
And what we'll do is I guess, I mean, we'll reduce the, the font size of the heading here.

313
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,700
So let's actually copy this.

314
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,000
Let's say a max height of we'll do we'll do 330.

315
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,260
And if that's the case, then let's take let me see.

316
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,000
I just want to check the HTML.

317
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,270
So it's this h one right here.

318
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,790
So the header content h one which what's the size by default.

319
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,350
I didn't plan on doing this.

320
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,610
That's why I'm checking all this.

321
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,530
So the size by default is four REM, so I guess we could change it to two REM.

322
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,430
So we'll say header home header content h one.

323
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,740
And we'll set the font size to two REM.

324
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,950
See if that works out.

325
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,890
So I think that that's that's good enough.

326
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,390
