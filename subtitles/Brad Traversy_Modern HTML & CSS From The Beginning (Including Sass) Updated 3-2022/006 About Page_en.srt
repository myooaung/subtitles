1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,510
Okay.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,220
So we have the homepage done.

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,180
Now we want to move on to the about which is completely empty right now.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,310
If I click on it, it's just a blank page.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,160
So what I'll do is copy what we have in the index because we're going to be reusing some of this stuff

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,290
like the nav bar and the footer and also some of the stuff in the head.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,910
So I'm just going to copy it all.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm going to just control A to select it all and then copy it control C and let's go into about HTML

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,630
and paste it in and start at the top here.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,910
Now if you want to leave the same meta tags, description, keywords, you can do that.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,160
We don't need this this link to the font.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,680
Awesome, because we're not using any icons on this page so we can completely get rid of that.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,130
We want to keep the reference to our style CSS because that's where all of our custom styling goes for

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,670
the title.

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,150
I'm going to change the welcome to about and then we have our header which had initially has the nav

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,030
bar and the showcase, but we're not going to be using the showcase.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,650
So let's get rid of this whole div with the ID of showcase and everything in it.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,780
So now the header only has the NAV and we want to move the current class off of the home link link because

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,870
we want that to go on to the about whatever the current page is is what we want highlighted and then

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,240
we can get rid of everything else up to the footer.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,140
We just want to keep the footer, so let's save that.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,560
And now if we click on a boat, we just have our header and footer.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,110
So this is basically like the start for any page that we create on this website.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,070
And when you start to get into like let's say PHP or some JavaScript frameworks, stuff like that,

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,510
you don't have to reuse, reuse your HTML like this.

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,090
You'll be able to like import files and stuff.

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,800
But that's, that's later on, that's after you learn HTML and CSS.

28
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,060
So let's go ahead and create this.

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,600
Where is it?

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,320
Right here.

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,350
We want we have basically two sections on the about page.

32
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,510
This is going to be the about info section.

33
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,030
This is going to be the testimonial section.

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,880
So right under header, I'm going to put in a section tag and I'm going to give it an ID of a boat dash

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,660
info.

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:21,810
And inside here we want a container because we want all the content to be contained and we'll have info

37
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,460
left in info, right?

38
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:31,920
So info left class and under that let's do info right class.

39
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:45,320
So info left is going to have a heading an H one and we're going to do a boat hotel beat.

40
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:55,230
And I'm going to wrap the text about in the text primary class inside of a span because I want I wanted

41
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,810
to have that that tan color.

42
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:06,750
So let's say class text primary and we want that span to just wrap around the boat, word like that.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,940
And then underneath the H one, let's put a paragraph and let's do let's say lorem, we'll do lorem

44
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,090
30 and then let's do one more paragraph and let's do lorem 20 like that.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,610
So that's the left side.

46
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,910
Now on the right, we're just going to have an image.

47
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,570
So let's put in an image tag and the source is going to be dot slash because we're looking in the current

48
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:40,350
directory and then we want to go into the image directory and we actually want photo to JPEG and for

49
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,900
the alt I'll just put in the word hotel.

50
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,720
So let's save that, see what we get.

51
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:54,870
So we have the heading, we have the paragraph, this is, this is info left and then info right.

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,140
We just have the image in here, which is the full size image.

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,660
As you can see, you can scroll away the way over.

54
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,150
It's actually a really large image.

55
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,200
So let's add our CSS to get this looking better.

56
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,080
So we'll go to our style sheet and let's go all the way down.

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,440
So put in a comment.

58
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,750
Actually, you know what?

59
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,130
Let's leave the footer at the bottom.

60
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,200
I always I like to keep the styling of the footer at the bottom, but let's put a comment here and say

61
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,490
about info.

62
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:37,200
We have our ID about dash info and let's see for about info.

63
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,590
Actually, you know what, I don't think we have any specific style for that just, just that particular

64
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,340
div.

65
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,260
What I do want to do.

66
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,270
Is I want to add a BG class, one of our utilities.

67
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,920
I want to use BG Light.

68
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:02,560
So in addition to the ID of about info, let's add a class of BG light and save.

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,640
And as you can see, it's very faint, but it is gray, it's not white.

70
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,870
And then for the info, right let's style that.

71
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,460
So about info and then there's a class of info, right?

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:25,600
And we want to float to the right and we want to set the width to half 50% and I'm just going to set

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,020
a min height of 100%.

74
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,520
And let's see for the image, this, this, this image is inline.

75
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,080
It's not a background image.

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
And by default, it'll break out of its container.

77
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,970
So usually with images you want to set the width to 100% because what it does is it contains it 100%

78
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,340
of its container, which in this case is info.

79
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,850
Right.

80
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,830
So I'm going to copy this right here.

81
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,140
Oops, I want to copy that.

82
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,940
And we want to say image.

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,970
We want to target the IMG tag and then we want to set the width of the image.

84
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,850
Actually, you know what I'm going to do 70%, so we'll say with 70%.

85
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,670
And we also want to display it as a block.

86
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:20,590
And if you remember back in the section where we talked about display block, display inline, I showed

87
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,830
you an example of an image and I wanted to align it in the middle, but we couldn't do margin auto on

88
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,370
the image because an image by default is displayed in line.

89
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,760
So that's why I'm going to display this as block because I want to set the margin to auto.

90
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,850
All right, let's save that.

91
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,540
Good.

92
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,360
Now we want to take this, which is info left and we want to float it to the left.

93
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,210
So let's let's go right here.

94
00:06:49,210 --> 00:07:00,490
We'll say about dash info, class info, dash left and float to the left.

95
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:09,250
We'll set the width to 50% in the min height to 100% and save.

96
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,150
And there we go.

97
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,520
So now we have that floated to the left.

98
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,940
Now we need some spacing here, right?

99
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,790
Because it's right up against the header.

100
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,260
It's right up against the footer.

101
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:26,380
So a lot of times what I'll do is I'll add a utility class for padding and sometimes for margin.

102
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:34,660
So I'm going to go to my style, my utilities up here, utility classes that we've been creating and

103
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,640
let's create one for padding.

104
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:43,870
So we'll say padding, we'll just say padding and let's do some p y padding.

105
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,350
And what I mean by p, we want to make this a class.

106
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,900
What I mean by py is the y axis.

107
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:59,320
So padding for the top and bottom and let's do p one and we'll make that padding on the top and bottom

108
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:08,380
ten pixels oc we could even since this is only going to be one property, we could go like that and

109
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,090
copy it down and then we'll do P two.

110
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,680
Even if we're not using them right now, we could have them available for the future if we were going

111
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,970
to add more pages.

112
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,970
So let's say 20 pixels, 30 pixels.

113
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,820
So we have these different padding classes now and I'm going to save it and I'm going to go and add

114
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,060
one to the about info.

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:39,760
So right here about info in addition to BG LT let's do padding y-3, which should be 30 pixels on the

116
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,720
top and bottom.

117
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,770
Let's save.

118
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,700
And there we go.

119
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,520
So now we have some spacing here.

120
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,900
And then whenever we have a section where we want to add some padding to the top and bottom, we can

121
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,360
simply put in one of these utility classes.

122
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,970
So this is this stuff is is it's not mandatory.

123
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,430
I mean, we could put a put padding on the about info, but I think it's much cleaner to do it this

124
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,200
way because you have these classes that are available to you whenever, whenever you want, as opposed

125
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,200
to just having senseless padding and and background colors for every single element.

126
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,530
You just have these classes, you can add kind of like a framework.

127
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,050
So let's move on here.

128
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
What else did I want to do?

129
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,520
I think that's oh, we want to make the image circle or we want to add a radius to the image.

130
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:39,730
So to do that, we just need to go back to our CSS and go down to where we have our image, which is

131
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,030
we've written credit, quite a bit of CSS already.

132
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,130
So right here, this, this IMG tag, we just want to add a border radius to this.

133
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,760
So we'll say border dash radius and we're going to set it to 50% and save.

134
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,160
And now you'll see that it's a circular image.

135
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:03,340
Now, the last thing I want to do is make this heading bigger, because right now I have it as an H

136
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,370
one, which is the biggest heading, and I still want the text bigger.

137
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,910
So I'm going to add a class to it and I'm going to call this LX dash heading.

138
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,700
So we'll call the we'll do large heading and we'll use this as a utility because we can use it on other

139
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,900
headings as well.

140
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,130
So let's go up here and let's see.

141
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,380
We'll go right under the clear.

142
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:36,580
We'll go right here and say dot lx dash heading and I'm just going to set the font size to let's do

143
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,670
40 pixels and save and there we go.

144
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,230
So now the text is bigger.

145
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,610
So let's move on to the next section, which is going to be the testimonials.

146
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,530
And since we have the clear I mean, we have the floats here, we have to clear them.

147
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,540
So we're going to add a class of Claire, which we already have in our class, and then we'll add our

148
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,200
section with the ID of testimonials.

149
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:09,340
And I'm also going to add a class here of py3 because I want to add padding here as well.

150
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,270
Then we want our container so you can see the you can see the pattern here.

151
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,060
Just it's just sections stacked on top of each other.

152
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,890
And then we have our container to move the content in the middle if we want some kind of background

153
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,510
image or something, we put it on the section which I'm actually going to do.

154
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:35,110
So inside the testimonials, let's see, we're going to have a heading, let's do an H two.

155
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,620
But I'm also going to give this a class of L dash heading because I want it to be large and we'll say

156
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,850
what our guests say.

157
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,480
So those are H two.

158
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,790
Let's add testimonial.

159
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:59,290
So basically we're going to have two testimonials here and we're going to give them a class of testimonial

160
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:05,920
and also BG primary because we want it to we want them to have this tan background.

161
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,710
So let's do a class of testimonial.

162
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,680
And inside the testimonial we're going to have the image of the person.

163
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,230
So this is going to go to slash image and then let's pick person one JPEG for the ALZ.

164
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,640
I don't know, we'll just give her a name, we'll say Samantha.

165
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,880
And then under the image is the testimonial.

166
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,750
So it'll be a paragraph and let's do Lorem 40.

167
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,670
So that's one testimonial.

168
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,830
And I'm going to give the div here.

169
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:52,450
Also a class of BG primary which will give it that colour, that background color.

170
00:12:52,450 --> 00:13:00,580
And then we can just copy this whole div, the whole testimonial and go on to the next down here and

171
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,660
just change the image to person two and we'll change the name.

172
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,370
Is it they both female Yeah.

173
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,710
So we'll just change the name to I don't know.

174
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:15,430
Jen So let's save and let's take a look so it doesn't look too good.

175
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,800
So let's go ahead and add some CSS.

176
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,010
So right below the where we did the about stuff.

177
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:35,980
Let's do ID testimonials and I want the height to be 600 pixels and let's give it a background image

178
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,380
of let's do a URL.

179
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,300
It's going to be outside of the CSS folder, into the images folder and then into and then we want to

180
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,500
test BG.

181
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,050
We don't want it to repeat.

182
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,550
We'll do center, center slash cover.

183
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,320
We want the whole image to show.

184
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,630
And then let's add let's do a padding top of 40 pixels just to push the heading and all this stuff down

185
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,320
right here.

186
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:04,890
All right.

187
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,940
So this is the testimonials, 600 pixels area.

188
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,620
And as you can see, everything is is busting out and it's because of the size of the images.

189
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,690
So I'm going to grab those images.

190
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,730
So let's say testimonial.

191
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,770
And then each one of those testimonials has a class of testimonial.

192
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:34,530
And then I'm going to grab on to the image and I'm going to give it let's see, let's do a width of

193
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,260
100 pixels and save.

194
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,090
Wait a minute.

195
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,360
Oh, this should be testimonials.

196
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,670
So now that the images are smaller, it doesn't bust out of its container anymore.

197
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,650
So let's see.

198
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,670
Let's let's do this.

199
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,500
Let's start from here and go down.

200
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,120
So this h two.

201
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,770
Oh, it's an h2i believe.

202
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:12,440
Say testimonials dot we want to target the H two and we're going to set the color to white and let's,

203
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,540
let's align it to the center.

204
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,250
So text align center and let's do padding bottom 40 pixels.

205
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,370
Why isn't that?

206
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,520
Or Oh, I put you see how I put this testimonial.

207
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,220
It's this h two is not within either of these divs and these divs have the class of testimonials.

208
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,060
So this is wrong.

209
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,230
We just want that.

210
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,810
Here we go.

211
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,730
So let's see.

212
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,760
So for the testimonial div, I want to add some styles for that.

213
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,140
So I'm going to copy this because that one's for the image.

214
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,710
This is for the actual div I'm going to set.

215
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,970
Some padding.

216
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,040
Let's do 20 pixels.

217
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,210
Let's do some margin bottom just to push push them down.

218
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,260
And if we added more testimonials with the with a div with the class of testimonial, this would apply

219
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,400
to those as well.

220
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,460
So let's see, margin.

221
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,660
Bottom 40 pixels.

222
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,730
Let's do over.

223
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,070
Actually, I'll I'll do that after.

224
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,870
Let's save that.

225
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,250
And then I want the image to float to the left.

226
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,090
And we don't have to make the text float to the right.

227
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,340
It'll automatically push the text over.

228
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:45,160
So in the image, let's say float left and save.

229
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,010
So now the image is float to the left and it's right up against the edge, though.

230
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,720
So I'm going to add some margin right to the image to push the text over.

231
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,960
So margin, right, it's 220 pixels.

232
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,420
Push the text over.

233
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,680
Let's also make the image rounded.

234
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,470
So we'll add a border radius of 50%.

235
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,710
And there we go.

236
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,740
That looks pretty good.

237
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,050
Let's see for the testimonial itself.

238
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,569
Let's give that let's give do a little bit of rounded corner here.

239
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:29,590
So the testimonial class, I'll do border dash radius.

240
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,810
Let's do five pixels.

241
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:37,450
So it has a little bit of a rounded corner and then I want it to be a little bit see through.

242
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:45,490
So in CSS we have a property called opacity where we can make the the element opaque, so basically

243
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:55,330
transparent and we can add a value from zero to or 0 to 1 where one is, is what it is now not see through

244
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,510
it all and zero is completely transparent.

245
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,550
So basically the higher the, the, the less transparent.

246
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,840
So I want to do 0.9 because I want it to be barely transparent.

247
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,190
So right here for our testimonial div, let's do opacity 0.9 and save.

248
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,500
And you can see you can barely see through it.

249
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,060
If I do 0.5 and save now you can really see through it.

250
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:29,560
But the problem here is when you when you add opacity to a div like this, it also makes everything

251
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,820
within it opaque.

252
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,760
So even the text we can't really read, the image we can see through and that's not really what we want.

253
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,820
Even if we wanted the background to be really see through like this, really transparent and we wanted

254
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,950
the text to be really readable, we would have to do something different, we'd have to add another

255
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,730
element and then make just the background see through.

256
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,050
So basically we'd have to add an overlay and I'm going to show you how to do that later on.

257
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,280
Not right now.

258
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,780
If you want it to be just a little bit see through, then you could add it to the whole div like we

259
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,460
are now because it's, it's such a small amount that the text is still readable.

260
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,160
The image, you can still see the image, but at the same time it's still a little opaque.

261
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,760
So I'll show you how to do an overlay later on.

262
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,850
So I think that's it.

263
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,440
Yeah, that looks pretty good.

264
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,690
Let's see, let's compare it with that.

265
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,200
Yeah.

266
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,370
So that's good.

267
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,480
Wait, why is it?

268
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,890
Did I miss some padding?

269
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,150
I think I did.

270
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,010
Uh, let's see.

271
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,530
Testimony.

272
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,450
Oh, I had you know what?

273
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,670
I had 100 pixels padding on the top.

274
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,970
There we go.

275
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,410
Okay.

276
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,470
So that's our Bo page.

277
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,030
It's I mean, there's not a ton of content, but I think it looks pretty good.

278
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,950
I think the homepage looks pretty good.

279
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,380
So especially if this is your first website.

280
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,640
In the next video, we're going to start on the contact page, which just has a form.

281
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,520
We have some icons and and that should be it.

282
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:01,880
All right.

283
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,260
So I'll see you in the next one.
