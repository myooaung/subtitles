1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.430
So now we're going to get started on the overlay with the list items.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.320
We have our toddler all set.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:15.330
So let's go down here and let's say menu wrap and let's style the menu class itself.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:29.850
So we're going to position this to fixed and set it to top zero, left zero and set the width to 100%.

6
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.230
We want it to go all the way across.

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.320
We also want it to be 100% up and down.

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.150
So basically like an overlay.

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.380
Now initially we're going to want the visibility to be set to hidden.

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.920
But if I do that now, I won't be able to see it to style it.

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.660
So I'm just going to comment that out for now.

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.800
We'll come back to it.

13
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:59.430
Let's set the overflow to hidden and let's display this as flex because we want to center everything.

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:11.160
So we'll say display, flex and align items to the center and justify content to the center.

15
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.070
All right.

16
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.020
So if we go ahead and save that now, you can see the list items are in the middle here.

17
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.430
All right.

18
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.030
So now we want to take care of the menu overlay, which is basically the dark part.

19
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.710
So when we click this this this dark area right here.

20
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.880
So for that, we're going to take menu wrap.

21
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.100
Say menu, wrap menu, and then it's going to be the direct div.

22
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.750
If you remember, our menu class has two divs in it before the UL, so we're targeting that first one

23
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.800
and we're going to set a background and I'm going to use the primary color I'm sorry, the overlay color.

24
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.520
Now if I save that, you'll see that it's only overlaying the, the, the, the menu itself.

25
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:16.730
Now I'm going to set the width to 200 and I'm going to use viewport widths here and then height.

26
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.130
I'm also going to set to 200 viewport widths.

27
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.020
Now the reason for that is I want it to extend pretty far.

28
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.700
So when this is the finished one, if I click this, it extends.

29
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.160
You see how it scales up.

30
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.180
It scales up to 200 viewport widths in both the height and the the width.

31
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.270
So let's see now what we want to do.

32
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.240
You can see that the stuff has disappeared.

33
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.670
So we're going to go ahead and say Display, flex.

34
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.260
And let's align ups.

35
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.450
We want to align items to the center and also justify content to the center.

36
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.560
And now it's back.

37
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.720
So we're just recentering everything.

38
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.950
Let's see.

39
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.370
Next thing we want is to add a transition here

40
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.340
and we're going to do transition all 0.4 seconds and eas.

41
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.580
Now what we want to transition is the scale.

42
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.760
So we want this to start off with a scale of zero.

43
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.570
So let's say transform and then scale.

44
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.110
And if we set this to zero and I save, you'll see it disappears.

45
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.670
So scale zero, it's just it's not there.

46
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.500
It's scaled down to nothing.

47
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.210
And then what we want to happen is when we click this, we want it to scale upwards.

48
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.530
So that's what's happening.

49
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.040
When you see this open, it's scaling up and it's transitioning.

50
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.730
However, I can't see anything anymore.

51
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.990
So again, I'm going to just comment that out for now just so we can see this to style it.

52
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.130
All right.

53
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.540
Now, let's see.

54
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.400
I think I think that's that's good for this div.

55
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.170
Now, the next one, I'm going to just copy this.

56
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.279
And let's paste that in and target the next div.

57
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:30.720
So let's see for this one, we're going to text a line center, so we'll save that.

58
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.060
And I can see that these are aligned in the center.

59
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.250
We're going to do a max

60
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.500
width of let's do 90 viewport widths so it wouldn't go beyond 90 viewport widths.

61
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.150
And this is inside the dark, inside the the part where scaling and then the max height, we're going

62
00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:02.070
to set to 100 viewport heights and we're going to set opacity to zero.

63
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.380
All right.

64
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.580
Now, if I save that, it disappears.

65
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.730
So again, I'm going to comment this out.

66
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.240
The parts that are that actually the basically the starting points nothing shows.

67
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.270
So we need to comment all that stuff out for now.

68
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.490
And then when we're ready, we'll bring it back in.

69
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.540
Now, let's see what else we want to do here.

70
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.250
We need to add a transition and we want to transition the opacity.

71
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.330
Now, just to let you know what's going on here, when we click this, you'll see that it scales up,

72
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.700
but then you see how that fades in.

73
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.570
It doesn't come in with the scale, it fades in afterwards.

74
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.240
So that's the div that we're working with right now.

75
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.850
So we want to transform the opacity.

76
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.580
Let's do 0.4 seconds ese.

77
00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:03.120
So that way it'll just kind of fade in after this div scales in and then I think we should be good here.

78
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.310
So let's go back and now let's start to style what this looks like here.

79
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.770
So let's grab on to the list item.

80
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.120
So I'm going to copy this and let's put this in and we're just going to use the angle brackets.

81
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.000
I know in a lot of these cases we don't need to like right here, but we'll just use it and we'll say

82
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.480
UL and then ly and then we're going to remove the bullet.

83
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.610
So let's say list style none.

84
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.220
So that gets rid of the bullets.

85
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.920
Let's set color to white, even though that's not going to change the link color.

86
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.790
But just in case there is a list item that is not that is not a link.

87
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.270
And then we can just inherit we can just do color inherit for the a tag and we're going to set the font

88
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.350
size here.

89
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:06.490
So let's say font size, let's do 1.5 REM and let's do that.

90
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.300
Should be good.

91
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.560
Let's save that.

92
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.360
So.

93
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.870
Oh, we need some padding here.

94
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.270
It's too padding

95
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.290
to REM.

96
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.460
Oh, that's too much.

97
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:33.160
I'm kind of experimenting a little bit from my initial my initial one here because I use pixels, and

98
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.810
now I'm trying I want to use REM.

99
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.070
So that looks good.

100
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.200
Now the links, we have to take care of those.

101
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.760
So let's copy this.

102
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.040
And let's say we want to target the a tag.

103
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.500
And if we say color, inherit and save, that's they're going to turn white.

104
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.020
We also want to do text decoration, none and save.

105
00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:58.750
All right.

106
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.020
Now for the hover, I want to use a secondary color.

107
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:11.020
So I'm going to just grab this and let's do colon hover and let's say color far.

108
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.830
Secondary color.

109
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.850
All right.

110
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.540
So now when I hover over it, we get that that secondary color.

111
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.920
But I want it to be transition.

112
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:37.549
So I'm going to add to the link a transition of I'll just do color transition, color 0.4 seconds and

113
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.390
ease.

114
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.260
So now we get that nice transition.

115
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.530
So there's really only a couple of things left to do.

116
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:52.370
We need to hide all of this initially, which basically we just need to uncomment the things that we've

117
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.730
commented out and then we need to have an event.

118
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.040
Well, it's not well, I guess it is an event.

119
00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.000
It's the checked event.

120
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.930
When we check this, we want that stuff to show.

121
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.580
We want it to scale up.

122
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.490
We want that first div to scale up the second div.

123
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:15.770
We want to bring in to opacity one and we also want to set the visibility from hidden to show.

124
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.720
All right, I'm sorry, visible.

125
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.100
So let's uncomment opacity right here.

126
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:31.160
So that's the the inner div and then scale is the outer div and then visibility, the menu has visibility

127
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.520
hidden.

128
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.870
So we're going to uncomment all of those and save and that's going to make it all disappear.

129
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.900
So now we want it to come back when we click this.

130
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.060
So we're going to add that stuff up here.

131
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:50.420
So first one, let's do let's say show menu.

132
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:59.300
So we're going to say dot menu wrap and this is all going to happen when the toddler is checked.

133
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.320
So we simply want to do toddler checked.

134
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:12.800
Now we want to target the class of menu and we can't do like dot menu like that because it's not within

135
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.760
the toddler.

136
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.120
Right.

137
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.560
And we can't do that.

138
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.990
We can't even do plus because it's not directly after the hamburger is directly after.

139
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:29.030
So the way that we can target this menu from this checkbox is using the Till de OC, which I can't remember

140
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:36.470
if I actually I showed you this before, but we can use this to target something that precedes another

141
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.950
element.

142
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:45.230
So we want to grab the menu and we want to set that visibility to visible because remember initially

143
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.670
we set it to hidden.

144
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:53.300
So now we're checking, hitting the check thing and or the checkbox and we're setting menu to visibility.

145
00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:01.250
Visibility visible now we still can't see it because it's the inner div is scaled down.

146
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.030
Right.

147
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:07.280
So we have to add another basically another event with this toggle or checked.

148
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:22.250
So we're going to grab this and we want to take that first div and transform scale and we want to scale

149
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.630
to one.

150
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:24.980
All right.

151
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.090
And then let's add a transition.

152
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.080
Duration and I'm going to use that menu speed.

153
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:43.640
So let's say var dash dash menu, dash speed and let me just make sure I set that.

154
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.570
Yeah, I did.

155
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.130
All right.

156
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.690
So if I save that.

157
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.460
Okay.

158
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.060
So now that opens.

159
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.170
Oh, you know what?

160
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:57.880
We didn't make it circular, so we didn't add the border radius where we were supposed to.

161
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:06.900
So we need to go to that first div and let's add border radius unless you want it to be square.

162
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.850
But I think it looks cool as a circle.

163
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.800
So let's see.

164
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.140
That's still not quite right.

165
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:15.910
All right.

166
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.100
I'll figure out what's wrong afterwards.

167
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:25.890
Let's add the the last one, which is going to let's see, we go back up here.

168
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.970
The last one, which is going to set the which is going to bring the items in.

169
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.310
Right.

170
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.230
Because it's set to opacity zero.

171
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:38.530
So we want to target those, which is going to be the inner div and we want to set opacity

172
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:55.600
to one because it's initially set to zero and let's say transition, opacity, 0.4 seconds ease and

173
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.710
let's add a delay.

174
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.830
So we'll do 0.4 seconds delay.

175
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.770
So now if we click that.

176
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.590
It's almost working.

177
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.440
But we have an issue with the circle here.

178
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.430
So let me just see what what's going on here.

179
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.740
All right, guys.

180
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:21.380
So since this is in a flex, the width is being affected.

181
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:28.430
So all we have to do is in this initial dive right here, the directive after menu is add a property

182
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.870
of flex none.

183
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.230
So let's put this right here.

184
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:39.980
So if we say flex none and save, and now let's reload the page.

185
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.950
So we click this and now it scales out all the way.

186
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.610
And it's not it's not bound into the the window here.

187
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.050
All right, cool.

188
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.400
So let's bring it out.

189
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.230
Still looks good.

190
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.250
Let's bring it in.

191
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.760
Good.

192
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.560
I mean, we can still see the circle.

193
00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:01.590
And like I said, if you want to extend this, like you could add a media query and extend this to like

194
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.610
300.

195
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.240
Yeah.

196
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.280
So now you don't have that effect.

197
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.840
But it takes longer.

198
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.910
So it doesn't take longer.

199
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.330
But it goes does it go fast?

200
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.940
It looks like it's going faster.

201
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.980
No, it's not.

202
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:27.590
So you could you can increase that if you don't like the the circle, you know, when it's on smaller

203
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.460
screens.

204
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.310
But I think it's fine.

205
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.420
I think it looks cool.

206
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.460
All right, so that's it, guys.

207
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.350
Hopefully you enjoyed this little project.

208
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.990
And like I said, feel free to to use this in future projects.

209
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.240
It's a nice little nice little menu.

210
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.500
And you could basically attach it to any UI or any website.

211
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:56.000
And like I said, if you want to try and turn this into a full fledged website using this menu, maybe

212
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.090
that could be a little challenge for you, but that's it.

213
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.650
I'll see you in the next video.
