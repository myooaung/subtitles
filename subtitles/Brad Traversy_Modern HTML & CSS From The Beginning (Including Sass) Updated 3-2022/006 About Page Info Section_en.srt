1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,760
So we finished the index page here in terms of the desktop view.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,570
We will do some stuff, you know, for a responsive design later.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,460
Now we're going to move to the about page.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,450
So in this code, we're going to let's actually create a new file in the dist folder.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,840
You want to make sure you're in the dist folder and we're going to call this about HTML.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,600
Now what I'm going to do is copy everything from the index and then get rid of most of it because there

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,080
is some stuff here we need, such as all the head head data.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:41,850
I'm sorry, head head mark up here as well as the footer and also some of the stuff from the header.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,040
So as far as this goes, is this this can all be the same actually.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:59,310
We can change the can go ahead and change the title here to about me and then let's delete everything

12
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,500
from section A down to the top, down to section C.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,300
So we want to leave the footer there.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,980
We also want to leave the reference.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,880
Actually, I'm sorry, we want to delete the reference to the typewriter script because we no longer

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,390
need that.

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,920
That's only on the home page.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,970
And let's see in the header, we're going to actually cut this down quite a bit.

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,930
So we want to change the ID now to head our inner.

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,130
We want to keep the container, we want to keep the nav.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,420
That should all be the same, except we want to move the current class from home.

22
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,380
Now that we're on the about page, we want to move that to about K and then we can get rid of the whole

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,390
header content div right here.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,470
You don't need that and that should be good.

25
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:57,360
Now if we save this and we go back and we go to about I'm sorry, that's, that's the finished product.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,550
Let's go to a boat and now it looks like this.

27
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,250
So let's deal with the header inner.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,800
Obviously the image is not showing here.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:13,950
So we're going to jump into main dot seas and go up to where we have our header stuff.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,220
So where it says header enter here where I'm actually going to copy the background image.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,710
So I'll grab this background in height and in the header dash inner.

32
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,750
We're going to have the same background image, except I just want to change the position a little bit.

33
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:39,660
Instead of center right, I'm going to do 20% on the x axis and then let's do 30% on the Y just to kind

34
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,240
of move it a little bit, just so the head of the guy isn't covering the logo or anything.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,110
And then the height, I'm just going to set to 5.5 REM.

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,690
And then I also want to have a border, a border on the bottom to kind of separate it from the rest

37
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,430
of the content, which will be three pixels solid and I want to make it the main colour.

38
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,410
So if we save that and we go back, it's going to look like this.

39
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,560
So let's see.

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,100
Now we want to deal with the rest of the about content and we're going to start with this area.

41
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,460
So this is going to be about a it's going to be a section and I want to use grid template areas.

42
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,600
So we'll have like the bio I'm sorry, the bio image, the bio and then award one, two and three.

43
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,930
So let's go to about HTML.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:42,300
We'll go directly under the the header here and let's just say section A, I guess it's the info.

45
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:50,280
So we're going to create a section and let's give it an ID of about since we're on the about page and

46
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:59,430
then a and a class of text, class of text dash center and let's do P three for some padding.

47
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,580
We also want a container to move everything to the middle.

48
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,960
We want a title.

49
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,920
So section dash title.

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,970
And we're going to say about me and let's do bottom line div.

51
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,050
Okay.

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,000
And then we're going to do a paragraph with the class of lead.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:32,400
And we're just going to say, let me tell you a little about myself and what I do.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,960
And then we're going to have a class of let's do info.

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,170
And this is where this this info here, let's call it about info.

56
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,310
This is going to be the grid and then the items will be the template areas that will assign within the

57
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,240
CCIS.

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,060
So let's first have our image.

59
00:04:53,070 --> 00:05:04,890
I'm going to give it a class of bio dash image and let's give it a source of IMG.

60
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,010
You want to go img slash and it's the about JPEG.

61
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,210
All right.

62
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,950
And then underneath that, we're going to have a div with the class of bio.

63
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,830
And I want to give this a light background.

64
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,060
So I don't we didn't create the background classes yet, but we will do that.

65
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,380
So I'm going to do BG Dash Light because I wanted to have a light grey background and then let's do

66
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:43,350
an H for and let's say we'll just say your project is in safe hands and if you don't like this text,

67
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,310
you can change it.

68
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,930
And then I'm just going to do like, let's say lorem 30.

69
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,430
So underneath this div of bio and bg lt we're going to have our awards.

70
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:05,380
So let's do a class of award, dash one and we're going to use the award icon.

71
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:11,830
So we want to do AI with the class of face and then a dash award.

72
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:20,470
And then for the size we're going to do fa-3x and then let's put an H three and we'll just say award,

73
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,540
award one and then some text.

74
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,020
We'll do.

75
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,000
We'll do.

76
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,500
It's just not working.

77
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm ten and I'm just going to copy the award div.

78
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,510
So we'll do two, three of them and we're just going to change the class here to two, this 1 to 3,

79
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,430
we'll keep the same icon.

80
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,110
Let's just change up this text.

81
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,580
So this will be award two, this will be award three.

82
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,970
So that should be it for this section.

83
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,990
So we'll save it.

84
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,280
And if we go back, this is what it's going to look like without styling.

85
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:07,770
So let's head into let's let's do our utility first, our background colors because I want to be able

86
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,680
to assign BG dark.

87
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,200
BG Light what else?

88
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,430
BG Main.

89
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,440
So we'll add those classes.

90
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,630
Let's put it.

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Let's go under the buttons.

92
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,420
So go right here.

93
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,170
Backgrounds.

94
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:40,090
So let's let's take class B, g and then we're going to add in here ampersand dash main, which will

95
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,190
be BG Dash Main.

96
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,940
And then I'm going to set a background.

97
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,160
Of main dash color.

98
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,460
And then for the color, this is where we definitely want to use set text color, which is the function

99
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,550
that we created and we want to pass in the same as the background.

100
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,450
All right.

101
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:13,600
And then I'm just going to grab this and let's have four of these, except this is we're going to change

102
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,230
to dark.

103
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,750
I'm going to do control DX one, one time, two times and then just do dark.

104
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,580
Same thing here.

105
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,430
We'll do light and let's also do medium.

106
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,179
So that way we can have all the different colors as backgrounds if we want, and the text will adapt

107
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,970
to what it should be so it can contrast.

108
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:43,570
All right, so now we have that down.

109
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:50,980
So we want to start to deal with aligning all the stuff that's in this about info class.

110
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,160
So we're going to do this, let's see in our main source.

111
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,440
Let's go back below the home.

112
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,520
Uh, let's see.

113
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,700
There's a lot of stuff in the home, so that ends here.

114
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,210
So let's do about sections.

115
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,530
So we have about and then we want to style the A section.

116
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:28,790
So we'll do an amp, dash A and we have our about dash info.

117
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,410
We want to display that as grid.

118
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:39,830
So grid items except we're going to use grid template areas which we haven't I don't think we've used

119
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:46,730
in a project yet and in grid template areas is basically just a visualization of how you want it set.

120
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,240
So we're going to have the bio image and then the bio.

121
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,490
So the bio is going to extend further than the image, as you can see right here.

122
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,220
So we have bio and then bio bio.

123
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,320
So this is longer and then down below we want the three awards.

124
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:18,170
So let's go on to the next line here and let's do we'll just say aw1, aw2 and aw3.

125
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,580
So that's this is visually how we want it set up.

126
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,240
So we have to assign the grid areas.

127
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,360
Actually, let me just add a grid gap first.

128
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,900
Let's put a semicolon there and let's say grid gap and we'll do 1.2 REM.

129
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:47,730
Now under the about info, let's set up our grid areas so we have a class of bio image and I call it

130
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,280
image or img.

131
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,690
So right here.

132
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,440
But let's do.

133
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,260
Yeah, we'll keep image I guess so.

134
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,720
Bio image.

135
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:07,080
We want to set that grid area to the bio image grid area which is this right here.

136
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:15,060
We want to put this inside that or assign that to that and then let's also grab the bio.

137
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:22,560
So class of bio, we're going to assign that grid area to bio.

138
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,710
And then I'm also going to add just a border left just to give it a little bit of just a little bit

139
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,640
of style.

140
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,880
So we'll do three pixels solid and let's make it the main color.

141
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,810
Okay.

142
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,460
And then we'll just do some padding.

143
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,530
Let's do 0.8 REM.

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,810
So that's that.

145
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,430
Now we want to do the three awards.

146
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:57,110
So remember we have the class of award dash one which we'll set to the grid area of aw1 above.

147
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:07,070
And then I'll just copy this and let's do award two and let's do award three.

148
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,110
Now the icon for the award.

149
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,290
I just want to make it the main colour.

150
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,150
So I'm going to go down here and just grab all of them.

151
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,890
So we'll say award one.

152
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,040
To, uh.

153
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,610
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,850
I want to grab the icon.

155
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,730
So we want the class of face in each one face.

156
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,630
Don Award dash three f as.

157
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,770
Okay.

158
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:52,850
And then let's make the color, the main color, and I'm just going to add a little bit of margin one

159
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,420
rim.

160
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,640
Give it some space.

161
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,890
So let's go back and there we go.

162
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,800
So we set the bio to this grid area.

163
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,390
I'm sorry, the bio image, then the bio to stretch across basically two columns and then the award.

164
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,760
Each award goes in each column.

165
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,020
So I think we'll go ahead and stop here.

166
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,300
And in the next video we'll continue on with the progress bars and the rest of the about page.
