00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,740
All right, guys, in this video, I just want to show you the next project we'll be building, which

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,710
is a portfolio project that uses SAS.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,640
Now, the inspiration for the look of this site comes from a template that I found on Mobi Ryzhkov.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,280
So I just wanted to show you guys this real quick, and it's just a one page, it's just a single page.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,670
Our template is going to be multiple pages.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,090
I didn't even look at the HTML or the CSS for this.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,270
And then as far as this typing effect here, the typing effect we're using comes from my JavaScript

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,760
tutorial on YouTube.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,810
So if you're interested in the actual JavaScript, you can just search for JavaScript typing effect.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:47,100
And the first result here will be my tutorial that shows you exactly what's going on as far as this

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,490
course.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,560
We're just going to kind of include the file.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,980
So we have a landing page here with a background image.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,180
This logo up here pertains to the the developer's name, John Doe.

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,430
Now, I did include the PSD file.

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,470
If you want to change the initials, if you want to use your own logo, if you want to use text here,

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,520
if you don't want to use anything here, whatever you want to do is fine if you're going to use this

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,830
as your own portfolio or whatever.

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,270
And then we have the menu over here with the different pages, which I'll show you in a second.

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,750
We have a button to go to the work page, and then down here we have what John specializes in some font

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,040
awesome icons.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,610
And then here we have some more icons with clients, awards, hours worked, projects completed, creative

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,270
process.

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,750
So down here we're going to add some visual effects using transitions footers, pretty simple.

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,840
Just have some social media icons with a hover effect.

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,240
And then the about page, you can see we're still using that same background image, but we're pushing

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,630
it up into the nav bar and then we have the about section.

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,540
We're actually going to be using grid template areas here.

29
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,520
Then we have some progress bars, so we'll be creating these from scratch.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,130
I know that Progress bars are included with frameworks like Bootstrap and stuff like that, but we'll

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,520
be creating these with just HTML and CSS.

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,960
We have some logos here, some testimonials, and then on the work page we have some images with some

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,220
overlay effects.

34
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,290
So we'll be using some CSS transitions here as well I think looks pretty nice.

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,550
All these images will be included in the project files as well.

36
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,730
So let's take a look at the contact page, which is very simple.

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,230
We just have a form here.

38
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,780
We have this section with the email, phone and address, big text that says, let's start your next

39
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,400
project and the footer.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,060
All right.

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,160
So now let's take a look at the responsiveness of this.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,160
So I'm going to open up my chrome tools and let's hit the device icon here.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,830
So this is what it would look like on an iPad, which is very similar to what it looks like on desktop.

44
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,100
Basically, everything is is pretty much the same.

45
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:06,150
So let's look at let's say iPhone X, so on on smaller devices, smartphones, we're just going to kind

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,890
of narrow the header down to just the logo and the menu centered and then everything else is just nicely

47
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,570
stacked on top of each other.

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,200
For the about page, you can see everything is nicely stacked.

49
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,260
Testimonials, Progress, bars, the work page.

50
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,010
We just have the images and then the contact page.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,620
Everything is nice and stacked as well.

52
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,700
All right.

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,440
So that's the responsiveness of it.

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,610
So that's it, guys.

55
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,720
Hopefully you enjoy this.

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,590
Let's jump in to the next video and start to set up our SAS environment.
