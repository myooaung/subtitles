00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.870
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.980
So now we're going to deploy a website to a platform called Net Phi, which is just a fantastic platform

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.310
for hosting static websites as well as front end applications using JavaScript frameworks like React

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.930
and Vue.js and that stuff you'll get into later if you're just getting into web development.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.160
But what's really cool about Nullify is they give you a lot for free.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.590
So we can deploy for free, we can host our website, they even give us an sstl for free.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.980
We can add our own domain name, which we'll do later on.

8
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.320
And then there's also extra features such as contact form submissions.

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.560
So if we go down here, you can see that we can simply add a PHI attribute to the form tag and we'll

10
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.830
be able to receive submissions in our net ified dashboard.

11
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.080
So if you recall, when we deployed to a shared host in order to make the contact forum work, it was

12
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.160
it was quite a bit of work.

13
00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.810
We had to implement a PHP script to be able to mail it to our email address, which wasn't even the

14
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.920
best way to do it.

15
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.380
So this gives you a very simple and secure way to add give functionality to your contact forms.

16
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270
So what you need to do is, first of all, sign up for NetFlow Fi.

17
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.600
It's absolutely free to sign up, no credit card or anything like that.

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.110
And then once you log in, you'll see this new site from Get Button and you can choose GitHub, GitLab,

19
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.950
Bitbucket.

20
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.100
So Get is a version control system and it's something that you're going to need to learn.

21
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.590
If you're going to be a web developer, that's something like 95% of dev companies use Git.

22
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.590
And for this particular for what we're doing now, you're only going to need to use a couple commands

23
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.580
and I'm going to put a document in the section with those commands.

24
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.780
I'm also going to put a link to a crash course that I have on YouTube.

25
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.680
Forget that you might be interested in, but you will have to download it.

26
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.740
So you go to get Dash Nme.com just go ahead and download it and if you're on Windows you'll get a tool

27
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.039
called Get Bash, which is just a better command line or a better terminal for Windows than the standard

28
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.280
one.

29
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.169
So I would suggest using that.

30
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.810
And then also the last thing I want you to do is create a GitHub account if you don't have one.

31
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.290
All right.

32
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.570
I'm actually logged in right now and GitHub is just a place to store your repositories.

33
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.130
So you store your code here.

34
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.720
And all we have to do, as I showed you from PHI, is bring over a GitHub repository and we can actually

35
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.860
host our website.

36
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.280
It'll even it'll give us a really weird domain name, but we can, we can add our own custom domain

37
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.900
name, which we're going to do as well.

38
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.470
All right.

39
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.510
So just do those three things.

40
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.530
Sign up for net phi sign create an account at GitHub dot com and download Git to your local to your

41
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.220
machine.

42
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.710
All right, so once you do those things, we're ready to move on to the next video where we'll initialize

43
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.590
a get repository and we'll push it to GitHub.
