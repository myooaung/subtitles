1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.060
So in the last video we created our core HTML, our head tags and all that.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.390
Our fabric icon linked our style sheets, created the HTML for the nav bar.

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.640
And now we're going to style.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.480
We're going to add our base styles and we're going to style our nav bar.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.550
So let's go to Style CSS and we're going to use some variables in this project.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.810
So on the root scope, I'm going to create some variables mostly for colors.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.270
And this makes it really easy if you wanted to switch up the color scheme, so let's add one called

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.060
primary dash color and I'm going to set this to a dark, a dark red.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.990
So basically if we look at the project, this color here that you see this button, this right here,

11
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.670
this is going to be the primary color.

12
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.030
And then this orange color that sports has that this button has is going to be the secondary.

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.180
And then we're also going to have a light color and a dark color.

14
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.560
So this will be the dark.

15
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.770
And then this the background here, this is going to be the light.

16
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.030
So the red is going to be hexadecimal c72727.

17
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:21.330
Then we're going to do secondary dash color and that's going to be hexadecimal F nine, nine, 500.

18
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:36.330
Let's do light color and that's going to be F three, three times and then dark color is going to be

19
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.560
three, three, three.

20
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.700
All right.

21
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.940
I'm also going to set the max width of the layout here.

22
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.440
So let's say max width and we'll do 1100 pixels.

23
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.060
Now, the sports I'm sorry, not this point.

24
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.120
The categories like sports, entertainment, technology, these all, as you can see, have their own

25
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.290
colors as well.

26
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.780
Now, these are going to have a class called category.

27
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.270
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to set a scope of the class of category and I'm going to put those

28
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.530
variables in here.

29
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.500
So let's do sports dash color.

30
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.560
And sports color is actually going to be the same as the secondary color.

31
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.770
So we'll put that in there and then let's do in T so entertainment color, which is going to be like

32
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.840
a purplish color.

33
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:38.520
So it's going to be hexadecimal a66b and then let's do tech for technology color and we'll set that

34
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.370
to 009cf so that gets our variables out of the way.

35
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.840
We can now use those.

36
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.930
So let's move on to our our core styling.

37
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.580
Now as far as fonts, we're using the Ledo or laddered font for the standard text, all the paragraphs

38
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.210
and stuff.

39
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.990
But for the headings I'm using a font called Stat Lynch's Stat Lashes.

40
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.330
So we're going to get these from Google fonts.

41
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:14.610
So let's go to fonts dot google.com and let's see, let's search for lato.

42
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.020
So Ledo, Ledo, we're going to click the plus button and we're also going to search for stat.

43
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.020
What is it?

44
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.030
It's actually s t a a t right here stat which is stat lachaise I don't know how to pronounce it, but

45
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.560
we're going to add that as well.

46
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.230
And then if we click on this down here, we're going to grab this link.

47
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.550
This will include both fonts and we're going to put that in our HTML.

48
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.630
Let's put it right above our style CSS.

49
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.530
So now in our style sheet, I'm going to first add a reset.

50
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.100
So we're going to say for everything we want to set the margin and padding to zero.

51
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.060
Let's also set our box sizing to border box.

52
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.330
And then in the body we're going to add our font family.

53
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:24.510
So our base font family is going to be Ledo and then we just want sans serif like that.

54
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.710
And then let's see for the line height, I'm going to make it kind of big.

55
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.270
Let's do 1.5 and then the background is going to be our light color.

56
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.260
So let's take our variable of light color.

57
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.130
So if we save that, take a look.

58
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.190
Now you can see the background has changed, the font has changed.

59
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.380
Now for the links, I don't I want all links to have a base color of three, three, three and I want

60
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.790
to remove the underline.

61
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.110
So text decoration.

62
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.710
None.

63
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.440
And then next, we're going to actually know what.

64
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.320
Let me just make this smaller.

65
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.890
Next, I'm going to do the unordered list.

66
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.350
So for all unordered lists, I'm going to remove the bullet points.

67
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.940
So list style, none.

68
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:25.610
And for any image, I want it to be 100% of its container, because by default, images will will just

69
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.830
stretch beyond their containers.

70
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.510
But if we put a width of 100%, that will stop it, or it'll make them bigger if their container is

71
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.560
bigger like this is.

72
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.990
But that will fix that in a few minutes.

73
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.950
Now the headings I actually want to have that other font.

74
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:54.680
So let's do h one, h three, h four, h five and h six and let's set that font family and we're going

75
00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:03.020
to set this to a a t l i c h e s that's the font we want.

76
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.130
And this is going to, we're going to say cursive here instead of sans serif.

77
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:16.040
And then let's see, I'm going to add a margin bottom to all of our headings of let's do point 55 REM,

78
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.070
and then I'm going to set a line height.

79
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.310
I want to lessen the line height a little bit for four headings.

80
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.140
So I'm going to do 1.3.

81
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.360
So let's see, let's add our container utility class.

82
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.110
So I'm going to put a comment, say utility, because we're going to be using the container in the NAV.

83
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.090
So we might as well get this out of the way.

84
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.740
So container we want to set a max width and remember we set the variable up above for max width.

85
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.210
So we're going to put that in.

86
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.930
We want to margin auto, push it to the middle, let's add padding on the left and right.

87
00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:02.240
So we'll do two REM left and right and let's do overflow hidden so that it always shows the content

88
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.150
within and we'll save that.

89
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.470
Now we can work on the navigation.

90
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:22.490
So remember it has an idea of main nav, so let's say main dash nav for the nav bar itself.

91
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.890
We're going to have a white background

92
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.380
save that and that turns white.

93
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.930
We're going to position it sticky because we want it to stick to the top.

94
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.960
So we have to put a top value of zero.

95
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.250
Now, I always want it to be on top, so I'm going to add a Z index of two and you'll see why later

96
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.670
on.

97
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.730
So save that.

98
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.080
Not much change.

99
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.710
Now we want the we want the NAV to be a grid.

100
00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:01.550
However, if we put the if we put display grid on the main NAV itself, it's just going to put the container

101
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.410
as the as the one grid item.

102
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.950
So let's make the container the actual grid item.

103
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.730
So I'm sorry, the grid container.

104
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:19.820
So let's say main dash nav container and let's set that to display grid.

105
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:27.800
So what this will do is it'll make the logo, the social icons and the UL here all grid items.

106
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.620
So let's figure out how we want those laid out.

107
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.960
So we use grid dash template dash columns.

108
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:44.570
And for the first one, which is the logo, let's do six F second, let's do three FR and let's do two

109
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.260
FR.

110
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.000
So I'm going to save that and it's going to align things like that.

111
00:08:50.480 --> 00:09:05.210
And then let's just add a padding of one REM here and then let's align everything, align items to the

112
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.020
center.

113
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.880
So we'll save that.

114
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.960
So it aligns them all to the center vertically.

115
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.020
So now the logo is way too big.

116
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.940
So let's, let's make that smaller.

117
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:25.220
We'll say main nav dot logo, let's set that width to 180.

118
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.340
So that looks good.

119
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.940
The, the links here.

120
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.410
Obviously we want these to be, we want these to go this way.

121
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.240
So I'm actually going to use flex here.

122
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.480
I don't want to use grid for just these these list items.

123
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.750
So let's add main nav ul.

124
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.910
And let's let's align it first.

125
00:09:53.910 --> 00:10:03.660
So I wanted to go all the way over to the end so we can use justify self and, and that'll push it all

126
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.530
the way over.

127
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:15.780
So I want to display flex and if I do that automatically the links will go into a flex row and then

128
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.760
for the links themselves for the A tags, let's do those.

129
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:28.710
We'll say main nav ul ly a and let's add padding.

130
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.040
We'll do .75 rem.

131
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.510
So that will give them some padding and let's, let's make them bold as well.

132
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.080
We'll say font weight fold.

133
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:45.870
All right.

134
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.700
And then for the current, remember the current we want to add a background to.

135
00:10:49.710 --> 00:11:02.190
So let's say main dash nav ul ly a dot current and we're going to add a background and we're going to

136
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.930
use the primary color

137
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.550
and there we go.

138
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.610
Let's also change the color to white.

139
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.300
And then for the hover, I just want I want to give it the light color.

140
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:29.010
So let's say let's just copy this and say hover and let's do a background

141
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.770
and let's use the light color.

142
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:35.790
All right.

143
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:41.290
So now when I hover, you see that we get the light color, but we want to change the text.

144
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.650
I want to make sure the text is dark.

145
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.400
So let's do color.

146
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.800
Or we could use the dark color here.

147
00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.590
We could do that.

148
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.910
Yeah, that's fine.

149
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.680
So the social icons are kind of squished together.

150
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.520
I also want to change the color of those.

151
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:21.530
So let's say main nav dot social, I want to justify self, I want to put them in this in the middle.

152
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:29.900
So let's say justify dash self because remember when we're, when we're aligning the actual item itself,

153
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.950
we use self.

154
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:36.050
If we're using the parent, we can use like justify content, align items and so on.

155
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.840
But we're going to say justify self center.

156
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.010
And then for each icon, we want to change the color.

157
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:57.530
So let's do main nav, social and then the eye and change the color to a grey.

158
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.540
We're going to do seven, seven, seven.

159
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.980
All right.

160
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:09.290
And then let's just add a margin, right, of 0.5 REM, kind of spread them out a little bit.

161
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.560
