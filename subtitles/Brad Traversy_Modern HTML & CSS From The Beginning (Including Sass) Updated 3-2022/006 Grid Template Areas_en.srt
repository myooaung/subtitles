1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,760
So now we're going to get into a property called grid template areas, which basically allows us to

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,670
visually map out the alignment of our elements through CCIS.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,040
So let's create a new file here called zero five Underscore Grid Underscore.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,400
We'll just call it grid areas HTML.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,380
All right.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,570
So I'm going to close that up and I'm going to paste in the body here and just go over it because it's

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,140
kind of a lot.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,660
I don't feel like typing it out, but basically we have a main div here.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,270
Let's just push this back like that.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,390
All right.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:55,120
So we have a div with the class of container that goes around everything and then we have a header which

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,170
just has an H one.

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,560
We have a section with the class of content and inside here there's an H three and a paragraph.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,120
Then we have a side which we want to be our sidebar, and then there's three boxes and then a footer.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,890
So I just want to lay this out like a very simple website where we have the header, the main content,

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,320
the sidebar, the three boxes and the footer.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,520
And we're going to do this just using the grid template areas property.

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,500
So let's go up here and actually let's save it and open it first.

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,100
Everything is just going to be straight down, but we're going to set on the container.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,550
We want to set a grid, so we'll save that.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,910
Now here's where we want to put the grid template areas right in the in the parent.

23
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,450
So template dash areas.

24
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,610
And we basically, like I said, we want to map the map this out visually.

25
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,030
So the header, I want to go all the way across.

26
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,530
So I'm going to do header header header.

27
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,530
Now the reason I did it three times is because we're going to have three boxes that go all the way across.

28
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,440
So you want to have the maximum number of columns you have to have in every row that you do.

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,240
So that's our header row.

30
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,350
We don't need a comma.

31
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,010
The next one is going to be the content and the sidebar.

32
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:32,800
So I want the content to take up two of the three and then the sidebar will take up just one here.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:44,890
The next one will be the boxes which we have box one which quotes so box one, box two and box three

34
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,310
and then the footer I want to span all the way across.

35
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,710
So we're just going to say footer three times.

36
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,870
I don't know why I keep forgetting the quotes.

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,330
All right.

38
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,790
Now, if I save this, it's going to it's going to turn into a grid, but it's not doing what we want

39
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,250
it to do because we haven't we haven't referenced these as grid areas.

40
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,590
So what we need to do is take each element and and assign it to one of these grid areas.

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,990
So we have a header with the class of header.

42
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,410
Right.

43
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:26,590
So I'm going to say class header and I'm going to assign grid dash area to header matching this right

44
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,250
here.

45
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,700
And if I save this, notice that now the header goes all the way across and you might not be able to

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,030
tell.

47
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,220
I'm actually going to just paste this in real quick, which is just going to add a border around everything

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,280
so you can see the actual outline of it.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,400
Let's actually add a grid gap as well.

50
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,010
We can you can use all this stuff.

51
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,940
Even though we're using grid template areas, it still works like a grid.

52
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,110
So let's say grid gap one ram and save.

53
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,350
Oops.

54
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,860
What I do here, I forgot my semicolon.

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,530
Okay, so as you can see, the header spans across all three.

56
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:16,430
Now the section, the content area I want to be, I want to span two and then have the sidebar right

57
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,089
here.

58
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,360
So we have that set in the template areas, but we haven't assigned the grid areas yet.

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:34,850
So let's take the content and let's assign the grid area to content and then we'll assign the sidebar

60
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,960
class to the grid area of sidebar.

61
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:49,340
And if I save that, you can see that the content takes up two of them too.

62
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,840
And then the the sidebar takes up one and the heading is pretty much in place, but we have to add that

63
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,710
as well.

64
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,810
So we're going to take I'm sorry, not the heading the boxes, they say heading inside.

65
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,160
That's what confused me.

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,050
But let's take box one.

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:17,830
And let's assign a grid area to box one which pertains to this right here.

68
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,970
And then I'm just going to copy this down because we want to do the same with two and three.

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,810
Okay.

70
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,180
Save that.

71
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,200
No change.

72
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,290
But then the last one here, the footer, we want to go all the way across, which we specified right

73
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,490
here that it's going to.

74
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,060
But we need to assign the grid area so it has a class of footer.

75
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:49,190
And then we can simply say grid area footer and save.

76
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,440
And that goes all the way across.

77
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,340
Let's actually align that to the center as well.

78
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:05,570
So text a line center and we'll do the same with the header.

79
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,030
Very, very ugly.

80
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,360
But I'm just showing you how you can use these grid template areas to literally map out what your what

81
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,010
your layout should look like.

82
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,260
Now, let's say we wanted to change this.

83
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,690
Let's say we wanted to do let's actually change.

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,240
Let's have box three have its own its own entire row.

85
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,420
So I'm going to say this is going to be part of box two.

86
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:42,350
And then we'll go down and we'll say Box three, box three in box three.

87
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,140
So try to visualize what that's going to look like.

88
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,460
So I'm going to save.

89
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:53,200
And what happened is box one takes up one, box two takes up two.

90
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,370
You can see it's longer.

91
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,530
And then box three takes up basically its whole its whole area here, just like the header in the footer

92
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,070
does.

93
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,930
So you can kind of experiment with this a little, but it's just so easy to create layouts now as opposed

94
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,020
to having to float everything and clear them and so on.

95
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Now, in the next video, I'm going to show you how to utilize media queries to make your grids responsive.
