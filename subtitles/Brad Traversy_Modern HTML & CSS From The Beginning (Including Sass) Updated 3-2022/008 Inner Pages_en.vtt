00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.450
Okay.

2
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.570
So now we're going to create our inner pages.

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.360
So we have a blog, HTML page that we want to create and also a single post page.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.870
So what we'll do is let's see, let's go into our HTML and I just want to check out the button.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:28.170
So the blog section which is right here, this read our blog, the ref should go to blog dot HTML.

6
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.590
And by the way, we haven't even looked at the navigation.

7
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.840
So if I click about it takes us down cases, blog contact and we'll add some JavaScript to do the the

8
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.860
smooth scrolling.

9
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
But if you don't want to add any JavaScript, you can just leave it the way it is if you want.

10
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.880
But we'll get to that in a little bit.

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.560
But let's take care of these inner pages.

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.600
So if I go to the blog and I click read our blog, it doesn't exist.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.820
So we have to create that file.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.690
So let's say blog, HTML, and what we'll do is copy everything from indexed HTML and paste that in

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.160
and we're going to get rid of it.

16
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.850
See, we're going to keep the header, we're just going to modify it.

17
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.690
So.

18
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.120
Everything that is between actually everything in the main.

19
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.940
We'll go ahead and get rid of for now.

20
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.060
So we'll get rid of that.

21
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.540
And for the title, we'll just say, read our blog.

22
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.150
And let's see what we want to do here.

23
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.880
So this stuff is going to stay the same.

24
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.410
Now, the hero.

25
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.860
I don't want it to take up the entire page, so I'm going to add another class onto the header called

26
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.730
blog.

27
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.480
And let's see, we want to keep that.

28
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.550
Now these these here since we're on a different page, obviously we can't go to the about section.

29
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.030
So what we want to do is we want to point to first of all, home can just go to index HTML, right?

30
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.550
And then if we want to go to a boat, we'll go to index HTML and then the about section.

31
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.270
So basically we just need to prefix all of these with index HTML.

32
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.470
Like that.

33
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.310
And then let's see for the content.

34
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.930
We're just going to have an H one and just say blog.

35
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.040
All right?

36
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.180
Now I'm going to save this.

37
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.730
And if we go to our blog page, this is obviously way too big.

38
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.040
So I want to I want to make this smaller.

39
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.960
I also want to change the image.

40
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.770
So what we'll do is go into our stylesheet.

41
00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.360
Let's go to style CSS and let's go down to where we have our hero.

42
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.200
And we're going to add let's see, go right here and let's say hero.

43
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.990
Now, if this also has a class of blog, then let's change the background image.

44
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.830
And you could do this with other inner pages as well, have different classes for those different images.

45
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.210
So we're going to go up one level into images and then what is it?

46
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.150
Yeah, it's actually I have it in the home folder.

47
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.520
It's the same, same image that we have on the home for the blog and then know repeat center center

48
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.010
cover.

49
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.610
And I'm going to change it from height of 100 viewport heights to 30 viewport heights.

50
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.980
So if I go ahead and save this and now we take a look, now we just have a much smaller header now for

51
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.000
the content.

52
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.890
I actually want to structure it like we did with this with the flex columns.

53
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.230
So what I'll do is grab let's see from the index page.

54
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.360
I'm going to grab the solutions.

55
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.320
Section and let's go back here and inside Main.

56
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.670
We're going to go ahead and paste that in here.

57
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.420
Uh, let's see.

58
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.460
So we have section.

59
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.620
Let's actually make this an article instead.

60
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.350
So make sure you switch that and the ending tag to article.

61
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.620
And we don't need a class of solutions.

62
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.810
We do want the flex columns though.

63
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.230
And then for the image, let's use images.

64
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.670
So this is the first post.

65
00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:02.090
So we'll do blog one as our image and for the content, let's see, we don't need I'm actually going

66
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.930
to make this big light and then we don't need an H four because we're just going to have the title,

67
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.200
just say blog post one and then let's see.

68
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.300
Underneath that though, let's have a paragraph with the class of meta and this is where we'll put like

69
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.730
the user and stuff.

70
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.520
So I'm going to put a user icon, so F as and then F a dash user.

71
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.500
And then after that we'll say posted by John Doe.

72
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.680
Yeah, actually let's put strong tags around the name.

73
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:55.730
So John Doe and we'll put a pipe character here and then the date say April 19, 2020 and then we'll

74
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.010
still have this read more down here as well.

75
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.140
But let's make the button instead of outline.

76
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.400
Let's say BTN Dark, which we should already have.

77
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.570
All right.

78
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.940
So if I save that, we take a look.

79
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.610
There we go.

80
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.220
This is our first blog post.

81
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.480
So the second one, I'm going to copy this whole article.

82
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.920
And we'll go down, we'll pass that in.

83
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.080
And then I'm just going to change the image to blog two.

84
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.650
I'm going to change the background to dark, let's say blog post to.

85
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.140
Will change the user to Jane Doe.

86
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.060
Change the date.

87
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.310
And then for the button.

88
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.700
I want to.

89
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.530
I want to use button.

90
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.430
Light.

91
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.240
Let's see what that looks like.

92
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.880
So there we go.

93
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.000
So any time you want to use the styling, it's super easy.

94
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So we'll go ahead and copy the first article again.

95
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.410
And go under this one and change this to blog three.

96
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.700
I'm going to go back to a dark background.

97
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.380
Three.

98
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.230
I'll just change the date.

99
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.760
We'll keep the same author.

100
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.010
And let's do button white.

101
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.560
Right?

102
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.350
Oh, actually, I didn't want to change the colors.

103
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.470
I want to keep the light because I want them to alternate.

104
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.480
So if I save that and we take a look, so we have the light, the dark.

105
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.050
We do want the image on the other side, though.

106
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.570
Actually, it's only the middle that I want the image on this side.

107
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.640
So remember, we can just add our reverse class, right?

108
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.300
So flex columns.

109
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.740
We can just add flex reverse.

110
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.040
And now the image is on the other side.

111
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.490
So that's our blog page.

112
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.060
Now if I click on the Read More, it should go to a post.

113
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.490
So for each link here, let's have it go to post dot HTML.

114
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.290
So I'll just copy that.

115
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.770
And we want each of these to go to that page.

116
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:19.680
In reality, they would go to different posts obviously, but they'd all be formatted the same way.

117
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:24.600
So let's create post HTML.

118
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.800
Now this is going to be pretty simple as well.

119
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.410
Let's see.

120
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:37.260
So we'll copy the blog, HTML and let's paste that in.

121
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.900
So I'm going to keep I'm going to keep the top here.

122
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.770
Let's change the title though, to post one.

123
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.200
I'm going to keep all this and this too.

124
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.650
So it'll have that same hero image at the top.

125
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:05.130
But then for the main, let's clear everything out of the main so all these articles will clear out.

126
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:12.810
And then we're just going to have a section here with the class of post and we'll have an H two with

127
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.440
a title.

128
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.570
So blog post one.

129
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.450
And then underneath that we'll have our meta class, which I'll just copy from the blog html.

130
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.310
So this paragraph right here.

131
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:32.440
Also copy the text paragraph and then we'll just add a couple more paragraphs.

132
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:43.660
Let's say like lorem 60, another paragraph, lorem 50 and then that should do it.

133
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.400
So if we take a look at that, if I click Read More, it takes us to the post.

134
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.160
Now I want to style some of this stuff.

135
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.070
I also want the image in there as well.

136
00:09:54.070 --> 00:10:05.050
So what we'll do is add, let's see, we'll go under the meta input image and let's let's go to what

137
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.300
images slash blog and we'll take the blog one image.

138
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:11.860
All right.

139
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:18.940
Now, as far as styling goes, let's go to our style, CSS and style the post.

140
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.680
So I'll go let's go above the footer.

141
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.870
So post an ad padding around the whole thing.

142
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.460
We'll do 50 pixels, top and bottom, 30 left and right.

143
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:49.630
We're going to do the H two post H two, let's say font size 40 pixels margin bottom.

144
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:58.150
Let's do 20 pixels padding bottom, we'll do ten pixels.

145
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.950
And I want to add a border bottom.

146
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.360
Support a bottom cc see solid one pixel.

147
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.690
So if we look at that, you can see that's our title.

148
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.420
We have this underline for the meta.

149
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.480
I just want to push the content under it down.

150
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:22.590
So let's say post meta margin bottom.

151
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.350
330 pixels.

152
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.910
Now the image is huge.

153
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.150
So because by default it's width 100%.

154
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.800
So let's change that.

155
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:39.970
So the post image, I'm going to set the width to a fixed 300 pixels and I'm going to make it rounded.

156
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.870
So we'll say border radius 50%.

157
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:50.770
I want to display as a block because I want I want to put it in the middle without using flex so we

158
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:58.600
can display block because by default it's in line and then we'll add margin zero auto on the left and

159
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.030
right and then 30 on the bottom.

160
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.690
So now if we take a look, that's what it's going to look like.

161
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.530
So, I mean, you'd probably have like a sidebar with categories and stuff like that if it were a real

162
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:11.890
blog.

163
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.190
But this is just something very simple just to add to the site.

164
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:22.500
So I think we're done as far as HTML and CSS.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:28.390
Let's just make sure if we make this smaller that the blog page still looks okay.

166
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.510
So everything is just stacked.

167
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.570
If we go to the post, that looks good.

168
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.920
All right.

169
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.000
So in the next video, we're going to add a little bit of JavaScript.

170
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.920
This part is definitely optional.

171
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.050
You don't have to do this, but I like the effect of this being totally transparent at the top.

172
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.250
And then when you scroll down, you know, the background comes in.

173
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:58.160
Also, we'll implement the light box library so we can open these images up in a light box.

174
00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.480
All right.

175
00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.830
So I'll see you in the next video.
