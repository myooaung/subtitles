00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.510
All right.

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.500
In this video, we're going to look at links, styling links and buttons and links are kind of special

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.970
because they have different states.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.220
You have your your regular links, your regular state, and you have your hover state and active state

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.300
and a visited state.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.830
And you can actually style those different states using something called a pseudo selector.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.990
And I'm also going to show you how to how to style buttons and also how to style a link as a button.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.140
Because a lot of times you'll have actual a tags that you want to look like buttons in your website

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.210
or user interface.

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.780
So let's go ahead and create a new file here called zero eight.

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.600
Underscore links, underscore buttons, dot HTML.

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:55.200
And we're going to go ahead and change the title up to links and buttons and let's add our style.

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.380
And for now, we'll just put in a tag.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.940
Doesn't have to.

15
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.260
Doesn't matter where it goes.

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.840
And just say, click here and save.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.650
Let's open it up with live server and we just have a simple link and it's going to be blue by default

18
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.930
with an underline which doesn't look very good.

19
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.050
So I'm going to grab on to that a tag here, use that as a selector and I'm going to change the color

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.030
to a dot gray.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.210
And then to remove the underline, we want to use the text decoration property and we want to set that

22
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.080
to none.

23
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.980
So the default is underlined, but we're going to set it to none.

24
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.070
Now, if I hover over it, you'll see we get a cursor.

25
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.900
The cursor changes into a pointer, but the nothing else changes.

26
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.250
So you're probably going to want some kind of change when you hover over it.

27
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.560
Now to do that, we can use the pseudo selector hover so we can do a colon and then hover and let's

28
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.440
change the color to coral.

29
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.640
So now if I go and I hover over it, it changes to coral.

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.400
And you can you can add any properties you want here.

31
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.580
You could do something crazy like let's do font size changes to like 40 pixels.

32
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.200
And now when I hover over it, it goes to 40 pixels, font size.

33
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.050
So you can do whatever you want in the hover state.

34
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.580
But I'm not going to keep that.

35
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.780
Let's just change the color.

36
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.570
And if you want to add the underline on hover, you could do text decoration underline.

37
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.710
And I can see that it's colored and it's underlined.

38
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:39.810
So in addition to hover, we have visited so we can do a colon visited and let's just do color red now

39
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.470
visited.

40
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.640
At least for me.

41
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.680
I don't use this very much.

42
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.500
I don't think I've ever used it actually in a real project.

43
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.750
When you click on it and you visit it, it then turns red and it stays red.

44
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.420
Even if I reload the server, it stays red.

45
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.760
And if there were other links, if we didn't click on them, they'd be they'd be gray, dark gray,

46
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.680
and then you'd click on it and they turn red.

47
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.890
So it's kind of weird and I really don't like it and it's not something that I use, but it is possible.

48
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.560
So I just wanted to show you that, but I'm going to comment that out.

49
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.980
Another state that we have for links is active.

50
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:25.320
So if we do a colon active and let's say color red and now the active state is going to be when we click.

51
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.360
So when I click see how it turns red and if I click and hold, it also turns red.

52
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.950
So that's the active state and that's another one that I really don't use.

53
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.200
But it is it is possible.

54
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.420
So those are the different states for links.

55
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.780
Now what I want to do is I want to style, I'm going to put a button in here and style the link in the

56
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.920
button the same way.

57
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.050
So let's say button and let's give both of these a class of BTN.

58
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.170
So this is often what I'll do in projects as I'll have different button classes, sometimes you'll have

59
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.560
like a BTN light if I want a light button BTN Dark, which will be this basically the same, just different

60
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.250
colors.

61
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.670
But let's just do BTN, we'll say click here.

62
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.769
Actually, you know what, let's put in the text my button just so we know that this is a button.

63
00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:29.010
And then up here, let's say my link and save and you can see that they're obviously formatted very

64
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.820
differently initially, but we want to make them the same.

65
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.440
And I'm going to just make this bigger.

66
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.970
Not that big.

67
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.940
Okay, so we have a link in a button.

68
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.650
Let's.

69
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.900
Let's see, I want these on separate lines.

70
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.490
They're both inline elements.

71
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.860
So I'm going to just put a couple of line breaks here just to kind of get them away from each other.

72
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.580
So buttons obviously are styled differently.

73
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.780
They have a border.

74
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.960
They have a little bit of padding here, the font's different.

75
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:08.320
So let's go up here into our styling and let's say button styling.

76
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.530
So we have a class of BTN

77
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:22.900
and let's go ahead and add a background and I'm going to use a blue that's like a, like a Facebook

78
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.770
brand blue.

79
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.500
So it's going to be four C, six, C, a zero.

80
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.660
And let's set the color of the text to white.

81
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.420
Let's save that and see what we get.

82
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.990
All right.

83
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.310
Now we want to remove the border because buttons have borders.

84
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.810
So we're going to say border.

85
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.760
We could either do border none like that or we could do border zero.

86
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.300
I usually use border none, so we'll save that.

87
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.790
And now the border is off the actual button.

88
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.240
Next thing we want to do is is the font size.

89
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.170
We want the font size to be the same for all all links in buttons, which we're going to set to 16 pixels.

90
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.400
So we'll save that.

91
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.420
Good.

92
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.490
Next thing we'll do is the padding.

93
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.630
So let's say we want to do ten on the top and bottom and 20 left and right.

94
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.830
Save that.

95
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.310
And this is this is zoomed in that's why this is so big.

96
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.680
Can actually zoom out a little bit now.

97
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.510
Yeah.

98
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.640
And let's change the font for the body.

99
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.250
So I'm going to say font family.

100
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.450
Let's grab this.

101
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.790
Or is it Tahoma sig ui tahoma k?

102
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.080
That looks a little better.

103
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.270
Back down to our button.

104
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.000
Let's give it a little border radius.

105
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.270
And this is these are all properties that we've learned about.

106
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.860
So we're kind of taking all the stuff that we've learned and actually creating an element that that's

107
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.580
styled.

108
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.180
So now you can see they have the rounded corners.

109
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.390
Let's let's actually put a line break above the the a tag to just bring it down a little bit.

110
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.840
All right.

111
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.420
So these are these are pretty much identical now.

112
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:19.580
So for any button or any link that we want to style this way, we would just add the class BTN globally.

113
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:28.010
Now one thing that I want to mention is the we'll go over this in a minute how the hover state.

114
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:35.360
But when we go over the actual button, we don't get a cursor, we don't get a pointer on our cursor.

115
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.930
And for this we do links by default.

116
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.820
You do get the the pointer.

117
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:47.840
So if we want the pointer to show up, either way, we can actually set that in the CSS so we can set

118
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.740
cursor pointer.

119
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.150
And now when I go over the button, you can see that it turns into a pointer.

120
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.620
Now for the hover state.

121
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.900
So let's say BTN hover.

122
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.800
We don't want a space there that won't work.

123
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:09.720
So BTN hover and we're going to set the colour to do a light grey.

124
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.420
So that's the text colour and then the background.

125
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:23.280
I'm going to set that to just a slightly lighter blue than the one we have, which is going to be 446190.

126
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.890
Or is it darker?

127
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.960
I think it's yeah, I think it's darker.

128
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.299
And then I'm going to just get rid of the text decoration, underline for the the link up here.

129
00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:39.570
Even though we said links link covers should be KORRELL down here, we're saying the button hover should

130
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.140
be light grey and this is going to overwrite that style.

131
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.910
So let's save, let's go ahead and hover and you can see that the blue gets a little darker.

132
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:56.670
So you can't even distinguish the difference here between the the link, the a tag and the button tag.

133
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.080
And that's that's what we want.

134
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.090
So that's what you're going to do a lot in websites and especially in user interfaces where you have

135
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.900
a lot of links that you want to format as buttons.

136
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.710
All right.

137
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.090
So that's it, guys.

138
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:16.770
In the next video, what I want to do is start to look at menus creating vertical and horizontal navigation

139
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.520
bars.

140
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.590
So we'll get into that next.
