1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,600
So we're going to go ahead and get started here.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,030
Now, I'm going to keep the final project open just as a reference so that I can point to you guys.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,430
Like when I'm creating the HTML in CSS, I can show you exactly what I'm doing in the final project.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,540
And like I said in the last video, a lot of times you'll get the design beforehand and you'll just

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,200
have to use it as a reference and create the HTML and CSS.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,090
So we'll kind of take that approach.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,330
And I'm also going to for now have the browser and the text editor open at the same time.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,120
I don't like how narrow this is, but at the same time, I want you to to see to see them both.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,120
If we get to a point where we're creating stuff like this and it doesn't look good when it's this narrow,

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,710
then I'll make it bigger.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,800
So first thing we want to do is create a project folder so you can put that anywhere in your system.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,710
I'm going to go to my desktop and I'm just going to call this folder.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,330
Let's do hotel underscore website and we can open this in V's code.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,080
So let's say open folder and we want hotel website.

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,920
It's completely empty.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,680
And I'm going to create, first of all, a folder for our images and you can call this images or IMG

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,740
is another common convention, so I'm going to use that.

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,410
And then we want to get all the image resources that you downloaded in the first video of this section,

20
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,270
which I have right here.

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,050
And we want to put those into our IMG folder.

22
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,670
So let's go ahead and select all these and bring them into IMG.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,690
Oops.

24
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,320
What happened?

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,700
There we go.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,360
All right.

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,950
So now that those are in there, we can close these up and go back into VS code.

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,470
And now you can see I have all the images here.

29
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,180
So next thing we'll do is create our page structure.

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,400
As you can see, we have three pages home about in contact.

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,820
Now, remember, in the beginning of the the HTML basics section, I said that when you have a home

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:08,930
page of a website, you need to call it index HTML because when you go to something whatever dot com,

33
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,720
it's going to look for that file as the home page.

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,930
So let's say indexed HTML as a new new file.

35
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,970
I click to this icon and we might as well create the rest of the html pages.

36
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,140
So we'll do html.

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,500
About html dot html.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,330
Let's do contact dot HTML.

39
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,570
And we're also going to need our CSS, our stylesheet and we're not going to be putting our our CSS

40
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,210
in the HTML like we did in the sandbox.

41
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,920
I only did that for convenience.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,960
When you have a project, you want to create separate style sheets and generally you want a separate

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,730
folder that contains those.

44
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,350
So I'm going to click this folder icon and create a folder called CSS.

45
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,680
And then inside there I'm going to create a new file called Style CSS.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,220
And the name style is it doesn't matter what you call this, but style main CSS.

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,950
These are common conventions for main style sheets, but it doesn't it doesn't really matter.

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,050
So now that we have that, that's basically our our website structure.

49
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:21,140
So we're going to head into the index HTML we can close up about and contact for now, but let's open

50
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,760
up our style sheet as well.

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,170
So we have these two files open and let's generate our head body tags.

52
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:34,040
So exclamation enter tab and we'll change the title here to let's say hotel beat.

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,830
And usually you'll have like some kind of separator, like a dash or a, or a pipe character.

54
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,980
And then if you're, if you're focused on search engines like you want to you want to rank for, let's

55
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,930
say, Boston Hotel, you might put something like that here as long as it makes sense.

56
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:58,610
But we're just going to put welcome because it's the home page and you'll probably want to put some

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,340
meta tags in here like description.

58
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,650
I'm not going to do this for every project we create, but I'll do it for this one just because it's

59
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,430
the first.

60
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,390
So let's say name, description and let's do content equals.

61
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:21,079
And then I'll just say Welcome to the most.

62
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,410
Extraordinary hotel in

63
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,610
Boston, Massachusetts.

64
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,310
So that's our description.

65
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
Let's do another meta tag.

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,810
This will be our keyword.

67
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:47,270
So we want to do name equals keywords and for the content you'd probably do something like hotel, whatever,

68
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,170
the location.

69
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:56,600
So something like Boston Hotel, New England Hotel and whatever it may be, whatever keywords.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,370
Describe this page.

71
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,240
All right.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,270
Now, in addition to that, we want to link our stylesheet.

73
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,310
So we use a link tag.

74
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,060
And if I use Emit, if I do link enter or link tab, it'll automatically put in the REL attribute.

75
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,210
So the REL is going to be equal to stylesheet because we're just telling it that we're importing a stylesheet

76
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,100
here, CSS file and then in the a ref, we want to point to that file.

77
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,190
Now remember we put it inside of a folder called CSS.

78
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,880
So we want to say CSS slash style CSS.

79
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,510
Och.

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,280
And then we can get started with the the body here.

81
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,030
Now it's important to mention that everyone has their own style.

82
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,190
Everyone has their own naming conventions and how they want to structure tags.

83
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,500
For instance, what I'm going to do is have a header tag, so I'll just put it in header.

84
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,150
And inside my header I want the navigation and the showcase.

85
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,970
I want this whole area to be the header, but it's fine if you would have just this inside the header

86
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,180
tag and then maybe have section for this, you're going to see you're going to see different styles

87
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,580
when you're looking at different HTML and you're going to develop your own style.

88
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,030
What I do here is just what I like to do and I like to think that it's, it's, it's okay.

89
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,280
And hopefully guys don't mind the way that I do things, but I just want to, I want, I want to make

90
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,990
it clear that every developer has their own style of doing things and not just HTML, any kind of programming,

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,050
anything like that.

92
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,590
So like I said, I want the nav the nav bar in here.

93
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:39,830
So I'm going to create a nav tag and I'm actually going to give this an ID of nav bar.

94
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:48,290
And inside the nav bar, we're going to have the logo, this right here, which is just an H one.

95
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,180
And then we're going to have our our navigation, which is our unordered list.

96
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,760
So let's put an H one, which I'm actually going to give a class of logo.

97
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,650
And that's another thing that is different depending on the developer is is how you use IDs in classes.

98
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,160
I could easily call this a class and this an ID.

99
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
That's fine.

100
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:17,660
The one major rule that I would say you should never break is don't have more than one ID like don't

101
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,080
have another idea of nav bar on the same page.

102
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,830
But I mean some people you will use just classes.

103
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,880
I tend to use IDs for stuff that I won't have duplicates of and that kind of surround everything else

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,370
that they're parents of other things.

105
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,450
For instance, we have the H one and the UL in here, the NAV surrounds them.

106
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,130
So I'm going to use an ID here.

107
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:48,890
So for the logo we're just going to do h, b, t, and usually you'll have your logo go to your home

108
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,350
page like you'll see if I click on if I hover over it, it's a link and it goes back to the home page.

109
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,020
So if I'm on a boat and I click that it take me back.

110
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:04,040
So we want to surround this in an a tag and we want this to go to index dot HTML.

111
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,630
All right.

112
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,640
Make sure that you're closing a tag is on the other side of the the beat.

113
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,780
All right.

114
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm just going to close this sidebar up to give me some more room as well.

115
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,780
So that's our H one.

116
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,420
Now we want the UL right here.

117
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,110
So let's do UL list item.

118
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,020
And then in each list item, we'll have a link.

119
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,130
This is going to go to index dot HTML and this is going to be our home page.

120
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:40,220
I'm going to do a control option down or control all down on a Windows machine and let's do a bout and

121
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,810
say about HTML contact.

122
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,900
Contact.

123
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,530
So there's our nav bar.

124
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,890
Now let's open this in live server.

125
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,330
And it's going to look horrible because we have no CSS.

126
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,700
So that's what we're going to do now is we're going to jump to the CSS.

127
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:07,960
And that's another thing that that varies is sometimes you might do all of your HTML on the whole page

128
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:15,250
and then start your CSS or you can do what we're going to do and go by basically component by component.

129
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,890
So the nav bar, then we'll move to the showcase, then to this part, that part and so on.

130
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,370
So let's jump into Styles, CSS.

131
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:31,420
And in addition to the nav bar styling, I want to do just some of the core basic styling like the body

132
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,030
tag and stuff like that.

133
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,100
So I am going to add a CSS reset.

134
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,070
So I'm going to put an asterisk here, which means we're grabbing everything and we're going to clear

135
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,950
out the margin and padding the default margin and padding that the browser puts on every on a lot of

136
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,050
different elements.

137
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:56,350
As soon as I save that, you'll see that it changes the UL, the heading, that stuff, the margin goes

138
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,830
away.

139
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,600
And then I also want to add a box sizing property.

140
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,260
Oops.

141
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,480
And we're going to set that to border box because when we have boxes that have padding like this right

142
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,920
here, I don't want the padding to add to the actual width of the box.

143
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,660
So that's pretty important.

144
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,750
So next we'll have our main styling.

145
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:27,850
And what I mean by main is just like core elements like the body links, headings, paragraph, all

146
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,930
that stuff, anything that really doesn't have a class or an ID.

147
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,920
So for the body and a lot of times when you style the body, you'll put in the HTML as well.

148
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:47,260
So HTML body and then I'm just going to set the font family to I'm going to use one of these presets

149
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,340
for vs code.

150
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:57,580
We'll use this Segou UI to home a Geneva and then let's set the line height to I'm going to set it kind

151
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:57,970
of high.

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,920
So 1.7 M And now that I saved, you can see that there's a little more spacing in between the lines.

153
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,650
Next thing we'll do is the links.

154
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,770
I want all links by default unless unless the class or ID specifies.

155
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,260
Otherwise I want them to have a color of three, three, three and I also want to remove the underline.

156
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:27,580
So we'll do text decoration none and we'll save that also the headings.

157
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,550
So I'm going to say h one, h two, h three.

158
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,640
I want spacing underneath.

159
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,790
So if we look at our final project, so like right here, you can see the spacing here, spacing here

160
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,980
because we move, we remove the default margin and padding, there's not going to be any spacing.

161
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,840
So we need to add that ourselves.

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:57,940
So I'm actually going to do padding bottom 20 pixels and then for paragraphs, remember paragraphs by

163
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,990
default have a margin, but we just removed it with the reset.

164
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,300
So I'm just going to re add ten pixel margin on the top and bottom.

165
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,380
Remember, if we do it this way, this is top and bottom, this is left and right.

166
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,590
So those are the those are the core styles.

167
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,350
Now let's move on to the actual nav bar.

168
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,860
So what was it, an ID?

169
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,280
Yeah.

170
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,080
So we did ID nav bar.

171
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:31,990
Let's put a comment in here just to kind of organize things and we'll say nav bar, I'm going to set

172
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,850
the background color or background to three, three, three.

173
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,390
I'm going to set the color to white.

174
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,170
And let's see, what else are we going to do?

175
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:51,010
Let's do an overflow auto so that the background shows no matter what.

176
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,980
And we'll save that and notice that that we can't read the text even though we put color here, because

177
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,290
the all the text, it's all links.

178
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,670
And if you have links, you have to you have to add the colors specifically to those links.

179
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,880
So remember we have a logo, so I'm going to do nav bar class logo.

180
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,460
I want to style that link and then any other links in the nav bar.

181
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,910
So let's do comma nav bar.

182
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,120
Actually, you know what we'll just do just do nav bar a there's no need to do that.

183
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,570
And let's say color white and save.

184
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,520
And now we can actually see the text.

185
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,830
So let's see.

186
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:44,800
Next thing we want to do is align the logo to the left and we want the the UL to be on the right.

187
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,680
So let's add some floats for that.

188
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,510
And I would recommend using something like Flexbox, but we haven't gotten to that yet, so we're just

189
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,730
going to use floats.

190
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:02,980
So let's grab the nav bar h one and let's do float left.

191
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm also going to add some padding to the top to push it down a little bit.

192
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,470
Let's do 20 pixels.

193
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,510
We'll save that.

194
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,590
Now the UL.

195
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,120
We also want to float that.

196
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,820
We want to float that to the right.

197
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,980
So let's say nav bah ul.

198
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,280
We're going to do a couple other things too.

199
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,690
We want to remove the bullets.

200
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:38,700
So let's say list style none and we'll set the margin to zero.

201
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,690
Pat Actually, we don't have to do that because we added the reset.

202
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,240
So let's just do float right and save.

203
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,550
And now that's floated over to the right.

204
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,530
So the list items right now are going vertical.

205
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,360
We want them to go horizontal.

206
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,070
So let's grab on to those.

207
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:05,590
We'll say nav bar ul ly or you could just do nab bar ly.

208
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,240
It's up to you.

209
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,910
I like to just keep it kind of organized like that.

210
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:17,490
So for the list items, we want to float them all to the left and save and then everything else that

211
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,120
we style.

212
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,080
As far as these links, it's going to be on the a tag inside.

213
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,490
So let's do that.

214
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,020
Let's say nav bar.

215
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,490
You ll see a.

216
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:40,860
And we want to display them as blocks so that we can add padding.

217
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,390
And we want to do 20 pixels all around.

218
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,090
If I save that, it kind of pushes them right into place.

219
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,030
We get 20 pixels all around.

220
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,790
Let's make sure there are lines centered.

221
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:01,020
So we'll say text a line center and what else do we want to do?

222
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,910
I think that's it.

223
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,550
Now, I do want to have a hover state.

224
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,260
Right now, if I hover over them, nothing happens.

225
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:16,560
So what we can do is take this and just add our pseudo selector of hover.

226
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,820
So colon hover.

227
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,370
And I'm going to say background.

228
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,800
Let's do four, four, four.

229
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:35,040
And let's also make the color a hexadecimal of F, let's do F, seven C, 08a, which is this light

230
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,180
brownish tarnish color.

231
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,020
So now if I hover over, it looks like that.

232
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,510
Now, another thing I want to do is depending on the page we're on, I want it to have that effect as

233
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:46,750
well.

234
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,490
If we look at look at the final project, you can see that the home page has that effect.

235
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:59,560
So what we can do is whatever page we're on in the nav bar here, we can add a special class and we're

236
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,130
going to add it to the link to the A tag.

237
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,740
So since we're on the home page here, let's say class equals and let's call this current.

238
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,010
So we'll go back and then I want it to have this same styling.

239
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,670
There's no sense in recreating it.

240
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:24,609
Let's just put a comma so that it affects both and we'll grab this and then just add the class of current.

241
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,860
And you usually want to put this on a new line just to keep it clean and save.

242
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,650
And now notice the home page has that.

243
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,900
Now, before we move on, I just want to show you one thing.

244
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:45,220
If we stretch this out really far, it's always on the very edge here, and I don't want that.

245
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,940
Usually what you'll do is you'll have a container and move it into the middle.

246
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,390
And we don't want to wrap a container around everything because then the black bar will actually get

247
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:55,750
mad.

248
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,400
Added push to the middle.

249
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,260
I want the black bar to go all the way across, but I want this stuff to be in the middle.

250
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,340
So to do that, what we'll do is add a container class within the nav because remember the nav, the

251
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,640
ID nav bar is where that background is.

252
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:20,890
So within that we want to have a container class and we want to move the H one and the UL into that

253
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,520
class and save and then we'll style it.

254
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,410
So let's add the container.

255
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,930
I'm actually going to put the container up top because it's kind of a utility class, meaning you can

256
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,310
use it all around.

257
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:41,350
So let's put a comment here and say we'll just say utilities or utility classes.

258
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,060
And we'll do container.

259
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,090
So remember margin auto.

260
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,830
I want to do that.

261
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,420
That's going to push it all to the middle.

262
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,230
But we need to have some kind of width.

263
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:05,070
So for the width we want to use max width because we want it to be somewhat responsive, as responsive

264
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,570
as we can make it without going into stuff we haven't talked about yet, like media queries.

265
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,810
And we're going to set that to 1100 pixels.

266
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,340
That'll be the max width.

267
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,660
All right.

268
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:25,410
And then let's see, let's add in overflow auto just so it always shows the background doesn't go outside

269
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:25,920
of it.

270
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,300
And then some padding I want to do padding.

271
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,070
Let's do zero, top and bottom.

272
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,190
And I just want left and right to have 20 pixels padding.

273
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,720
So let's save that and notice that now it's not right up against the edge.

274
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,410
And if I bring this, if I bring the browser out.

275
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,270
It's right.

276
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,000
When it hits 1100 pixels, it stops.

277
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,860
That's the max width.

278
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,270
And yet the black bar is still goes all the way across.

279
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,400
Now, I just want to show you something, and you guys don't have to do this, but if we had the container

280
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,980
on the outside of the nav bar, so have that.

281
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,240
And then the div the ending can div for the container outside of the nav bar and save.

282
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,810
Now the background doesn't reach all the way across because it's restricted inside the container.

283
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,360
And I don't like the way that that looks.

284
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,540
Websites from like you know like the early 2000s looked like that where everything was in this this

285
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,910
container and then you had some like funky background over here.

286
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,640
Nowadays, you want your backgrounds to extend all the way across and you want to just put your content

287
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,140
inside containers.

288
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,330
And that's another reason why it's a class and not an ID is because we're going to be using this container

289
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,880
class throughout throughout the site.

290
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,540
All right.

291
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,360
So let's just bring that back how it was that it's.

292
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,610
And there we go.

293
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,140
So that's it.

294
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,210
That's our nav bar.

295
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,870
So in the next video, we're going to start on the showcase area right here.
