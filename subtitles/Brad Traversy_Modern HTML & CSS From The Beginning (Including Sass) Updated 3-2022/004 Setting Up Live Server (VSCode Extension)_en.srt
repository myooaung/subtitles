1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,930
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,730
So in this video, I want to show you how to install something called Live Server, which is something

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,290
we'll be using through the course.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,040
And basically, it's an extension to voice code that allows us to open our HTML pages on a little development

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,860
server as opposed to opening them in the file system.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,650
So right now you can see that the website is open.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,470
And if you look at the URL bar, it's file colon with three slashes and then basically just shows the

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,970
path to the file.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,620
So the server will actually open it on what's called our local host.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,890
And not only that, it will it will auto reload.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,670
So when we save an HTML file or CSS or JavaScript or anything else, it's going to just auto reload.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,450
So we don't have to keep hitting the reload button every time we make a change.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,280
So we're going to go ahead and do that and I'm going to just create a new file here.

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,690
I'm going to call it zero to underscore live underscore server HTML, just naming it after what we're

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,440
doing here.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,990
And there's something else that I want to show you guys.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,440
Instead of typing out the whole structure here, like we did in this file with V's code, we can use

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,900
Emit to generate that structure.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,810
So what I'm going to do is just put an exclamation and I can either hit enter or tab and it's just going

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,020
to kind of create that structure for us so we don't have to type it out for every HTML page we create.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,660
Now notice there are some some added things here.

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,070
We have some meta tags.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,360
We're going to go over meta tags, including these ones in the next video.

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,000
But for now, I just wanted to show you that we can quickly generate our structure, our our dock type,

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,670
HTML head, body tags and stuff like that.

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,940
So I'm just going to change the title here to live server and we'll go down here and just put an H one

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,880
and we'll say we'll just say hello world doesn't really matter.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,270
I just want to put something and then I'm going to save this with control.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,660
S And we want to now install a live server.

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,910
So we're going to go over here to this extension's icon and make this a little bigger.

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,510
And we're going to search for live dash server and it's going to be this this one here, this first

32
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,250
one with this purple icon.

33
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,560
Now to install an extension in V's code, you just want to click the little green install button once

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,350
it installs, you want to click reload to activate.

35
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,440
So it's just going to kind of reset the the editor and now under enabled you're going to see live server

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,630
and any other extensions that you install will also be displayed here.

37
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,560
So now what we can do is instead of of leaving and going and opening up the file, we can simply right

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,370
click and we can say open with live server and the browser will automatically open and it will display

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,950
the web page and notice the URL now is different.

40
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,150
It's not just that file path, it's 127001, which is what's called the loopback address.

41
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,210
And this is always going to loop back to your local machine.

42
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,480
So this is your local host and then this colon, 5500, this is the port number that it's running on.

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,370
You can run things on different ports and then you just have the name of the file that's loading.

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:12,180
So from now on we're going to use live server to open our files instead of leaving and going and opening

45
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,740
the file manually.

46
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,550
Also, if I change something like let's change this to we'll just add a paragraph here and we'll say

47
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,430
This is a test and I'll just save.

48
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,150
And now if I go to Chrome, you can see this is a test is displayed.

49
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,800
I didn't have to go and reload it.

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,160
It just auto loads and this is great for when you when you actually have your editor on one side and

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
then the browser because it automatically updates.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,480
Now I don't want to do that because I only have so much screen real estate here for you guys and I don't

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,700
want to make the editor too small.

54
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,040
We might do that in some videos later on, but for now I'm just going to switch back and forth.

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,070
So to stop the server, if you go down here, you can see this port 5500.

56
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,040
If you click that, it'll stop the server from running.

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,480
And if I go back to the browser and reload, you'll see it no longer works.

58
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,870
If I want to start it again, I can either again do open with live server or I can click this go live

59
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,710
link down here.

60
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,880
If I click that, it will start it back up and open it in the browser.

61
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,690
All right.

62
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,180
So I just wanted to show you guys that and let you know that that's what we'll be using, as opposed

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,080
to just opening and opening our HTML files right on the file system.

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,290
So in the next video, we're going to take a look at meta tags.

65
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,770
We'll look at the ones that are generated here as well as some others.
