00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.140
All right, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.990
So in the last video I gave you a little challenge.

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.230
I wanted you to replace the certain divs with HTML five semantic tags to just make it more accessible,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.280
more organized.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.080
And I did the first one for you, which is the div with the ID of header.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320
So we use the header tag here.

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.600
So the next one is pretty obvious.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.600
We have a div with the ID of main that goes around.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.180
Let's take a look at the project goes around all of this area, which is basically the main content

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.290
of the page.

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.740
So that would be replaced with the main tag.

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.340
So this ends like I said, you can click on a div and it ends here.

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.230
So we want to change the ending div and we want to change the starting div.

14
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.300
So that's the first one.

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.310
Next one is going to be in here.

16
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.060
We have the welcome section which ends right here.

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.090
So this this is actually going to be a section.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.950
So we're going to change that and we're going to change that to section.

19
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.380
Next, we have the blog section.

20
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.120
Now, this ends right here.

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.150
So we're going to change this to section and change that to section.

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.400
Now within the blog we have some articles so div with the class of articles.

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.880
So these are going to be changed to article.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.460
I'm going to cover I'm going to select the div right here and then do a controlled DD.

25
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.340
I'm also going to get the next one and the next one.

26
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.110
So just some shortcuts here.

27
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.630
We're going to change all of these to article.

28
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.430
Okay.

29
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.990
So the next thing is the sidebar.

30
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.360
Now, remember, a site is for content.

31
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.790
That's not the main content, but it's on the page.

32
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.460
We have navigation, we have contact stuff here.

33
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.760
So we're going to grab this div right here along with the ending div and put in a side.

34
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.370
Now the UL, the way that NAV works is we don't actually replace the UL, we wrap the UL in a nav tag.

35
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.560
So let's say oops, let's do nav and then we'll grab this and I'll just hold option or alt and then

36
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.260
the up key and just move it up into the nav.

37
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.470
And then the last thing is going to be the footer which I want to replace the div here with footer and

38
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.100
let's save.

39
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.760
And if we take a look at the result, it looks the exact same.

40
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.570
All right.

41
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.490
So if any of what we've talked about has been confusing, don't worry about it.

42
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.180
We're going to be doing this stuff all along throughout the course.

43
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.740
So you're going to get the hang of it.

44
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.020
If what we've talked about has been painfully easy for you, don't worry about it.

45
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.150
Things are going to get more complicated.

46
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.060
I just want to start from absolute scratch for people that that have never even written a paragraph

47
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.960
tag before.

48
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.700
So hopefully, hopefully both sides are somewhat satisfied.

49
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.010
Hopefully you're starting to get it if you're an absolute beginner and hopefully I didn't bore you to

50
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.240
death if you're a more advanced front end developer.

51
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.840
All right.

52
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.000
So in the next video I'm sorry, in the next section, we're going to jump into CSS basics.

53
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.720
So we're going to start to talk about all the basic properties for colors and padding and margin and

54
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.100
the box model.

55
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.220
We're going to look at things like positioning, different types of positioning, relative, absolute

56
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.080
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

57
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.670
So that's it.

58
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.290
I'll see you in the next section.
