1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,840
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,700
So we're almost ready to start learning how to learn HTML, CSS, build websites.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,890
But before we do that, we need a couple of things.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,300
What's good about learning HTML and CSS is it doesn't take much to get started.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,210
If you're learning a more complex language like let's say PHP or Python or something like that, usually

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,640
you'll need to install a web server locally so that you can develop on your local machine and that takes

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,840
a lot more work.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,250
Some languages even need to be compiled and you need something called an ID.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,290
But with HTML CSS, we can simply click on an HTML file and run it in a browser.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,390
We can also edit it with a text editor.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,140
So those are the two things we need is a browser and a text editor.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,350
Now, it doesn't matter what operating system you're on, if you're using Windows, Mac Linux, you

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,610
can see I'm on a mac.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,240
But everything we do in this course, it doesn't matter what you're on.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,830
And if there is something little that's specific to Windows, I will mention it for you guys that are

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,940
using Windows.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,920
Now your system comes with a browser and a text editor.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,060
So for Windows you have, for instance, edge and Notepad.

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,910
For Mac, you have Safari and text at it.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,280
But these are not good for web development, especially the text editors for a browser.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,140
I would definitely recommend Google Chrome.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,530
It's it's the most popular in the web development community.

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,550
It's very fast.

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,890
It's fast to a to adapt new features and CSS JavaScript and so on.

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,620
It also has really great development tools.

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,740
Second to Chrome, I would say Firefox.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,660
As far as a text editor, you don't want to use Notepad or anything like that because there's no features,

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,990
there's no syntax highlighting anything like that.

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,200
There's a lot of choices, but what I would recommend and what I'm going to use is Visual Studio code,

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,730
and I use this for everything.

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,730
I don't just use it for HTML, CSS, I also use it for PHP, JavaScript, Python, any language that

32
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:00,630
I work with because it's just very fast, it's intuitive, has a lot of features, it has great extensions

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,280
and it's just all around.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,600
It's just a great editor.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
So that's what we'll be using.

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,870
I don't have it installed, so I'm going to go ahead and download it and it's available for Windows,

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,780
Mac or Linux.

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,600
It doesn't matter what system you're on.

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,720
So on a mac, it's just going to give me the zip file.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,160
I'll go ahead and open it up.

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,180
Or unpack it.

42
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,100
And you can see I have my icon here and I'm just going to bring it to my applications folder.

43
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,280
So once it's in there, I can open it up.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,490
I'm actually going to drag it down to my bar, which you guys can't see, just so I can easily access

45
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,310
it and then I'll go ahead and open it.

46
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,760
So when you first open up vs code, you'll see a welcome page.

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,890
It'll give you some options, like open up a file, open a folder, it'll show you a recent projects.

48
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,970
And the only reason I have recent projects is because I already had VS code installed.

49
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,070
I just uninstalled it for this course.

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,280
If also over here if you want to change your theme.

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,180
So if I click color theme, it'll open up this, which is the command palette.

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,480
And for instance, we could change it to a light theme and you can kind of experiment with these a little

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,720
bit.

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,510
I'm just going to keep the regular dark theme like that.

55
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,160
So let's close this welcome page up and head over to the sidebar.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,520
So this first icon here is your your file explorer.

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,560
So when you have a website or a web application, it's going to be in a folder and you're going to want

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,580
to open that folder so that you can see the files and access them easily.

59
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,550
So I actually have a folder that is on my desktop that I'm going to open called Split Landing Page,

60
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:36,280
which is just a very simple website with some JavaScript and HTML, CSS.

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,840
So I'm going to open that and you'll see that I have the files over here.

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,440
So we have one HTML file, we have a CSS file for styling, and then we have a JavaScript file.

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,840
And when I just clicked them once, notice that they just open and they just stay in this one tab and

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,950
then it kind of closes when I click on the next one, if I double click, it'll stay.

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,170
So if I go click on the next file, notice that the HTML indexed HTML stayed there.

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,330
If I double click this one, it'll stay there and then I can just close them up and we'll be working

67
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,370
in the file Explorer quite a bit.

68
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,460
So the next thing I want to show you is the settings.

69
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,870
Now, this this text right here is way too small, especially for doing a course.

70
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,760
You guys probably can barely read this.

71
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,040
So to get to the settings, you can go to this little gear and you can go to settings or you can do

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,230
control comma on a on a windows machine or command comma on a mac.

73
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,350
And that will also bring you to the settings as we go along here.

74
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm going to be teaching you guys some of the keyboard shortcuts because your workflow really speeds

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,420
up when you learn shortcuts.

76
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,930
And when we write our code, our HTML, CSS, I'm going to teach you some shortcuts to navigate around

77
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,700
really easily as well.

78
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,950
So what I want to change is the font size, which is actually right here editor font size.

79
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,720
But if I couldn't find this, I could just search for it up here so I could say font size.

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,090
And you can see now it's at the top here, it's 14 pixels by default.

81
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,500
So I want to change it to 26 and that should take effect right away.

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,620
The only other setting I want to change is my tab space.

83
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,920
So if I type in tab spaces, the default is four.

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:22,570
And what this means is the number of spaces that it indents when you hit tab because in HTML and in

85
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,370
most languages you're going to you're going to indent to organize your code.

86
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,140
But four is a little too much for me.

87
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,630
I like to keep it at two, so I'm going to change that to two and that should save right away.

88
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,520
So let's close up the settings.

89
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,110
And now if I go back to let's say index HTML, notice, the font is much bigger and a tab now is two

90
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,060
spaces as opposed to four.

91
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,020
So the last thing I want to do is just go over these other icons.

92
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,850
This one is just a search.

93
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,730
So if you want to search within the page, you can also replace.

94
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,310
This is for version control with Git.

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,170
We're not going to get into that right now.

96
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,360
This is a debugger for programming languages like Python, JavaScript and so on.

97
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,490
Also something we're not going to get into.

98
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,610
But this one right here, the last one is your extensions.

99
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,250
So you can extend the functionality of voice code with a whole bunch of extensions.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,530
And we don't have any installed right now, but it does show some of the popular ones shows us some

101
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,750
of the recommended recommendations.

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,780
If you want to search, you can search like let's say we're using PHP, if we want to search for PHP

103
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,080
extensions like this one right here, IntelliSense.

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,520
And if we click on that, it'll show us a bunch of documentation and examples.

105
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,480
Basically, this gives you some PHP dropdowns as you can see right here.

106
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,550
If we wanted to install this, we could just click the green install button and it would simply get

107
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,390
installed.

108
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,740
And if I make this a little bigger, you can see the number of downloads.

109
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,840
You can see this one has 5.7 million downloads and a rating of 3.5.

110
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,840
So you see the number of downloads as well as the ratings.

111
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,850
And I do have a couple of extensions that I want to install later, but I don't want to get into that

112
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,630
right now.

113
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,350
All right.

114
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,210
So now that you have vs code set up in the next section, we're going to jump in and we're going to

115
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,830
start to learn HTML.
