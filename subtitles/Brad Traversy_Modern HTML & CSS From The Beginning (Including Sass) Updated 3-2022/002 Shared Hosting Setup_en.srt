1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,720
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,140
So we're going to deploy our site to a shared host with In Motion hosting, which is a service that

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,960
I've used for a long time.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,770
I'm actually going to create a new account.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,360
They're not paying me a dime for this.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,220
However, I do have an affiliate link that I'll attach in a document to this lecture.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,170
So if you are going to buy a package, I'd appreciate it if you could use that link.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,530
All right.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,420
So I'm actually going to go ahead and set up an account just out of pocket just to demonstrate this

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:27,810
to you.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,380
So as you can see, there's different types of hosting they offer.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,080
Many of them are the types we've talked about now.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,560
Their shared hosting plans are going to be the business hosting.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,890
You'll notice with different companies, they'll call it different things.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,050
They also have WordPress hosting, which is basically the business hosting or shared hosting.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,720
But with WordPress already preconfigured, WordPress is actually a content management system and it

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,630
might be something worth looking into after this course.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,220
They also have veeps hosting, dedicated servers, reseller hosting.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,550
We're going to go ahead and click on Learn More for business hosting.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,220
So as you can see, if you choose any type of hosting, they're going to have additional packages with

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,570
different price points.

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,080
And these prices here are actually if you pay for two years in advance, 399, you'll see one year is

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,280
4.99.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,620
This one is one year, 6.99.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:26,970
So very rarely, if ever, are you going to find a hosting company that allows you to actually pay $3.99

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,290
month by month.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
Usually you have to pay by year by two years.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,580
Sometimes they'll allow six months.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,710
It really depends on the company.

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,770
But for now we're going to choose or I'm going to choose the cheapest version here for one year.

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,520
Now, the difference between these, you can see, is the number of websites.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,590
So you can have different amounts of websites.

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,930
The disk space and bandwidth is unlimited on all of these, but you have to be careful with shared hosting,

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,430
even though it says unlimited.

35
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,240
If you start to slow the server down, you start to slow down resources.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,560
They're either going to throttle you or they're going to ask you to bump up your package.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:09,600
If you have a website that has a ton of users or it's a really big or big application, something like

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,550
that, then you're going to want to use a VPN or dedicated server or something like that.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,960
But like I said, most small business websites, these are absolutely fine.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,480
I would probably say go with the middle tier, but since I'm just doing this for the course, I'm going

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,420
to choose the cheapest one available, which is going to be one year for 4.99 per month, which should

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,820
come to about $60 a year.

43
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,930
Yeah.

44
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:43,130
Now, if you want an sstl certificate, they do offer free SLRs, but you do have to have a dedicated

45
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,590
IP for that, which is an additional $4 a month, which is $48.

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,280
So they're going to charge you an extra $48 if you want a dedicated IP and an SSTL.

47
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,420
I'm not going to choose that, but just know that you will need to if you want sstl.

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,100
And then here, this is for just like a quick start or one page website for 100 bucks.

49
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,760
Obviously we don't want that.

50
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,510
And then if we want to install WordPress or Bold Grid, we could do that.

51
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,070
But we're not going to do that either.

52
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,910
So let's click Continue and now it's going to ask about a domain.

53
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,290
Now within motion, you can purchase a domain through them.

54
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:28,400
I think it's 1499 per year or if you have your own, you could choose this option here and to your domain

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,650
and then you would have to go wherever you registered that domain and just update what's called name

56
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,010
servers to point to your in motion hosting account for just registering domains.

57
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,410
I actually suggest name cheap dot com.

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,560
I'll put an affiliate link for name cheap in the document as well, but I'm just going to go ahead and

59
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,270
purchase a new domain here.

60
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:58,130
So I'm going to do Edge Leger and I believe dot com is already taken but dot net is not.

61
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,820
So I'm going to just choose edge ledger dot net as my domain.

62
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,460
So as you can see, it's available.

63
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,500
So I'm going to add it to my cart.

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,290
And then over here you can see my total is 84 to 86.

65
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,560
That's for the entire year for the domain and for the hosting.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,029
And let's see, just continue here.

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,269
Actually, I'm going to remove the domain privacy.

68
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,640
What that means is if someone tries to do a who is check on your domain, they won't be able to see

69
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,370
your like the email address you used and stuff like that.

70
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,070
But I don't care about that, so I'll delete that.

71
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,400
And then over here I am a returning customer, but I want to create a whole new identity for this just

72
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,670
because this is only for the course.

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,740
So I'll go ahead and put an email address in here

74
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,320
and continue.

75
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,750
And then it's probably going to take me to a page where I have to enter my credit card information and

76
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,940
stuff like that.

77
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,450
Yeah, all my information.

78
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,900
So what I'm going to do is pause the video.

79
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,610
I'm going to fill all this out and then I'll come back.

80
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,240
All right?

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,100
So I filled out all my information.

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,930
It gave me a summary up here.

83
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,050
So now I just need to click agree and check out.

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,280
Okay.

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,970
So now it says welcome to In Motion hosting order details.

86
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,730
And down here it's going to ask if we're creating a new website or transferring an existing website.

87
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,720
So we're going to go ahead and click creating a new website.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,350
And they also ask if you want a one on one call from a new account specialist so someone that can actually

89
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,320
call you and help you out if you need help, which I think is really cool.

90
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,870
But obviously we're not we're going to click no, thanks.

91
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:55,220
And then here they have really good documentation and support for the control panel, setting up FTP

92
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,690
accounts and stuff like that.

93
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,660
And you can get custom articles sent to you, but I'm not going to check any of these, so we'll just

94
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,860
leave them all blank.

95
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,720
Oh, I guess we have to check at least one.

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,070
So we'll do.

97
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,510
Let's do getting started.

98
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,250
So it's going to process that.

99
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,160
Now, we should have an email that has information on how to access our C panel, our control panel

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,240
and stuff like that.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,840
So I'm going to just pause the video and pull up that email.

102
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,430
All right.

103
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,270
So this is the email that you'll get welcome to In Motion hosting.

104
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,890
And it's going to say get started with your account management panel also called AMP.

105
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,400
So your email, your login is going to be your email address.

106
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,340
And then it says to get started, set your password here.

107
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,810
So we're going to go ahead and click that.

108
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,730
We're going to set a password.

109
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,020
So

110
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,360
actually use something different here.

111
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,240
All right.

112
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,820
So that might be too simple.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,940
I'm going to be canceling this account anyways.

114
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,460
All right.

115
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,610
So this is your AMP panel, and this is this is basically in Motion's customer panel.

116
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,630
You can update your contact information, your credit card info.

117
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,960
If you have trouble, you can send in a support ticket.

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,200
And then down here you have your link to see panel, which is basically your web hosting control panel

119
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,720
and many, many different companies.

120
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,910
You see panel, it's the most popular type of control panel for managed hosting.

121
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,680
You can also check your email from here, but you can also do that from C panel.

122
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,100
You can install software like WordPress, stuff like that.

123
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,320
You can manage your SSL certificates.

124
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,810
So it's basically your your client panel.

125
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,660
So let's go ahead and click on See panel and that should open up and let's just close this up.

126
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,930
So this is your control panel for your basically your website, your hosting account, and you'll see

127
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,790
there's different sections preferences.

128
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,580
We have a lot of the stuff that we have in the AMP panel like Contact Information and to get back to

129
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,550
AMP, you can click here or you can go click home.

130
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,130
There's also links up here to get to different sections, but email, you have your email accounts,

131
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,440
you can set up your forwarders, your email routing, you have spam filtering, stuff like that.

132
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,050
Domains, if you wanted to add another domain, if you want to create redirects, you can do that from

133
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,590
here.

134
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,070
If you want to install applications on your website like WordPress, which is a blog slash CMS content

135
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,990
management system, you also have like shopping carts, open cart press to shop.

136
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,430
These are open source shopping carts that you can install and use on your website.

137
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,630
You have software, so PHP packages, stuff like that, files, FTP accounts, we're going to get into

138
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,360
that because we need a way to actually upload our files to our site and databases.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,940
If you get into application development, you'll probably want to get into like MySQL or Postgres.

140
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,650
These are relational databases and these are included as well metrics.

141
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,620
If you want to look at analytics, your website, visitors and so on, security, you can block certain

142
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,910
IP addresses.

143
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,890
You do do have shell access, which means you can log in through the terminal into your account and

144
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,900
do different things and advance.

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,410
We have things like cron jobs, but that's way beyond this course.

146
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,490
All right.

147
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,140
And on the right side, I mean, I have mine blurred out just because there's some sensitive information,

148
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,570
but it has all your stats and stuff like that, the number of FTP accounts you use and email accounts

149
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,350
and so on.

150
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,860
So in the next video, before we start to deploy our website, I want to show you how to create email

151
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,650
accounts as well as FTP accounts.
