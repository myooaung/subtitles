00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.540
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.580
In this video, we're going to look at text shadows.

3
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.780
And this is another thing that I personally don't use that much.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.220
Just like we can add shadows to elements, we can also add them to text.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.580
So let's create a new file in our sandbox called zero five.

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.770
Underscore text, underscore shadows html.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.660
Okay, we'll go ahead and put our boilerplate in and I'm just going to close up the sidebar.

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.900
Let's say text shadows put in our style.

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.000
And what I'm going to do here is just I'm just going to have four different age ones.

10
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.130
So we're going to say h one.

11
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.700
And inside the content, let's say welcome to my course.

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:58.240
And I just want to add actually let's do this two times four and I want to add a class, a different

13
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.560
class to each one.

14
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.630
So let's say Class A.

15
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.900
Class B.

16
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.280
Oops.

17
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.260
Class C and class D.

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.760
So we have these different classes on each H one because I want to give you a different example for

19
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.450
each one.

20
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.460
Now I'm going to do just a core styling here of font family and let's do Ariel.

21
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.670
And then let's make the font size pretty big.

22
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.250
So we'll do font size, let's do five REM and we'll go ahead and open that up.

23
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.590
And actually, it's do a little bit smaller for REM good.

24
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.560
So let's start off with the first one, which is an H one with a class of A.

25
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.650
And of course, I could just do a, but I just want to I'm changing things up just so you guys remember

26
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.430
that you can do this, know you can do just a or you can target the H one with the class of a.

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.530
So let me just paste this in just like with Box Shadow, we have a couple of different values, so we

28
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.200
have the H shadow, which is horizontal shadow and the vertical or V shadow and the color.

29
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:27.170
So let's go ahead and add to this first one text dash shadow and I'm going to use REM units.

30
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.220
I'm just going to do 0.2 REM eight shadow.

31
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.000
Let's do point to REM V shadow and for color I'm going to use steel blue.

32
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.330
So let's save that, see what it looks like.

33
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.670
So as you can see, the the horizontal shadow basically is this way.

34
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.780
Vertical shadow is going down, it's going this way.

35
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.020
So it kind of comes off diagonal this way.

36
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.800
Now, just like with Box Shadow, we can also have a blur.

37
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.950
So let's do an H one, let's do h one, B.

38
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:12.380
So we're now targeting the B class, which is the second one here, and let's paste this in here.

39
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.580
So it's actually blur and then color, and I'm going to copy what we already have up here and paste

40
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.300
this in.

41
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.700
So let's do.

42
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.600
Let's do for REM.

43
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.940
We'll do for REM three REM for the V shadow and then for the blur.

44
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.510
Let's do we'll do 0.7 REM and we'll keep still blue.

45
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.500
So let's save that.

46
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.390
And now you can see that we have the the blur effect and you can use pixels if you want.

47
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.560
It doesn't have to be REM units, but that gives kind of a different look.

48
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.630
So next thing I want to do is white text.

49
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.930
So let's do H one dot C.

50
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.900
And let's do white text.

51
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.270
So basically what we're doing is setting the color to white.

52
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.060
If I save that, it's going to just completely disappear.

53
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.110
But what we can do is add the shadow so that we can actually make out the text.

54
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.420
So we'll do 20.2 REM.

55
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.400
0.2 REM.

56
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.300
Let's do one REM for the Blur and let's do Steel Blue and save.

57
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.860
And it's going to look like that.

58
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.440
So we get some pretty cool text effects here.

59
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.920
Again, not something that I really use that much, but it's good to know.

60
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.480
So for the last one here, I want to show you that we can use negative values.

61
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.340
So I'm just going to copy this.

62
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.370
Let's grab this one here.

63
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.370
And instead of it coming this way, I want it to go up.

64
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.930
I want it to go this way so we could add a negative value for the H shadow and the V shadow and we'll

65
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.500
save.

66
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.090
And now you can see that the blur is is up here rather than down here.

67
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.260
Okay.

68
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.790
So that's about it, guys.

69
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.960
We probably won't use this this tech shadow again.

70
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.180
I just wanted to include it in the course in case you like it and you want to use it maybe in, like

71
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.650
a showcase area or something like that.

72
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.060
All right.

73
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.070
So I will see you in the next video.
