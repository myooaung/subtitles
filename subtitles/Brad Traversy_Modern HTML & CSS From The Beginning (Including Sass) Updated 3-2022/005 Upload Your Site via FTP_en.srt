1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,570
All right, so now it's time to actually upload our website.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,900
So if we go to our domain name, obviously yours is different, but mine is edge ledger dot net.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,500
We're just going to see the in motion just placeholder.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,100
So we obviously want to replace this with the website that we built.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,120
So we're going to go down to where it says files and we want to click on FTP accounts.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,890
FTP stands for file transfer protocol and it's an Internet protocol that's used for file transfer.

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,740
That's I guess that's the easiest way I can put it.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,140
And right here we can put in just like with the email accounts, any name we want, I'm just going to

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,630
do Brad and it's going to be at edge ledger dot net.

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,240
Yours would be different obviously.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,770
And then a password.

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,210
So I'll just put in a password here

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,980
and this is really important.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,240
So the directory by default, it's going to put it into this this FTP account will go to just a separate

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,760
folder called Brad, which is not very useful.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,510
We want to actually go to the root of the of the website so that we can access the root page here.

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,170
So we're going to just clear all of this out like that.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,780
And you can also set a quota if you want and upload quota, but we're just going to keep unlimited and

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,390
then let's click create FTP account.

20
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,070
And now that's been created now to access our file, we need to we need to add an FTP client and I would

21
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,810
highly recommend file zilla.

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,730
So if we just search for file zilla, it's going to be this right here file zilla project dot org.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,490
And you want to make sure you get the client, not the server.

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,400
The server is if you want to have your own FTP server, so you just want to click download here and

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,030
download and it's for Mac Windows Linux, it's cross-platform.

26
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,020
So just grab that once it's installed you can open it up.

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,920
I already have it installed, so I'm just going to open it up here and you're going to see you're going

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,510
to see something like this.

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,650
And over here on this side is your local machine.

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,440
As you can see, it's showing my desktop right here.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,510
These are the folders I have on my desktop, which includes the Edge Ledger website that we built.

32
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,090
So if I go in there, you'll see the HTML file or CSS image javascript.

33
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,690
DataStore is just a hidden mac file, so don't worry about that.

34
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,850
If you're on Windows you won't even have that.

35
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,700
But what we're going to do now is log in to our website through FTP.

36
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,760
So up here in the host we want to put our domain name.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:49,440
So I'm going to use edge ledger dot net and then the username is going to be whatever your FTP account

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,750
is, mine is Brad at edge ledger dot net.

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,720
And then the password that we used.

40
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,660
What was it?

41
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,890
And then port, you can leave that blank.

42
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,320
The default port for FTP is 21, but if you leave it blank, it's still going to use 21.

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,170
So we don't need to put it in and then click connect and you might get a box that says like authorize

44
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,770
or something.

45
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,790
The first time you try to log in, just say okay or authorize or whatever.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,970
Now what we're looking at here is the root of our entire server, or I should say our count.

47
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,110
And the place where you want to go to for your website is public HTML.

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,300
This public underscore HTML.

49
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,050
This is our actual website.

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:45,420
So if we go into there, what we're going to see is a couple of files and the default team so it can

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,150
be HTML or FTM.

52
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,080
That is the the landing page that we see the coming soon page.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,140
So what we want to do is delete everything in here.

54
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,630
We're just going to delete all of this.

55
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,170
So we'll say yes to the confirmation.

56
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,930
And then if I go back to Edge Ledger dot net and reload, we're just going to see this this blank index

57
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,870
of so there's no files here.

58
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,290
So we want to go to file zilla and just bring all of our website files, not the DD's store, but our

59
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,300
website files right over.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,190
We can just drag and drop and it's simply going to upload them to our host.

61
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,140
So it's all done.

62
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,990
So there's only a couple of files, so it doesn't take long.

63
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,030
And then if we go back to our domain and reload, there's our website.

64
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,420
So our website is now live on the Internet.

65
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,650
And it's easy as that.

66
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,870
Now, FTP is when you start to get into application development.

67
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,640
When you're building these larger apps, FTP is not really efficient.

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,810
It's very slow.

69
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,660
You'll probably want to start to learn about Get and using SSH, using the control panel, stuff like

70
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,200
that.

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,300
But that's later on down the road.

72
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,320
For now, if you're just building small business websites, HTML, CSS, a little front end JavaScript,

73
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,090
I mean, FTP is fine.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:16,210
So now that you know how to purchase a shared hosting account, create email accounts, create FTP,

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,380
upload your site.

76
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,790
In the next video, we're going to start to learn more about CSS.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,930
We're going to start to learn about transitions and stuff.

78
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,900
We're going to start to look at the grid system and then we're going to build some more projects.

79
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,210
I'm also going to show you how to deploy to a static host called NetFlow Phi a little later on.

80
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,580
All right.

81
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,380
So I'll see you in the next section.
