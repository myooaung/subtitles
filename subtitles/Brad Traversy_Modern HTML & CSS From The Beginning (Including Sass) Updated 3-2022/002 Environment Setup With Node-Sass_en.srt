1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,690
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,900
So now we're going to go ahead and set up Node Sass so that we can compile our XSS files in our SAS

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,470
code.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,600
So you need to go to Node.js dot org if you don't already have it installed and just go ahead and install

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,550
either the long term support or the current version for latest features doesn't really matter in this

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,480
situation.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:25,020
Now we're going to jump into VS code and I just have an empty folder called SAS Sandbox and we need

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,060
to use the terminal or the command line.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,010
I'm going to use my integrated terminal.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:36,030
We can open that in V code with control tilde or you can go to the view menu and just go to terminal

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,090
or you can use your standard Mac terminal, Windows Command prompt to Linux terminal or whatever and

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,070
just do a quick NPM Dash Dash version just to make sure you have NPM installed.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,150
And then what we want to do is create a package JSON file since we're installing anything with NPM and

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,520
we can generate that with NPM init.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,500
And then I'm also going to add on dash y so that we don't have to answer a bunch of questions.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,360
It will just give us the defaults.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,650
So let's go ahead and run that and I'll clear this up with control L and in our package JSON, it just

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,050
has the name, the version, all that stuff.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,520
Once we install Node SAS, it should get listed in here as a dependency.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,920
So let's say NPM, install node dash SAS.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:27,940
Okay.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,320
So it's going to install it in a folder called Node Modules.

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,840
And you can see it's listed here as a dependency.

24
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,670
Now in order to use node sass, we're going to create an NPM script.

25
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,720
So inside here at this scripts, we don't need this test.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,970
I'm actually going to change this to SAS.

27
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,890
That way we can just run NPM, run, run SAS.

28
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,700
And then in here we want it to run Node SAS, we want to set a watch flag.

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,850
So Dash W we want it to constantly watch a folder called SAS, which we haven't created yet.

30
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:10,740
So slash and then we want it to output dash oh to a folder called dist slash.

31
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,820
CSS dist is where basically our project is going to live.

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,890
The HTML files, the CSS, anything that we would deploy will be in that dist folder.

33
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,090
And then we're just going to add a dash dash recursive flag here.

34
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,980
All right.

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,420
So that should be good.

36
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,480
Let's go ahead and save this and we'll close it up.

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,320
And now what I'll do is create a folder called Success, and this is where all of our SAS files will

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,590
go.

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:45,060
So let's create a file called Main Dot Success and you can see it as a little SAS logo there.

40
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,930
Now we also want to create a folder called Dist and this is where the compiled CSS is going to go as

41
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,550
we direct it in our script.

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:01,770
So let's go ahead and clear this up down here and let's run NPM, run SAS.

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,990
Now what this is going to do is it's going to constantly watch the SAS folder and any SAS files in it,

44
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,180
and as soon as we save it'll compile into dist CSS, which we haven't even created.

45
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,260
We don't have to create it.

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,490
It will do it on its own.

47
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,920
So we'll test this out by just creating a variable and I'm going to discuss variables and stuff in depth.

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,240
I just want to test it out.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,550
So I'm going to say we want to say color.

50
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:38,250
We'll set that to red and let's say body and we'll set the background to the variable of color.

51
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,220
So this is SAS, this is not regular CSS.

52
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,020
Now I'm going to save it with control.

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,620
S And as soon as I save it, it'll tell us down here that rendering is complete and if we look in DIST,

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,370
we now have a CSS file with a main dot CSS.

55
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,220
So it's going to copy the name which we called main and it's going to just name it that, but it's going

56
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,360
to be a CSS file.

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,080
And if we look in that, it's just a body background read.

58
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,310
So it takes this sass with these variables, compiles it down to this CSS and then this is what we include

59
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,600
in our HTML.

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:20,190
So in DIST, I'm going to create a file called index dot HTML and we'll just put in our boilerplate

61
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,579
here.

62
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:33,900
Let's call this SAS sandbox and we want to link to see CSS slash main CSS and we'll just put an H one.

63
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,360
And we'll save that.

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,210
Now we can open this HTML with a live server.

65
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,330
And now we have a red background.

66
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,640
Now, if I go back into my SAS file, this is where you want to do all your styling.

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,200
You don't want to touch the CSIS, just the SAS.

68
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,430
I'm going to change this to Blue, and as soon as I save that, you'll see down here it renders and

69
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,080
then we can go back.

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,910
And now we have a blue background.

71
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,550
So our entire environment is set up.

72
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:13,720
Now when you're ready to deploy, you will just take this dist folder, this other stuff, node modules,

73
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,740
you all your SAS package, JSON, this is your development environment.

74
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,960
This only has to do with your development.

75
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,090
This DIST is your actual project, your actual product that you would deploy.

76
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,810
All right.

77
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,410
So that's how we work with Node SAS and we're going to come back to this.

78
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,380
But in the next video, I want to show you another option which is using a graphical program called

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,190
Koala.

80
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,300
So we'll take a look at that and then we'll jump back in and we'll start to look at the features of

81
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,080
SAS.
