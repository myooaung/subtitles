1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,440
So we deployed our website to notify and we have our form working, but our domain looks like this.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,560
So obviously you're not going to want that for your website.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,100
Now, there's plenty of domain registrars out there.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,240
I go with name cheap.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,000
They're they're cheap, obviously.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,500
Also, they're very reliable.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,670
They have great support.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,990
I've been using them for years.

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,300
It's a company that I personally recommend.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,770
They're not paying me a dime for this.

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,640
However, I do have an affiliate link that I'm going to include, if you guys can use that.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,970
If you do purchase a domain, that would mean a lot to me.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,430
So what you would do is just search.

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,410
So let's say we wanted like news.

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,980
Obviously, news grid is taken, let's search for news grid site and click the search.

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,220
And as you can see, it is available, the dot com is available and it's 888 per year.

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,540
So pretty cheap.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,980
And then down here you can see some other options like the dot net dot I, which is much more expensive,

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,140
dot org, dot IO and then there's a bunch of other ones down here.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,260
Usually I would suggest if it's a if it's a real site like your company site, I would suggest registering

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,920
the dot com, the dot net, the dot org, all the big TLDs I would suggest taking because you want to

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,840
be in control of that, especially if your company gets big and stuff like that.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,160
But I'm not going to actually register a domain because I already have some, so I'm just going to use

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,830
one of my my current domains.

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,050
So once you register and you go through the process, if you go to your dashboard, you're going to

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,090
see all of your active domains.

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,260
Now, the one that I'm going to use for this project is this app demo 112 dot com.

29
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,920
So I'm going to go to manage and this is going to bring you to basically the control panel for that

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,240
particular domain.

31
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,470
Now, before I do anything here, we're going to go back to Fi.

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,650
And step two is you can see is set up a custom domain and you're going to put in the domain you want

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,010
to use.

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:12,870
So I'm going to say W WW dot app demo 112 dot com and click verify already has an owner.

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,650
Is it you.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,210
Yes add domain.

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,300
All right.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,720
So now here says by default your site is always accessible subdomain.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,600
So it's still going to be accessible through the net subdomain, which is this crazy domain here.

40
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,670
Now, there's a few things we need to do to connect app demo one 1202 to our account because if it just

41
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,610
let us do it, anyone could take any domain and connect it to that, to that website.

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:56,040
So I'm going to go to this this documentation page here, this custom domains documentation and scroll

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,730
down.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,200
And this basically tells us what to do, but it's kind of long winded.

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,540
So I'm going to go to let's see, where is it right here so we can use.

46
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,270
We can use Natalya Fi's built in DNS, but I'm not going to do that.

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,980
I'm going to use this method here.

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,770
It says, Create an A record pointing your root domain to our load balancers IP address, which is this

49
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,150
number here, 104 1981452.

50
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,040
So this is an IP address.

51
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:36,360
Remember, we talked about this a long time ago, so we're going to copy this, this load balancer IP,

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,470
and we're going to go to our domain panel and go to advance DNS.

53
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,680
And remember, it said, create an A record.

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,030
So down here you can see it says Add new record.

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,510
I'm going to click that and I'm going to choose a record for the host.

56
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,440
We're going to put the at symbol, meaning just the root, the root of the domain.

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,910
And we're going to paste in that IP address and then click the check mark.

58
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,810
All right.

59
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,370
And then the next thing we need to do is add a new record of a C name.

60
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:16,019
So we're going to say C name and we're going to point W WW to whatever your net ified domain is, which

61
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,190
mine is this right here.

62
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,290
So yours will obviously be different.

63
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:25,230
So I'm going to grab that and I'm going to put that in here inside the C name and we're going to click

64
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,980
the check.

65
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,870
All right.

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,670
Now, this stuff up here, I'm actually going to delete.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,250
The stuff that was already here.

68
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,750
Okay.

69
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,870
So we just have our a record and see name record now.

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,380
If you needed to have an email addresses with this domain, you would find a separate email service

71
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,470
and you would have to use what's called an MX record.

72
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,580
But I'm not going to get into this in in this video, in this course.

73
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,660
We just want to deploy this website so we have this stuff done.

74
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,660
So let's go back to our domain management page and let's reload.

75
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,300
And you can see now that check, check status thing is gone and these are now green.

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,610
So I don't know if it's going to work yet.

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,570
Sometimes it takes a little while to propagate, but let's try it out.

78
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,820
We'll go to WW W Dot App Demo 112 dot com.

79
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
There it is.

80
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,400
So it's as easy as that to create our domain.

81
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,840
All right.

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,740
And as you can see, it's HTTPS and this is all free.

83
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,610
Didn't pay a dime.

84
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,420
Didn't put any credit card information in.

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,100
Nothing.

86
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,340
So it's a fantastic service, really.

87
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,620
So if we go back to overview, everything is done, everything is deployed.

88
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,820
We have our form.

89
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,520
Just to test that out one more time, we'll go down here.

90
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,830
I'll just say Brad at Gmail and subscribe back to site.

91
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,470
We'll go back to our panel here and reload.

92
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,160
And if we look at the form submissions, you can see Brad at Gmail.

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,880
So that's it.

94
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,580
Our website is deployed and that's that.

95
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:00,910
All right.

96
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,710
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
