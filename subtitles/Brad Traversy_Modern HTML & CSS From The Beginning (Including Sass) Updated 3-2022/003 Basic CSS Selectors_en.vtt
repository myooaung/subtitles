00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.930
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.310
So in the last video I showed you how to implement CSIS in a few different ways.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.330
And the most common way is going to be by using an external stylesheet like a style CSS and then bringing

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.520
it in using the link tag.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.370
But like I said, for the sandbox, for the section, I'm going to be using internal CSS in a style

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.930
tag just so we have everything on one page just for the sake of learning.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:35.550
So let's create a new file here and we're going to call this zero to underscore selectors dot HTML because

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.610
what I want to talk about is the different ways that we can select content to style or select elements

9
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.110
or tags to style.

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.050
So let's put in our boilerplate here with VS code and let's call this CSS selectors

11
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.960
and we're going to put in some style tags here.

12
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.050
And then as far as the body, I'm going to just put in some simple HTML, we'll have a div and inside

13
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:18.570
this div, let's do an H two, we'll just say welcome and paragraph, let's do lorem 20 tab and then

14
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:29.400
let's do another div and we'll do another h two and we'll say about paragraph lorem 20 tab.

15
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.070
So let's save this and let's open it up with live server if you're using live server.

16
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
So we have two divs with heading and a paragraph.

17
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.060
Now in the last video we took in H two and we gave it a color.

18
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.020
Let's go ahead and do that.

19
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.160
We'll say green.

20
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.570
And if I save that, what happens is it's going to take every single H two on the page and style it

21
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.290
green.

22
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.770
Now there's going to be cases where you don't want every single element, whatever that element is to

23
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.400
be styled.

24
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.700
You want to pick and choose what you want to style like.

25
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.720
Let's say we only want this, this one, this first one to be green.

26
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.150
In that case, we would use an ID or a class.

27
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:23.760
So if I were to add ID, green dash heading, I could go up here and I could add on to this h to a number

28
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.640
sign which represents an ID and then the name of the ID and I could have called it, called it absolutely

29
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.750
anything if I save that notice, only the first one is green because it's targeting this ID.

30
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.420
Now, this is actually optional.

31
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.880
We don't have to put the actual element.

32
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.540
However, if we keep it off like that, we could add this green heading ID to anything and it would

33
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.470
be in effect.

34
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.270
If I add it to a paragraph, it would turn the paragraph color green, although that wouldn't make much

35
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.250
sense because we call the green heading.

36
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.250
But for the most part, you're not going to see the actual element, at least in my experience.

37
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.210
Now, remember what I said about classes and IDs?

38
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.580
This is not really something I would put inside of an ID because it doesn't really.

39
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.740
For one thing, we might want to use this again.

40
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.800
We might want another green heading somewhere and IDs should be something that there's only one of.

41
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.940
So I would actually change this to a class and then to target a class, the styling is the same way.

42
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.260
It's just this right here.

43
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.390
Instead of a number sign, you want a dot.

44
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.180
So if I save that notice, it's still green.

45
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:44.910
So just remember a number sign is for ids, dot is for classes and I'm just going to comment this stuff

46
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.120
out just so you have just you have some reference and I'll do an ID and I'll add that as well later

47
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.570
on.

48
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.280
So now what I want to do is talk a little bit about naming conventions.

49
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.800
This is not really a good name because at any point we might want to change this to a different color

50
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.430
like blue.

51
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.150
Maybe, maybe it's a website for a company and they change their branding.

52
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.380
So if I save that it's now blue and this this heading or I'm sorry, this, this title here, the class

53
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.820
name makes no sense.

54
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.519
So what I would do is I'd call this something like primary heading instead of green heading.

55
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.670
That way it's just your primary color, your headings, primary color.

56
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.740
You may might even have a secondary heading class if you want a different color and it doesn't have

57
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.520
to just be color.

58
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.670
You could change the font size, whatever it is that you want.

59
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.380
But you want to think about your naming conventions and you want to think about the future.

60
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.180
Could this change in the future?

61
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.000
So calling it green heading is not really a good choice, even though it's it's going to work.

62
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.260
It's just it doesn't it's not it's not a smart choice, semantically.

63
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.280
All right.

64
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.820
So now what I want to do is let's see, let's add an ID to these.

65
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.390
So we'll call this one welcome and let's call this one about.

66
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.450
So you see how this makes sense because we're not going to have another welcome Div or another about

67
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.010
DIV.

68
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.600
So an ID is a good choice for this.

69
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:25.470
So if I wanted to let's say let's say give the welcome idea background color, I could target it like

70
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.340
this.

71
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.710
Right?

72
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.760
And I'll say background or background color.

73
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.100
And don't worry about any of these properties.

74
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.220
I don't want you to focus on these because we're going to talk about all of these later.

75
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.100
I just I want you to focus on the selectors.

76
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.800
So I'm going to give this a background color of a hexadecimal value that's actually a light gray.

77
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.270
So if I save that, notice that this only has that background color.

78
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.190
So let me put a comment here and say the number sign is for IDs.

79
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.330
Now, what if I want to have some styling, but I want it for both of these divs right here.

80
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.860
So if we want to do that, we can use multiple selectors.

81
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.200
So what I'll do is I'll take the welcome the div with the idea of welcome, put a comma and then put

82
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.710
the div with the ID of a bow and then put my styling.

83
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.720
So let's say I want to give them a border of one pixel solid.

84
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.980
I'll do, I don't know, like gray.

85
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.230
And I'm going to talk about these numbers probably in the next video or the one after that.

86
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:48.540
And then I also want to add a little bit of padding and margin bottom of five pixels.

87
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.840
All right.

88
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.920
So I'm going to save that.

89
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.340
And that style was now it was applied to both of these divs because I used multiple selectors and I

90
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.720
could add more if I want.

91
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.160
It doesn't have to be IDs.

92
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.580
I could put an H two, I could put a paragraph, I could put a class or whatever I want, and that would

93
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.040
take on all of these styles in here.

94
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.920
Now, let's say I wanted to target a specific, for instance, a specific paragraph inside of a specific

95
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.040
div like, let's say the welcome paragraph.

96
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.200
I want that font size to be bigger.

97
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.670
What I could do is I could use a nested selector.

98
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.440
By saying I'd welcome and then space paragraph.

99
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.820
You don't want to do a comma.

100
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:42.330
What that means is, is it means all the divs or all the elements with the idea of welcome in all paragraphs.

101
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:49.230
You don't want that comma because we want to say inside the the element of welcome, we want the paragraph

102
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:57.300
inside of it and then let's say font size, it'll do 20 pixels.

103
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.920
By the way, 16 is the default, but I'll talk about pixels and all that and a little bit.

104
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:09.600
So if I save that, notice that only the welcome div paragraph has the font size of 20.

105
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.260
All right, so let's see what else.

106
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.060
We can also style the body.

107
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.340
So if we go up here.

108
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.060
Say body styling.

109
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.590
So we'll take body.

110
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:32.350
And body is usually where you put if you want the whole website or the whole web page to have a background

111
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.940
color, you could do that.

112
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.620
I'm going to give it a hexadecimal of three, three, three, which is a dark gray.

113
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.820
So if I save that, you'll see it changes the whole body.

114
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:49.850
Now, the reason we can't read this right here is because by default, the text is black.

115
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.350
So what I'll do is I'll go to.

116
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:03.770
I'll just target the about the div with a bow and I'll change the color, which is the text color to

117
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.550
white.

118
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.420
So that we can see it.

119
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.510
And I know this is pretty ugly looking, but I just want you to know the different types of ways to

120
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.960
basically select and style different elements.

121
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.250
So instead of body styling, I'm just going to say element.

122
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.990
Selector.

123
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.370
Because we're grabbing the actual element or the actual tag.

124
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.820
When I say element, I just mean tag that the body itself is the element.

125
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.200
Div is the element.

126
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.270
H two is the element with the angle.

127
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.590
Brackets is a tag.

128
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.900
So I use them interchangeably.

129
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.140
All right, so we have element or selectors.

130
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.620
Let's just make this consistent here.

131
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.340
Element selectors.

132
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.360
DOT is for classes, numbers for IDs.

133
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.980
We have multiple selectors.

134
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:07.640
By using a comma, we have nested selectors so we can select stuff inside of other elements and those.

135
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.110
That's pretty much the basics.

136
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.730
I mean we have other things like pseudo selectors and and stuff like that, but I'm not going to get

137
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.540
into that now.

138
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:20.660
I just want you to understand the fundamentals of selecting elements and being able to style them.

139
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.380
All right.

140
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.580
So that's it, guys.

141
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.200
I will see you in the next video.
