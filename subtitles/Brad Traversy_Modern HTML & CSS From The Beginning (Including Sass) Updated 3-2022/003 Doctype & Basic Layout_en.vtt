00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.930
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.310
So in the last video, we created an index HTML file.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
We opened it inside of a browser so we could see how it renders.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.130
And this is not the standard of how to create a document.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.990
There are some other things that you need to add.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.430
Even if we only wanted to display this in the browser, there's some other tags that we need to add

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.040
for it to be a valid HTML five document.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.010
Now, before we do anything, I'm going to rename this file.

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:36.390
So instead of index, I'm going to rename it to zero one underscore basic underscore layout dot HTML.

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.540
Because like I said, I want this to be a sandbox so you can go back to and you can check certain things

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
and I want each file to be named after what, what we're doing inside of it.

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.240
So we're going to just number them so they're in order.

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.340
If you don't want to number of them, you don't have to.

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.790
You could call it just basic layout or basic or whatever.

15
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.140
But I want to be very specific and I want to I want you guys to have this for future reference.

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.920
All right.

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
So basic layout of an HTML page, let's actually just get rid of this for now.

18
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
So the first thing that you're going to want on every HTML page is the dock type.

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.750
So I'm just going to type this out.

20
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.050
It's going to be an angle bracket, exclamation dock type, usually all capitals and then HTML and then

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.880
closing angle bracket.

22
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.260
So this is a dock type.

23
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.930
And what this does is it tells the browser what type of document it is because a browser can read HTML

24
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.570
five, it can read HTML, it can read HTML 4.0.1.

25
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.320
So there's a lot of different variations of HTML, but HTML five is definitely the standard and that's

26
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.760
what you're going to want to use.

27
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.330
It's also it's also much easier than the others and it's less strict when it comes to tag syntax.

28
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.170
So I just want to quickly show you from the W three Schools site, which is a great site for reference.

29
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.350
This is a page all on dock types.

30
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.930
And if we go down here, you'll see that the dock type declaration must be the very first thing in your

31
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.930
HTML document before the HTML tag, which I'll go over in a second and down here it gives us the different

32
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.530
types.

33
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.710
So for HTML five, it's what we what we just did.

34
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:22.170
But then you'll see that HTML 4.0.1 actually has a much longer dock type because there's different variations,

35
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.650
there's strict transitional frame set.

36
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.620
And this has to do with what's allowed and what's not.

37
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.000
So it's gotten much easier over the years with HTML five, so we don't have to worry about these dock

38
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.340
types.

39
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.480
But I just wanted to show you that there are very different HTML has its own dock type, has transitional

40
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.300
frame set 1.0, 1.1.

41
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.940
But this is the only one that we have to worry about.

42
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.480
All right.

43
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.400
So I just wanted to kind of show you that.

44
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.520
So we're declaring this document as HTML five.

45
00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.930
The next thing we want is an HTML tag, so I'll do HTML and then hit enter or tab and it'll finish it

46
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.560
for me.

47
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.480
And we just want to hit enter so that the bottom tag is down below.

48
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.670
And now inside the HTML tag, we have a head tag and then under the head we have a body tag.

49
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.410
Now notice that there's an indent here and v code will do this automatically.

50
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.270
If you're using something like notepad, which I would definitely not suggest, it's not going to indent

51
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.060
it for you automatically, so you have to do it yourself.

52
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.810
Now the reason it's indented is because both of these tags are inside the HTML tag.

53
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.320
This is actually the parent of these two tags and these are the children of the HTML tag.

54
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.430
Now the head and body are very different.

55
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.880
Head is for things like meta tags.

56
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.280
If you want to associate keywords with your page, it's basically just information about your page.

57
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.870
It doesn't actually display in the browser in the body of the browser.

58
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.090
Now one thing that you should definitely put in the head tag is the title.

59
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.330
So we want to put a title tag and again, we're tabbing it over because it's within the the head tag

60
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.140
for the title.

61
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.060
I'm just going to say my website.

62
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.230
All right.

63
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.589
Now, if I go ahead and save this, I'm going to do a control SX, I'm going to save the file and let's

64
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:20.550
open it up.

65
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.770
So we have our basic layout HTML because we renamed it and I'm going to say open with chrome.

66
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.790
And notice there's nothing in the body.

67
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.310
But if we look in the tab, we see my website, whatever you put in, the title tag is going to show

68
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.300
right here.

69
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.910
So it's very important for you to have a title.

70
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.860
Now, whatever we want in the body, we put in the body so we can put back our h one, say my website

71
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.710
and we can put our paragraph.

72
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.260
And we'll go ahead and save and we'll go back and reload.

73
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.860
And now we have our h one and paragraph in the body.

74
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.710
So anything that you want to show in this area is going to go in the body of your your document.

75
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.060
All right.

76
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.250
So you just want to keep this structure in mind.

77
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.080
This is the core, fundamental mandatory structure of an HTML document.

78
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.700
You have your dock type at the top, you have your HTML tags that wrap around everything.

79
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.610
And then you have a head and body area in your head.

80
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.110
You should at least have the title.

81
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.610
And in the body you just have whatever you your website content will be.

82
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.100
So the last thing I want to show you is how to create a comment.

83
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.330
So you might want to label stuff without it actually rendering in the browser.

84
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.150
So let's say I wanted to put a comment right here.

85
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.810
What I would do is put an angle bracket, an exclamation mark, and then double hyphen.

86
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.420
Once I do that in vs code, it actually auto completes the rest of it.

87
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.500
But this is the format of a comment, so I'll just say this is a comment.

88
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.090
So starts off like this and then it ends with double hyphen and an angle bracket.

89
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.230
So just make sure you don't forget the exclamation because that's not a valid comment.

90
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.240
And notice that it turns green in vs code to let you know that it's it's actually a comment.

91
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.500
And if I save this and we go to the browser and reload notice it doesn't show here because it's a comment.

92
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:20.370
Now in browsers you can view the source code, you can view the HTML source on a mac, you can do command

93
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.210
option u and on windows I believe it's control you and it'll open up a new tab that shows you the actual

94
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.080
HTML so you can see our dock type, our HTML tags, all that stuff.

95
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.940
It also will show the comments in the source code just to let you know that.

96
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.580
So let's go back and I want to show you how you can comment out something that's already there.

97
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:49.110
So if I just put my my cursor on this line right here in V's code, I can actually just do control and

98
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.420
then forward slash or question mark, the same key, the forward slash question mark.

99
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.160
So if I hold control and hit that, it'll comment the whole line out and I can toggle it if I hit it

100
00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.640
again.

101
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.380
Control forward slash.

102
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.330
I can just toggle the comment.

103
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.270
If I wanted to comment out multiple lines, I could highlight them and again control forward slash and

104
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.070
that will comment out the whole thing.

105
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.280
There may be times when you want to just kind of not show a certain part of the HTML in the browser

106
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.080
and you want to comment it out and you can put this on a separate line as well like that.

107
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.920
That will still work.

108
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.510
This is all commented out.

109
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.590
All right.

110
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.710
So that's going to be it for this video, guys, in the next one.

111
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.580
I want to give you some tips and tricks with VS Code.

112
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:38.280
For instance, we can generate the basic structure automatically without having to type all this out

113
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.780
with every HTML page.

114
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.090
I also want to give you a couple of extensions that I want to recommend and that I'll be using in this

115
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.600
course.

116
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.960
All right.

117
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.460
So I'll see you in the next video.
