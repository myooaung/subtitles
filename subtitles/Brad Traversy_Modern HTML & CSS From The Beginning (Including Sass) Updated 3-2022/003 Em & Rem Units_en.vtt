00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.390
All right.

2
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.570
So in this video, we're going to get into M units and REM units.

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.490
Up to this point, we've pretty much been using pixels for everything, which is a fixed unit.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.000
So M and Rima are similar, but they're multipliers of different things.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.190
So an M unit is a multiplier or relative to the font size of its parent container or its parent element

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.700
where a REM unit is, it's relative to the font size of the root HTML element.

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.260
So if we look at an HTML file, this right here, this HTML tag, it's default punts, punt, it's default

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.300
font size is 16 pixels.

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.660
But of course, you can change that within your CSS.

10
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.420
So I know it's it's kind of tough to explain.

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.670
So let's jump in and let's create a file called 14 underscore, underscore REM dot HTML, and we'll

12
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:05.069
put our head body tags in here and let's say M and REM units.

13
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:17.310
And then for the HTML, I'm just going to have a box one div and let's do an H three, let's do a paragraph,

14
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.470
we'll do 20 and then I'm just going to copy the whole div here.

15
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.440
Okay.

16
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.210
So this one and we'll do box to box to.

17
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.820
All right.

18
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.160
So let's save this and let's open up live server and let's open up our dev tools as well here.

19
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.520
And we're going to be in the Elements tab and I'm just going to go ahead and select the select the paragraph.

20
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.010
Now, by default, the font size as well as the margin here, it's going to be set to one M so whatever

21
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.430
the number of pixels of the font size of its parent element and by default, obviously its parent,

22
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.900
its direct parent is the box one, which we haven't set a specific font size.

23
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.070
So it's going to keep going up until it finds a font size, which it's going to reach the the HTML,

24
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.800
the root element, this is the absolute root element and by default, that's 16 pixels.

25
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.550
So if we go to computed, you're going to see that the the margin is 16 pixels, the font size is also

26
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.810
16 pixels.

27
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.640
Now headings are a bit different.

28
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.110
If we take a look at that, let's grab the selector and click on the heading.

29
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.880
You can see the font size is actually the computed font size is 18.72 because if we look at the actual

30
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.220
CSS from the browser, the font size is 1.17 M.

31
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:57.240
So the reason for that is 16 pixels or 16 times 1.17 is actually equal to 18.72.

32
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.980
So that's where this comes from.

33
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.240
Okay.

34
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.200
Now if I were to manually change the font size of of the direct parent, which is box one.

35
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.510
So let's say font size, we'll change it to 20 pixels rather than 16.

36
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.020
And watch what happens to this font size of the H three I'm going to save and it gets it gets turned

37
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.260
to 23.4 because 20 times 1.7.

38
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.950
That's what the the m that's what this is set to one point I'm sorry, 1.17 is going to be 23.4.

39
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.060
And if we look at the paragraph now, the font size is 20 pixels.

40
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.560
So is the margin.

41
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.890
You can see right here the margin on the start and the end also 20 pixels because it's it's set to one

42
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.160
m OC, as you can see right here.

43
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.050
So it's going to be whatever this is.

44
00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:01.700
Now, let's say we wanted to change the font size of the paragraph, so we'll say box one, let's see,

45
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:18.140
we'll do box one paragraph and let's set font size to let's do 1.5 rem, I'm sorry M and save and you

46
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.670
can see it gets much bigger and down here this is our styling font size 1.5.

47
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.940
Mm.

48
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.010
So let's look at the computed value.

49
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.330
The computed value is 30 pixels excuse me.

50
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.430
And the reason for that is because 120, which is its parent element, times 1.5 is equal to 30.

51
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.800
That's where we get 30 pixels from.

52
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.230
And it's also automatically going to add that margin to the top and the bottom of 30.

53
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.880
Now, one thing that's confusing about M units is if I do padding, right?

54
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.860
So let's say padding one M what what?

55
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.480
Just take a second and think of what what this is going to be.

56
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.160
Remember, one m is a multiplier of its parent.

57
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.220
So you might think that it's going to equal 20, right?

58
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.530
Because 20 times one is 20.

59
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.380
So let's save it and let's see what we get.

60
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.270
So for padding, which is right here, we actually get 30.

61
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.380
The reason for that is since we added a font size to the actual element itself, the paragraph, it's

62
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.880
going to go on that now.

63
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.610
So the padding is going to be since this is 30 pixels, it's 1.5 times 20 and then we set this to one

64
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.040
M, then it's going to be 30.

65
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.840
And that's very confusing.

66
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:52.160
So that's that's one reason that a lot of people don't use EMS and one reason I don't use EMS.

67
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.340
So another reason is for nested elements.

68
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.920
So let's go ahead and add down here.

69
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:04.820
UL And I'm just going to put in a couple list items we can use the money sign, which will just start

70
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.340
at one and go in increment by one.

71
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.630
We'll say times for tab and then we get these for list items.

72
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.690
Now this one here, I'm going to add another UL and let's do the same thing.

73
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.590
We'll say times three and we'll save and we have these list items here.

74
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.430
So let's say we want to change the font size of a UL that's in box one.

75
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.900
So box one UL and let's say we want the font size

76
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.930
to be 1.2 M and let's go ahead and save that.

77
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.740
So if you look at this UL, the nested list right here is bigger, right?

78
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.470
And we can check that out by using the selector.

79
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.820
Let's look at these ones here.

80
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.680
So we get 24 pixels.

81
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.360
But if we look at these ones here, we get 28.8.

82
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.880
So it's not consistent.

83
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:15.650
And the reason for that is these inner elements here are actually now going on the nested I'm sorry,

84
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.790
their parent element and we have a nested UL here.

85
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:30.350
So this is going on this and if we were to put another UL like let's go ahead and grab this and put

86
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.070
this right here and paste that in.

87
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.850
We'll nest it again.

88
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.320
It's going to get even bigger.

89
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.010
So that's that's another issue with using EMS.

90
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.290
So my suggestion would be just to drop EMS all together and use REMS, because they're always going

91
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.420
to be based on the root element.

92
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.080
All right.

93
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.580
So let's start to get into that.

94
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.580
So I'm actually going to comment out the whole div here, the whole box one div.

95
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.160
And let's see, we'll comment this stuff out to.

96
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.180
So we'll just kind of start from scratch and now we'll look at REM units.

97
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.240
Now, I'm not going to set a font size to the parent element itself, box two, because we're very rarely

98
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.380
going to do that.

99
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.920
We're going to be using REM units, so we're going to go on the root element always.

100
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.770
So let's grab the let's grab the H three.

101
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:35.750
So box dash two, H three, and let's set the font size to let's say two REM and we'll save that.

102
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.240
And let's take a look at what that is.

103
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.710
So if we go and hit that and we look at our computed styles, you'll see that it's going to be 32.

104
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.550
Like I said, the HTML or the root element font size is always going to be 16 pixels unless we manually

105
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.420
change it.

106
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.550
So you can see it's 32.

107
00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:13.070
If we set, let's say box to paragraph and set font size to let's do 1.6 REM and we save that and we

108
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.020
take a look at the computed size.

109
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:23.780
It's 25.6 pixels because 16 times 1.6 is going to be 25.6.

110
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.650
Now let's add let's actually add a line height here.

111
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:36.410
So the height of the line and I'm going to do 1.7 REM.

112
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:42.890
Now remember when we used M units, if we had set a line height here, it would actually it would actually

113
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.900
be based on this.

114
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.530
Right.

115
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.630
But since we're using REMS, it's always going to be based on the root HTML element.

116
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.470
So let's save it.

117
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:58.790
Let's take a look at the line height and it's 27.2, which is 16, the root element's font size times

118
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.870
1.7.

119
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.760
So much less confusing.

120
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:08.750
If we wanted to change the root element font size, we could do that.

121
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:19.190
So let's go right here and just simply do HTML and let's say font size ten pixels and we'll save and

122
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.260
notice that everything got smaller.

123
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:29.480
So if we check out the font size of the heading here, it's 20 pixels because the heading is set to

124
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.410
two REM, right?

125
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.020
So it's going to be two times ten, which is 20.

126
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.630
The paragraph, try to take a guess at what that's going to be.

127
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.680
Let's check it out.

128
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.350
And it's 16 pixels because ten times 1.6 is 16.

129
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.670
And if we look at the line height, it's 17 because we set it to 1.7.

130
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:55.550
And this is actually a common thing that some people do because when you deal with 16 pixels as the

131
00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:01.040
root element, it's harder to figure out what the exact size is going to be.

132
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.160
If you set it to ten, then you're going to know that two is 20, 1.6 is 16.

133
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.100
This is 17, 2.8 is 28.

134
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:17.700
You know, if we if we set the the font size here to 2.3, it's going to be 23 pixels, right?

135
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.800
If we take a look at it.

136
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.840
So let's grab the heading.

137
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.400
It's 23 pixels.

138
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.840
So a lot of people will do that.

139
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:32.240
And to make it even more responsive, we could just set the font size to a percentage to 62.5%, which

140
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.160
is actually going to be ten pixels.

141
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.410
If I save that, it's the same thing.

142
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:44.720
23 And if we look at the font size of the text here, it's going to be 16 because we set it to 1.6.

143
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.170
REM.

144
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.400
And just to show you, if I set it to one REM, it's going to be ten.

145
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.060
So you might see this as well.

146
00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:00.110
I tend to leave the HTML at 16 pixels and just and just kind of eyeball things rather than being so

147
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.890
exact.

148
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:07.250
If you are taking an actual design from like, I don't know, Photoshop or something and it need the

149
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.880
pixels need to be exact, then you might want to do it this way.

150
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:18.620
You might want to set it to 62.5 so that you know exactly how many pixels you're adding to padding and

151
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.400
all of that.

152
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.780
For me, I do a lot of my my designs just just by eyeballing it, just by doing the HTML, CSS, not

153
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.360
actually copying an exact design.

154
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.150
So I'll usually leave the sorry, the, the root element at 16.

155
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:42.560
Now another huge reason to use REM units is, is for accessibility and browser settings.

156
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.740
Now if I go to my Chrome settings.

157
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.740
And go down to where it says font size, you'll see it's set to medium.

158
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.480
That's the default, that's the recommended.

159
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.440
But if I set it to very large and I use REM units, notice my it's gotten bigger in fact down here you'll

160
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:07.840
see the paragraph is now 24 instead of 16 because we've, we've, we've manually set that in the browser

161
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.950
settings if we use M units that it has no effect.

162
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.220
In fact, I'll go ahead and take this off.

163
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:23.960
And take this comment off and we'll save it and it has no effect.

164
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.730
So if I it's I mean, it's set larger because of what we did up here.

165
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.760
But watch if I set it to very small.

166
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.450
Notice that all the stuff we do with the M units is still huge.

167
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.440
While if we go down to where we used REMS, it's very small.

168
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.130
So it's not going to have an effect if your parent elements have font sizes.

169
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.320
Now, if we didn't have a parent element font size, it would go by the HTML.

170
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:56.800
Even if we used M's and then it would work because that's what this is doing.

171
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.080
This is changing the the parent.

172
00:13:59.410 --> 00:13:59.860
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.700
The root element's font size.

174
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.340
If we didn't have this here, let's get rid of that and save.

175
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.950
Now, you'll see that this is very small because it's going by the root element by default.

176
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:17.530
But when you use M's, you're adding you're adding font size to the parent element.

177
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.710
And that's what it goes on regardless of of the settings in the browser.

178
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.980
So just another reason that REM units make things more adaptive and more responsive.

179
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:32.520
So let's set this back to medium and I'm going to comment this stuff back out.

180
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:39.820
So I know that that this may be confusing, but it is a good idea to use REM units.

181
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.410
If you want to use M units, you can.

182
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.450
But that's I mean, everybody has their own style, their own way of doing things.

183
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:52.900
I don't really use M units except for maybe some special situations, but, you know, using REM, it

184
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.310
makes it more accessible.

185
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.500
If someone want if older people that can't see very well, they want to change the settings, it'll

186
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.640
actually work.

187
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.530
You know, it makes things more responsive, more adaptive.

188
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.490
So it is it is recommended.

189
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.160
But you could also stick with pixels.

190
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.730
It's all up to you guys, whatever is easier for you.

191
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.610
But we will be using REM units quite a bit throughout the rest of the course.

192
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.390
All right.

193
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.850
So in the next video, I want to take a look at another CSS unit, which is the viewport height and

194
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:30.790
the viewport width unit, which are really used for something completely different, use more for like

195
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.770
boxes and backgrounds and stuff like that rather than like font sizes.

196
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.180
All right.

197
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.220
So I'll I'll see you in the next video.
