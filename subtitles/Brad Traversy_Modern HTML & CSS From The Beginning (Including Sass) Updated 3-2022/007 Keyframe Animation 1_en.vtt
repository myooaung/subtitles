00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.830
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.590
Now we're going to start to talk about animation in CSS.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.070
And there's a few ways to do animations.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.410
You have keyframes which are going to be looking at now.

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.000
We also have transitions.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.630
Basically, when you animate something in CSS, what it means is you're taking a property that can be

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.390
animated, such as a width, a position, a color, opacity, something like that, where you have basically

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.740
you have midpoints.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.240
So let's take a width.

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
For example, you have zero pixels and let's say you go to 600 pixels.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.090
Well there's, there's all the pixels in between.

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.460
So you can go from 0 to 600 pixels.

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.000
You can animate that so you can make something grow or shrink.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.030
You also have positions so you can move things around.

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.030
You have opacity so you can fade things in, fade things out, stuff like that.

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.610
So let's get started with keyframes.

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.140
So I'm going to create a new file here.

18
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.280
I'm going to call it zero seven, underscore keyframes dot HTML.

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.720
And let's put in our stuff here.

20
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.160
Sure.

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.310
You guys are sick of hearing me say that and do this, but I just want to set everything up from scratch.

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.820
All right.

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.230
So keyframes.

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.150
Now, as far as the HTML, we're going to have a single div with the class of box.

25
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.870
That's it.

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.420
We're going to create this this div.

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.300
Basically, it's going to be a square and we're going to animate it.

28
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.000
So in the style, let's let's start off by doing body.

29
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.400
I'm going to give it a dark background.

30
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.670
All right.

31
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.990
And let's open this up.

32
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.630
So we have a dark background.

33
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.160
And then for the box, let's make this a white box by default.

34
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.070
So back ground, we'll make this white.

35
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.750
Actually, you know what?

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.890
Let's use let's use words because we're going to be animating the colors.

37
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.550
So background white, obviously nothing is going to show up because it's empty.

38
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.780
There's no content in it.

39
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.750
So that means we have to add a width and height.

40
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.370
So we'll say width, 200 picks and height, 200 picks and save.

41
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.860
And now we have a white box.

42
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.320
It's 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.

43
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:33.240
Now what I want to do is let's let's animate the width, first of all.

44
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.020
So when it comes to animation, we have a bunch of different properties and then we also can combine

45
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.700
them much like we can with many other properties like border background, stuff like that.

46
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.530
But let's look at each one one by one.

47
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.720
So first I'm going to do animation dash name and I'm going to call this animate.

48
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.820
Let's do animate one and let's do animate

49
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.120
duration.

50
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.580
So this is the time that it should take to animate.

51
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.320
I'm going to say 2 seconds.

52
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.160
All right.

53
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.210
Now, why is this giving me an error here?

54
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.230
It's probably because we didn't create animate one.

55
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.780
Um.

56
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.500
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.090
Animation duration.

58
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.550
Now, this animate one right here.

59
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.920
This.

60
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.220
We have to create a keyframe called animate one.

61
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.900
So we're going to go down below and we're going to say at keyframes and then animate one and you can

62
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.830
call it whatever you want.

63
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.910
I just chose animate one, so we can basically specify points in the animation.

64
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.840
Now, I'm going to do this the simplest way first, first just to show you and that's from and two.

65
00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.880
So we'll say from so from we could say like so let's extend the width.

66
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:17.160
So we could say from width, 200 picks and then two we'll set with to let's say 600 picks and let's

67
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.910
save.

68
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.420
And there we go.

69
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.829
So you can see that we get that little animation.

70
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:29.720
Now, since it's 200 pics to begin with, we don't even need the from like we could simply say two with

71
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.470
600 picks.

72
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.930
And if I save, it's still, it still works.

73
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.410
Now there's some other things that we can add here.

74
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.150
And by the way, if you want to change the duration, like to 5 seconds now, it's going to take 5 seconds

75
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.110
for that to happen, for it to extend to 600 pixels.

76
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.690
But going to change it back to two and notice how it only goes once.

77
00:04:51.230 --> 00:05:00.860
What we could do is add in animation, dash, iteration count, and right now it's set to one.

78
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.130
But let's set it to two and let's save and see what happens.

79
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.410
So we get one, two.

80
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.710
And then stops.

81
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.170
Now, if you want it to keep going, you can use infinite.

82
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.330
So I'll save.

83
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.860
And it'll just keep going.

84
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.660
Now I'm going to set this back to one.

85
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.900
Which is the default.

86
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.390
And I'm going to add another property here called animation dash fill dash mode.

87
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.420
So right now, notice that once it's done animating, once it's done stretching out, it goes back to

88
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.550
the to its default of 200 pixels.

89
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.090
Right?

90
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.900
So what if we want to keep it at that stretched out 600 pixels, we can change this to forwards.

91
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.450
So if we save this now, it's going to animate and it's going to stay where it's at.

92
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.920
All right.

93
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.150
Let's see.

94
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.990
We also have just to show you some more properties.

95
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.530
We have animation delay, which I'll set to 2 seconds.

96
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.240
So now once I save, it's going to wait 2 seconds and then it's going to start.

97
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.360
So it's going to delay the start of the animation.

98
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:23.880
We also have animation dash direction and let's set that to alternate.

99
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.970
So if we save that.

100
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.130
Actually, no.

101
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.050
Let's do alternate dash.

102
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.370
What is it?

103
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.800
Alternate reverse.

104
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.690
So then it's going to go reverse.

105
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.100
So you can do that as well.

106
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.250
But I'm going to keep it at alternate.

107
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.740
And then the last one I'm going to show you is the timing function.

108
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.920
So animation, dash timing, dash function.

109
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:03.620
And this is basically like the, the motion and you could do like ease, ease in which is going to kind

110
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:13.370
of start off, start off fast and then like ease in or ease out, which will start off slow and then

111
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.180
go faster.

112
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.620
So let's look at ease in and there's not too much of a difference, at least in my opinion.

113
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.470
Let's make the let's make the duration a little longer.

114
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.290
We'll say 5 seconds and let's watch the motion here.

115
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.160
It's going to delay.

116
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.910
So it starts off slow and then it starts to go faster.

117
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.780
Right.

118
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.320
Let's let's actually comment out the delay, but let's do ease out and see the difference.

119
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.370
So save and see how it starts fast and then it slows down.

120
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.760
And then you can also do ease in.

121
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.370
Oh.

122
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.240
Is in.

123
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.940
Oh, which will start off slow and slow.

124
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.840
So it's the ease is out and then it eases in.

125
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.060
All right.

126
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.030
So these are the different timing functions that you can use.

127
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.880
Now.

128
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.850
Obviously width isn't the only thing we can animate.

129
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.900
Let's do color.

130
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.850
So let's say we want the color or I'm sorry, the background color.

131
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.170
The color would be the text.

132
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:23.400
So we want background color and let's set that to red and we'll go ahead and save.

133
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.170
Now, not only is it going to extend to 600 pixels, but it's going to turn to red.

134
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:33.510
It's going to go through all the the whole color system, and it's going to go from white to red.

135
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.010
Let's see.

136
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.870
Another thing we could do is its position.

137
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.820
So let's actually.

138
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:47.150
Let's give this a position of relative, because remember, when we add position relative, we can use

139
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.910
parameters like top, bottom, left, right.

140
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.760
So what I'll do is say from.

141
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.830
Top zero.

142
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.930
So basically it's default position.

143
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:08.770
And then too, we're going to end up at, let's say from the top, we want to go down 300 pixels.

144
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.570
So let's save.

145
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:19.200
And now you can see that it's animating the width, the color and also the position, moving it from

146
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.180
from zero, from the top down to 300 pixels from the top.

147
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:29.970
Now, like I said, there's a shortcut for this, so you don't have to have all of these different properties.

148
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.430
We can simply use the animation property.

149
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.710
So I'm going to uncomment the delay and I'm going to comment all of these out and I'm going to show

150
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.890
you how we can do this with just one line or just one property.

151
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.750
So we're going to say animation.

152
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.710
First parameter here is going to be the name of the animation.

153
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:53.430
So animate 1/2 is going to be the speed or the the the duration.

154
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.550
So we'll say 5 seconds next is going to be the film mode.

155
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.800
So I want it to stop at the end.

156
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.300
So we'll do forwards.

157
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.000
If we wanted a delay, we could do that.

158
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.410
We'll do a 1/2 delay and then we can do the timing function.

159
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.870
So I'll do ease in out.

160
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.300
So let's save that.

161
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.020
Waits a second and then it does the same thing.

162
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.130
Okay.

163
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.540
So this is just a shorter way to do all this stuff.

164
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.580
So that's it.

165
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.820
In the next video, we're going to we're going to still look at key frames.

166
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.590
But I want to show you how we can add different points we don't have to do just from and to.
