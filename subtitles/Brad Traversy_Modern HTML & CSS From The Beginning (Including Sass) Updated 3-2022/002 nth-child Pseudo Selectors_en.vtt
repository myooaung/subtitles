00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.660
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.820
So in this video, we're going to look at a pseudo selector or a pseudo class called Nth Child.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:14.160
So I'm going to go ahead in our CSS sandbox to and create a new file called Zero to underscore and underscore

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.440
child dot HTML.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.520
And I'm going to change this this targeted selectors, I'm just going to do zero one just to stay consistent

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.000
here.

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.910
All right.

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.900
So in the Nth Child file, let's go ahead and generate our head and body tags.

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.660
We'll say end child and we want our style tags.

10
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:50.440
Now, as far as the HTML, what I'm going to do is just have a UL and I want about 20 list items.

11
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.560
So I'm going to say ly, I'm going to use emit here and the content will be item and then an incremental

12
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.060
number and I'm going to say times 20 and then hit enter.

13
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.640
So we'll go ahead and open this up.

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.860
We'll save it open with live server.

15
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.400
I'm going to add some base styling for the list item.

16
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.530
So I just want to add some padding.

17
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:23.170
We'll say 0.25 REM and margin oops, not margin 0.25 REM.

18
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.620
And let's just take away the bullet items with list style.

19
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.220
None.

20
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.510
All right.

21
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.340
Now, we've seen the first child in last child.

22
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.940
So I'm just going to refresh your memory.

23
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.940
If you forget what these do, basically, we can select the first and last element, and it doesn't

24
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.960
have to be a list item.

25
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.220
I'm just using list items.

26
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.820
It could be divs, it could be whatever, any element at all.

27
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.670
But we're going to say Ally and then the pseudo selector syntax is a colon.

28
00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:04.870
So we want to say first child and let's say background, let's just do background red.

29
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.550
I'll just use color names here.

30
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.199
So that selects the first one.

31
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:15.370
And if we want the last one, copy that and we'll just do Last Child and save.

32
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.690
And now the last one is red.

33
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.670
But what about all of these?

34
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.640
You know what, if we want to choose the fourth one or every every second one, every even one, every

35
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.460
odd one for that we can use Nth Child.

36
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.880
And Nth is basically like a kind of like a placeholder.

37
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.500
So let's get, let's say position three.

38
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.470
So to do that we can say list item and we're going to say Nth Dash Child and we're just going to pass

39
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.500
in three K and then I'm going to say background and let's do a different color.

40
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.660
We'll do purple and save and notice that the third one down is is purple.

41
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.670
So what if we wanted to do every three, not just the third one, but every third one?

42
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.730
We want to do so in that case, let's say every three.

43
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:23.970
So we could say ninth child and we can say three and plus zero.

44
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.340
This is basically the formula that that we're going to use here and let's say background and we'll do

45
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.850
orange if I save that.

46
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.560
Notice that every third one is orange and it replaced the the this one here position three because it's

47
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.960
further down so it just kind of overrode it.

48
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.940
If I put important here and save, then that's going to overwrite that.

49
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.320
Now this formula that we passed in here is the counter.

50
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.330
So this is the counter and then zero.

51
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.280
This is the offset because we can offset, we can start it wherever we want.

52
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.590
In this case, we're starting in at zero and as a shortcut we can just do three N So if I save that,

53
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.270
we're going to get the same result.

54
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.380
Now let's say that I want to do every three, but I want it to start after the seventh item here.

55
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.510
So let's put a comment in here.

56
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.100
We'll say every three after seven.

57
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.650
So to do that we can put in Nth Child and then pass in three N and we want to do plus seven, which

58
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.910
is our offset.

59
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:40.900
And then I'll do background yellow and we'll save that and notice that the yellow starts here.

60
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.450
So this seven, this is the offset.

61
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.040
We're basically going to just we're not going to start it until we hit that seventh item and then we're

62
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.900
going to do every three.

63
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.430
Now, a more common thing you're probably going to do is even in odd.

64
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.740
So let's say every odd.

65
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.310
So we could do ly nth child and we could pass in.

66
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.550
Odd.

67
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.610
And let's do background.

68
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.800
I'll do a light gray and save.

69
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.050
And now every odd item here is going to be light grey.

70
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.930
Now, it's probably it probably it's probably pretty obvious that we can do even as well.

71
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.860
So let's do that.

72
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:39.190
Let's do even and we'll change this to let's do a shade darker or a shade lighter actually and save.

73
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:47.560
And now every even is the like this this did light grey all right so end child can be pretty handy I

74
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.210
remember before in the child was actually a thing we had to use JavaScript to dynamically select every

75
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.580
other element and it was, it was just a pain in the neck.

76
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:06.280
Guys, if you're learning HTML and CSS now, you've missed a lot of just giant pains in the -- because

77
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.450
things weren't I mean, you know, these selectors weren't around even like border radius wasn't around

78
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.200
to do things like even placeholders in our forms and our input forms.

79
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.500
We didn't have the placeholder attribute before HTML five.

80
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.840
So we would have to use JavaScript to put to have a value in, but then add a click event.

81
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.730
So when we clicked in, the value went away, which was just a giant pain in the neck.

82
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:39.280
So you guys are lucky, those of you that are learning this now that you don't have to go through that

83
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.280
stuff and then browser compatibility is a whole new issue.

84
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.120
All right.

85
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.210
So that's that's the basis of end child.

86
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.340
In the next video, we're going to look at the before and after pseudo selector and look at some practical

87
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.750
uses for the for that.
