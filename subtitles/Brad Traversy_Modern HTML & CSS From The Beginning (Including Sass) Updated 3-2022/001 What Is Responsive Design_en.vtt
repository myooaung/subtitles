00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.140
So up to this point, we've looked at most of HTML five and the basics of CSS.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.100
We created a little hotel website and it does use some elements of responsive design, but it still

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.450
isn't responsive because we have yet to add media queries where they're needed.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.710
If you go in and you take the hotel website and you make your browser really small, it's going to look

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.950
like crap, but we're going to fix that by the end of this section.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
So I just want to quickly go over what responsiveness is and how we can achieve it.

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.280
Then we'll jump in.

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.900
We'll look at media queries and some other stuff, such as relative CSS units.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.160
So responsive design is when we use HTML and CSS to make a website or an application layout respond

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.930
to different screen sizes.

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.600
And a few years ago, making a website or a layout responsive was kind of a luxury.

13
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.720
I can actually remember asking clients if they wanted to pay extra to make their website responsive.

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.150
But now it's really a necessity.

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.130
It's not an add on or a luxury.

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.190
And the reason for that is the huge increase of of the use of smartphones and tablets and other devices.

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.350
A lot of people now don't even have computers.

18
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.380
They're fine with either a tablet or even their smartphone.

19
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.160
So let's look at some of the different ways to achieve responsive design.

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.150
So the viewport tag is important because it tells the browser how to handle the pages and dimensions

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.140
and scaling.

22
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.310
We've already set this in our pages and it's actually default with EMIT with our boilerplate generation

23
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.600
in VS code.

24
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.210
Using fluid widths is also something we've done.

25
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.900
Remember our containers we use Macs with and instead of just width, it allows the text to adapt to

26
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.490
smaller screen sizes.

27
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.580
Now the most significant part of responsive web design and probably the most difficult are media queries

28
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.780
not setting them, but learning how to use them and when to use them.

29
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.330
And media queries allow us to specify certain CSS styles based on the screen size.

30
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.440
So for example, if we wanted to float some elements, if the screen was bigger than 600 pixels, we

31
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.390
could write a media query for that.

32
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.440
If we wanted a font size to be smaller on just mobile devices that were 500 pixels or less, we could

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.490
do that as well.

34
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.090
All right.

35
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.800
So we're going to we're going to do that.

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.360
And we're also going to update our hotel project to use media queries.

37
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.690
Another good idea is to use REM units over pixels.

38
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.840
It keeps sizes intact with the rest of the page because the REM unit is a multiplier of whatever the

39
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.450
root HTML elements font size is.

40
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.630
And we're going to we're going to go over that in this section.

41
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.810
We're also going to talk about V, H and v, w units.

42
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.170
So we also have a design method or strategy called Mobile First, which is pretty popular these days.

43
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.350
This is where you first designed the layout for mobile devices, meaning small screens, and then you

44
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.800
add your media queries for the larger screen styles and you might even display less content on mobile

45
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.870
devices you know your most important content and then have more and larger devices when you have more

46
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.800
real estate.

47
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.490
And we're actually going to do a mobile first project later on.

48
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.760
All right.

49
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.530
So in the next video, I want to start to look at media queries and their syntax.

50
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.190
Then we'll talk a little bit about relative units like RAM and M.

51
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.750
And finally, we'll update our hotel project to be responsive.
