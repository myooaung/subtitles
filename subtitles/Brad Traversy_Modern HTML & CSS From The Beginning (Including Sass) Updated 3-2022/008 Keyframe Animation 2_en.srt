1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,330
So in the last video, we looked at key frames and we looked at how we could animate different properties

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,810
such as the position, the width, the colour, but we just did a two in a frame, so basically a starting

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,130
point and an ending point.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,820
But with key frames you can actually have more than just those points.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,290
You can you can use percentages.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,210
So that's what I want to go over in this video.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:29,280
So I'm going to create a new file here called zero eight, underscore keyframes, let's say keyframes

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,870
to XHTML.

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:41,760
And I'm just going to close the sidebar up here and let's say Keyframes two and we'll put in our style

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,630
tags.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,970
And I'm just going to have again, just an ID of or let's do that.

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,220
I do an ID or a class in the last one.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,190
I just want to be a little consistent here.

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,630
So we have a class of box.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,200
Let's do that.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,180
Same thing.

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,900
So box.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,120
And in the style, let's add box.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,240
We'll make the background dark like we did in the last one.

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,390
So body background, three, three, three.

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:29,440
So the box will give it a background color of white and let's set the width to 200 pixels and the height

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,510
to 200 pixels.

23
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,800
I should probably spell background correctly and we're also going to position this relative because

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,550
we're going to be dealing with positional properties.

25
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:50,710
So let's say position relative and let's save this and open this up with live server.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,510
So we have our box.

27
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:58,210
Now I'm going to add an animation here with a keyframe and I'm just going to add I'm just going to use

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:06,250
the animation property instead of using all the separate properties and we'll say animate one, let's

29
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,960
say we'll have it.

30
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,290
The span will be a 5/2 span forward so that it stays where it's at when it ends.

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,050
And let's do ease.

32
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,210
We'll do ease in and out.

33
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:19,990
All right.

34
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:29,410
So just like in the last video, we're going to create a keyframes and let's call it animate one.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
And before what we did is we did two and from.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,640
But in this case, I want to use percentages.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,760
So basically 0% are the starting point we already have set here.

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,630
In fact, I'm going to set the position that I want, which is top zero left zero.

39
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:52,710
Uh.

40
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,050
Yeah.

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,040
Left zero.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:04,260
And then I'm going to say, well, at 25%, I want it to be top zero.

43
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,420
So I still want it to be at the top, but I want it to be left.

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,690
Let's say 300 pixels.

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,540
Now, what I want this to do ultimately is I want it to go from here, over, down, back, over and

46
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:16,840
up.

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,560
So a complete circle.

48
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,900
Complete 360, 360 degrees.

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,950
So let's go ahead and save this and see what happens.

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,330
So it gets pushed over and it's going to end in the same spot over a period of 5 seconds.

51
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,470
Now, obviously, we want we want to add on to this.

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,470
We want it to go down after.

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:49,450
So let's go right under this and say at 50% of the base, basically like the timeline, we want it to

54
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,710
be top 300 pixels because we want it to move down and we still want left to be 300 pixels.

55
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,820
So let's try that.

56
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,630
We'll save.

57
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,850
Goes over, goes down.

58
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,390
And it's going to end up in the in the starting position.

59
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:05,950
All right.

60
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,820
So next thing we want to do is add 75% and it doesn't have to be 25, 50, 75.

61
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,490
You can use any point in the timeline that you want.

62
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,209
So here I want it to be from the left.

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,769
Let's do top first.

64
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:27,490
So top, I still want it to be 300 pixels, but the left, I want it to be zero because I want it to

65
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,540
go back over.

66
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,270
So let's save it goes over, down, back, over and up.

67
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:42,430
Now, I just want to make sure that at 100%, which is basically the ending point, I want it to be

68
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,330
back in its original place, which is top zero, left zero.

69
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,410
All right.

70
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,800
So now our square just does a complete square.

71
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,410
Now, obviously, we can change other properties if we want.

72
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,620
So let's say at every point we want to change the color.

73
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,220
So let's do right here, background red.

74
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,070
And then at 50%, we'll say background green.

75
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,940
Let's do background blue.

76
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,420
And then at the ending point, let's do background light, we'll save that.

77
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,190
And you can see it changes to red, to green, to blue and to white.

78
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,590
Now let's do something else.

79
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,480
We can also animate the border radius, so let's do border radius.

80
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,490
I don't know if I show this to you guys, but you can have more than one value and it pertains to each

81
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,000
corner.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,130
So let's say we want the left corner, top left to be 50%.

83
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,160
So basically rounded and then the other one zero.

84
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,510
So I save that.

85
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,320
Notice that it turns into 50% when it goes to 25%.

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,250
This this corner here.

87
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,430
Now I'm going to copy this.

88
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:09,030
And then right here, let's say we want both both the top corners to be rounded.

89
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,310
So 50% and then we'll go down here and then we want the top.

90
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,860
So 50% and then also the bottom, right.

91
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,470
I believe this is will be 50%.

92
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,320
And then by the end, it should be a complete circle.

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,610
So we'll just say border radius, 50% like that, meaning all corners.

94
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,770
So with each iteration, each corner changes and by the end it's a circle.

95
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,810
So I mean, obviously this animation is is it's not very practical.

96
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,740
It's not something you would actually put in in a project, but it gives you the the tools that you

97
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,230
need to be able to create some cool stuff.

98
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,320
So you should be able to come up with some nice ideas.

99
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:02,670
As far as animation goes, it's not really my specialty, but you know, if you're if you're creative

100
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,160
in that area, you can do some really, really awesome things with CSS animation.

101
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,270
So in the next video, we're going to continue on with with animations and we're going to look at transitions.
