1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,660
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,490
In this video, we're going to take a look at CSS variables also called custom properties.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,800
So in documentation, you might see them as custom properties, but most people call them variables

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,520
because that's what they are.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,830
They're just placeholders for values.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:22,980
So let's create a new file called zero six, underscore variables dot HTML, and we'll put in our boilerplate,

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,770
let's say, CSS

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,080
variables and let's put our style.

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,750
I'm going to just close this up and in the body, we're not going to have too much here.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,320
We're going to put a header and the header will have in each one.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,590
We'll just say CSS variables and outside the header let's do a container and it's going to have two

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,220
divs.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,990
So class of box, let's do a class of box dash and then money sign and then let's times that by two

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,740
and enter and each one is going to have let's do an H three, we'll just say heading paragraph, we'll

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,520
do lorm 15 doesn't really matter what the content is.

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,540
So I'm going to copy the H3 in the paragraph and put that in this div as well.

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,800
And let's just move this back and open this with live server so it should look like this.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,790
And we're going to add some, some base styling here before we get into variables.

19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,950
And I know a lot of this stuff is repetitive, but it's good to keep typing it out because you get more

20
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,850
familiar with things.

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:43,830
So we're going to add a reset of so margin zero, padding zero and the body just want to make it look

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,700
somewhat decent.

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,830
So we're going to do a font family of aerial.

24
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,680
I wish Ariel was the default font for browsers, not times New Roman because it just looks horrible

25
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,290
or some kind of sans serif font.

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:12,830
So let's do a line height of 1.4 and let's do a background of light gray.

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,330
All right.

28
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,680
So I'm going to save this.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Now, before I move on to styling this other stuff, I'm going to show you how to create a variable.

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,280
Now, you need to define a scope for your variables.

31
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,330
Well, actually, you can define them right inside here.

32
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,180
If we wanted to, like, I could go right above and I could say, Dash, dash.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,210
This is how you format the variable.

34
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,470
Dash, dash.

35
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,280
And then name it.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:47,810
So I could say, let's say light dash color and set it to f four, three times like that.

37
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,190
And then I could use the variable right here by using the var keyword, opening up some parentheses

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,180
and then putting in dash dash light color.

39
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,020
You'll see in V's code we'll actually get a dropdown with with the options.

40
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,300
And if I save we get the same result.

41
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,840
So this is how you can define a variable.

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Now, usually you're not going to define it right in the same right where you're using it.

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,480
That kind of defeats the purpose.

44
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:23,960
I like to use variables, so I have a single place in my CSA, in my stylesheet that I can update,

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,330
like primary colors and stuff like that.

46
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,810
So what I'm going to do is just take this, just cut that out, and then I'm going to go up here and

47
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,030
I'm going to define a scope to define my variable in.

48
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:43,310
Now, since I used it in body, I could just do body like that and then put in the variable, but I'm

49
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,950
going to put it in the root, what's called the root scope.

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,930
So we do colon root.

51
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,980
So any variable that you create in the root scope, you can use anywhere in the stylesheet.

52
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,840
So if I save this, you can see that this still works.

53
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,860
All right.

54
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,880
Now, what I usually use variable variables for is primary color, secondary color.

55
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,530
And then you usually have some kind of light gray at least, at least when I build sites.

56
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,020
Otherwise, I have some kind of light gray, sometimes a dark gray, sometimes a really like a black,

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,740
almost.

58
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,730
And I put these into variables because I might use them over and over.

59
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,830
And then if you ever want to change it, you don't have to go to each instance of that color and change

60
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,130
it.

61
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,220
So let's create a primary color.

62
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:36,800
And for the primary color, I'm just going to do steel blue and then let's do a secondary color because

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,040
usually you'll have kind of a color palette to your your UI or your website and I'm going to do sky

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,670
blue.

65
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,320
So we have a primary color, a secondary color and a light color.

66
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,820
And then we're going to go down here and add some, some more styling.

67
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,230
So let's go header.

68
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:06,710
And for the header, I'm going to set a background color and I'm going to set that to the variable of

69
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,970
primary color.

70
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,700
So if I save that, we get the color.

71
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,940
I'm also going to change the text color to white.

72
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,150
All right.

73
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:27,800
And then let's see, let's let's text a line to the center and then I'm going to add a bottom border.

74
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,730
Actually, I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say border bottom, let's do five pixels, and

75
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,950
then I'm going to use the secondary color.

76
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,980
So var dash, dash secondary color solid and we'll save.

77
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,920
All right, now let's do the container.

78
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,070
The container is actually going to be a Flexbox.

79
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,520
So we'll say display flex.

80
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,790
It has two items in it.

81
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,890
So those are going to be side by side.

82
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,210
And then in the container, I'm going to add.

83
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,890
Let's see, let's do margin auto and then let's add a max width.

84
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,590
And this is some this is something I may put in a variable as well because if you want to for some reason

85
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,990
change the width of the the interface of the website, you can easily do that up here.

86
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:26,440
So I'm actually going to go right here and say max width and let's set it to 100 pixels and then we

87
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,710
can set that right here by saying var dash, dash, max width.

88
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,370
Now if I save it, I shouldn't be able to go past 100 pixels.

89
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,830
And if I wanted to change it, I could just very easily just change it to like 960 and now you can see

90
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,660
it gets it gets thinner.

91
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:51,730
Now the boxes I want to have the the primary color as well.

92
00:06:51,730 --> 00:07:02,770
So let's go box and let's say background color and we'll set that to var dash, dash, primary color.

93
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,980
And let's do the same thing with the board or bottom.

94
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,940
So border bottom.

95
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,870
We're going to set to five pixels.

96
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,660
We're going to use the secondary color and solid.

97
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,400
Okay.

98
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,590
Let's change the color to white.

99
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,060
You could even put the text color in a variable if you wanted to.

100
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,480
You can put whatever you want into variables, but sometimes it just doesn't make sense.

101
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,660
It really makes sense when you're going to be reusing it or if it's something major, like the width

102
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,100
of the the layout or something like that, at least in my opinion.

103
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,830
And then let's just add some padding here.

104
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,250
We'll say one REM margin, one REM, and we'll save that.

105
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,970
And now you can see that it has the same colors as the header.

106
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,870
All right.

107
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,080
So what's great about this is if I want to change, let's pretend that this is a whole website and we're

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,540
using these variables all over the place.

109
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,450
So we have like seven, eight, nine instances of the primary secondary color, light color.

110
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,940
We can now easily change this.

111
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,100
So if we wanted to change it to like, I don't know.

112
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:26,230
Dark, dark gray and then maybe like light gray or something like that, that might look a little weird,

113
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,190
but we'll save it.

114
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,410
And now the whole thing changes.

115
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:36,610
So it's very convenient to use variables for colors and then things like widths and layout and stuff

116
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,360
like that.

117
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,970
So another thing that maybe we can do is is the width of the flex boxes.

118
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:53,650
So if we actually let's go up here and let's set dash dash box one width, we'll set that to one and

119
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,900
then dash dash box to width, we'll set that to two.

120
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:09,670
And then let's add the box one class and we'll say, What do we do in here?

121
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,630
We're using Flex so we can say, var dash, dash box one width.

122
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,040
Copy that down.

123
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,520
We'll change this to two, box two and swap and save.

124
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,850
Whoops.

125
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,150
What I do, just delete everything and save.

126
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,910
And now you can see that there's a different layout here and now we can easily change this.

127
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,160
If I wanted to do maybe three here, save that, that gets that gets bigger.

128
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,700
If I want it to do maybe one and three here now, I can easily change the layout with these variables.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,560
Now everything is in.

130
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,780
All the variables are defined in the root scope.

131
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,990
But again, you can, for instance, the boxes.

132
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,570
If we want, we can say dot box and we can move these.

133
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,810
Into here, since we're not going to be using these variables anywhere else except for the box scope.

134
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,110
Right?

135
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,630
So if I save that, that's still works.

136
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,410
Now, if I move the max width into the box, that's not going to work.

137
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,520
So if I stretch this out, you'll see the max width doesn't work anymore because it's in the container.

138
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,790
I could put this in the container scope like I could do dot container and put that in, but that's something

139
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,250
I would I'd keep in the root because it's like a main just a main part of the site.

140
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,300
All right.

141
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,700
So that's pretty much it, guys.

142
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,240
I mean, like I said, I mostly use it for primary and secondary colors, things like widths.

143
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,350
But yeah, we'll be we'll be using variables throughout the coming projects and that's it.

144
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,910
I will see you in the next video.
