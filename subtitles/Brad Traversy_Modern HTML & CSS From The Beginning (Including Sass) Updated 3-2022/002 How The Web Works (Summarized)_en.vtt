00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.660
All right.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.000
So before we get started, I feel like it's important that, you know, at least the basic idea of how

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.700
the process of getting and loading a web page in your browser works.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.810
So for some of you, this may be very simple.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.620
You may already know this stuff.

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.920
For some of you, this may be very confusing and daunting.

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.890
If it is confusing, just know that you'll understand this process more as time goes on and you don't

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.350
need to know it to start building websites.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.170
I think a good metaphor for this is that you don't need to know how an engine works to be able to to

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.590
learn how to drive a car.

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.110
And the stuff that I'm going to talk about here in this in this section, it all happens under the hood.

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.670
So if you're a beginner and you're just stepping into this world, don't worry if you don't understand

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.180
this stuff.

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.720
I just think it's important to mention before we start.

15
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.110
All right.

16
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.610
So we all use the Internet every day, but most people don't know how it actually works.

17
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.340
And they just know they go to, you know, facebook.com or whatever and it loads their profile, their

18
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.270
social media.

19
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.670
So I'm going to try to explain what actually goes on under the hood in very simple terms.

20
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.490
Basically, the Internet is a global network of computers and devices, and these computers have what's

21
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.430
called an IP address to uniquely identify them, just like an actual address for your home.

22
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.490
And these IP addresses, they're assigned to you by your Internet service providers, and they're usually

23
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.880
in the form of four numbers with dots in between just like this here.

24
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.970
Now, this is a version four IP address.

25
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.870
There's also version six IP addresses that are much longer.

26
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.570
And these were created for when we run out of version four IP addresses and you can actually go to Google

27
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.400
and just search what's my IP and you'll find different sites that will actually trace it and show it

28
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.730
to you if you want to know what your current IP address is.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520
Now, even if you have multiple devices in your home, like let's say you have two computers, a tablet,

30
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.390
a mobile device, each of these devices, they all have what's called a private IP address that is only

31
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.170
local to your network, your home network.

32
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.140
Your router, however, has a public IP address, and that's the IP address that the Internet actually

33
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.830
sees all the private ones for each device that's only within your home network or your your office network,

34
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.910
whatever it may be.

35
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.750
All right.

36
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.020
Now, the way that computers talk to each other is over something called the TCP IP protocol.

37
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.040
And a protocol is basically just a way for computers to communicate almost like a language that so they

38
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.330
can speak to each other.

39
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.950
Don't worry too much about this.

40
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.530
If you're getting into computer networking and stuff like that, it's very important to understand the

41
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.040
different network layers and so on, how data packets are sent.

42
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.020
But that's not important for what we're doing here or even to become a web developer.

43
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.610
Now, HTTP is a little more important for you to understand.

44
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.230
This stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and if you notice when you type in website URL like Google.com,

45
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.330
Facebook, you're usually doing HTTP or https.

46
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.930
HTTPS is for secure connections using an SSL certificate and we'll talk more about that later.

47
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.220
But basically, HTTP is what's called an application layer protocol and it actually runs over TCP and

48
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.760
it's responsible for handling web traffic between a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox and a Web

49
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.010
server that stores a website.

50
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.740
And we'll talk more about that in the next slide.

51
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.910
So HTTP is one of many types of application layer protocols.

52
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.660
You also have, for instance, SMTP, which deals with email, you have FTP and SSH.

53
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.570
These these deal with transferring files over the Internet.

54
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.920
HTTP, however, is going to be the one you deal with the most in web development.

55
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.120
So websites and web pages are basically just files that are stored on computers that run a piece of

56
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.010
software called a web server.

57
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.030
And an example of a web server would be Apache or Engine X.

58
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.130
Don't worry if you've never heard of these before.

59
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.610
Technically, you could run a web server from your home on a computer, but most ISPs prohibit doing

60
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.690
that, and you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways because if for some reason the computer shuts

61
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.240
off or something happens, your website goes down.

62
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.390
So what you usually do is you you can build a website on your local machine at your home or office,

63
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.930
and then you would upload it to a hosting company or to a server that a hosting company owns.

64
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.240
And there's all different types of hosting accounts.

65
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.610
You can actually get a dedicated server, which is an actual computer that's dedicated to to you for

66
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.240
your use.

67
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.160
But those are really expensive.

68
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.740
You have shared hosting where you share accounts on one server with other people.

69
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.930
This is this is much cheaper.

70
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.800
And I'll go over the different types of hosting in a later section.

71
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.250
But that's basically what you're going to do is use a hosting company.

72
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.650
And in addition to that, you're going to need a domain name, which can be a dot com dot net dot org

73
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.910
and many other.

74
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.930
Shields.

75
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.720
Now, remember, all computers, including Web servers, have an IP address, but it would really suck

76
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.100
if you wanted to go to Facebook or Google and you had to remember something like 7522128131.

77
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:22.170
So what happens is when you type in, for instance, HTTP, colon, slash, slash, WW dot, facebook.com,

78
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:28.050
there's something called a DNS or a domain name service that actually maps that domain to the correct

79
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.950
IP address of Facebook.com or whatever website you're visiting.

80
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.900
And this makes our lives much easier.

81
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.810
Otherwise you'd probably have have a notebook with, you know, hundreds of numbers for each website

82
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.950
that you want to visit.

83
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.650
So later on, I'm actually going to show you how to register a domain name and how to upload a website

84
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.110
to a Web hosting account.

85
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.980
All right.

86
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.850
So let's take a quick look at a diagram that kind of explains what we've been talking about.

87
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.830
So you, the user down at the bottom types in, let's say, Google.com into a web browser and this could

88
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.900
be Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, any Web browser.

89
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.650
And the DNS server looks at the domain name such as Google.com and it maps it to the IP address that's

90
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.690
needed, as you can see right here.

91
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:23.730
Once it gets that IP address, it then makes a what's called an HTTP request to the web server of that

92
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.840
IP address.

93
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.020
And then that web server will return.

94
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.070
It'll return a response with the HTML file that needs to be load any other files, including CSS files

95
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.660
which are used for styling.

96
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.390
You have any images that that are on the page, those will get sent and whatever else is needed for

97
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.090
Google.com to be loaded in your browser.

98
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.820
Now these HTTP requests, they're made when you load a web page as well as when you, for instance,

99
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.960
submit a form.

100
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.400
And there's different types of requests, there's different status codes, but that's all stuff you're

101
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.450
going to learn later on.

102
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:03.180
When you get into scripting and programming, you don't need to know that stuff to create basic static

103
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.060
web pages with HTML and CSS.

104
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.080
So this is obviously a very brief summary.

105
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.820
There's a lot more that goes into it.

106
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.210
It's much more intricate when you get into networking layers and so on.

107
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.770
But that again, that's not stuff that you guys need to know right now.

108
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.970
One thing about web development in general is it can be very overwhelming because there's just so many

109
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.950
different technologies to learn.

110
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:33.210
But HTML and CSS, the they're the building blocks of all websites and web applications.

111
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.250
So in the next video, I want to talk more about the roles of HTML and CSS.
