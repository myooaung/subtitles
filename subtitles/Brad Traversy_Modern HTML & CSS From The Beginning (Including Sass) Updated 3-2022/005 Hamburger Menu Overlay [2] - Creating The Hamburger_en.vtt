00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.750
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.660
So I know the last video was kind of long, but I wanted to get the HTML and the base styling out of

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.130
the way so we can focus on the menu.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.040
So let's head over to our version, which looks like this.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.710
So we just have the checkbox up here and the checkbox has a class of toddler, if you remember.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.540
So we have class of toddler menu wrap is going to cover.

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.680
It's going to surround everything, including the overlay.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.590
So many wrap surrounds all of this everything.

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.090
So let's start with that.

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.490
So we're going to go to menu CSS and let's add class menu dash wrap and we're going to set that to position

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.450
fixed.

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.010
So when we have our overlay open and we scroll down, we don't want this to scroll down.

13
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.960
Like we don't want the menu to just go out of focus or out of the viewport.

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.650
We want it to stay where it is, so we want to position it fixed at top zero, left zero.

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.110
So basically its natural position.

16
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.750
We want it to stay there and we want to give it a Z index of one so that it's always on top.

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.920
We want the menu to be visible, so we want it to be on top of any other content.

18
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.700
All right.

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.520
So if I save that now, you can see that it's fixed and that white area is now gone because it's just

20
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.730
sitting on top of of anything else that we have on the page.

21
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.580
Now, let me try and explain what's going to happen.

22
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.790
We need to style the checkbox itself.

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.460
Now the checkbox is going to sit on top of the actual hamburger class just right here.

24
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.550
We want it to sit on top of it, however, we want it to be invisible.

25
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.300
So we want to set the opacity to zero.

26
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.180
And the reason that we need the checkbox is just for a state because we can set it to checked and we

27
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.580
can actually grab on to that within the style and we can create our overlay when it's checked and when

28
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.460
it's unchecked, we can bring it out so that the the checkbox is just for functionality.

29
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.790
The hamburger class is what we're going to use to create the actual square and then the inner div will

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.550
be using to create the lines inside.

31
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.190
Hopefully that makes sense and close that up.

32
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.260
So let's grab the menu wrap and then the toddler, which is the actual checkbox input and we need to

33
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.490
position it correctly.

34
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.060
So we're going to say position absolute and we want to set it to the top corner.

35
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.110
So top zero, left zero.

36
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.380
And we're going to set let's see, we're going to set the Z index to two because we always want it to

37
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.280
be on top.

38
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.660
It's going to be invisible.

39
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.020
We won't see it, but it will still be there and we'll still be able to check it.

40
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.840
And we're going to set the cursor two pointer so that when we hover over it, we have a pointer and

41
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.100
let's set the width to say 50 pixels and height, we'll do 50 pixels.

42
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.750
And if I save that, you can see now it's positioned absolute right in the corner.

43
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.180
However, we don't want it to show, so we're going to say opacity and let's set that to zero.

44
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.510
So now it's not there, but it is there.

45
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.110
All right.

46
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.690
And you can see I'm actually checking it right now.

47
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.060
When I hover over it, the cursor goes over it and it's going to be 50 pixels around.

48
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.570
All right.

49
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.630
Now, the hamburger class.

50
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.890
We're going to we're going to grab on to that next.

51
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.210
So let's say hamburger and we're going to position it right in the same spot.

52
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.270
So absolute top zero, left zero.

53
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.060
And we're going to set this Z index.

54
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.620
To one.

55
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.420
We want it to be under the checkbox and we're also going to set a width and height.

56
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.780
We're going to do 60 pixels, so height and you can mess with the sizes if you want.

57
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.830
I mean, you don't have to follow the exact parameters that I am, but whoops.

58
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.720
Let's see, we got width, height.

59
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:17.040
Let's set padding to one REM and then the background I'm going to set to the primary color.

60
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.399
Now, I just want to show you real quick.

61
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:24.340
If I do like background black and save, we get our little square here and we can actually check it.

62
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.550
I'm clicking and it's checking that input, but we're seeing the hamburger class here.

63
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.610
Now I'm setting it to the primary color.

64
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.160
So var dash dash primary.

65
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.470
And we're not going to get the little drop down in vs code because the variables are not set in this

66
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.860
file.

67
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.480
They're set in the style file.

68
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.770
So it's a primary color and if I save, you'll see that it has the primary color and it's C through

69
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.320
its it's translucent because of the primary.

70
00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.720
The primary color is an RGA and the opacity is 0.75.

71
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.280
So that's what we're seeing here.

72
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.570
I mean, if you don't want it, if you want to set it to a different color or you don't want it to be

73
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.560
translucent, then of course you can change the background to whatever you want.

74
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.820
Now I'm also going I want to center I want to display this as a flex because the dive inside is going

75
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.600
to take care of the lines.

76
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.630
I want to center everything.

77
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:36.830
So I'm going to display, flex and then align the items to the center and let's also justify the content

78
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.820
to the center, and we should be good.

79
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.390
All right.

80
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.620
So that's basically the the hamburger, the outside wrapper of the hamburger.

81
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.390
Now we want to do the lines.

82
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.800
And remember, there's there's a div inside of the hamburger div.

83
00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.530
So what we want to do is set this to be a line and then we're going to use before and after to insert

84
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.910
the top and bottom lines, if that makes sense.

85
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.950
So let's go back to menu CSS and I'll actually put a comment here.

86
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.620
Let's say hamburger line, just so you know what does what because I know a lot of times when we look

87
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.470
at complicated CSS, it's you don't know what is actually doing what.

88
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.380
So I want to try to explain that as we go along.

89
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.460
So we're going to take the menu wrap and we want the hamburger class and then we want the immediate

90
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:44.120
div and we're going to set it to position relative and then we're going to set flex to none and set

91
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.000
the width to 100%.

92
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.370
Now the height I'm going to set to two pixels because remember, we're creating the line here, we're

93
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.860
creating the middle line of the hamburger menu.

94
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.270
So I'm going to give it a background of white.

95
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.830
I want it to be white and let's say display flex.

96
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.350
And we want to set a line.

97
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:18.910
Items to center and justify content to center.

98
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.380
So let's save that.

99
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.360
And you can see we get our middle line.

100
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.390
Now, obviously, we need two more.

101
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.750
We need one above it, or I should say before it and after it.

102
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.280
So we're going to use the before and after pseudo selectors.

103
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:41.590
So let's say hamburger lines, I will say top and bottom lines.

104
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.610
So we're going to take menu wrap

105
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.860
hamburger and let's say we want the div that we want to do before.

106
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.770
So we want to use the before pseudo selector and we, we're going to do the same exact styling for after.

107
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.020
So we're going to copy this and then we're going to do after and it might turn.

108
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.910
If you're using vs code, it might turn into double colon basically does the same thing.

109
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.520
A single colon is just a shortcut for that.

110
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.770
So since we're using before and after, we need to put in content, but we're not actually inserting

111
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.460
content and let's set this to position

112
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.550
absolute and it's absolute to the relative div, the actual div.

113
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.890
And then let's set the Z index to one.

114
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:45.990
And let's say top, I'm going to say negative ten pixels, so I'm going to move it up ten pixels and

115
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:51.510
we want to set the width to 100% just like the the standard div up here.

116
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.290
And then we're going to set the height to the same thing.

117
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.700
So two pixels.

118
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:05.850
And for a background I'm just going to say inherit which will be white, it's going to inherit the this

119
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.660
white here.

120
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.830
So if I save that, you'll see that now we have a line up above.

121
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:17.160
Now what's happening is both the before and after, it's basically creating both lines, the before

122
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.610
and after.

123
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.680
However, they're in the same exact spot.

124
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.860
We just said top negative ten pixels.

125
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:29.520
So what I want to do now is just take the after one because this is this should all be the same for

126
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:29.850
both.

127
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.490
However, the after we just want to position it below.

128
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.980
So I'm simply going to take the top value and I'm going to set it to ten pixels and save.

129
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.680
And now that brings it down ten pixels.

130
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.930
So hopefully that makes sense.

131
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.480
And now we have our our hamburger menu.

132
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.140
All right.

133
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.450
So just to reiterate what we've done here, because I know that it might be a little confusing, we

134
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.780
set the menu app to be positioned fixed and start at the top and the top left corner.

135
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.920
So menu wrap covers, everything, even the entire overlay here.

136
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:08.130
And then the toddler is the checkbox, which we positioned it, we set a width and height and then we

137
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.990
basically made it disappear.

138
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.610
It's still there.

139
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.380
You can see we can still check it.

140
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.940
So right now I'm actually checking it.

141
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.620
If I click anywhere on this, it's checking it, but it is opacity zero.

142
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.360
In fact, if I change this back to one and we save, you can see that it's still there.

143
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.590
All right.

144
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.360
We're going to set that back to zero.

145
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.570
And then the hamburger class is what takes care of this actual box right here, which we have set the

146
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.410
primary color.

147
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:41.280
You kind of can't I mean, it's very hard to see because it's it's it's it's translucent and it it's

148
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.950
almost the same color as the background, but it is there.

149
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:49.560
And then the inner div we took and we create basically created a line.

150
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.070
So we set width to 100%.

151
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.870
So it goes all the way across aside from the padding and the height to two pixels.

152
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.520
So the line is two pixels.

153
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:06.480
Then we took the before and after pseudo selectors and we created a two more lines for those.

154
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:14.400
Set it to be up here at the top negative ten pixels and then we took just the after and we changed top

155
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.800
to ten pixels so that it got pushed down.

156
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.760
So that's that's what's going on here and hopefully that makes sense.

157
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.060
So I think that's going to be it for this video in the next one.

158
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.880
I want to start to to take care of the rotation.

159
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:33.630
When we click on this, I want to transform it and use rotate so that we can actually morph it into

160
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.500

161
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.660
So we're going to do that in the next video.
