00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.780
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.290
So now we're going to take a look at forms and inputs.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.340
Now, it's important to to understand that with forms on a website displaying them is with HTML, and

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.960
then we can style them with CSS.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
But when you submit a form and make it do something like, let's say a registration form, that stuff

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.780
happens on the back end and that happens with some type of programming language like PHP or Python or

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.550
JavaScript or something like that.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.300
So just, just understand that HTML and CSS are to display the form, but server side programming languages

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.140
which you'll learn in another course, those that's what is used to actually process the form, even

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.790
a simple contact form.

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.870
Although there are some services that you can use that will basically you can kind of insert a snippet

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.650
into your HTML and you can use their service to process your form.

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.350
And we may talk about that much later on.

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.940
But for now, let's go ahead and take a look at creating a form and the different inputs.

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.710
So I'm going to create a file called zero seven underscore forms, underscore input, HTML, and let's

16
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.540
go ahead and put our boilerplate in here.

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.590
We'll change the title to forms and input.

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.190
And let's go down to the body area and create a form.

19
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.630
So we're going to use a form tag and notice when I use Emit to create a form tag, it gives us an action.

20
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.590
This is where the form is going to be submitted to.

21
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.270
So you would submit it to a file.

22
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.290
Sometimes it's going to be a PHP file if that's what you're working with on your server.

23
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.110
It might be something like a file called process dot PHP where it would take all the form inputs, the

24
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.560
values, maybe integrate it with a database so you can insert the data into a database, something like

25
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.040
that.

26
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.250
So here is where we're going to put our our inputs and I'm going to separate our labels and inputs with

27
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.820
Divs.

28
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.880
So Divs are just basically just that division.

29
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.190
So if you want to separate your markup in in certain ways, so I'm going to put a label in here.

30
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.259
So if I say label tab, it'll give me a for attribute and this for attribute.

31
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.610
You want this to match the ID of the input and I'll show you why in a second.

32
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.850
So let's say this is going to be for the user's name.

33
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.340
We'll put the text name in here right under it.

34
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.550
We're going to put an input and in V's code and emit.

35
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.980
If I hit Enter or tab, it's going to give me a type of text by default, which is what we want right

36
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.580
now.

37
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.110
So if I go ahead and save this and let's actually run this in life server.

38
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.580
You see, we have a label and we have our input.

39
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.050
Now, if I give this an ID of name, which is the same value I did for the for attribute, if I save

40
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.560
that and I click on the label, it'll actually highlight the form.

41
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.550
So if you want that functionality, then you want to put the four in the ID.

42
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.670
If this doesn't match, you'll see if I click on the label, it doesn't actually highlight the form.

43
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.990
It's not something you need to do, but if you want that functionality, then you want to add both of

44
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.590
these.

45
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.220
And then a lot of times with inputs you'll have a name attribute, which in this case the value just

46
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.450
happens to be name.

47
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.600
But this is what is used on the server side.

48
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.660
So if on the server in like let's say PHP, you want to grab the value you would use whatever this is

49
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.920
in this case name.

50
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.910
All right.

51
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.180
So let's move on to create another input here.

52
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.450
So we'll put another div, we'll do a label this time.

53
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.160
Let's make this an email.

54
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.310
So we'll put an input in here.

55
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.560
Now with Emmet, we can do a colon here and then whatever the type of input.

56
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.920
So I want this to be an email type and if we do that, it'll also give us the name ID by default.

57
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.250
So we're going to fill this in with email and email.

58
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.810
All right.

59
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.620
And I'll save that.

60
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.730
And notice it looks just like the text field, but it has to actually be an email for it to for it to

61
00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.270
submit.

62
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.540
So you can actually easily add validation by just using this type email.

63
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.000
It's just client side validation.

64
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.280
If you're working with a server with like let's say PHP, you'd want to add validation there as well.

65
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.710
So that's an email failed.

66
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.530
And if you want to put your label on a separate line without CSIS, you could put a line break here.

67
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.710
Let's go ahead and do that.

68
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.010
Just think it just looks a little better like that.

69
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.610
And we're going to I'm going to show you how to style a form really nice later on.

70
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.680
It's actually going to be one of our challenges.

71
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.250
So let's go ahead and create another field here.

72
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.230
Let's do a div and a label.

73
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.360
And this is going to be for message and message is going to be a text area which is different from a

74
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.320
text input like this because it's bigger, it's for it's for more content, usually like a message or,

75
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.630
I don't know, a bio or something like that.

76
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.940
And a text area has its own tag, which also has an ending tag.

77
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.050
And I'm going to get rid of these for a second here and just have the name and ID.

78
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.390
So for name, let's say message, ID will say message.

79
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.160
And then we don't have to put anything within the text area tags.

80
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.580
But if I save that, let's put a line break after the label and save it and you'll see that it's a little

81
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.970
bigger.

82
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.210
Now, if we want to make this even bigger without without using CSS, we can use the calls and row rows

83
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.170
attribute.

84
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.610
So for calls, let's do 50 and save.

85
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.980
So what this is, is it's 50 columns going this way.

86
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.490
All right?

87
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.350
If we want to make it bigger vertically, then we can use rows.

88
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.950
So we'll say rows equals five and save.

89
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.260
And now it's five rows going down and you can make it as big or as small as you want.

90
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.790
So that's a text area.

91
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.310
So these are the main ones like this could this could be a contact form right here, but there are other

92
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.670
ones.

93
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.440
Let's look at a select list.

94
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.930
So again, we'll put a div in here

95
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.290
and in here let's put a select tag with a name and ID, let's call this gender.

96
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.260
Actually, we'll call it sex.

97
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.930
We'll be politically correct here.

98
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.840
So we'll say sex.

99
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.530
And actually we want to go inside the select.

100
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.670
We don't want to do this.

101
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.690
I meant to put a label here, so let's do label.

102
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.850
And then inside the select is where we want to put our options.

103
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.960
If I just save it like this, we've got to put the text in here.

104
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.090
We have just an empty select list.

105
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.040
So for each option we want to put an actual option tag with a value.

106
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.430
So in this case we'll say male and then we'll put the text in here and let's just copy this down.

107
00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.980
We'll say female and then we'll just put other as an option as well.

108
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:09.740
So now we have a select list with kind of this dropdown menu where we can select an option.

109
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.550
So that is select let's take a look at number.

110
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.720
So we'll have a label and let's let's make this one an age.

111
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.970
We might use this for age.

112
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.280
I'll put a line break here.

113
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.640
And let's say input and then colon number, because we want it to be the type of number.

114
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.520
And if you don't want to remember, these emit shortcuts right now, if it's too much, you don't have

115
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.730
to.

116
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.700
It just it will make your life easier in the future.

117
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.580
So for name, let's say age and for ID age.

118
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.850
If we save that, it's going to look like a text field.

119
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.230
But when we click inside of it or when we hover over it, actually we get these arrows and we can go

120
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.550
ahead and we can kind of just change, just increment and decrease the number.

121
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:11.070
We can also type in a number and we can't type in any any letters except for E because that can actually

122
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.960
be part of a number.

123
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.300
So that's a number of fields.

124
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.520
It's good for ages, stuff like that.

125
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.980
Let's take a look at the date type.

126
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.710
So say Div, we'll do a label and let's make this one birth date.

127
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.400
And we'll put a line break at the end here.

128
00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:47.510
We want to do input type of date and we'll say birth date for the name and birth date for the ID.

129
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.320
Save that and it's going to give us this.

130
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.890
Now, there's two ways we can use this.

131
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.090
We can click inside of it.

132
00:08:53.090 --> 00:09:01.010
We can put in like, you know, like that, or we can click this little arrow which will give us this

133
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.040
date picker and we can actually pick a date.

134
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:11.000
We can go ahead and scroll through the month, months and years and makes makes it a lot easier to format

135
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.750
dates and it makes the user format it in a certain way.

136
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:23.330
So next, let's look at radio buttons, create another div here and do label for this.

137
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.500
Let's call it membership.

138
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.570
Maybe this is some kind of signup form for a membership and there's different levels.

139
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:38.030
So we're going to do an input for each one with the type of radio we'll call the name is going to be

140
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.970
the same for each one, which will be membership, but the value is going to be different for each one.

141
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.420
So value let's say there's a membership called Simple.

142
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.890
All right, so we'll do what happen here.

143
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.830
Value is going to be simple and then the ID will say membership.

144
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.960
So if we want to have more than one radio button, we'll just copy this down.

145
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.430
Let's do three times.

146
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.900
Let's say the second membership value is going to be standard.

147
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.310
And then this third one is going to be, let's say, super.

148
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.340
Maybe it's like a hosting package or something like that.

149
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.790
So if we save, you'll see that we just have the buttons.

150
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.770
There's no label and to if we want a label, we just put the text right next to it.

151
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.360
So we'll say simple.

152
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.430
We don't, we don't even have to do like a label tag or anything.

153
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.620
Standard and super and save.

154
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.190
And there we go.

155
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.840
So now we can choose one of these.

156
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:40.990
Okay.

157
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.840
Now, let's say that when you load the page you want one pre selected.

158
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.510
If you want to do that, what you can do is you can take the one you want selected like let's say standard

159
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.320
and we can add an attribute here of checked.

160
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.900
So if I say checked and then it loads the page, you'll see that it's automatically going to be checked.

161
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.200
And I forgot to mention with Select we can do the same thing.

162
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.620
Let's say we want female selected on a select list.

163
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.960
You don't use checked, you use selected.

164
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.010
So if I save that now notice that female is selected by default.

165
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:22.410
Also, if we want to pre fill a value here like let's say in name, we want a value.

166
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:29.790
We can actually add a value attribute and let's say John Doe and save.

167
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:36.210
Now sometimes you may want something in here that's not an actual value, but kind of like a message,

168
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.670
like enter an email or something like that.

169
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:44.790
Before HTML five, we would have to actually use a value, but you would want that to go away when you

170
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.600
click in the box.

171
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.960
So we would have to use JavaScript to add that functionality.

172
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.930
But with HTML five came placeholder.

173
00:11:52.710 --> 00:12:02.820
So if we want to add placeholder and set that to let's say enter in email and we save now it seems like

174
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.370
it's filled like the value, but notice the text is lighter and if I click inside of it, it doesn't

175
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:14.130
like it doesn't go it doesn't go away, but it gives me the cursor at the beginning.

176
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.030
It's not something that I actually have to delete, which we don't want.

177
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.060
So that's a that's a placeholder attribute.

178
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:26.220
So the last type I want to show you is a checkbox which is very similar to a radio button, except you

179
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.110
can, you can choose multiple options.

180
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.600
Notice with the radio, I can only choose one.

181
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:36.060
So there's different situations where you might want to use a checkbox and certain situations where

182
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.350
you might want to use a radio.

183
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.620
So I'm going to copy the whole div with the, with the membership and let's change this to let's just

184
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.630
say I like this would be like a hobbies I guess, or I mean it doesn't matter.

185
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.710
It's just an example.

186
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.190
But we want to change all the types here to checkbox.

187
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.080
Now I'm going to show you another little trick.

188
00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:01.740
If you highlight something like, let's say radio and you want to choose the next thing that matches

189
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.500
the next text of radio, you can hold control.

190
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.630
DX And it will choose the next one.

191
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:12.390
If you want to choose the next, do it again and notice all three are now selected and I can change

192
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.470
them all at the same time.

193
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.630
I'm going to change them all to checked.

194
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.740
I'm sorry, not checked checkbox like that.

195
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.240
And then if you hit escape it'll bring you back to your single cursor.

196
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:31.230
Or you can just click somewhere else and then for the name I'm going to double click and highlight and

197
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.540
I want to select all the memberships here.

198
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:41.040
So I'm going to do a control DX again, just to select all of these and I'm going to change it to likes

199
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.910
like that.

200
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.000
And then we can escape and there we go.

201
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.600
So we have a checkbox likes for the values.

202
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.340
I'm going to change this one to let's say, let's say bike.

203
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.930
Let's say this is like a vehicle.

204
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.550
So bike might not be the best example, but it's fine.

205
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.830
I want to change that to bike.

206
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.060
This will do car.

207
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.100
We want to change the value here to car.

208
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.040
You should probably do the values lowercase.

209
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:24.270
The value is the actual data that gets sent to the server, say boat, and we'll change that to boat.

210
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.100
So let's save that.

211
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.230
Now we have a checkbox that says I like cars selected by default because we have checked.

212
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.940
I'm going to get rid of that and we can go ahead and we can check as many as we want.

213
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.740
Like that.

214
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.180
So that is a checkbox.

215
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.630
Now we're going to add a submit button because obviously a form is no good unless you can actually submit

216
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.020
it.

217
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.650
Now with a submit, you can do a couple of things.

218
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:51.850
You can either.

219
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.730
Oh, that's something I want to show you, too.

220
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.260
If we have all of these tabbed over and we want to bring them back, we can hold shift and then hit

221
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.060
tab and it'll bring it backwards.

222
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.850
So for a submit button, we could use an input like this.

223
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:13.960
We could say input and give it a type of submit and then give it a value, which would be the text that's

224
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.550
actually displayed in the button.

225
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.760
So if I save that now we have a button that says Submit.

226
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.660
Another way to do it would be to use button tag.

227
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.890
So we could do button and again give it a type of submit.

228
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:37.610
And now we would just put the text in the middle like that because input is a self closing tag button

229
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.150
is not.

230
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.920
So you would put the text in the middle.

231
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.960
So that will give us the same thing.

232
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.700
All right.

233
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.190
I'm just going to comment these just so you guys know what is what.

234
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.570
So that's a text input.

235
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.520
This is an email input.

236
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.590
This is a message input, not a message.

237
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.800
A text text area input.

238
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.610
Let's see, this is a select.

239
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.160
This is a number.

240
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.030
This is a date.

241
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.490
Radio.

242
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.210
And checkbox.

243
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.450
And then this is an input submit.

244
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.550
So if you ever need to come back here for reference, you can do that.

245
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.930
It's actually just make this button submit.

246
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.520
Now, one more thing I want to show you is we can add a reset button.

247
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.930
I'm going to actually comment out one of these because we don't want to submit buttons.

248
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:51.890
But if we want to do a reset, we can do button with the type of reset like that.

249
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.250
We'll put the text reset in here and now if I fill some stuff in.

250
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.310
Say 33.

251
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.630
And then I hit reset.

252
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:08.450
It'll clear everything out except for John Doe, because we hardcoded that value in here like that.

253
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:09.859
All right.

254
00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.780
So that's how we can create forms.

255
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.359
And I know that this form is extremely ugly.

256
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.030
I'm going to show you how to style forms when we get to the CSS section.

257
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.349
This is just how we can actually display the fields.

258
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.950
All right, guys.

259
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.460
So that's it.

260
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.020
I'll see you in the next video.
