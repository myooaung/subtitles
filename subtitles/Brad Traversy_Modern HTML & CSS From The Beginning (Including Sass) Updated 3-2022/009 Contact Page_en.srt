1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,870
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,450
So we have one page left to go.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,790
That's the contact page.

4
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,370
So that's what we're going to start working on.

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,030
So let's jump into VS code and let's open up.

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,810
I'm going to open up about HTML and I'm going to copy everything in there and then let's create a new

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:24,600
file inside the dist called Contact HTML and we'll go ahead and paste this in and let's just pick and

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,590
choose what we want.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,330
So in the head, I'm just going to change the title to contact me and let's see, we want to keep the

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:41,730
header, but we're going to move the class here to contact and we're going to get rid of all the sections.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,600
Just keep the footer and we'll save that.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,090
And now we should be able to go to contact and we basically have our just our boilerplate for an inner

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,870
page.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:02,340
So on our contact page we have a form and we have an email address, phone number, address area.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,400
And then we just have an area that says, let's start your next project.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,370
So we're going to have section A, B and C.

17
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,600
So let's start off with the form which is going to be section A.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,740
So we'll go under the header here, let's say section A and we'll say contact form.

19
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:29,690
So let's create a section with an ID of contact dash a we're going to give it a class of text center

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:41,570
and let's do class of py-3 and we'll put in our container and let's do our H two with the class of section

21
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,380
title.

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,860
And we're just going to say contact me.

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,950
And underneath that we'll put our bottom line.

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,910
So I know this is very repetitive.

25
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:01,970
So we also want a paragraph with the class of lead and we'll say, here is how you can reach me.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,410
And I mean, it's repetitive, but that's that's really what you want.

27
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,840
You want to stay consistent with your your design, with your your markup, your styling.

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,430
You want everything to be consistent.

29
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,040
So being repetitive is actually a good thing.

30
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,310
So let's go underneath the paragraph here and create a form.

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,210
I'm just going to I'm not going to put any action or anything like that in the attributes in it for

32
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,540
now.

33
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:38,180
Just, just a form tag and let's do a class of text dash fields and then we're going to put our inputs

34
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,510
in.

35
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,140
I'm not going to use a label, I'm just going to use a placeholder in the form.

36
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,190
So let's do an input with the type of text and actually know what it's going to be text by default.

37
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:58,340
Let's do a class of text dash input and also a class of name dash input.

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:07,430
And then let's do, let's see, let's add a placeholder which we're going to use as a label.

39
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,300
So we'll just say name and then I'm going to just copy that down.

40
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:23,330
Let's do that's two, three, four, we'll do and then one we'll do five.

41
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,040
So one, two, three, four, five.

42
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,220
The last one is going to be a text area, but we'll change that up after.

43
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,570
So we have our name.

44
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,880
Next one is going to be the subject.

45
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,950
So let's do.

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,170
Text input, subject input.

47
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,750
And by the way, we're going to be using grid template areas for this form to place the inputs in the

48
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,030
correct areas for placeholder, let's do subject.

49
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,040
And this third one here is going to be the email input.

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,810
So we'll do email.

51
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,810
Let's change this class to email input.

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,990
We'll also change the type to email and we're going to have a phone number.

53
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,810
So let's do right here.

54
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:18,050
We'll do phone input, change the placeholder to phone number actually for this placeholder, let's

55
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,880
say email address.

56
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,270
And then this last one is going to be the message.

57
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,710
So it's going to be a text area.

58
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:33,980
So I'm going to get rid of the type text and the input and let's say text area and let's see, we're

59
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,660
going to have text input class.

60
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,150
Let's also do message input and then get rid of the placeholder.

61
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,040
No, I'm sorry, not get rid of the placeholder.

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,940
We want that.

63
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,880
We're going to say enter message, but we do want to add an ending tag since it's a text area.

64
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:59,600
And then I'm going to go outside of the div here and add a button with the class of BTN Dash Dark and

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,510
let's make sure we give this a type of submit because it's a submit button.

66
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,640
And then for the text inside, we'll just say submit.

67
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,280
All right, so that's our form.

68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,650
So we'll save that pretty or fixed it up a little bit, made it a little more readable.

69
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,310
So if we go to our form, it looks absolutely horrendous.

70
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,470
So we want to add our styling.

71
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:31,790
So we'll head over to Main dot C's and let's go down to the bottom.

72
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,830
So let's see, we have our boat and then our footer.

73
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,750
Let's go right above the footer and let's say contact page.

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:54,170
So for the contact we have our our A section, so let's do ID contact and then we want to focus on the

75
00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:05,330
ID of contact dash a so we'll do ampersand, dash a and let's do the text fields class, which actually

76
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,490
wraps around all the inputs.

77
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,140
And this is going to be our grid.

78
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:16,400
So display grid and we're going to use grid template areas here.

79
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,350
So let's go.

80
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,420
We want to go on to the next line and we're going to basically map this out visually.

81
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:32,210
So we want our name and email field on the first line, then we want the subject and the phone and then

82
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:39,080
we want the message to span across both both columns here.

83
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:50,690
So we'll go ahead and put a semicolon here and then let's add a grid gap of 1.2 REM and let's do a margin

84
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,400
bottom of 1.2 REM.

85
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,950
So still within this text field, I'm now going to add the grid areas.

86
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,670
We need to connect the actual elements.

87
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,750
So we have these classes name input, subject input and so on.

88
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,610
Want to map them to these grid areas.

89
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:20,360
So let's do the name dash input and let's do grid dash area and set that to name.

90
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,550
And then I'm just going to grab this and copy it down.

91
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:33,080
Let's do two, three, four, five and then I'm going to select this name here, control DX and just

92
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,950
change this to subject.

93
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:47,060
Same thing here, control D Change these to email and this one, change this to phone and this one will

94
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,800
be message.

95
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,360
All right, so we'll save that.

96
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,410
We'll take a look.

97
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,480
And now you can see it's mapped out how we how we did it in the grid template areas.

98
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,210
So I want to add some padding.

99
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,920
These are way too small.

100
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,590
So let's go.

101
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,500
Let's go outside of.

102
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,270
Well, no, we'll.

103
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,280
We'll stay within the text fields.

104
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,520
So we want to go like right here and let's do text input.

105
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:24,410
So all the class of text input, which is everything we're going to add padding of 0.5 REM and one REM.

106
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,340
And then the message, the text area, I'm just going to add to that.

107
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,049
I'm going to I'm going to change the height.

108
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,720
Let's do message input.

109
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,539
Actually, we already have the message input up here, so I could just add it right here.

110
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,890
We'll say height.

111
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,200
Let's do like 200 pixels.

112
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,610
See what that looks like.

113
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,130
It's too big.

114
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,950
Let's do let's try 100.

115
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,250
All right.

116
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,500
So it looks pretty good now for the button.

117
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,840
The this button right here.

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,610
I want it to be a little wider.

119
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,750
I don't want 100%.

120
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,710
I think that's too wide.

121
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,320
So let's do 50% for that.

122
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,890
So we'll target let's see, we have button.

123
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,400
Button.

124
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,880
I guess we could target the button dark inside of the text text fields.

125
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,380
Actually, it's not in text fields.

126
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,850
We have to go outside of it.

127
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,830
So that ends here.

128
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,330
So we'll just say the button dark.

129
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,630
Well, actually, we don't want to do that because we might want to change it to a different utility

130
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,110
class.

131
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:47,080
So we'll just do, let's say button and we'll set the type equals submit.

132
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:55,300
So we want to target the submit button and let's do a width of 50%.

133
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,140
All right.

134
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,740
Let's see what that gives us so it makes it a little wider.

135
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:07,540
So next we have the contact info, so we're going to add that to the HTML now that we have our form

136
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,530
all styled.

137
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,190
So in contact HTML, let's add section B.

138
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,730
So section B is the contact info.

139
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:36,160
So section, let's give it an ID of contact dash B and I'm going to give it a class of py padding three

140
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,210
top and bottom.

141
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:44,260
And let's also do a BG doc, give it the dark background and wrap it in a container.

142
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,780
And then we're going to do a class of contact dash info.

143
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,110
Current contact info.

144
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,610
And this is going to be a grid as well with some divs.

145
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,080
And we're going to have an icon.

146
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,460
Let's give it a class of face.

147
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,430
Let's do a dash envelope and let's make it a little bigger.

148
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,060
We'll do fa2x, so that's that.

149
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,880
And then we'll do an H three with the email.

150
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:24,880
We'll put a paragraph here and we'll just say John at something dot com.

151
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,680
So that's our email.

152
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,740
Let's just copy this div two more times because this one here is going to be the phone.

153
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,840
We'll change the icon to phone.

154
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,150
Change that to phone.

155
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,190
And let's just do fake phone number.

156
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,650
Five, five, five, five, five, five, five.

157
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,930
Just all fives like that.

158
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,890
And then the last one here is going to be the address.

159
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:02,490
So the icon is going to be address, dash card, and then let's say address.

160
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,470
And we'll change this to, let's say 50 Main Street, Boston, Mass.

161
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,160
OC.

162
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,390
Now I'm just going to add the C, the contact C section as well, because it's basically just an H one.

163
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:31,890
So let's say section C, we'll just say tagline and we'll do let's do a section with the ID of contact

164
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:43,620
dash C and let's do an H one and we'll just say, let's start your next project.

165
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,570
All right.

166
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,800
So we'll save that.

167
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,500
And actually, let's let's add a couple of classes here as well.

168
00:12:52,830 --> 00:13:02,730
So I'm going to do BG Main and let's do p y for let's see what that looks like.

169
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:10,050
So I'm going to save that and if we go back, so that's good for now.

170
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,970
You know, we want to add a container in the sea.

171
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,410
Forgot about that.

172
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,800
So let's do container and then we'll move this up into here like that.

173
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,570
So let's start to style this part, the section B.

174
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:38,140
So we want to go under the A which ends right here and we're going to do Ampersand B

175
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,250
and let's see, we're just going to we're not going to do too much here.

176
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:58,120
We're going to grab the contact info class and display it as a grid because we want those three contact

177
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,230
info icons and stuff to, to go across.

178
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:12,730
So let's do grid template columns and let's say repeat and we'll repeat three times one fraction and

179
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,330
let's text a line to the center.

180
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,380
And I think that should be good.

181
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,520
And let's check it out.

182
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,480
All right.

183
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,730
Now, last thing is this right here.

184
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,460
So I want it centered.

185
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,500
I'm just.

186
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,860
Actually, we can just text center it.

187
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,000
I believe so.

188
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,750
Let's go under B and let's do ampersand C and let's do H one.

189
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,600
And we want to text a line to the center.

190
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,870
And then I'm going to raise the font size to four REM.

191
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,660
So let's say font size for REM.

192
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,570
And take a look.

193
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,090
There we go.

194
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,740
Let's starting next project.

195
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,090
And if you guys don't like this, you could put an image here, you could put a Google map or something,

196
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,290
whatever you like.

197
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,690
But I think that's pretty good.

198
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,600
So now we have all of our pages.

199
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,260
So in the next video, what I want to do is the responsiveness.

200
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,360
That actually doesn't look too bad.

201
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,670
There's not a lot that we have to do.

202
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,810
We want these too.

203
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,210
Obviously, this isn't good.

204
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,110
We want to stack like the testimonials and stuff like that.

205
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,070
This needs to be fixed.

206
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,630
These need to be stacked.

207
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,890
So in the next video, we're going to start to make this much more responsive.
