1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.300
All right.

2
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.270
In this video, we're going to look at the display property with the values inline block and inline

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.689
block.

4
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.040
Now, display is very important because that's actually how we implement Flexbox.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.200
That's how we implement the CSS grid.

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.420
But we're not going to get to that just yet.

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.250
We'll do that a little later.

8
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.710
So in this video, I want to show you how to turn block level elements into inline and vise versa and

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.270
also look at inline blocks.

10
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:34.350
So let's create a new file called let's call it ten, underscore inline, underscore block HTML.

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.910
And I'm just going to close this up.

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
And for the title, we'll say inline and block styling.

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.940
So in the body, I'm going to start off with a UL, I guess I don't even need to give it.

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.230
We're only have we're only going to have one UL so we'll just use that as a selector.

15
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.420
But this is going to be like a menu.

16
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.230
So we'll do in a tag in here.

17
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.520
So go just nowhere.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.340
And let's say that these are like categories.

19
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.240
Maybe it's, I don't know, a list of blog posts or something like that.

20
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840
So we'll just say like technology.

21
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.970
And for this one, let's say business and, I don't know, fashion.

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.410
All right.

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.120
So let's go ahead and open this up.

24
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.090
And by default list items are blocked level.

25
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.440
Right.

26
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.170
If we open up our, our tools and we, we use our element selector and we look at the list item, you

27
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.970
can see that it goes all the way across and it knocks the next one down so that that's a block level

28
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.690
element.

29
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.420
Now we can change that to be in line.

30
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.270
And in fact, this could be a way to create a horizontal menu, horizontal navigation.

31
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:06.430
So let's go up into our styling and let's grab on to the UL and let's set it to.

32
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.740
I'm sorry, not the ul the ly.

33
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.800
And let's set it to display inline and save.

34
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.730
So notice that now it's going this way and the bullets are no longer showing either.

35
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.610
Now, you probably want to spread these out a little bit.

36
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.330
So we could do like actually I'd probably put these on the, on the links.

37
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.820
So.

38
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.990
A.

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.740
And let's set padding right to ten pixels.

40
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.710
So it's going to spread them apart.

41
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.040
Actually, let's do 20.

42
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.140
All right.

43
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.400
So that's how we can change block level elements to inline.

44
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.380
Now let's take an inline element such as an image and make it block level.

45
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.770
And I'm going to give you a I'm going to show you a reason why you would do this.

46
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.000
So let's put a couple of line breaks in and we'll put in an image.

47
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.080
And inside of our folder we still have the IMG folder with the leaf PNG.

48
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.300
I'm going to use that.

49
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.790
So in here let's do dot slash so the current directory and go into the image directory and we want leaf

50
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.850
png for the alt.

51
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.410
I'll just say my image and save that.

52
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.710
Now this is an inline image or I'm sorry, an inline element if we grab the selector.

53
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.080
And we take a look.

54
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.670
You'll see how it doesn't go all the way across.

55
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.920
If I were to put another image in, actually, if I just duplicate this and save, it's going to go

56
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.460
next to it.

57
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.620
It doesn't get pushed on to the next line.

58
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.390
Now, I want to make this a block level element.

59
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.780
Let me get rid of one of these.

60
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.680
And the reason I want to do that is because I want to add margin auto, because I want it in the middle.

61
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.650
If I were to do that now.

62
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.250
If I were to do that now, nothing happens because we can't do this.

63
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.810
We can't do margin auto on an inline element.

64
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.700
It needs it needs to be block levels.

65
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.050
So we'll simply say display, block and save.

66
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.690
And now we can actually add margin auto.

67
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:27.310
I can't tell you how how confusing that was to me a long time ago when I was just trying to simply center

68
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.160
an image and margin auto just wouldn't work.

69
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.350
I didn't realize that the the element had to be display block to be able to do that.

70
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.610
All right.

71
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.780
So that's these are two situations where you would want to display something that's normally in line

72
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.980
or I'm sorry, normally block as inline and normally inline as block.

73
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.850
Now, let's say we want some divs here, some some box divs like we've been dealing with.

74
00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.520
Just going to put a couple of line breaks and let's do a class of box and an H three.

75
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.190
I'll just say heading and then let's put paragraph form 20

76
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.960
and let's say we have three of these.

77
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.320
Okay.

78
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.190
We'll go ahead and save that.

79
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.800
And let's say we want to align these going across.

80
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.540
Actually, you know what?

81
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.890
First, let's style them a little bit just so we can kind of see the outline and stuff like that.

82
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.530
So we'll do what we've been doing.

83
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.540
Just give them a quick background

84
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.080
border.

85
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.850
Actually, let's not even let's not even do a border.

86
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.510
Let's just do padding 20 pixels.

87
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:55.820
What else will do margin bottom 15 pixel and we want these to display horizontally.

88
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.460
So obviously we need a width, right?

89
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.520
So width, let's do 32%.

90
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.510
Now if I save that, we get that width, but they're still on top of each other because by default divs

91
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.040
are displayed as block.

92
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.470
So maybe we just need to do inline, right?

93
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.130
Let's do display inline and save.

94
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.480
And that doesn't work.

95
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.630
And the reason this isn't working and it'll show you right in here in vs code the this property width

96
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:37.130
is being ignored because display you can't use width on inline OC and the margin is also being ignored.

97
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.460
So the solution to this, if we want these to go across is to use inline block, which is basically

98
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.050
like a mix of both.

99
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.910
It goes horizontal, but it also allows us to add widths.

100
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.020
So let's change it to inline dash block and save.

101
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.470
Now this is getting knocked on to the next line because again, we have padding.

102
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.000
So that's getting added to the width because we didn't add the box sizing property.

103
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.320
So let's go up here.

104
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.090
And let's say box.

105
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.680
Actually, you know what?

106
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.740
Let's just put it.

107
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.530
That's you.

108
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.560
That's what I I'll usually do.

109
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.180
But we can just put it in here.

110
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.420
So box sizing, board, box and save.

111
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.180
And now you'll see that they're aligned side by side.

112
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.280
We can probably even do 33.

113
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.670
No, let's do like 32 point.

114
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.660
I don't think I mentioned that we can do decimals in percentages like that.

115
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.080
So that looks pretty cool actually.

116
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:48.340
But yeah, that's so we have display inline display block and display inline block.

117
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.660
And then later on when we get to flex, we can do display flex.

118
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.760
We can also do display grid.

119
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.230
And I'm going to I'm going to talk all about that in the different properties that are associated with

120
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.280
that as well.

121
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.990
But yeah, so that's that's that in the next video we're going to look at positioning.

122
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.890
There's different types of positioning, relative absolute fixed.

123
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:14.260
So I want to explain what the difference is between all of those in the next video.
