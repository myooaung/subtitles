00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.260
So now we're going to look at the box shadow property and box shadow actually takes a bunch of different

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.740
values.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.510
So we're going to go over those and we're going to just show you how to add some shadows to some some

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.950
divs, some elements here.

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:23.640
So let's create a new file called zero four, underscore box, underscore shadows, dot HTML and let's

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.729
add our boilerplate, say box shadows and style.

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.360
Now for the HTML, I'm just going to put in a container class

9
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.090
and let's do, let's do three boxes.

10
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.110
So we'll do dot box and then here, let's do put an H three, I'll just say heading and then a paragraph

11
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.620
I'll do lorem ten and then I'm just going to have three of these.

12
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.410
So we'll just go ahead and bring this down three times.

13
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.300
All right, let's open this with live server and should look like this.

14
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.350
So what I want to do is I'm going to use Flex to display the the boxes.

15
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.400
So we're going to take the container class and we're just going to say display flex.

16
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.280
So we have our boxes.

17
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.060
And then I'm just going to add some base styling to the box class as well before we get into the shadows.

18
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.800
So just some padding.

19
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.620
And then let's do some margin

20
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:48.080
and let's see, we'll do let's do a background of coral and we'll say color white.

21
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.250
All right.

22
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.600
So now we have some boxes.

23
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.550
I should probably make it a little wider.

24
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.200
So I'm going to close this up.

25
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.060
And we should be good.

26
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.890
Like right here.

27
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.970
Okay.

28
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.590
So we have boxes now.

29
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.840
We're going to add some shadows.

30
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.610
So I'm going to say box shadow.

31
00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.080
Now, like I said, there's different basically options or values that you can that you can use.

32
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.860
So I'm going to paste in a comment right above and we're going to put in three values here to to start

33
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.310
off with.

34
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.190
So the first is going to be the offset X next will be the offset Y and the last would be the color.

35
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.860
So you guys know what a shadow is.

36
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.240
It just comes off the box.

37
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.950
Now offset X is going to be on the x axis.

38
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.120
K X is always going to be horizontal.

39
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.380
Y is vertical.

40
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:51.170
So let's say for the x axis or I'm sorry, x offset, we want to do ten pixels and then for the Y we'll

41
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.700
do ten pixels as well.

42
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.550
And then next will be the color I'm going to use teal.

43
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.210
It's kind of kind of weird colors, but I just want it to stand out.

44
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.250
So let's go ahead and save that.

45
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.120
And as you can see, it added a box shadow.

46
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.620
It put ten pixels on the X axis, ten on the Y.

47
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.790
All right.

48
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.340
Now I'm going to be adding different box shadow values.

49
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.910
The next one, I want to add the blur radius because there's actually more that you can add.

50
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.300
And one of them is a blur radius.

51
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.550
So this is going to have four parameters.

52
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.900
So I'm going to copy what I did here, and this is just going to overwrite the one before it.

53
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.740
So the blur radius is going to be after the offset Y and before the color.

54
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.110
And the blur radius is just that.

55
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.870
It's going to add a blur effect to it and it's in pixels, so let's say 20 pixels and we'll save.

56
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.750
And now notice that the shadows have a blur.

57
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.600
And if these stick out too much for you, if you want them to be less, you could do like five pixels

58
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.530
and save, and now it's less and you can experiment with it.

59
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.210
Now you can also do negative values for the offsets.

60
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.790
What that will do is it'll add the shadow to the top and the left by default.

61
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.510
We have the shadow coming out of the right and the bottom.

62
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.910
But what we could do is just copy.

63
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.810
Let's copy this line here and let's just say negative five and negative five and save.

64
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.980
And now you can see that the shadow is actually on the left and the top.

65
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.220
So negative five on the X is going to go this way.

66
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.340
Negative five on the the Y is going to go up.

67
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.840
All right.

68
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.850
Now, we can also do a spread radius.

69
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.770
So how far do we want it to spread?

70
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.750
So I'm going to actually copy these comments again.

71
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.390
And I'm just putting these comments here.

72
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.510
So you know what each of these values are.

73
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.980
So let's grab this one here.

74
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.350
So we'll say let's do three pixels.

75
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.690
For the offset y offset x blur radius.

76
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.080
Let's do ten pixels and then.

77
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.200
Uh, let's see for the spread radius will do one pixel.

78
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.090
And then instead of using a solid color, I'm going to use our GBA.

79
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.290
So it's red green, blue alpha.

80
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.630
So the red, green, blue, we've went over this so I'm going to use zero for them all which will make

81
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.170
it black.

82
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.690
And then the alpha is a transparency.

83
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.040
So we're going to do 0.3 here and save.

84
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.510
So this is something I don't really use box shadows that much.

85
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.270
I don't particularly like the look of them.

86
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.740
Some people do.

87
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.880
If I were to use them, it would be something like this, something very, very subtle.

88
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:58.820
So as you and I would probably use our GBA because the the the less transparent, the lighter this is

89
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:06.590
if we were to do like 0.9 and save you can see it's much darker now you may like that kind of look,

90
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.300
but I don't I think it looks really 2002 ish.

91
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.850
So I don't use shadows that much.

92
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.530
But nevertheless, you should know how to how to add them.

93
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.420
All right, let's see.

94
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.000
We can also do an inset box shadow, meaning that it's not coming.

95
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.220
It's not on the outside, it's on the inside.

96
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.060
So I'm going to just paste this in here and let's say box shadow.

97
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.000
And we can specify in set and then we do the offset X, X and Y.

98
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:49.550
So I'm actually going to do negative three pixels and negative three so that it's at the left and the

99
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.180
top.

100
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.890
And let's do teal and save.

101
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.000
Uh.

102
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.580
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.190
Not at the left.

104
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.670
In the top.

105
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.990
It's going to be down here.

106
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.620
Because when you do inset, it's the opposite.

107
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.800
If I wanted it to be the left at the top, I would do positive values.

108
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.710
It shows you how much I actually use this.

109
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.170
But yeah, we can do that if we want.

110
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.480
It's now it's on the inset of the box.

111
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.090
It's not coming from the outside.

112
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.240
And then we can also do multiple shadows.

113
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:31.050
So to do that we could say like box shadow and we could do let's say three pixels, three pixels teal,

114
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.460
and then we could put a comma and let's do negative three pixels, negative three pixels, and we'll

115
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.530
do all of it's going to be very ugly.

116
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:48.090
But just to show you how this works, if I save, you can see now I have the teal box shadow right here

117
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.700
and then the olive up top so you can separate them with a comma if you want to add more.

118
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.710
And of course you could add a blur radius.

119
00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:05.370
If we do, let's do ten pixels here and ten pixels here and we'll save when we get our blur radius.

120
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.520
So that's going to be it for Box Shadows, guys.

121
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.920
Like I said, it's not something that I usually use.

122
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.720
I don't I don't really like the look of them, but that's how how you use them.

123
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.690
In the next video, we're going to take a look at text Shadows.
