1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,720
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,600
So we're going to jump right in and start to learn HTML.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,340
We're going to learn all the important HTML five tags attributes.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,780
We'll learn how to insert images into pages, links, forms, stuff like that.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,500
And I realized that a lot of you guys probably already know some of this stuff.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,050
So feel free to skip around, skip some videos.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,950
If you want to skip this whole section altogether, that's fine.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:31,110
Later on after section three, we'll be getting into like CSS grid and Flexbox and animations and more

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,220
difficult stuff.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,880
But again, I want this course to be very friendly for absolute beginners that have never even touched

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,110
HTML before.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,300
So let's go ahead and create a new folder for our HTML files.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,380
So we'll just go ahead and right click and say new folder and I'm going to rename this to HTML sandbox.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:00,600
And the idea here is for every section or every video, I should say, we're going to be touching on

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,590
a different topic.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,590
So for instance, we'll look at like links and images in a video.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:11,100
We'll look at forms and input and I want to have a separate file for each video and create a sandbox

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,890
that you can use as a reference if you need to go back to it later on to see how how a tag is structured

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,860
or what attributes it takes, things like that.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,150
So let's go ahead and open this up in VS Code and Visual Studio code and there's a few ways to do that.

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,200
If you're on windows, you should be able to right click and say open with code.

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,580
You can do it that way.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,880
If you're on a mac, you can drag it down to your VTS code icon in your bar down below or you can just

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,870
open up V's code and just click open folder and then search for it.

25
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,610
So mine's on my desktop.

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,700
There it is, HTML sandbox and I'll go ahead and open.

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,930
All right.

28
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,250
So we can close this up.

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,600
And now on the side you can see the HTML sandbox folder is open.

30
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,570
So let's go ahead and create our first HTML file.

31
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,250
And I'm basically going to create a file called indexed HTML oops, not comma but dot HTML.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,340
Now there's something really important for Windows users.

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,120
If you are seeing a dot txt here after the dot html, then you have to actually change something in

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,190
your your folder settings.

35
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,610
All right.

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,440
So I have a screenshot here.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,690
If you're on windows and you're seeing a dot txt, you should check this anyways to make sure that this

38
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,920
box is unchecked.

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,910
What you want to do is go to your Vue tab in your your file manager and go to options right here and

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,430
then click change folder and search options.

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,500
You'll get a box like this that pops up and you want to click the View tab and make sure that this is

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,160
unchecked.

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,980
This hide extensions for known file types.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,100
You want it to show the file extension.

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,690
So just just make sure that that's unchecked if you're on windows.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,110
All right.

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,900
So I just wanted to mention that so you don't run into problems.

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,240
So now we have an HTML file.

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,770
So what do we do with this?

50
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,800
We need to put in what's called an HTML tag.

51
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,260
So HTML files are full of HTML tags which surround content.

52
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,490
So let's take a look at how HTML tags are actually formatted.

53
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,520
So elements are surrounded in angle brackets.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,210
So basically this the the left standing greater than signs.

55
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,580
So the element here, for example, is an H one and different elements do different things.

56
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,810
This is a heading tag.

57
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,190
There's actually H one through H six and I'm going to go over that in another video.

58
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,070
But basically this will make this text much bigger.

59
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:38,730
This here is a paragraph tag, which is just for paragraphs, just regular sized text.

60
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:45,450
And notice that there's an opening tag and there's a closing tag or a start in an end tag and the end

61
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,550
tag has a forward slash.

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,220
So that's how you identify the ending tag.

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,540
Now there are some self closing tags for stuff that doesn't have content inside of it, like the H one

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,350
and the paragraph.

65
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,440
They have content inside the bar tag is actually just a line break, so it just kind of skips a line.

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,200
So there's no need to put any content inside of it.

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,190
So it's a self closing tag, it doesn't need an ending tag.

68
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,670
Now notice that this one has a slash in this one doesn't.

69
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:23,940
This is actually a remnant of XHTML, which is a derivative of HTML, and it's it's not used that much

70
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,450
anymore.

71
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,430
HTML five is definitely the standard.

72
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,340
That's what you want to learn in HTML five.

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,940
You could use either of these so you can use the HTML version with the line or the slash, but you don't

74
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,450
need to.

75
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,890
This would be just fine.

76
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,770
So this is how tags are structured.

77
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,380
So what I'm going to do now is just put in a couple of tags and I want to show you how to open an HTML

78
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,730
file in the browser.

79
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:53,160
So remember, tags have an opening angle bracket and we'll do an H one, which is a heading.

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,460
We'll close that H one and with V's code, every text editor is is different with VS code, it's going

81
00:04:59,460 --> 00:04:59,910
to end.

82
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,320
The tag for you.

83
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,660
So notice that the ending tag was put in automatically, which is very helpful.

84
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,620
And VTS code actually has a tool that comes pre-installed called emit which you can use to type really

85
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,550
fast HTML.

86
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,260
And I'm going to show you some some tips and tricks with Emit as we move along.

87
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,850
So let's put something in here.

88
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:28,620
We'll just say welcome to my website and then we're going to go on the next line and we're going to

89
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,310
put a paragraph tag.

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,500
Now remember, we have emit installed and with them we can just do P because we want a P, a paragraph

91
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,820
tag which is a P and then we can hit enter or tab.

92
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,960
You can do enter a tab and it'll actually complete it for us.

93
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,700
So it makes it very easy.

94
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,090
If we want an H to tag, we can do H to enter if we want.

95
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,900
So let's say an image tag, we can do img enter and that will actually give us the attributes that we

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,170
need.

97
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,870
I'm going to go over all this stuff later, so don't worry about it.

98
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,090
But just to show you that emit is very helpful and it allows you to write HTML very fast.

99
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:15,330
So in the paragraph, let's just say this is my very first website.

100
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,930
So we just have a heading tag and a paragraph.

101
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,400
Let's go ahead and save this.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,360
You can either go to file save or you can just do control s or command s on a mac and that will save

103
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,140
the file.

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,000
So now let's go ahead and minimize this and let's go into our HTML sandbox folder and you can see we

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,460
have our index HTML file.

106
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,980
Now you might have a different icon.

107
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,920
It's probably going to be whatever your default browser is, it could be Chrome or Safari or edge if

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
you're on Windows.

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,460
So you just want to open this with a browser.

110
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,220
So I'm actually going to right click and just say Open with Google Chrome, which is my default browser.

111
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,440
And there it is.

112
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,910
So you can see that the H one is a large heading and then the paragraph is just, just normal sized

113
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,570
text.

114
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,820
But this is in fact an HTML file.

115
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,750
You can see in the in the URL bar here, it gives us the full path.

116
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:20,370
Yours will probably be different, but mine is in my desktop in HTML sandbox and then index HTML.

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,050
Now of course, when you upload this to a web host, it'll be your domain name.

118
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,180
So let's say you registered my website, which of course is already taken, but we'll use that as an

119
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,960
example.

120
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,910
So this would be replaced.

121
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,950
This file, this stuff here would all be replaced with whatever your domain is.

122
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,280
Now, there's a reason that I called it index HTML.

123
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,880
And this name here is significant because when you call it indexed HTML, this is your home page.

124
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,890
If we were to upload this to a host with let's say my website is the domain.

125
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,220
If we go to my website, it's going to load the index page.

126
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,590
So it's very important to understand that whatever you want your home page, you want to call that index

127
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,320
and then any other page you can call whatever you want.

128
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,330
Like let's say you had an about page that listed your company info or something like that.

129
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:19,890
You could create an about HTML page, upload it, and then you would go to my website, slash about

130
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
HTML and that would load that.

131
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,430
But index is significant because that's always going to be your home page.

132
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,420
All right.

133
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:34,169
So now that we have created an HTML file and open it, opened it with Chrome, in the next video, I'm

134
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,120
going to show you how to correctly structure in HTML document because this isn't correct.

135
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,620
There's some other things that we need to add in order for it to be valid.

136
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,910
HTML document.

137
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,210
All right.

138
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,650
So we'll get into that next.
