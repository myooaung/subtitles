00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,650
All right, guys, in the last video, I gave you an assignment with some HTML of a form and a bunch

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,380
of classes and IDs with some hints inside your CSS and your styling.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,190
So in this video, I'm going to go through and I'm going to add my styling.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,470
And don't worry, if yours doesn't match the, you know, my exact CSS, that's fine.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,370
So let's start off with the asterisk here.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:32,910
So as the hint says, we might want to add border box for the box sizing property so the padding doesn't

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,600
affect the width.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
We also want to reset the margin and padding.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,800
That's pretty self explanatory.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:47,640
So let's go ahead and set border I'm sorry, box sizing to border box and let's clear out the margin

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,220
and padding on everything.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,820
So I'll save that now all the margin and padding is removed.

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,060
So we used railway for the font.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,300
As you can see it's already bringing its already brought in here.

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:14,010
So let's go ahead and actually I'll put that back, let's set the font family and we want to set that

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,740
to railway and sans serif

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,580
k we'll save that.

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,880
Now we have our font and the hint there is the background color which is that hexadecimal value.

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,020
So let's do background, do background or background color and we're going to set it to three four for

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,890
a72 and we'll save that.

21
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,700
There we go.

22
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,540
So we should also actually know we don't yeah, we'll set the color to white here.

23
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,490
We are going to have that white form wrap, but we can just change the font color in there.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,460
And then the last thing I want to do here is set the line height to let's do 1.8.

25
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,780
So let's see.

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,460
Underlines are ugly.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,190
So let's remove that.

28
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,900
Remember text decoration.

29
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,540
I want to set that to none.

30
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,670
That will get rid of all the underlines.

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,560
Let's go to our container.

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,310
So remember, we want to center the form.

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:33,120
So we want to use margin auto and we also want to set a max width and we may want to add some padding.

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
So let's, let's go ahead and do that.

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,480
So I'm going to set the margin to auto, but on the top and bottom, I'm going to set 30 pixels just

36
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:51,510
to move the the container down a little bit and we'll set a max width and it's a pretty thin or narrow

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,170
form.

38
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,950
So we're going to set this to 400 pixels.

39
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,960
K And then let's set the margin.

40
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,680
Oops, I'm sorry, not the margin.

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,280
We already did that one to set the padding to 20 pixels and save that.

42
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,270
So next we have the form wrap.

43
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,560
This is the white area around the form and the heading and all this.

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,480
So let's go ahead and do that.

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,950
Let's say background.

46
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,020
Let's set that to white and then for padding.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm going to set that to 15 pixels on the top and bottom and 25 on the left and right.

48
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:45,810
So since our text is white, our body text, we want to change the color of this form wrap text.

49
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,480
So let's change that to three, three, three.

50
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,420
Okay.

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,900
So that's our form wrap now.

52
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,430
Let's move on to the H one in paragraph.

53
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,070
We want to center these so we want to use the text align and we want to set that to center.

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,670
We don't want to center everything.

55
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,350
That's why I didn't add it to the form wrap.

56
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,320
We don't want these the inputs and stuff centered.

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,900
We just want the heading and the paragraph centered.

58
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,070
All right.

59
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,000
So each label input is wrapped in form group.

60
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,790
So what I'm going to do is just add a margin top to each form group.

61
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,460
So margin top, let's do 15 pixels just to push them, push each one down.

62
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,170
So for the label, we want that to be displayed as a block level element.

63
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:46,050
So let's use the display property, set that to block and I'm going to change the color to let's do

64
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,050
666 and save.

65
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,590
So for the inputs they should go all the way across by default they don't.

66
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,300
And then we also want them to have some padding because they're much too skinny right now.

67
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,890
So let's do that.

68
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,610
Let's say we want the width to be 100%.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,130
We want to go all the way across and let's add ten pixels padding to each input.

70
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:21,990
Let's also set the border to let's do DX one pixel solid and let's give it a kind of a rounded border.

71
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,940
So we'll say border radius and let's do just five pixels for each one.

72
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,630
So that makes these the inputs look much cleaner.

73
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:31,970
All right.

74
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,030
Next, we have the button.

75
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,040
So button should wrap across 100% and display is block background color is this.

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,610
So let's first of all, just grab that and set the background to that.

77
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,180
Okay.

78
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:55,390
We'll get rid of that and let's set the display to block.

79
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,870
Okay.

80
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,550
So we'll save that and then we want it to go all the way across.

81
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,190
So let's do a width of 100%.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,930
So now you can see it goes all the way across.

83
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,450
We need some padding here.

84
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,190
So let's do padding ten pixels all the way around.

85
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,520
We want to bring it down from the from the top input.

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,500
You can see it's kind of stuck to it right now.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,080
So let's do a margin top.

88
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,040
Remember, margin is the outside.

89
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,250
So we'll do 20 pixels, push it down.

90
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,370
Let's also make the color of the text white.

91
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,520
So we'll say color

92
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,670
white.

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,090
And what else let's do.

94
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,970
Uh, let's see.

95
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,170
I think that's.

96
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:41,800
That's good.

97
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,780
Let's change the pointer to a cursor.

98
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,140
Notice that if we go over a button, it doesn't change to a cursor.

99
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,310
We want that to happen.

100
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,170
So we'll say cursor pointer.

101
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,990
And now when we have her over it, we get the the cursor or I'm sorry, the pointer.

102
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,210
All right.

103
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,010
So let's see, what do we have next?

104
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,150
The hover.

105
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,850
So I want it to to have a kind of a different color or just get a bit lighter on the hover.

106
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,120
And you can see I actually gave you the hexadecimal value here.

107
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,140
So we're just going to go ahead and add the background.

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,240
And make it that color.

109
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,140
So now if I hover over it, it actually gets darker.

110
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,370
All right.

111
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,680
So the bottom text, which is this right here, we want to make that smaller.

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,800
So the default, remember, is 16 pixels.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,240
So let's set the font size here to 13 pixels.

114
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,210
And I'm also going to move it down a bit by doing a margin top of 20 pixels.

115
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,260
Next thing is the footer.

116
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,920
So this right here, we want this to be centered.

117
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,670
We also want to push it down a little bit.

118
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,530
So let's say text align center.

119
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,000
Oops.

120
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,770
And let's do.

121
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,440
Let's see the colors.

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,000
Find for the text.

123
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,120
Let's do margin dash top and let's move it down ten pixels.

124
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,950
So now it's centered.

125
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,980
It's moved down.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,230
Last thing is the link.

127
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,910
So I gave you the color for the link.

128
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,350
So we're going to change that.

129
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,230
Let's say color and we want oops, what happened?

130
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,000
There we go.

131
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,020
So paste that in and save and that's it.

132
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,840
So don't get discouraged if you don't have this exact CSS or if you couldn't do it or if you can only

133
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,030
do part of it, that's absolutely fine.

134
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,429
If you if you're just getting into CCIS, then this is kind of a tough project.

135
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,710
So we're going to move on.

136
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,680
And in the next section, what I want to do is take what we've learned in the HTML section as well as

137
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,790
this one, and build an actual website, an actual project.

138
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,270
So we're going to build a small hotel website that has a home page and about page, contact page, and

139
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,340
we're going to style the navigation menu and add some background images.

140
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,230
So we'll actually get to put something together with everything that we've learned so far.

141
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,560
All right.

142
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,180
So I'll see you in the next section.
