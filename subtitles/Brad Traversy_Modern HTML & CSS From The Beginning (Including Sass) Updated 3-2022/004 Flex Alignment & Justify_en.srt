1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,780
Okay.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,330
So now I want to get into alignment and justify properties.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:14,280
So I'm going to take everything from the Flex Base Basics file and copy it and create a new file called

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,960
17 Underscore.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:24,060
And we'll call this flex aligned HTML and let's paste that in and save.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,450
And we, of course, we have to open up live server with this page now and I'm going to get rid of I'm

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:38,880
going to keep all the same HTML but get rid of this stuff that the specific items and let's see we'll

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,950
keep flex one so if I save this they'll just all be even and we can get rid of this flex wrap and we'll

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,360
go ahead and uncomment this.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,190
And we want this to be a row, which is the default anyway.

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,000
Now align items is the property that I want to look at first and it's put on the container, not on

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
the items themselves because it applies to all of the items.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,360
Now remember, when it's in a row like this, the horizontal axis is the main access and then going

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,700
this way is the cross axis.

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,020
What align items does is it aligns them on the cross axis.

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,750
So if it's a row, it's going to be this way.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,030
So let's go ahead and say align items and let's go ahead and add center.

18
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,430
Now notice that nothing changed.

19
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,470
And that's because the height of the flex container is only the height of the content within it.

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,420
We don't have a specific height.

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,090
In fact, I can go ahead and add just so you can see this better.

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,210
Let's do a background color, I guess.

23
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,160
Yeah, we'll just do gray.

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,490
So that's the flex container, that's the height.

25
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,360
So if we add a height to this of let's say 50 V H, which is viewport heights, half the browser.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,430
Now this is the height of the flex box or the flex container, and we've aligned the items to the center

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,320
on the cross axis.

28
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:19,230
Now, as far as values for this, we have center, we have we can do flex start, which is where it

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,340
was at the beginning.

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,410
You can also do flex end.

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:30,810
So it makes it really easy to align things, even if it's just like a showcase and you have maybe some

32
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,860
headings, a heading or a paragraph button, just a div with some content.

33
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,530
It's very easy to align things without having to use margin and padding and all that.

34
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:48,120
Now if this was a column, so I'm going to change the the direction to column.

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,620
Now notice that it's, it's going this way.

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,450
It's aligning it to the end here horizontally because when it's a column, this is the cross axis and

37
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,440
this is the main axis and line items is always on.

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:17,850
We just put this so cross axis a line and if I change this a line items to center, then it's going

39
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,950
to be centered this way because remember, it's on the cross axis and when it's a column, this is the

40
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,030
cross axis.

41
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,240
And one thing I didn't show you in the last video with like the flex grow and all that is that in a

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,050
column.

43
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:38,790
So if I set Flex one, let's just comment that out then it's just going to be the regular the regular

44
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,070
height of the items.

45
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:51,810
But we can set flex one or I could take item two and I could set Flex to like that.

46
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,200
And then that's going to be so you can do the same thing in the column fashion.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,450
I just I didn't show you that in the last video.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,120
So back to align items, let's set that to row.

49
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,560
So we have flex, start, flex and center.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
We also have stretch.

51
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,340
So if I do stretch, it's just going to stretch all the items so that they're all the height of the

52
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,180
container.

53
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,360
But yeah, that's that's a line items.

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,620
Now we also have justified content which is going to be the main axis align.

55
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,930
So let's see, main axis align and let's say justify content center.

56
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,730
Now you can't really tell here because I mean these are we have a set to flex one.

57
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,250
So let's comment that out and let's set this to width or we don't even need a width.

58
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,110
Let's just comment out flex one.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,200
So now you can see that it's centered on the main axis because we have justify content.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,610
We could do flex start which will put it there.

61
00:04:59,610 --> 00:04:59,820
We could.

62
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,000
You flex and which you'll put at the end.

63
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,660
Now we have some other cool options here too, like space around.

64
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,860
So it takes what it does is it takes whatever the remaining space is.

65
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,940
And these could be any width, but it just distributes it around the items, including the sides.

66
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,180
Now, if you don't want the space on the sides, we also have space between and now.

67
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,980
There's no space on the side.

68
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,090
We just have everything distributed in the in the middle of the items.

69
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,580
And it doesn't matter again how many you have.

70
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,020
You put some more here and it's just going to distribute that space in between.

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,520
All right.

72
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,330
So pretty cool.

73
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,520
Very, very easy to to do.

74
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,490
And obviously, if we change this to column.

75
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,930
Then justify content is going to be this way because it's on the main axis.

76
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,200
So we have space between each one.

77
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:10,100
If we wanted to do center or if we wanted to do flex, let's do flex end and it'll align it this way

78
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,150
down at the bottom.

79
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:19,640
So there's going to be a lot of times that you see display, flex, align items center and justify content

80
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,400
center because just I mean, you just center a lot of things in your layouts and that's one of the easiest

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,480
ways to do it.

82
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,110
So yeah, now we can also align each one individually if we want.

83
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,660
So let's change this back to a row.

84
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,270
Not that I don't know what that is.

85
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,710
Call Rome.

86
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,070
Let's change that back to a row.

87
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,800
So we have everything centered.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:57,410
Now, if I want to take, let's say item one and there's a property called Align Self and let's set

89
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:03,530
that to Flex Start, they're all set to center, but I'm going to take just the first one and put that

90
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:13,490
to Flex Star and then I'll take let's take item three and let's say align self and let's set that one

91
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:23,750
to flex end so you can take each one and you can align them differently than the the main alignment

92
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,190
of align items.

93
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,860
So those, those properties are really important, especially these two.

94
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,260
So we'll be using them quite a bit through the course.

95
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,260
But that's the main idea of Flexbox.

96
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:44,270
It's just aligning things in rows or columns and centering them, and it just makes things much, much

97
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,800
easier than floats with margins and padding and percentages.

98
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,720
And, and you'll see when we get into our projects how much easier this makes it.

99
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,260
All right.

100
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,800
So that's it.

101
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,150
I'll see you in the next one.
