1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,420
All right.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,560
So in this video, we're going to talk about the box model and we're going to talk about margin and

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,010
padding, as well as what a CSS reset is.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,190
We're also going to look at some of the default styling of the browser.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:19,560
So let's create a new file here called zero six, underscore box, underscore model HTML and let's put

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,060
in our head body tags.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,580
And for the title, we'll say box model, margin and padding.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,580
And let's put in our style.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,670
And then for the HTML, I'm going to put in a div with the class of box, which is just going to have

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,500
an H three, I'll say box one and then a paragraph with 20 words.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,760
So alarm 20.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,540
All right.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,550
And then I'm just going to copy this down.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,330
So shift option or shift alt and then down we'll copy it.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,930
And let's just we'll just change this to box two and they both have the same class, which is which

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,830
is absolutely fine.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,810
We're just going to style them the same way.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,590
So let's save this and open it with live server, open it in Chrome and I want to open up our dev tools.

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,680
So on Mac, it's command option I on windows it's F 12 or you can use your your menu.

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,890
So remember, this is the HTML over here.

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,360
This is the CSS.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,790
So I'm actually going to just click on the div right here, the first div which will give us the CSS

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,180
which by default just has a display block because remember divs by default are displayed as a block,

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,980
meaning they go all the way across.

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,740
And right here you're going to see a diagram of the box model, which makes it a lot easier to explain.

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,960
So there's basically four layers.

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,460
There's the element itself, which we can put a height and width property on by default.

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,950
The width is all is all the way across and the height is going to be however much content is in it.

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,130
If I add a bunch of more paragraphs, it's going to extend more or I can just set a height and see this.

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,520
Then we have padding, so we have spacing we can put here.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,870
Then we have the border.

32
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,700
We looked at the border properties in the last video and then we have the margin.

33
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:12,360
Now the margin in padding, the spacing is some people get this confused when they first start.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,250
But all you really have to remember is the margin is the outside of the element or the outside of the

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,700
border.

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,410
The padding is the inside.

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:28,020
So to give you an example, let me just add some styling for the box.

38
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,440
So we're going to say box and we're going to say background.

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:41,160
We're going to give it a color of light gray and then we'll give it a border, let's say two pixels,

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,620
gray, solid.

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,840
And we went over the stuff in the last video.

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,100
So now you can get a better picture of of the box model.

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,900
So we have the content, then we have the padding and then we have the border.

44
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,270
And then outside of the border is the margin.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,410
Now notice that there's some spacing here, there's spacing here, there's spacing here, and there's

46
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,850
even spacing around the sides.

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,190
That's because the browser has default margin and padding on certain elements.

48
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,460
So if we grab the selector tool here and I hover over the H three, you'll see that there's some orange

49
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,560
areas here where the space is.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,760
That's the margin.

51
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,420
And if I go over the the paragraph, we have some margin and even the body if I go right.

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,340
Actually, it's not going to let me show it.

53
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,160
But anyways, the body has some some margin as well.

54
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,760
So let's click on this, the three, and then over here you'll see the styling.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,750
So this margin block start margin block end is basically margin top and bottom and it has a value of

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,110
one.

57
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,660
M and M is a relative unit.

58
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,660
It's relative to the number of pixels of the font size of its element of its parent container.

59
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,840
And if you don't understand what that means, don't worry about it.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,510
If you want to see the computed pixels, you can actually click on computed and it'll show you that

61
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:11,380
the font size and the margin on the top and bottom for the H three is going to be it's 18 seven two

62
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,910
pixels by default.

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,149
If we click on the paragraph, you'll see that it has a margin on the top and bottom of 16 pixels.

64
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:25,660
If I click on the body, you can see it has a margin on all sides of eight pixels and there you can

65
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,580
see the orange around the whole body.

66
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,690
So these are all default browser styles and there's other elements as well, like a UL and unordered

67
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:42,190
list and in ordered list, they both have margin on the top and bottom and they have a padding on the

68
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,500
left of, I believe, 40 pixels.

69
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,740
So this is just stuff that that you're going to run into and you can overwrite those values.

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,390
Obviously, like I could set for paragraph, I could set margin to zero and get rid of that.

71
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,310
And I can actually show you that real quick.

72
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:13,750
So if I say box paragraph and set margin to zero and save that, we go back.

73
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,960
Now, if I you'll see that there's no orange when I hover over the paragraph and if we look at the styles

74
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,640
you can still see the default.

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,100
But this overwrites it what I just did.

76
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,240
Now if you want to take away all the default styling, you can do that with what's called a reset.

77
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:40,120
So I'm going to get rid of that what I just did and I'm going to create a CSS reset and there's different

78
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,080
ways to reset.

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,730
You can reset margin and padding font size borders.

80
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,930
There's actually like popular reset files that you can use.

81
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:56,020
Like Eric Myers has a reset file that's pretty popular, but the easiest way to do it is just to use

82
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:04,390
an asterisk which selects everything and then just say you want margin to be zero and padding to be

83
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,080
zero.

84
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,070
So we're just setting the margin and padding to zero for everything.

85
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,180
So let's save that.

86
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,500
And this is on all sides, top to bottom, left and right.

87
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,720
So if we go back now, notice there's no spacing anywhere, not even on the body, not even on the side

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,290
here.

89
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:26,260
And if I grab the selector tool, there's no orange, there's no green, which is padding, there's

90
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,670
just no spacing at all.

91
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,540
Now it's up to you on if you want to use a reset or not.

92
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,110
I do.

93
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,460
Sometimes it really depends on the layout, but if you do use it, you have to remember to add all of

94
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,330
your your your own margin and padding because now if I add another paragraph under this one, it's going

95
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,380
to be right next to it.

96
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,890
It's not going to have that that default spacing that the browser gives it.

97
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,030
Same with the heading.

98
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,040
Usually you'll want some space here.

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,210
It's not there anymore.

100
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,210
We'll have to create it if we're going to keep the reset.

101
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,170
All right.

102
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:05,530
So I just wanted to kind of explain how the default margin in padding works, also the structure of

103
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,550
the box model.

104
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,720
So now let's look at some properties that have to do with margin and padding.

105
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,450
So I'm going to add a width to the box as well.

106
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:23,740
Let's do with 500 pixels and let's say I want padding on all sides.

107
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,250
So I'm going to put a comment right here and I'm going to say padding on all sides.

108
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,040
So we would just use padding and then we could do, let's say 20 pixels.

109
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,640
So this will put 20 pixels on all sides.

110
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,940
You can see top and and notice the green one.

111
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,280
If I use the the element selector and we hover over it, we see the green, that's actually the padding.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,800
And you can see that it's 20 pixels on all sides for both, obviously, because they're both they both

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,040
have the class of box, which is what we styled.

114
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:06,580
Now, when we add padding, if we if we keep the box sizing the way it is now, the box sizing property,

115
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,100
it adds to the width of the entire thing.

116
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,940
All right.

117
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:19,030
And to just give you an example, if I say padding 120 and we take a look, the width of this is no,

118
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,070
it's not 500 pixels.

119
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,240
It added to that.

120
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,610
It's 500 pixels plus the padding.

121
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,770
And that's not usually how you want to do it.

122
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,940
Usually you want to keep the.

123
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,140
With at the right width and then just add the padding.

124
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:39,929
So to do that, you want to add to the asterisk right here, a box sizing property and you want to set

125
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,520
that to border box.

126
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,710
So now if I save that and we go back, we still have 120 pixels padding, but the box is still 500 pixels.

127
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,490
It just pushes it inside as opposed to adding it.

128
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,850
So let's put that back to 20.

129
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,900
I just made it that big.

130
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,950
Just so just so you could tell that the width was larger.

131
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,130
So we'll put that back and the next thing I want to do is show you margin, because right now there's

132
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,860
no margin and these are kind of stuck together.

133
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,600
So margin is going to be spacing around the border on the outside of the border.

134
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:26,190
So let's add, let's say margin on all sides and we'll say margin 20 pixels.

135
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,550
And if we take a look and we use our element selector, see the orange, that's the margin.

136
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,920
The green is the padding, the orange is the margin.

137
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,540
In fact, if I click on one of the divs and we look at the box model, it'll show us all the values.

138
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,000
20 The border is two pixels, the padding is 20 and then the width here.

139
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,630
So just remember that margin outside padding inside and it doesn't matter if you have a border property

140
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,440
set or not.

141
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,550
It's still it's still going to be relative to the box model.

142
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,260
All right.

143
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,100
Now, these properties that we've used, map padding and margin with just one value, it's putting the

144
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,330
same on all sides.

145
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,470
But there may be cases where you want different values on different sides.

146
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:23,400
So I'm going to go down here and let's say padding per side so we can use padding top.

147
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,430
So let's say on the top we want ten pixels and let's do padding.

148
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,370
Bottom.

149
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,320
Actually, I'm going to do top.

150
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,340
Let's do right.

151
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,030
And I'm doing this in a certain order for a reason and I'll show you that in a minute.

152
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,260
So padding, right?

153
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,480
Let's say we want 20 pixels.

154
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,540
Let's do patting bottom.

155
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,670
We'll do ten just like the top and then left.

156
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,200
We'll do 20.

157
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,940
Just like the right.

158
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,280
Now, this is going to overwrite this, and that's something that I really haven't talked about yet.

159
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,390
When you have the same properties, the the ones that are further down are going to overwrite the ones

160
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,380
that are further up.

161
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,190
So all this padding here is going to overwrite this one.

162
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,790
So even if I leave them without commenting, the so this is going to take effect.

163
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,100
So let's take a look.

164
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,140
And you can see now there's less padding.

165
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,660
If you look at the green, there's ten pixels on the top and bottom, there's 20 on the left and right.

166
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:33,490
So if you want to do this but you don't want to have four different properties, you can you can shorten

167
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,380
this just like with with most cases, like you saw with the with the border and the background, there's

168
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,610
there's short hands.

169
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,690
So let's say padding, shorthand.

170
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,420
Now, when we do this, there's a certain order to the values.

171
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,590
So it's going to be this just like I did right above top right, bottom left.

172
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,260
That's why I did it in this order.

173
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,500
So if we say padding, it's going to be in that order.

174
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,380
So let's do top ten pixels, right?

175
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,620
20 pixels, bottom ten pixels left 20 pixels.

176
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,060
So if I save that and we take a look, it's going to be the same thing.

177
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,070
So this is just a shorthand for this does the exact same thing.

178
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:27,040
Now we can make this even shorter because the top and bottom and the left and right are the same.

179
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,400
Top and bottom or ten, left and right or 20.

180
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,420
So let's say padding, shorthand.

181
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,510
So we can actually just have two values.

182
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,940
One will be top, bottom, one will be left right.

183
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,540
So we'll say padding top and bottom.

184
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,190
We want ten left and right.

185
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,240
We want 20.

186
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,610
So this is the same exact thing as this, which is the same exact thing as this.

187
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,170
So we're just shortening it up.

188
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,230
So if we look at it, we get the same exact thing.

189
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,190
We have the ten on the top and bottom, 20 on the left and right.

190
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,870
So hopefully that makes sense.

191
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,210
You can add padding all these different ways.

192
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,800
Now with margin, it's the same exact thing, same exact thing.

193
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm actually going to just copy all this and change it to margin.

194
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,450
So margin, top, right, left bottom, this same thing, same order.

195
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:27,580
So let's grab this and let's put this down here and just change this to margin.

196
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,780
Change these to margin.

197
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,170
Uh, margin.

198
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:46,710
Okay.

199
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,030
So that's going to do same exact thing.

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,050
Save that if we take a look now we have ten pixels, top and bottom margin, 20 left and right margin.

201
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,840
So yeah, I think that that's all I want to do here.

202
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,460
One other thing.

203
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,650
Usually since we did a reset, we'd probably want to separate the the H three and the paragraph a little

204
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:08,890
bit.

205
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:20,290
So what I would do is just add box H three and I'd probably add like padding bottom ten pixels, five

206
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,940
pixels, whatever it may be.

207
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,710
Oops, what happened here?

208
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,010
Inside, I'm inside this style.

209
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,100
So let's check that out.

210
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,440
And now we have spacing under the heading.

211
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,570
All right, so that's it, guys.

212
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,920
In the next video, we're going to start to talk about floats so we can align things.

213
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:45,130
Now, ultimately, when you when you align stuff, you're usually going to want to use Flexbox or CSS

214
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:51,160
grid, but we're not going to talk about that stuff just yet because that that stuff is a little more

215
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,200
complicated and it's much newer.

216
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:00,340
I want you to get a handle on just old fashioned floating before you start to deal with flex and grid

217
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,420
and stuff like that.

218
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,810
All right.

219
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,520
So I'll see you in the next video.
