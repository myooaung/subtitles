1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,810
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,350
So now we're going to take a look at media queries with the grid.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,510
So let's create a file called zero six.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,010
Underscore grid.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,020
Underscore media queries dot HTML.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,010
And we'll put our style tags.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,150
So I'm going to create the the markup first.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,800
So we're going to have a container of grid and then let's do an item.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:37,090
And in H three inside here we'll just say heading and then a paragraph with the text.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,930
We'll just do lorm 15 and then I'm going to copy this down.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,660
I want four of them, so I'm going to do three more.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:44,890
All right.

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,310
And we'll go ahead and save this and open it with live server.

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,750
So let's start off with adding a grid.

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:05,890
So we'll take the parent element and we'll set it to display grid and let's say grid dash template columns.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:12,610
And we're going to do a repeat, let's say repeat for auto.

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:14,460
Okay.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:23,810
So that's going to set them to basically a four column grid and we'll do a grid gap of one REM.

19
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,830
All right.

20
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:31,460
Now, the way that that this is naturally is it's just it's it's four columns, no matter what, no

21
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,690
matter how small.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:42,170
And what I would like to do is have it so that when we get to a certain point, like maybe tablet size

23
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,040
seven, 68 or so, we change it to two columns.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,670
And then when we get to mobile, it's stacked, meaning that it's just one column.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
So this is pretty easy to do.

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,450
We can just add in media query.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,640
So let's say we want this to be for Max with 768 pixels.

28
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,990
We need that.

29
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,120
And then we're going to simply take our grid element and we're going to say We want grid.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,040
Actually, I'll just copy this here and let's say for max width.

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,460
768 we want to.

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,370
So we'll say repeat to auto.

33
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,260
Now, once they hit 768, you can see that it goes to two.

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,300
All right.

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,290
And then we'll just add another one.

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,240
So I'll copy this and we'll say at 500.

37
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,270
So basically smartphones.

38
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,060
I simply want one fr actually, you know what I'm going to do instead of auto, I'm just going to do

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,040
one fr like that.

40
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,150
So we get the same result on big screens and then basically tablet size and then we get to smartphone

41
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,590
sized stacks.

42
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,550
So it's as easy as that to use media queries with the grid.

43
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,540
Now we also have grid template areas which we went over in the last video.

44
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,820
So I want to show you what we would do in that case.

45
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,830
So I'm actually going to open up the file from the last video and just add to that.

46
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,300
So let's go ahead and open this with live server.

47
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,390
So right now, even if we go down to mobile size, that doesn't look very good.

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,240
So all we would have to do is add a media query.

49
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,990
So we'll say add media.

50
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,250
And I'm just going to do let's see, let's see what this looks like at like 768.

51
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,920
So it's okay that that's fine for like a tablet size, but for smartphones, we want to change it.

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,560
So let's do a max width of, let's say 500 pixels.

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,820
And what we would do is just change up the grid template areas.

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:58,660
So we'll take this and if we want to stack everything, we can simply have one column.

55
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,950
So we'll do header.

56
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,840
Content.

57
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:12,300
Oops I forgot to put the the select the selector which is going to be our container of grid.

58
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,280
Or is it.

59
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,420
Wait, no, it's container.

60
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,110
Sorry.

61
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,149
So container.

62
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,660
And then I'm going to paste that in and we'll say header.

63
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,070
So we only want one.

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,270
We want these to be stacked.

65
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,220
So header content and then we'll add in here sidebar.

66
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:39,330
We'll do box one, box to box three and footer.

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,430
So it's only one column.

68
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,310
And again, this is this is visually representative of what we actually want to display in our browser.

69
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,120
So let's save.

70
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,460
And now everything is nicely stacked.

71
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,960
So when it hits 500 pixels, everything stacks nicely.

72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,580
So pretty easy.

73
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,920
And we're going to be getting more into this in our project, which we're going to get into in the next

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,640
section.
