1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,480
All right.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,730
So our homepage is pretty much done aside from the responsive stuff that we're going to do our media

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,870
queries later on.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,070
So we're going to start on the about and the article HTML page.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:22,260
So let's open up about HTML and we're going to be using the nav bar, the footer, that stuff from the

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,950
index page.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,070
So I'm going to copy the whole index page and paste that in about and then we're going to go up to the

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,850
top here.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,570
Let's change the title here to just about and let's remove the current.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,000
We have a class of current on the link here.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,780
We're going to move that to the to the about page class current.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,470
We're not going to have a showcase.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,120
We can actually get rid of everything in between the nav bar and the footer.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,160
So we'll get rid of all that stuff.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,480
And if I save and we go to about we just have the the header in the footer.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,860
So this is basically your boilerplate for any other page you want to create on this website.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,140
A lot of page, a lot of page.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,350
A lot of times what I will do when I'm building something like this is I'll take this and, and name

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,480
it like boilerplate dot HTML.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,390
That way, if I need to create another page, I have all this.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:15,960
All right.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,170
And when later on, when you get into actual programming, whether it's PHP or Node.js or whatever it

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,290
may be, if you get into front end frameworks like React and Vue.js, you're not going to have to copy

24
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,220
everything like this.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,410
You can have what are called partials, or if you're using a front end frame framework, you can have

26
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,440
components that you can simply include into your file.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,560
That way, you don't have to do all this for every single page.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,430
All right.

29
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,450
Now we're going to have a section here.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,330
So let's say section, and we're going to give it an ID of a boat.

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,170
And then inside here we're going to have a container.

32
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,320
So that's just going to align everything to the middle.

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,870
But then we're also going to have a page container, which is going to be our grid container and this

34
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,110
page container we're going to use on any inner pages.

35
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,570
So the about any article HTML.

36
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,800
And if you wanted to create more pages, we could use this as well.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,730
It's going to set it up.

38
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,430
It's going to it's going to create a grid layout so that we have a main area and then anything else

39
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,430
we add will just be sidebar widgets basically.

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:32,130
So in this page container, let's create our first grid item, which is going to be an article and we're

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,860
going to give this a class of card because we want to have that white background with the padding.

42
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,450
And then let's do an H one and I'm going to give this a class of LX heading because I want this to be

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,520
a larger heading than the normal.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,230
And let's just say about our organization.

45
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:58,950
And then we're going to do, let's do a paragraph, paragraph with Lorem 50 and then let's do another

46
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:06,090
paragraph still within the article and we'll say Lorem 100 like that.

47
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,590
Let's do Lauren 150.

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,710
So next thing is going to be an aside.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,120
So let's say aside and this is just going to be that little join our club thing.

50
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,730
So I'm going to give this a class of card, but I also want it to be read or have the primary color.

51
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,540
So I'm going to do BG Dash primary.

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,940
I should probably put class in here.

53
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:44,850
So class card and BG primary and then let's do an H two and let's say join our club.

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,990
By the way, I have no idea what the club is.

55
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,050
It's just an example of, of a content widget.

56
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,970
So let's put paragraph here, let's do lorem ten.

57
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:03,760
And underneath that we'll just put in a tag with the class of BTN and let's do a dark button.

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,710
So we'll do b t n.

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,270
That's to beat and dash dark.

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,490
And then I also want this to go all the way across its container.

61
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:20,560
So let's add BTN block, which I'm about 90% sure we added in the CSS already, but I'm going to have

62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,040
to check.

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,140
So let's say join now.

64
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,320
Yeah, if we look at style CSS, I just want to make sure that I added this BTN block.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,560
Yep.

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,570
So it's going to go 100% across.

67
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,190
It's going to be displayed block.

68
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,110
All right.

69
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,340
So I think that's it.

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,630
Let's save this.

71
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,210
And basically, we just have we just have our content all on one line here.

72
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:49,210
We want to set this to a grid and we want to have this be the main part and then this be in the sidebar.

73
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,710
And then anything else we add.

74
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,870
I want to be in the sidebar as well.

75
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,300
So let's, let's go to our style sheet and there's nothing really we have to add that specific to the

76
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,940
about page, just the page container.

77
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,250
So we're going to go down.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
Let's put this.

79
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't want to put it as a utility.

80
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,360
Well.

81
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,060
I guess I guess it kind of is a utility because we're going to use it in multiple page, multiple pages.

82
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,570
So yeah, we'll put it right below here, below the list.

83
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,320
So let's say page, dash container.

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,380
And I'm just going to put a comment here and say that this is the inner page container or grid container.

85
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:45,850
So let's display grid and then we're going to do grid dash template.

86
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:55,820
Dash columns, and the split that I want to use is going to be five far and too far.

87
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,460
And you can experiment with how how thin or or wide you want the sidebar to be.

88
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,100
But I'm going to use that now how this is now with this stretching all the way down.

89
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,770
I mean, it's going to do this because it's just it's a five far too far and there are going to be the

90
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,700
same height.

91
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,680
You may want to do this.

92
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,210
You may want to add another like piece of content in the same box.

93
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,160
But what I want to do is have this be completely separate box from the next one.

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,760
All right.

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,500
So it's up to you how you want to lay it out.

96
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,940
You might want to do something like this, but let's let's go and say we want the page container and

97
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,010
we want the first child.

98
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,570
So basically the main article.

99
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:47,390
So I'm just going to say asterisk, colon, first child and I want to span this across rows.

100
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,170
So I'm going to say grid dash row.

101
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:58,640
We want to start at one and then we want to span let's span three and save.

102
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:06,200
So now it's just going to span down three and whatever we put next is going to go right here and then

103
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,920
right here.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,470
And if you want to have more than three, then you could you could increase the span and just have it

105
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,540
span as long as you want.

106
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,560
All right.

107
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,640
So let's.

108
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,470
This is all very close together.

109
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,870
So we're going to add some margin on the main container for the top and bottom.

110
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,760
So we'll say two REM, top and bottom zero left and right.

111
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,740
And then let's also do a grid gap.

112
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,130
So we have some space in between the actual grid items.

113
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,440
So grid gap is going to be 1.5 REM and save.

114
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,040
And there we go.

115
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,230
So now we have our margin top and bottom here.

116
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,110
We also have a grid gap and you'll see that when we create our article page, we're going to have two

117
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,370
boxes on the side.

118
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,930
So the next thing I add would be right here.

119
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,570
Next one would be here.

120
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,150
And then after that, it would go down over here.

121
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,740
Because remember, we're only spanning three and you could put this to whatever you want.

122
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,110
Like if I put it to six, it'll allow us to have six on the side, but I'm just going to use three for

123
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,710
now.

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,760
That's fine.

125
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,600
So we have our home page, we have our about page.

126
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,410
In the next video, we're going to start to work on our article page.
