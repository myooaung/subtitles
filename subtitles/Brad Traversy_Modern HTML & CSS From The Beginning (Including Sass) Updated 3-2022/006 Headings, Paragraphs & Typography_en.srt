1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,830
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,450
Now we're going to look at some tags that have to do with topography.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,820
Some of the stuff we already looked at, like like the H one tag, which is a heading tag.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,770
We'll look at some of the other headings and also paragraph and the strong tag and stuff like that.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:20,970
So let's create a new file here called zero four Underscore Topography dot HTML.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,220
And I'm going to show you some other stuff as well, some little tips and tricks when it comes to VS

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,790
code.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:34,590
So let's put in our our boilerplate, which is we'll do exclamation tab and that puts in all of our,

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,820
our structure here.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,130
And for the title, let's change this.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:45,030
We'll just say like headings, paragraphs, typography.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,320
Oops.

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,160
And then we're going to go down to the body here and I'm going to put a comment.

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:00,070
Now, if you want to just put a comment like an empty comment, you can just do control and then the

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,920
question mark or the forward slash key, and that will put in an empty comment.

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:11,470
It might be command and that key on a mac, I'm not sure because on my mac I actually switch the control

17
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,610
and the command keys.

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,290
So when I say control, it might it might be command on a mac, I'm not sure.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,890
So let's go ahead and just put in headings here.

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,260
And another tip, if you want to go to the next line, obviously you can go to the end here and you

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,340
can hit enter.

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,270
But if you're in the middle here and you hit enter, it'll do that.

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:37,540
If you want to have a clear new line and you're in the middle, you can hold down control or again might

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,110
be command and then enter and it'll create a new line.

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,640
No matter where you are here, it'll create a new line if you hold down control.

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,680
So keep that in mind and I'm going to give you these little tips throughout the course, because I think

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,680
that it really helps you write your code in a more efficient way, in a much faster way.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,520
All right.

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,130
So let's, let's put some headings in here.

30
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,890
So H one, I'm just going to say heading one and I'll hold control and enter to go to the next line.

31
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:14,050
Let's do H to tab heading to oops h three.

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,690
Heading for what else we got heading five.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,100
It goes up to six.

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,980
So h six.

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,480
Heading six.

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,250
All right, so let's save this and let's open this up with a live server.

37
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,750
I may have to close some of your other tabs and this is what it's going to look like.

38
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,500
So this is H one, it's going to be the largest and then it goes smaller and smaller and then H six

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,260
is going to be the smallest.

40
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,940
Now you can change the font size through CSS.

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,920
You can do whatever you want through CSS.

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,190
But by default H one is going to be the largest.

43
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,460
Now, a little tip or some advice that I would give is, is you usually only want to have an H one,

44
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,440
H one per page because the search engines actually look at this.

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,140
And you want to have like you want to describe whatever the content is.

46
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:21,580
For instance, if it's a blog post, you want to have your your blog post title in the H one and you

47
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,400
can have I mean, you can have multiple H ones, but it's good practice to just have one per page and

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,980
then these other ones you can have as many as you want.

49
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,170
Say you have a role of blog posts.

50
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,720
Maybe you have an H three for each title.

51
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:41,500
So I mean, it's not mandatory, but I would suggest using 1h1 per page if possible.

52
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,060
So those are headings.

53
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,230
Let's go ahead and look at paragraphs.

54
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,230
We've already done this, but it's just a P tag.

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,920
Now I'm going to give you another tip here with Emmet.

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,180
We can generate some dummy text if you need just some text to kind of fill as a placeholder, you can

57
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:08,830
do lorem r m and then hit tab and it'll give you a paragraph of dummy text or filler text.

58
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:15,790
And if you want to specify a certain number of words, like let's say we want a ten word sentence or

59
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:23,170
paragraph, we could do lorem ten tab and it'll give us ten words we could even do, like lorem 500

60
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:31,030
and it'll give us 500 words I'm going to do, let's say 100 and just generate some text.

61
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:37,090
And if I save this and we go and we take a look, you'll see that we have this paragraph of 100 words.

62
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,160
Now, inside the paragraph, I'm going to add, we'll just go anywhere.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,210
It doesn't really matter.

64
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,920
And I'm going to put in a strong tag now with VTS code.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,610
Once they put the beginning tag in, it adds the ending one automatically.

66
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,600
So I'm just going to just cut that out and put that over here and then anything that's within here is

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,980
within this strong tag.

68
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,640
So let's save this and go back and notice that it's bolded.

69
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:11,500
So by default it'll be bold, but with CSS you could change the styling of this strong tag to be a different

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,940
color or to be bigger, bigger font, whatever you want to do with it.

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,030
But it's made to make it stand out.

72
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,270
And at the same time you have the emphasis tag, which is the M, so let's say M.

73
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,250
And I'm going to just put the ending tag, let's say, down here.

74
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,900
And if we save that, we take a look by default it's going to be italic.

75
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,460
It's actually this right here.

76
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,430
So you can see that the text is italic, which again you can change within CCIS and we're going to get

77
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,350
into CCIS in the next section.

78
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,200
So that's strong and emphasise.

79
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,850
We also have the line break which I showed you in one of the slides.

80
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,800
It's one of the self closing tags.

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,460
So let's say we want a space right here without adding a new paragraph.

82
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,470
If I just do this and save, it's not going to reflect that in the browser.

83
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,000
This is only in the editor.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,420
I can put a million spaces here and save and it doesn't show in the browser to actually have a line

85
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,360
break without adding a new paragraph.

86
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,880
You would add in a bar tag.

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,780
So I'm going to go right here and put in a bar tag.

88
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,220
So what that's going to do is it's going to knock this on to the next line in the browser, as you can

89
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,210
see right here.

90
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,670
If I wanted it to go down again, I could add in another bar tag.

91
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,740
I'm just going to put a comment here.

92
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,990
So if we have to line breaks, you'll see that it pushes it down again and I can push it down as much

93
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,880
as I want.

94
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:57,080
And since it's a self-closing tag, you could either do this format or you could do that.

95
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,870
So both of these are going to work.

96
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:09,650
As you can see, I tend to use this just the HTML five, but sometimes I use a Visual Studio code extension

97
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,870
called Prettier, which will auto format your code and it adds the slash automatically.

98
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,610
So if you've watched some of my other videos and I have the slash, that's because I'm using Prettier

99
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,090
and I might introduce that extension to you guys later.

100
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,250
Now, in addition to the bar tag, we have an air tag which is a horizontal rule.

101
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:38,300
I'm actually going to put that let's see, we'll go right here and let's say horizontal rule and what

102
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,480
this does the air tag is it it does a line break, but it also creates an actual line.

103
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,560
So if you check this out, you can see it, put a line across the screen.

104
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,630
So that's a horizontal rule.

105
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,200
Now, if you've studied HTML before, especially if it was a while ago before HTML five, you might

106
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,050
have seen tags like the bold tag.

107
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,820
So if we put a B here, you might have seen stuff like this.

108
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,590
So if we actually take a look at this in Chrome, you'll see that it actually is bold.

109
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:19,670
But the bold tag along with the eye tag for italics and stuff like that, the U tag for underlying.

110
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:27,650
It's all been deprecated because HTML is not meant for styling and this strong tag replaced the bold

111
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,160
tag.

112
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,560
Because the strong tag is a semantic tag.

113
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,600
It doesn't necessarily mean it's bold, it just means that it should stand out in some way.

114
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,570
But we leave it up to the CSS to to say what that way is, even though it bolds by default.

115
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,390
And that's kind of hard to understand.

116
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,970
It did confuse me in the beginning when HTML five came out, but just know that we don't really use

117
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,750
this anymore or the you or I think there was se for strikethrough although we do have a semantic tag

118
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,710
for deleted text which does by default add a strikethrough.

119
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:08,120
So let's say we do Del and we're going to wrap this text right here.

120
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,640
So this is actually a semantic tag.

121
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,880
So we'll save this and take a look and notice that it does add a strikethrough, but it doesn't necessarily

122
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,680
mean that it has to be strikethrough.

123
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,800
We can change that in the CSS if we want.

124
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,630
Maybe we want it to be highlighted with a yellow background or something like that.

125
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,500
It doesn't necessarily mean strikethrough like the SE tag did.

126
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,100
They took that out of HTML five or deprecated it.

127
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,460
All right.

128
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,260
So in the next video, we're going to take a look at links, hyperlinks, and we're going to also look

129
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,080
at embedding images into a Web page.
