1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,930
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,360
So in this video, I want to take a look at nesting.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,510
So we actually need some mockup to work with.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,220
So this one here, I'm actually going to put in a header tag.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,040
So we'll say header and we'll go ahead and move this up into the header.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,890
And then under the header, I'm going to put a section and I'm going to give this, this section of

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:31,470
class of section and also a class of section, dash a and let's put an H three in here and we'll just

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:41,250
say section A and then let's put a paragraph and I'll do like Lord 30 and I want to also have just a

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,640
link, a read more link that we're going to style as a button.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,640
So let's put an a tag with the class of now I'm just going to do BTN dash light, I'm not going to do

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,470
BTN and BTN light like I would before with CSS.

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,700
And then in here, let's just say read more and then I'm just going to copy this whole section and we'll

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:10,440
bring it down and we'll call this section B, so we'll change that class and change that to B and let's

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,050
change this button class to button dark.

15
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,130
All right.

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,410
So if we save that, it should look like this.

17
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:26,760
So we're going to head back into main access and let's just look at some some basic nesting.

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,310
So I'm going to put in my header here.

19
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:42,300
Now for the header itself, I'm going to set a background of the dark color and a color of the light

20
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,990
color.

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,920
And then let's just add a little bit of padding.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,390
So we'll do one REM.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,040
So we'll save that.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,700
Now I want to align the H one to the center.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,550
Now, normally what we would do is we would take a header and we would take h one and create our style.

26
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:09,630
However, with SAS we can go right in the header and we can do h one and we can set let's set text a

27
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,790
line to the center and if I save that it works.

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,910
Now this text center is only going to apply to the H one that's within the header.

29
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,070
If we if we put another H one, this is not going to apply to it because it's nested within the header.

30
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,850
And what is what's really nice about this, I mean, just having this, you might not see a huge advantage,

31
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:39,960
but when you start to nest a lot of stuff together, you can really see the benefit of it, but you

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,940
can structure it like your HTML.

33
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,260
If we look at our HTML, we have a header and we have an H one nested inside.

34
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,260
We look at our SAS, we have a header, we have an H one nested inside so we can structure it very similar

35
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,000
to the HTML.

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,820
So that's basic nesting.

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:07,080
Now I'm going to let's see, let's go to our section now we have a class of section and I'm just going

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,840
to add a padding here of let's do three REM, spread it out a little bit.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,290
Now for the h3i want to say in all my section H threes, so let's go ahead and nest that.

40
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,200
Let's set the font size to two REM.

41
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:36,360
Now we can get creative here since we have some classes, we have section dash A and section dash B,

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:45,480
we can use an an ampersand as basically like kind of like a, like a wild card or like a placeholder.

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,380
I guess since we have session dash, what I'm going to are I'm sorry, section dash I'm going to go

44
00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:04,380
within my section class here and I'm going to do ampersand dash a so what this ampersand represents

45
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,690
is whatever its parent selector, so in this case DOT section.

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,430
Now I want a style dot section A which is just right here.

47
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,090
Right?

48
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,120
So this is actually going to take this section, put it in this ampersand and then just add dash a to

49
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,480
it.

50
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:27,270
So let's say we want a background and this kind of stuff.

51
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,530
I mean, you don't have to do.

52
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,100
I like it.

53
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,630
I think it's organized.

54
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,320
You have everything in one place related to a section.

55
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,380
So let's do primary color for the background and color.

56
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,270
I'm just going to say white.

57
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm going to show you something cool later on when it comes to text color.

58
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,300
Now, if I save this, you'll see that section A now has this styling.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,990
So this ampersand is just replaced with this.

60
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,830
And at the same time, if I want to do section B, I'll go ahead.

61
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:08,320
Paste that in and we'll just change that to a, B, let's change this to secondary color and save.

62
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,870
And now Section B has that secondary color.

63
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,470
All right.

64
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,400
So I think it's just organized to have everything we want.

65
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,880
We're dealing with sections, have it all in here rather than doing, you know, section, section H

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,370
three, section A, section B, it's just all in here nice and encapsulated.

67
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,830
So I think it's a it's an advantage.

68
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,020
And I like to do things this way.

69
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,010
All right.

70
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,270
So that's basic nesting.

71
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,870
Now, we can also do like pseudo classes.

72
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:46,670
So for instance, let's say I'm going to change this later, but let's say our a tag, let's say we

73
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:52,430
wanted to do some styling here like color three, three, three.

74
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,300
So I save that.

75
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,600
You'll see.

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,500
Now the links are dark.

77
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,000
Now to add a hover, I could simply do a stamp colon hover.

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,210
Whether it's hover before or after any pseudo class.

79
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,990
I want to use first child, last child, anything like that.

80
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,160
And I'll set the color to I don't know, I'll just say coral.

81
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,260
So if I save that and now when I hover over it, you'll see that it's coral.

82
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,120
Now, in the next video, I want to do a little more with nesting with the buttons.

83
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,820
But I also want to show you how we can use inheritance.

84
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,500
We can actually extend other selectors or other styles.

85
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,800
All right.

86
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,210
So we'll get to that next.
