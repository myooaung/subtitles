1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,080
All right, guys.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,810
So we're going to look at the Transform property now.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:11,010
And this is a page from the MSDN website, the Mozilla Docs, and it gives you a pretty good example

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,010
of some of the effects that you can do with the transform.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,810
So for instance, we can rotate.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,000
Actually, I got a click off at first.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,670
This is Skew, so you can kind of skew it, you can rotate, you can scale.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,460
So make it bigger, you can translate, which is basically move it around matrix.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,060
So we're going to look at some of these properties and we're also going to kind of integrate it with

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,140
transitions.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:47,670
So let's, let's create a new file called ten underscore transform, dot, HTML,

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,350
say transform, and it's put in our style.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,220
And again, I'm just going to have a class of box.

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:07,110
So we're just working with this box here and I'm just going to copy from the transitions, I'm going

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,740
to copy the whole body because I just want a box in the middle.

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,650
Actually, I'll just grab both of these, grab the hover as well, and I'll just delete some stuff.

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,460
So let's paste that in and I'm going to keep for the box, the background, the width and the height,

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,920
and I'll get rid of all the hover for now.

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,540
And I'm actually going to set it to 300 pixels.

20
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,230
All right.

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,960
So let's save that and let's open this with live server.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,610
We have a 300 pixel wide, 300 pixel height box in the middle of the screen and let's apply a transform.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:51,180
So we'll go to the box here and let's say transform and then we're going to have an effect.

24
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,980
Let's use rotate.

25
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,620
So we'll say rotate.

26
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:04,440
And that's going to take in whatever the amount you want to rotate, let's say 25 DG So 25 degrees and

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,450
we'll save and that's going to rotate it.

28
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,120
Now of course you could use rotate this rotate with animation with keyframes transitions, but if you

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,740
just wanted to have something tilted a little bit, you could just use it directly like this.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,400
All right.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,080
So next, we're going to look at oops, let's let's comment this out.

32
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,420
Next, we're going to look at skew, which will just kind of skew it diagonally.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,730
Diagonally, is that a word?

34
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,540
Diagonal?

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,410
And let's try that so you can see what skew does.

36
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:42,600
And this is nice if you want to have diagonal lines like in your layout, if you want to have maybe,

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,790
you know, a little showcase area where you have something on this side, something on this side, you

38
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,890
want a diagonal line in the middle instead of just having it half and half like that.

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,050
So that is skew.

40
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,380
Let's see, let's copy this down and comment this out and let's look at scale.

41
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:09,830
So scale, let's just put in two and that's just going to scale it up.

42
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,110
So essentially we're doubling it in size.

43
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,990
We could put three and it'll scale even more.

44
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,220
All right.

45
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,870
So let's comment that out.

46
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:29,180
Now, the next thing I want to show you is, is how to use transform with transitions.

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,870
So I'm going to add a transition for all elements that are animate able.

48
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:45,020
And let's do 1/2, ease in out and then let's just save that it's going to go back down.

49
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,180
And in our hover let's let's do the rotate.

50
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,750
So to rotate instead of 25, though, let's do 180.

51
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,320
So now when I hover over it, it rotates.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,240
When I hover off, it goes back.

53
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,360
So pretty cool.

54
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,400
We can also skew it.

55
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,710
Let's grab that.

56
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,850
So now when I hover over it, it skews and this this is going to basically, you know, overwrite the

57
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,630
rotate.

58
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,560
And then we can also do scale.

59
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,880
So if I save that and I hover over it, it'll scale up.

60
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,180
Now, we can also move this around the page without having to do, like a position relative and then

61
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,430
doing top bottom, left right properties.

62
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,590
And we can do that by using translate.

63
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,550
So we have translate, we have translate X, translate Y so we can move it along the x axis and the

64
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,690
Y axis.

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:01,600
So let's actually comment this stuff out and let's do a trance form.

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,050
And then we're going to set it to translate.

67
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,060
Let's do translate y and let's say 100 pixels.

68
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,820
All right, so let's save that.

69
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,790
Now, when I hover over this, it's going to move it down 100 pixels.

70
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:29,860
So I didn't have to do like a position relative or a top, you know, top one, whatever property.

71
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,620
It just simply moves 100 pixels.

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,440
And now if I want to move it up on the Y axis, I can simply put a negative value.

73
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,030
So -100 is going to move it up.

74
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:49,810
And if I want to do on the x axis, I can do translate x, let's do 100 pixels and that's going to go

75
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,500
over.

76
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,090
And if I want to go the other way, I could of course, do a negative value there.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,360
Now, let's say I want to move it on the x and y axis.

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,290
I can just use translate so I can say transform

79
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,560
translate.

80
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,820
And this is going to take in the X and the Y parameter.

81
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,860
So let's say 100 pixels on the X axis, 100 pixels on the y axis.

82
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,750
And now when I hover over it, it will go 100 over and 100 down.

83
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,870
And of course, I could use negative values if I wanted to.

84
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,670
Now, for if you want to increase performance, you can actually use translate three DX, which I don't

85
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:42,430
use all that much, but we can do translate three dx and let's actually comment this stuff out.

86
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,870
So if we use translate three dx, this actually has to have a Z value as well.

87
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,800
So 100 pixels and that's going to do the same thing.

88
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,240
And I believe it increases performance if you use translate three DX and you can do some really cool

89
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,600
things.

90
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,810
I'm I'm not that familiar with it I usually use translate but it is available to us.

91
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,320
All right.

92
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,030
So that's the transform property.

93
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,520
We'll be using this later on in other projects, but that's going to be it for this video, guys, and

94
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,810
I'll see you in the next one.
