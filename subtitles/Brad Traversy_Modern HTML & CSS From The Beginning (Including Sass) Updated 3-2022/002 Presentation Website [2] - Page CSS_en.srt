1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,210
So in the last video, we did the HTML for our presentation project.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,790
Now we're going to start on the CSS and our style CSS is already being included.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,100
So make sure you have your link to your stylesheet right here.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,280
So first thing I want to do is set some variables.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,370
So let's set for the root scope.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:31,170
I just want to have the colors for each page and also the animation speed because in the beginning when

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,300
the landing page loads will have the heading come in from the top, the paragraph come in from the side,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,200
and we want to we want that speed to be inside of a variable.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,570
So let's say dash, dash page, dash one dash color, and I'm going to set this to steel blue.

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,870
I'm going to use color names and let's do actually we'll just copy this down.

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,760
So I'll do shift option or shift alt on windows and then the down key.

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,010
Let's do we need four of them because it's four pages and of course you could add more if you wanted

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,210
to more or less so three and four.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:22,920
And let's see for page two, let's do ten and we'll do teal and let's do slate blue.

16
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,820
Which is almost the purple.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,520
And then I'm just going to add a variable called animate dash speed so we can easily change the speed

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,390
of the animation.

19
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,280
I'm going to set that to 1/2.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,880
All right.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,230
So those are our variables.

22
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,600
Next thing I'm going to do is the body style.

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,670
So for the body, let's do font family.

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:56,680
And I'm just going to use Ariel for this and then let's do line height.

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:04,630
Usually like to do about 1.4 for the body line height color is going to be white by default and then

26
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,110
let's zero out the margin and padding.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,920
Now I don't want scroll bars to show that's that's a big part of of of how I want this website to work.

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,750
So we want to say overflow and we want to set that to hidden.

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,630
So no scroll bars will show on the body.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,560
So if I save that, it's going to look like this, which we can't see the text anymore because the text

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
is white.

32
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,140
So I think that we should implement the page colors.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,600
So let's go down here, let's put a comment, we'll say page colors and basically we're going to tack

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,340
on to the IDs.

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,610
All sections have a class of page.

36
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,340
So this is all stuff they'll share, styles they'll share.

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,390
But the IDs are unique and that's where we want the colors.

38
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:08,230
So let's do ID, page one, and I'm just going to do background and I'm going to set it to var dash,

39
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:15,520
dash page, oops, page, dash one dash color.

40
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,590
All right.

41
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,410
And then I'll copy this line down a couple more times.

42
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,910
This one will be two, three, four.

43
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,070
And then we want to change the IDs to three and four.

44
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,650
So this way it's easy just to change the colors if you change, if you want to have something different

45
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,440
for a background of a certain page.

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,400
So if we save this, you'll see that now each each page has the different background color now for the

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,650
pages themselves, each, every single one.

48
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,950
We're going to want to take up the whole viewport, right?

49
00:03:50,950 --> 00:04:01,450
So let's add in our page class down here and let's display as flex.

50
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,680
And as soon as I do that, everything is going to go in a row.

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
It's going to go horizontal, which I don't want.

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,980
So I want to say flex dash direction.

53
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,050
I want to be a column and then it'll go back to going vertical.

54
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,060
And then let's set the height for 100 viewport heights.

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,570
And then when I save, it's only going to show the first page.

56
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,240
Now we want to align this stuff.

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:40,180
So let's say a line dash items and let's say center center, and that's going to align it horizontal

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,020
into the center.

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:50,560
And then let's do justify dash content to the center and save.

60
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,920
And now it's aligned both horizontal and vertical.

61
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,810
And then I'm just going to add, I'm also going to text a line center.

62
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,070
So the text itself and then I'm going to add a little padding on the left and right.

63
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:12,190
So zero, top and bottom and let's do four REM left and right, just so it's not right up against the

64
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,790
edge.

65
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,600
All right.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,630
Now the heading and the paragraph.

67
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,470
I want to be a little bigger, so let's target the page.

68
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:29,050
H one excuse me and let's set the font size.

69
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,300
Let's set it to four REM.

70
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:42,460
And I just want to change the line height to 1.2 and I'm going to add a margin of one REM.

71
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,060
All right.

72
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,260
So let's save that.

73
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,580
Excuse me.

74
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,340
So that looks pretty good.

75
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,150
The paragraph.

76
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,860
I also want to be a little bigger.

77
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,970
So let's target the page paragraph and we'll set the font size.

78
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,010
Let's do 1.3 REM, so we'll make it a little larger.

79
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,480
All right, now let's do the button.

80
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,220
So the button here.

81
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:17,200
So it has a class of BTN and we want to display it as an inline block.

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,370
As far as padding, it's going to be a pretty big button.

83
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,420
So we'll do one REM, top and bottom to left and right.

84
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,430
Let's make the background light by default.

85
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,430
You could put that in a variable if you wanted to, but I think it's fine.

86
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,310
And then let's do color.

87
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,950
We'll do three, three, three for the text.

88
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,180
And if it's a link, we want to take away the text declaration make that none.

89
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:57,210
We should also add border none and then let's do margin dash, top one ram just to push it down a little

90
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,780
bit.

91
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,920
And then the font size I'm going to make a little bigger.

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,080
So we'll do 1.1 REM.

93
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,550
Remember, one REM by default is going to be 16 pixels.

94
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:16,920
Now when we hover over this, I want it to change to a dark color, but I also want it to transition.

95
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:25,230
So I'm going to add a transition to all and it's going to be really quick, let's say 0.3 seconds and

96
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,670
we'll say ease in.

97
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,870
So that doesn't do anything because we don't have a hover yet.

98
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:41,940
So let's add a BTN colon hover and I want the background to be dark and the color to be light.

99
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:51,170
So if I save that and now when I hover over it, you'll see it transitions to dark rather than just

100
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,670
clicking, you know, just immediately switching to a dark color.

101
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,280
Now, let's see.

102
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,980
We also want to have a dark version of the button, and I want it to be this exact styling.

103
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,800
So what I'll do is I'll just put a comma here and I'll just say for BTN Dark, we want to have this

104
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,580
styling.

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,260
And then for the BTN cover, I'm just going to go ahead and copy this.

106
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,660
So BTN Dark Hover is going to be the opposite, so the background will be light.

107
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,540
And the color will be dark.

108
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,270
All right.

109
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,820
And if I click it, you'll see it goes to the next page.

110
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,000
So I can now I can navigate up and down the pages.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,799
We don't have the scrolling effect with jQuery yet, and it's up to you if you want to include that

112
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,370
or not.

113
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,890
I'm going to, but you don't need to.

114
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,900
It'll just switch like this.

115
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,530
All right.

116
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,210
So I think we're going to stop here.

117
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,480
And then in the next video, we're going to add our animation.

118
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,220
We want this this heading to come in from the top, this to come in from the side.

119
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,630
And then we'll also implement a little bit of jQuery to add the scrolling effect.
