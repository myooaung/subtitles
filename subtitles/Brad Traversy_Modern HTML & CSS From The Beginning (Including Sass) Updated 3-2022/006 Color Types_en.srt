1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,420
All right.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,850
So in this video, I want to quickly talk about the different color types that are commonly used.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,700
Now, I'm not going to go over all of them, but I'm going to go over the ones that you you'll see for

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,800
the most part, the most common types.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:19,050
So let's create a file called zero for underscore colors, HTML, and let's put our boilerplate in here

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,010
and we'll go ahead and change the title to colors.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,680
Let's add in our style tags.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,520
And as far as the body, let's just put a couple of headings.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,500
Let's do an H two here.

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,210
And an H three.

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:51,680
And then up in the style, I'm going to grab the H one as a selector and give it a colour property,

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,890
which is going to be the color of the text.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,730
Now, as far as colors go, anything I'm going to show you you can use for the color property, you

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,040
can also use for the background color.

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,250
You can also use for a border, anything.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,740
And the first type is, is a name.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,890
So we can put like red in here.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,000
So let's save this and let's run it with the live server.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,700
So open that up.

20
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,630
And of course we have a red heading.

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,490
So this is a color name.

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,290
Now, in addition to common colors like red, blue, green, we have a bunch of not so common colors,

23
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,760
like, for instance, coral.

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,750
We save that.

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,890
You can see we get coral.

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,370
And in this code, if I just put any letter in like a G, it's going to show us all the different options

27
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,100
for the different color names.

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:50,870
If I put an A, you see all these different colors, we've aqua, aquamarine, azure B, all these beige,

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,200
blue, violet, burley wood, some really weird names.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,480
But anyways, these are colored names.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,340
So the second color type that we can use is in our ggb value.

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,960
So for the H two, let's say our ggb and this takes in three things three values red, green and blue,

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,900
and each value should be anywhere between zero and 255.

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,860
So if I do zero, that means that the value for red is zero.

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,570
Let's do blue zero.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,820
I'm sorry, green zero and blue zero.

37
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,490
And if I save that, it's going to be black because we have no presence of red, green or blue.

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,430
Now, the highest you can go is to 55.

39
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,460
So if I say to 55 for four, the first one here and in V's code, it even gives us a little preview

40
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,820
here, which is nice, but if I save that, we get red.

41
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,070
Now, if I wanted it slightly darker, I could do like, I don't know, 210.

42
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,750
You can see now it's darker and let's say I want it to do all blue.

43
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,970
I could go to the last one here.

44
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,790
255 is the highest and it's, it's, it's blue as it can get really.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,440
Now there's a lot of different color combinations.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,790
Obviously, it can be anything between zero and 255 for all of these.

47
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:17,120
So if I do like, let's say 100 of green and maybe, I don't know, 20 of red and save, we get this

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,810
blue color.

49
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,880
Let's let's tone this down a bit.

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,700
We'll say like 120 and save.

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,080
And we get this color which is like a grayish blue and it gives you a little preview right here.

52
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,240
So just remember that all zeros is black.

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,460
And then if you do all 250 fives take a crack at what that's going to give us.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,900
If all zeros are black, then oops, all 250 fives are going to be white, as you can see, and you

55
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,760
can't even read it because the background is white.

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,530
But as you can see, it is there.

57
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,990
So that's red, green, blue or.

58
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,900
Now the third type is the most common and the one that we'll be using the most.

59
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:05,090
And that's hexadecimal or hex, which is a base 16 number and it pertains to the composition of a certain

60
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,010
color in the RGV space.

61
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,670
So it's always going to start with a number sign and it's going to be six or three characters that are

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,839
going to be letters, letters and or numbers for numbers.

63
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:26,060
It's going to be either 0 to 9 or for letters it'll be A to F, so all zeros is going to be black and

64
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,930
then all FS is going to be white.

65
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,460
Now, just like our Ggb, we have red, green, blue.

66
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,480
In hexadecimal we have red the first two green, the second two in blue the last two.

67
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:48,680
So if I wanted red, I could do f f for red for the first two and then zero zero green, zero zero blue.

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,940
And that gives me red.

69
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,060
If I wanted blue, I'd put F for the last two.

70
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,570
Like that, and if I did fefe in just the middle, it would be green.

71
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,720
And then any combination of, of any of those.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,930
So just like our GB, it's going to give us just a colour based off of the values of red, green and

73
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,510
blue.

74
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,400
Now obviously you're not going to remember all these different hex codes.

75
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,710
You may have some preferred colours that you use often that you'll remember, but there's there's plenty

76
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,360
of websites and software that you can use to, to reference different colours.

77
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,340
And I'm going to give you an example in a minute, but what you do want to remember is obviously black,

78
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,750
which is all zeros.

79
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,300
Now, when you have something that when you have a hex value that's all the same, you can actually

80
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,470
cut it down to three.

81
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,770
So three zeros is black and three FS is white.

82
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,600
You want to remember that?

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,110
And then anything else that's going to be all the same, like let's say three D's or three C's, it's

84
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,840
going to be a shade of grey because all the red, green and blue values are the same, same thing.

85
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,850
If we do like f four, three times, that's going to be some shade of of grey.

86
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,390
If we do e three, that will be a shade of grey.

87
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,890
As you can see, it's very light.

88
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,240
So some common ones that I use are three, three, three, which is almost black.

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
It's a really dark grey.

90
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
I think it's cleaner than using jet black, so I use it for a lot for backgrounds if I want a light

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
background, a lot of times I use F for like that.

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,320
So those are just some of the ones that I keep in mind as far as colour is like different blues or reds

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,130
and stuff.

94
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,420
I'll use a reference like this website here.

95
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,910
This is Colour Dash Dexcom so we just have a palette here of different colours.

96
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,100
These are just the latest favourite colours.

97
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,340
But we can go up here and we can use the colour palette.

98
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,830
But if I click one of these like let's say this blue right here, let's say we're building an application

99
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,050
or website, we like this blue.

100
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,620
If I click on that, it shows us the hexadecimal, the GB value and then other colour types as well

101
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,160
that I didn't talk about like h hsl hcv.

102
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,140
And you can use these in CSS, but I don't I and they're not that common.

103
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,230
Also, what's cool about this site is if you go down, you have a palette of different shades, different

104
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,750
shades and tints that have to do with this, this hexadecimal value, because often you're going to

105
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,840
want a colour palette or a colour scheme in your website or your application with colours that relate

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,500
to each other.

107
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,860
So you might have buttons that have this colour and maybe your background has this colour or something

108
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,610
like that.

109
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,970
And then down here you can see the percentages of our GB.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,540
So this, this gives you a lot of information on different colours, gives you examples and CSIS, so

111
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,070
really, really helpful site.

112
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,140
I would definitely bookmark the site.

113
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,470
Another good one is HTML colour codes dot com.

114
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,980
And this one here, you can see we have a colour palette.

115
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,260
We can just kind of slide and it gives us the hex value, the GB, the HSL.

116
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,540
So this is a pretty cool site as well.

117
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,060
Down here we have a colour chart we can click and it shows us in the header the different values.

118
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,670
All right, so you'll learn more as we go along.

119
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,520
But I just wanted you to understand these these three different types of colours that we can use in

120
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,510
CSS.

121
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,940
And of course you can use colour names.

122
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,960
I prefer hex.

123
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,770
Like if I have to make something white or black, I'll use the hex value.

124
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
A lot of people have asked me why?

125
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,510
Why don't I just use white or or black?

126
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,450
But I like to be consistent.

127
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,740
I don't like to just have I don't like to have colour names mixed with hex values.

128
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,020
It's just kind of just it's just my thing.

129
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,150
But you can do it any way you want, so just.

130
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,409
Just keep that in mind.

131
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,400
Everyone's different.

132
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,080
Everyone does things differently.

133
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,860
All right, guys.

134
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,800
So that's it for this one, and I'll see you in the next video.
