1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.690
Okay.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.450
So in the last video we created our core styles with our variables, the primary color, secondary color

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.090
and so on.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.320
We also did the nav bar, so now we're going to move on to the showcase.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.390
So let's head back over to the HTML.

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
Let's go under the NAV here and let's add our showcase.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.140
So we're going to use a header here with the ID of showcase.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.760
Now I want to put everything into the middle here.

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.740
So we're going to use a container, but I don't want to use the actual container here for the for the

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.640
grid container.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.370
So I'm going to create another class called Showcase Dash Container.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.380
And inside here, we're going to just have one grid item.

13
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.530
So I'm going to use I'm going to use the grids to just align it over to the side like this.

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.310
So which I probably would normally use flex for, but I just like I said in the last video, I want

15
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.200
to keep this focused on the grid.

16
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.910
So we're going to do that.

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.500
So we're going to have one grid item and we're going to call this showcase dash content.

18
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.770
And inside here we're going to have the category.

19
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.140
So this right here, this little sports, so that's going to have a class of category.

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.520
And we're also going to have to basically category is the core styling like the padding the border radius,

21
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.490
but then the color is dependent on the category.

22
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.540
So we're going to have a class called Category Sports and then in here we'll just say sports.

23
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.640
And underneath the category, let's put the title.

24
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.970
So this is going to be an H one and let's just say some sports article and then a paragraph.

25
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.650
And I think I did form 20 seems about right.

26
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.880
And then underneath the paragraph we want a link and we're going to give this a class of BTN, which

27
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.250
would be the core button class, and then BTN primary, which will be the primary color.

28
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.280
So we'll have to set those up and we'll just have this go to article HTML.

29
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.110
All right.

30
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.930
So that's the oh, we've got to put the text in here.

31
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.250
Let's put read more.

32
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.310
So that's the markup.

33
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.780
Now let's add the CSS.

34
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.680
So we'll go to style and let's go right here and say showcase.

35
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.910
So the showcase itself, let's do color white.

36
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.120
It's going to have a it's going to have the image background, but the background we're going to put

37
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.070
on the before pseudo selector if you remember in when we did the the the lecture on after and before

38
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.950
I showed you how to add a background image with an overlay using the before selector.

39
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.260
So for the actual showcase, I want the background to be dark.

40
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:18.210
So let's use three, three, three and we're going to just add padding of two REM all around and let's

41
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.030
do position relative.

42
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.490
And that's important because the before, the before pseudo selector is going to be position absolute.

43
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.580
And remember, if you position something absolute, it is positioned inside inside of the first relative

44
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.940
container so that we want that to be our showcase.

45
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:52.620
So let's save that and let's go right below and let's add showcase and we're going to do before now

46
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.810
when you use before and after you want to put in the content and we're not actually inserting content,

47
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.060
so we're just going to leave this blank and then we want to add our background image here.

48
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.380
So let's say background URL, dot, dot slash, you want to go outside of the CSS into image and then

49
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:19.529
we want featured and we're going to do no repeats center, center slash cover.

50
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.590
All right.

51
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.330
That's not going to show just yet.

52
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.710
Let's position this absolute because we're basically laying this on top of the showcase.

53
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.600
So position absolute start at the top zero and the left zero and then we want the width to go all the

54
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.410
way across.

55
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.690
We want the height to go all the way.

56
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.040
So 100%.

57
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.660
And we also want to make it translucent or transparent.

58
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.140
So let's add an opacity of, let's say 0.4 and save.

59
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.250
All right.

60
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.210
So now you can see the the image has has an overlay or it's not really an overlay on the image.

61
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.760
It's basically the image you can see through it to the dark is basically what's happening.

62
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.960
You can also see through the text right now, but we'll fix that in a little bit.

63
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.970
So let's let's grab on to the showcase container.

64
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:33.720
So we'll say showcase in the class of showcase container and we want to display as a grid and then the

65
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.520
grid template columns.

66
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.590
I want it to take up half the space basically.

67
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.630
So we're going to just repeat two times one fr.

68
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.770
We want it to be a two column grid, even though we only have one item.

69
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.430
That's fine.

70
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.950
It should just it should still make room for just just an empty item, basically.

71
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.430
And then after that, let's justify content to the center.

72
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.020
So this will center it

73
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.510
horizontally and then we want to center it vertically as well.

74
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.140
So align items center and then let's make the height of the showcase half the viewport.

75
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.260
So 50 v h and we'll go ahead and save that.

76
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.430
And there we go.

77
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.150
Actually, you know what?

78
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.490
I wanted some more more text than that.

79
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.920
Let's do.

80
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.070
For the paragraph.

81
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.200
Let's do lorem 40.

82
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.480
Yeah, it's a little too much.

83
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.100
I think 30 is what I did.

84
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.650
There we go.

85
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.080
So notice that the the text here, you can see through it.

86
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.990
So basically the image is on top of the text.

87
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:52.820
And remember, ze index takes care of of what displays first and basically the order of of what is on

88
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.600
top of what.

89
00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.080
So let's take the showcase and take the not the showcase container.

90
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.970
We want the showcase content which wraps all the text and let's set the Z index to one and save.

91
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.410
And now you can see that it becomes clear and it's now on top of the image.

92
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.290
Let's see.

93
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:23.630
So I think I mean, that's pretty much it for the core showcase styles, but we do want to add the category

94
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.110
that we need some styling for that as well as the button, which you can't even see.

95
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.150
But those are going to be utility classes that we can apply in other places as well.

96
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:40.910
So let's go up here to where we have our utilities and let's do the category.

97
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.890
So we'll say category.

98
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:56.990
So for category, I'm going to display as an inline block and let's make the color white.

99
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.210
I'm not going to do a back.

100
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.710
The background is dependent on the category, so we're not going to do that here.

101
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.780
But let's change the font size.

102
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:12.920
I actually want to make it smaller, so we'll do 15.55 REM units and I want it to be uppercase.

103
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.150
So let's say text transform to uppercase.

104
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.680
And as far as padding goes, we'll do 0.4 REM.

105
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.720
So that's the top and bottom and 0.6 REM on the left and right.

106
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.590
All right.

107
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:37.760
And then for the border dash radius, let's do 15 pixels, make it rounded, and then add a margin or

108
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.610
a margin bottom, rather, of we'll do a half of REM.

109
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.950
So we'll save that.

110
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.710
Now, notice it doesn't have a color around it.

111
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.370
So what we're going to do is add our special category colors.

112
00:08:52.370 --> 00:09:00.380
So let's do category sports and I'll just do one line since it's just one property.

113
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.860
So background is going to be VAR,

114
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.140
what do we call it.

115
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.240
Let's see.

116
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.620
Oh, sports color.

117
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.590
So we'll do dash, dash, sports color and save.

118
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.490
And there we go.

119
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.520
So while we're at it, though, we might as well add the other categories.

120
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:31.280
So we also have INT for entertainment and we have tech and we'll change this to anti and tech.

121
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.880
So now when we add our other categories, the style should be set.

122
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.790
Now the button, we want to do that next.

123
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:46.340
So let's say BTN, so we'll have BTN and then we'll have special BTN for for the colors as well.

124
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.080
Special classes for the colors.

125
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:54.980
So for the core button let's display as an inline block.

126
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.720
Whoops I do here.

127
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.620
So inline dash block and then we want to take away the border just in case we use this on an actual

128
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.340
button.

129
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.140
So we'll say border none.

130
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.910
And then the background just by default, I'm going to use the dark color.

131
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:21.020
So we'll say var dash dash dark just in case you do BTN without another special class for the color.

132
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:32.810
So we'll do that and then let's do color white by default and our padding which will be 0.5 REM top

133
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.930
and bottom 1.5 left and right.

134
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.460
So we'll save that.

135
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.730
Let's see.

136
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.620
I actually want to push that down a little bit.

137
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.120
So where our showcase is.

138
00:10:54.070 --> 00:11:04.040
Let's do, let's grab the paragraph that's in the showcase content and let's add margin bottom, the

139
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.230
one room just to move that down a little bit.

140
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.950
All right.

141
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.420
So back to the buttons.

142
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.860
We have the core button style, but we need to do BTN.

143
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.560
We're going to have a BTN Lite.

144
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.080
I'm just going to do all the colors now so we don't have to worry about it, which I'll just put this

145
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.790
on the same line like this.

146
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:31.090
So background is going to be the variable of light color.

147
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.080
All right.

148
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.430
And then we'll copy this down.

149
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.880
Let's see.

150
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.520
We have we have light dark.

151
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.810
Actually, we don't need dark because it's dark by default.

152
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.450
So we'll just do primary and secondary.

153
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:52.300
So primary and this will be our primary color and then secondary.

154
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.710
All right.

155
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.000
So let's save that.

156
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.750
And now you can see we have our red button now for the hover.

157
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.030
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to have one hover and I'm just going to make I'm just going to

158
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.420
add the opacity of 0.9.

159
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:19.840
That way, it doesn't matter what color it is, it'll still have an effect when you hover over it and

160
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.460
it doesn't, you know, if it's even if it's dark or light, it's just going to change the opacity just

161
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.700
to give it a little bit of an effect of darkening.

162
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:33.730
But really, it's just it's just we're changing the opacity or making it a little bit transparent.

163
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:40.360
And then I want to have one more class for the button that will make it into a block level button,

164
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.310
meaning it goes all the way across.

165
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:49.870
So we're actually going to do button or BTN block where we set it to display block instead of inline

166
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.260
block.

167
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.050
And we set the width to 100% and I want to align to the middle.

168
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.060
So text align center.

169
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.390
So now our buttons should be all set.

170
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.970
All right, we're going to have quite a few utility classes in this project, which is nice because

171
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:12.790
you can easily change things up if you want to change the background of something, it's it's easy to

172
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.300
do.

173
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.260
All right.

174
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.860
So that's it.

175
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:21.700
I will see you in the next video where we will create we'll start to create this grid right here with

176
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.140
all of the articles.
