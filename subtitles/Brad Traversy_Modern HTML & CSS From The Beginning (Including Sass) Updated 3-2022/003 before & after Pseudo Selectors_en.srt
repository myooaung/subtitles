1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,900
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,760
In this video, we're going to take a look at the before and after pseudo selector, which actually

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,170
allows us to insert content before or after an element.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:18,210
So I'm going to create a new file here called zero three underscore V for underscore after HTML.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:27,240
And let's put our boilerplate in here, say, before and after.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,320
Okay.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,260
So like I said, it allows us to put something before and after.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,330
And I'm going to give you some practical examples.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:43,920
So one example would be where we have a form and there's some fields that are required, and you may

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,230
have seen this before, but they'll be like some kind of mark, like an asterisk or something where

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,850
the fields are actually required.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:01:01,170
So what I'm going to do is just put in a label and we'll just say for name and I'm going to give this

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,510
a class of is dash required?

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,150
And then here we'll just say name.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:18,030
And then after the label we'll put an input type text that sets it.

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,170
We don't need anything else.

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,120
So let's save this and open it.

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:32,470
So a good example of of a practical use for this would be to put an asterisk after the label like right

19
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:32,890
here.

20
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,040
And we could even style it, we could color it red for instance.

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,100
So let's take our is required class.

22
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:50,860
So we'll say oops we want dot is required and so we want to do is required and then we want to do colon

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,920
after we want it to be after.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,960
And then in here it takes in a property called content, which I'm going to make an asterisk.

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,840
So we're just going to put whoops, wrong character, we're going to put an asterisk in here and let's

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,729
just save that and see what happens.

27
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,190
So notice that the asterisk actually gets put in here and it's not in the markup.

28
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:22,240
If we open up our, our dev tools here and we go to the Elements tab and we take a look at the label,

29
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,850
let's see, we want to look at the HTML.

30
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,440
So I'm going to just bring this down.

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,470
If you look at the label, we have a label and then input.

32
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,080
There's no asterisk in the markup at all.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,960
It's being inserted into the into the view here and the browser through CSS.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,210
And then we can also style it.

35
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,120
We should have a semicolon here, but we can style it.

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,050
We could say like color red, and if I save that it's now red, we might want to push it over a little

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,440
so we could add some padding, dash left, we'll say like two pixels and save and it pushes it over.

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,800
So I think that's a pretty practical use because then you can go ahead and just give any like let's

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,340
say we had six, seven fields, whatever ones were required, you could simply give a class of is required

40
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,340
and it would have it automatically have this asterisk.

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,820
You don't have to worry about going into your markup and actually adding an asterisk in your HTML.

42
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,370
So that's one practical use.

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,670
And just to show you, if I did before and save it does the same thing, it just puts it before.

44
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:35,500
Now, another really practical use for before is to do an overlay in an image overlay.

45
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:43,180
Now we did an overlay in the Edge Ledger project, but we didn't use before.

46
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,400
We just kind of did it on that element.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,850
But I'm going to I'm going to give you an example of of how we would do this.

48
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,170
So I'm going to comment this out.

49
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,090
We don't want this element.

50
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,700
We're going to do kind of a little landing page here.

51
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,100
So let's put a header.

52
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:06,670
And in the header we'll do an H one, we'll say Hello world, let's do a paragraph, I'll do lorem ten

53
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:16,060
and then under that header let's do a section and we'll put an h three.

54
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:23,830
I'll just say lorem three and then we'll do a paragraph and let's do lorem 30.

55
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,750
So we'll save that.

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,050
And I'm actually going to bring this back down to 100%.

57
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,610
I did have this zoomed in, so I'm going to bring that back down and then let's add some, some core

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,330
styles.

59
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,360
So I'm going to add some styles to the body.

60
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,960
Just I want it to look somewhat decent and realistic.

61
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,670
So let's say font family, we'll use Ariel for our font and let's give it a background.

62
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,980
We're given the body a background of dark and a color of white.

63
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,510
All right.

64
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,660
And then for the header itself.

65
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,080
Fusco go right here.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,190
We'll say header.

67
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,250
I'm going to display.

68
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,170
As Flex.

69
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,830
As soon as I do that, it's going to it's going to go horizontal.

70
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,300
But we want the flex direction to be a column.

71
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,150
So I save that.

72
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,890
It goes back to that direction and we want to justify content center.

73
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,570
I just want to move everything to the center.

74
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,370
So this is stuff we've already done.

75
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,410
We're just setting it up.

76
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:44,130
So we want to align items to the center and we want to text the line to the center as well.

77
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,560
And then let's let's add a height of 100 viewport height.

78
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,330
So we'll save that good.

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,060
The font size of the H one.

80
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,580
I just want to increase so I'm going to say header H one.

81
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:08,190
Now we could use if you want, you can use a greater than it doesn't really make a difference.

82
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,390
But sometimes you'll see that.

83
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:15,300
You'll see that people like to do that, which means that it's a direct child of header.

84
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:25,110
So let's say font size for REM and let's say margin one REM.

85
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,930
And I'm just going to zero out the margin on the body as well.

86
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,810
So I'm going to take an image and first of all, I'm going to add it to just just the header itself

87
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,660
and I'm going to show you what the problem with that is.

88
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:50,480
So let's get an image from source dot unsplash.com and if you go down.

89
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,360
Let's see from a collection.

90
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
Let's do this random search term.

91
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:11,220
So if we grab this this nature water, random search term, and let's put a background of a URL, put

92
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,910
that in there and we'll say no, repeat, because we don't want it to repeat.

93
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,100
We want to center on the X and y axis and then we want it to cover the whole we want to show the whole

94
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,690
image.

95
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,600
So if I save that, we get a picture of some water here.

96
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,710
Now I want the this is actually nice because we can read the text fine.

97
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,920
But a lot of times with with some images, you won't be able to read the text.

98
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,990
These all seem to be pretty good.

99
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,760
All right, so let's use this one.

100
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,080
So let's say that we want this image to be transparent.

101
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:55,050
We want to add an opacity value and we could say like 0.4 and save and and the image is going to change.

102
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,940
But you can see that now.

103
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:03,570
We can see through the image and it makes it darker, but the text is also translucent and we can also

104
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,050
see through that and it's also not readable still.

105
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:14,670
So we want the text to be nice and clear, but only the background image to be faded or to be translucent.

106
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,370
Lucent.

107
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,920
So what we need to do here, what we could do as a solution is use before.

108
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,400
So we're going to say header before.

109
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:32,470
And we're going to take this right here, the background image and the opacity value.

110
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,720
And pass it in there.

111
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,539
Now, when you use before and after, you want to use content.

112
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,760
Now, we're not actually inserting content in the page, so we're just going to leave this blank like

113
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,360
that.

114
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,820
All right.

115
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,770
Now, if I save that, we can't see the image because we basically need to position it so that it's

116
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,470
it's it's basically on top of it or actually behind it.

117
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,830
So we want to position this, let's say, position absolute.

118
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,690
We want to start at the top corner.

119
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,880
So top zero, left zero.

120
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,430
So basically right here, we want it to go 100% across 100% height because we want it to cover the whole

121
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,760
thing.

122
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,210
So let's say width 100% and height also 100%.

123
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:30,640
So if we go ahead and save that, you can see that the we're still having the same issue.

124
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,270
I mean, the image is dark, but the text is not.

125
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,810
So we're going to actually give it a Z and X and we're going to push it behind.

126
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,360
So we're going to say negative one and let's save.

127
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,830
And now look at the text.

128
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,490
It's nice and bright, yet the image is still darkened.

129
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,750
So if we wanted to change the the amount of opacity, we could make it darker, even darker than this.

130
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:05,560
Like 0.20 is going to be completely just dark and then one is going to be just the full image.

131
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,370
Anything in between we can do like 0.5.

132
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,400
It's kind of hard because the image keeps changing.

133
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,070
It would probably be a better example if it was a static image.

134
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,120
I probably should have did that.

135
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,120
But either way you can see how this works.

136
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,920
So we're adding the background image on the before pseudo selector, adding some opacity positioning

137
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,750
and absolute starting it at the top left, making sure it covers the whole area.

138
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,850
And then we're sending it back with Z index of negative one that will bring the text forward.

139
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,440
So just remember that when you when you're doing a showcase image, you can do it that way.

140
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,280
All right.

141
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,880
So that's a pretty practical use of this and you'll see this a lot.

142
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,560
So in the next video, we're going to start to take a look at Box Shadows.
