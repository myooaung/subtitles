00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.100
All right, guys, in this video, we're going to style some menus.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.490
So we're going to create a vertical side menu and then also a navigation bar that goes horizontal.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.550
So let's create a new file called zero nine underscore menus dot HTML.

4
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.980
And for the title, I'm just going to say menu styling and let's add in our style tags.

5
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.490
And for the markup we just want to add a UL and I'm going to give it a class of side menu.

6
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.610
We're going to have a list item with a link inside of it, doesn't matter where it goes.

7
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.010
And then let's just say home for the text and then we'll copy this down a few times.

8
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:52.250
And this one will be about this will be services and this will be contact.

9
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.480
Let's save that.

10
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.500
It's open it up.

11
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.140
And there we go.

12
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.610
Looks horrendous.

13
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.250
First thing I'm going to do is for the body.

14
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.220
I'm just going to change the font family to let's do aerial.

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.600
And next thing, we want to target the side menu, which is the UL.

16
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.680
And I want to get rid of the bullets because by default you always have these, these disc bullets.

17
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.440
Now you can get rid of these within the UL or within the list item with the list style property.

18
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.970
And we want to set that to none.

19
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.080
So we'll save that.

20
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.150
That gets rid of them.

21
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.260
You can see we also have the Ariel font.

22
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.390
Next thing I want to do is add a border around the whole UL.

23
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.800
So we'll say border and let's set it to one pixel.

24
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.910
I want to do a light gray so I'm going to do deed and let's do solid.

25
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.830
Save that good.

26
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.990
Let's do a border radius.

27
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:08.030
Just to add a slight curve, I'll do ten pixels and let's set a width of 300 pixels, kind of shorten

28
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.030
it a little bit and let's set the padding.

29
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.150
Now by default, unordered lists have 40 pixels padding on the left, as you can see, that's pushed

30
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.750
over.

31
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.310
So doing padding 20 pixels on all sides is going to overwrite that.

32
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.900
So if I save that, you can see now we have 20 pixels on all sides.

33
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.400
And I think yeah, I think that's all I want to do for the UL.

34
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.250
So now we're going to focus on the list items themselves.

35
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:46.070
So side not slide side menu list items and we want to set the font size a little bigger by default.

36
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.590
It's 16, we're going to set it to 18.

37
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.170
I think I have this zoomed in.

38
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.660
Let me just see real quick.

39
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.840
Yeah.

40
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.430
So that's a that's normal.

41
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.570
That's 100%.

42
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.400
So font size 18, I also want them spread apart quite a bit.

43
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.930
So I'm going to use line height and set it to 2.4.

44
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.540
Mm.

45
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.350
Save that and it's going to spread them apart.

46
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.800
Let's see, what else do we want here.

47
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.350
Let's do a border bottom on each one

48
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.430
and I'm going to do dotted for the style one pixel and the same color as the UL border.

49
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.990
So you can see that each one now has this this bottom border.

50
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.150
Now, one thing I want to show you is the borders are I put them here to separate the links and we don't

51
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.070
need the last one under contact.

52
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.570
So we can actually use a pseudo pseudo selector called last child to target the last list item.

53
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:56.690
So let's say side menu, Li Colon, last child and we'll get into some of the other pseudo selectors

54
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.350
later on.

55
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.550
We can select the first one.

56
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.470
We can select anything in the middle.

57
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.030
We can do like all the even all the odd and it's pretty powerful.

58
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.390
But just for now, we're going to use last child and set border to none and save.

59
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.290
And now the last link here or the last list item doesn't have a border.

60
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.390
So for the styling of the actual links, the colour and the underline, we have to target the a tag.

61
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:31.640
So let's do side menu list item A and let's change the color to three, three, three.

62
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.210
Let's get rid of the underline with text decoration.

63
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.930
None.

64
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.550
Save that.

65
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.890
And for the hover right now, it doesn't change at all.

66
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.170
So I want to actually change the color for that.

67
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.670
So let's say side.

68
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.190
I don't know why I keep doing slide.

69
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.840
Let's do like a colon hover and let's change the color to coral.

70
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.210
So now when I hover over a link, it turns into the coral color.

71
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.290
All right.

72
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.270
So I think that that's pretty much it.

73
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.160
It's not the best looking menu, but it looks a lot better than the standard unordered list.

74
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.640
So now we're going to move on to the navigation menu.

75
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.330
So I'm just going to put a comment right here.

76
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.920
Side menu.

77
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.400
And down here, let's just copy this up.

78
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:37.440
So I'm going to do shift option up and this one, I'm going to change the class to NAV Bar and let's

79
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.270
just put a couple of line breaks in between these two to kind of just separate them a little bit.

80
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.320
All right.

81
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.580
So this is our nav bar.

82
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:52.410
So we want this to be to go straight across and we want these links or the list items to float.

83
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.420
So let's go under.

84
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.360
Actually, we'll go above since nav bars at the top.

85
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.510
All right.

86
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.960
So we want to target the UL, which is called NAV Bar.

87
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.360
And the first thing I want to do is remove the list, the bullets.

88
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.000
So we're going to say list style none.

89
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.770
Okay.

90
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.530
Now I want to take away all the margin and all the padding.

91
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.990
Save that.

92
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.560
Good.

93
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.060
Let's see.

94
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.660
Next thing we want to do is add the background.

95
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:43.140
I'm going to use that Facebook style blue, which is 4c6, c, a zero.

96
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.690
Okay.

97
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.010
We'll save that.

98
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.400
Let's add a border radius of five pixels.

99
00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.290
Now I'm going to go down here and we're going to say nav bar list item and we want to float these because

100
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.970
we want them to be side by side.

101
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.590
We don't want them to go down.

102
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.090
We don't want them to be vertical.

103
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.300
So let's float all of the list items to the left so they'll kind of just stack side by side.

104
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.590
So we'll save that.

105
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.000
And it happened.

106
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.480
They float.

107
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:23.310
They float now to the left, but the background is now gone since we floated it, it kind of just kind

108
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.650
of collapsed the background.

109
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:33.480
So the way that we can fix this is go to the nav bar, the parent element, and we want to add in overflow

110
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.230
and set that to auto and save.

111
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.060
And now we get the background back.

112
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.900
All right.

113
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:46.290
Because now the background is going to basically pertain to whatever content is inside of it.

114
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.530
And you can set this to hidden as well.

115
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:55.680
If you have some some content that goes outside of the element and it has a scroll bar and let's say

116
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.750
you don't want that scroll bar there, you can set overflow to hidden and I'm sure we'll run into that

117
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.350
later.

118
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.240
But now that we have the background, let's start to style the links.

119
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:19.170
So we want to say nav bar like a and let's change the color to white and we'll take away the underline.

120
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.240
Save that and we want to display as block.

121
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.289
Let's actually it's actually move this up to the top

122
00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:44.550
now since we display block we we can add some padding and it's going to actually it's going to give

123
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.920
some space on the top bottom here also space in between all of the links.

124
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.370
So let's say for each link, we want some padding.

125
00:08:53.370 --> 00:09:00.600
We want to do 15 on the top and bottom and we want to do 20 on the left and right.

126
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.100
So let's save that.

127
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.270
And there we go.

128
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.860
So it kind of filled out the the wrapper, the nav bar UL.

129
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.060
All right.

130
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.620
So that looks pretty good.

131
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.460
Let's make it so that when we hover over a link, the background changes color.

132
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.750
So I'm just going to make it a slightly darker than the blue it already is.

133
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.580
So let's say nav bar

134
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:32.490
list item a hover and we're going to do a background

135
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.750
color and that's going to be let's see, what is that going to be?

136
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:46.350
446190, which is slightly darker.

137
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.210
We can also change the color of the text.

138
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.940
We'll just do like a light gray slight change.

139
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:57.150
So now if we go up and we hover, you'll see that it changes the background and it takes up the whole

140
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.060
the whole area of the link.

141
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.720
Now sometimes you might see people put the padding on the list item, but that's not really a good idea,

142
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.970
especially if you want to have the the hover state take up the whole thing like this.

143
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:18.450
Otherwise it would just take up like a square around it, which doesn't look very good and you'll see

144
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.970
different ways to create nav bars.

145
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:28.500
I think that this specific CSS is probably the easiest to do this and you'll see if I make this bigger,

146
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.130
it just stretches along if I make it really small.

147
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.110
Well, actually, we don't have enough links here, but if we had more links, it would just knock on

148
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.420
to the next line, which doesn't look very good.

149
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.120
So later on, I'm going to show you how to create a more responsive nav bar where it will kind of,

150
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:51.660
you know, when you get to a certain screen size, like like for a smartphone, they'll actually switch

151
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.560
to going this way and it'll look nice and neat, centered and stuff like that.

152
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:55.950
All right.

153
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.050
So next, I quickly want to look at the display property.

154
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:04.740
You see how a display block here we can change in line to block and vice versa.

155
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.080
There's also something called inline block.

156
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.350
So we're going to we're going to take a look at that in the next video.
