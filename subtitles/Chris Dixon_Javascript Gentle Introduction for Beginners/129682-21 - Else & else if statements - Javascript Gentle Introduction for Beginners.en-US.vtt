00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.170
Welcome back, everybody. In the last video,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.420
we took a look at if statements.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
If statements check if a condition is met,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.745
and then if that condition is true,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.440
we then run some code.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.095
Though if we had more than one outcome,

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:18.510
we need a way to deal with that.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.195
We can deal with that by using a else statement or a else-if statement.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.670
Let's put that in a new folder.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.295
Duplicate the last video,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.745
in fact, when I number this they're in order.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:38.080
Number 1, and then this is going to be number 2,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.810
this is else and else-if.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.750
Then open up your text editor,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.400
and then change the name at the top.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.560
This is going to be else statements,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.370
and else-if, just moving down between the script tags.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.100
Rather than delete, this we can actually do is build on the last video to start with.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.030
We check in if a user is logged in.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.105
If that user is logged in,

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:32.310
we send a message to the user,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.115
but this provides no backup in case the user is not logged in.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:40.725
This is where a else statement can be used.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.210
Just after the curly brace,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.740
we can then type else and then provide a second set of curly braces,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.015
and this is for the condition if the user is not logged in.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:55.895
We can just copy the document,

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:58.885
paste in between the braces.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.415
This time if the user is not logged in,

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:06.290
we're just going to send a message to that user just to log them in.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.410
Please login to view page.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.990
We still got the variable of logged in set to false,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.840
so now we should get the login message. There we go.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.610
Please log in to view page,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.730
this is used as a fallback in case the original statement is not true.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.080
If-else statements are used quite regularly in programming languages.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.960
It's a really useful concept to get used to.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.130
[inaudible] if-else statement, and you may be wondering what to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.930
do if there is a third option or a third condition to meet,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.465
and this is pretty straightforward.

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:53.165
We can just build on overall,

00:02:53.165 --> 00:03:01.275
and in between the if-statements and the else statements where you simply use a else-if.

00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:04.605
We'll create a new example.

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:06.555
Just delete all that.

00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:10.670
I'm going to create a example just to show you how this is used.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.600
This is based on a car's speed.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.260
We're going to check a variable,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.420
which is the speed limit.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.445
For example, I'm going to set the speed limits to be 70,

00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:29.600
and then a second variable which is your speed,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.020
and also set this to 70 just to begin with.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.070
As an example, we're going to print a message to the car's display.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:50.565
Create an if-statement, and the if-statement want to check if your speed,

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:53.595
put that variable inside there,

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:56.830
is less than the speed limit.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.915
Paste inside there,

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:05.390
so if your speed that you are doing is less than the current speed limits,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.050
we can create a message with a document rights,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.500
such as, thank you for driving safely.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.115
Just remove the sidebar to get a bit more space there,

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:32.225
and then we can create a else-if and then the brackets and then the curly braces.

00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:35.030
If your speed is greater,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.414
we just copy this condition based on in the else-if,

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:44.715
and it changes to greater than.

00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:48.150
If you go on over the speed limit,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.350
let's put an over document right inside there,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.510
and this time say, please slow down.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.130
Then we're just going to finish this with a else statements as the backup.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.995
You can put more than one else-if statements in there if you want,

00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.355
it just needs to go straight after the last curly brace,

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:13.725
but make sure an else statement is at the end.

00:05:13.725 --> 00:05:18.440
As a fallback, if the speed is equal to the speed limit,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.790
just put a simple message into there such as,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.230
careful, you are driving at the speed limits.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.885
We don't need to put brackets inside there with a condition,

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:43.070
just for this time because there is only one [inaudible] conditions to meet.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.075
We've covered if the speed is less than or greater than the speed limit,

00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:53.875
the only over possible outcome we can get is if the speeds are equal,

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:57.165
and this is covered by the else statement there.

00:05:57.165 --> 00:06:02.330
Let's take a look. Currently you've got the speed limit to be equal to your speed,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.850
we should get the careful message at the very end there.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.970
Let's open this up. We'll get careful you are driving at the speed limits.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.920
Let's change the variables.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.890
We've put you're speed to be 60,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.650
we should get, thank you for driving safely.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.920
Refresh that, and there we go,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.575
says the thank you message.

00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:37.855
On the last one to check is if your speed is greater than the speed limit,

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:41.180
which you get the please slow down message,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.145
which we do that, so that's great.

00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:47.350
Thank you for watching, and this is the end of the video

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.960
on else statements and else-if statements.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.360
In the next video, we're going to put these into practice with a little mini challenge.
