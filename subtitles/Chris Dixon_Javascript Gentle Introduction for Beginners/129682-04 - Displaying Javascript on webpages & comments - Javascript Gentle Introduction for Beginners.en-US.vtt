00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.810
Welcome back. In the last video,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.650
we looked at how we can use alerts to alert users to a certain message on the webpage.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.420
In this video, we're going to take a look at

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.700
some different methods of how we can include JavaScript's onto our webpages.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.545
We'll also take a look at how we can include comments in JavaScript for making notes,

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:26.920
and also commenting out our code when we no longer need it.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.895
If you go into the JavaScript folder and still in the understanding JavaScript section,

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:36.750
I'm just going to select the first one that we created and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
then press Command or Control D to duplicate.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.910
Or if you prefer, you can copy and paste.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.870
I'm going to call this comments and display in JavaScript.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.985
Then open up brackets or your text editor.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:03.660
Then dragging the new file that we just created.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.180
Then open up the index page.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230
We've got the alert box that we created in the last video.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.585
If you just get rid of that for now,

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:17.450
so we don't get that popping up every time we go into

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.870
the browser and then change the title,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.030
to comments and display in JavaScript.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.460
In fact, we don't need to use this external alert file. We can get rid of that.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.230
Open up your script tags either in the head or the body section. It doesn't matter.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.890
In the last video we looked at add in a alert to alert the user to a message.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.265
It doesn't have to be texts that we can alert to the user.

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:58.490
We can also use numbers and mass.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.060
We can alert at 10, take away free.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.285
Then if we go over to the browser,

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:12.950
you can see that the calculation has been performed and we get the results of seven.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.619
As well as the alert box is different methods we can use to display JavaScript.

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.630
Another method is the console log.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.545
Instead of the alert,

00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:30.670
we can type in the console and we can send a log to the console of the same message.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.290
If you go over to your web browser.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.450
If you're using Chrome just right-click and go to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.300
Inspect Element and you can toggle between

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.190
the bottom and side by clicking

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.790
these three dots and then clicking on the dock side that you prefer.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.655
If you go down to the bottom, just make a bit more space.

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:53.680
You can see there is the Console tab.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.050
So select the Console tab and you can see that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.145
the result that we just created of seven is appearing in the console.

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:04.420
The console is often used for debugging

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.765
rather than displaying alerts to the user on the screen.

00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:10.450
We can just keep it confined to the console.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.850
We can print things to the console such as error messages.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.470
That's really good for debugging.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.680
If we go back over to brackets,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.550
as well as the alerts and the console log.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.310
We can also use what's called the document.write.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.470
As you go through the course, you'll see the word document quite often.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.085
The document is the full webpage that we're targeting.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:41.710
I'm going to write to the page whatever is in between these brackets.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.115
Save and then refresh.

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:48.055
Now appearing on the webpage we've got the results of seven.

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:51.665
But we need to be careful when using document.write.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.530
If it's used after the page has fully loaded,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.060
it will overwrite the whole page with the result.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.560
So we need to be careful when using that.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.390
Again, as well as maps,

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.825
we can include text such as hello and that will appear on the page are exactly the same.

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:13.850
The last thing I want to show you is how we can

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.395
manipulate the current HTML which is on the webpage.

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:23.360
So I'm just going to go down to the body section and create some HTML.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.220
I'm going to create a h1 heading and just leave the contents blank for now.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.805
The h1 I'm going to give a id of title and average,

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:40.190
copy the script tag. Just onto the bottom there.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.830
So we're going to use JavaScript now to manipulate the HTML which is currently there.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.955
There's actually no text in the h1 heading at the moment.

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:53.110
But you can use JavaScript to put some text in there.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.180
Just as before, we're going to target the full document to

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.490
start with and then use the dot.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.295
Then we're going to narrow down the full document to the element that we want to change,

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:06.665
which has the id of title.

00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:12.180
JavaScript has a way of doing this called getElementsById.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.170
Notice that all the words apart from

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.130
the first one begins with a capital letter to make it more readable.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.670
This is fairly standard in a lot of programming languages.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.865
It's what's called camel case.

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:30.590
The full document is being narrowed down to

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.200
an element which we are going to slip by its id.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.995
In brackets and then quotations,

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:39.800
we can add the id that we want to target,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.570
in our case here its title,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.450
and then nova dot.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.920
We want to select

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.345
the inner HTML and then

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:56.420
equals and then we can put in quotes the text that we want to replace.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.050
So we want to display on the screen the text.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.200
In my case, when I put displaying

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:14.360
JavaScript in webpages and semicolon at the end of that statement.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.100
I hope that makes sense.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.030
We said in a HTML element which has no text another minute.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.410
Then we'll select in the full document or the full webpage.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.630
Then we narrow it down to the id of title.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.675
Then we set innerHTML,

00:06:30.675 --> 00:06:32.895
which is the section in between.

00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:38.640
We set in our value to be equal to this text here. Let's save that.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.580
If you refresh the web browser,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.795
we've now got the text that we set in h1 heading.

00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:47.930
So this method is lot more commonly used and can

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.085
be a bit safer than using document.write.

00:06:51.085 --> 00:06:53.300
Now we'll looked at four different methods of,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.840
including JavaScript, into our webpages.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.845
When I head back over to the text editor and take a look at JavaScript comments.

00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:05.315
Comments are available in JavaScript,

00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:07.940
just like many other programming languages.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.940
If you want to add some notes.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.395
With JavaScript, we want these notes not to be read by the browser.

00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:18.365
We can add a double forward slash.

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:20.720
This is for the single line comments.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.785
We can make some notes such as set innerHTML.

00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:30.530
Adding comments can be useful if you take a breakaway from

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.815
coding and you come back after even just a week or two,

00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:36.245
that can really help you remember what you were doing.

00:07:36.245 --> 00:07:38.300
As well as adding notes for yourself,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.500
you can also comment out the actual code in just the same way.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.645
You can see it goes gray.

00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:48.670
This section of code now won't be read by the browser.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.855
It's useful if you just want to

00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:55.115
temporarily remove a section of code without actually deleting it.

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:59.645
So the two forward slashes are used for single lines.

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:04.625
If you have many different lines or a block of code you want to comment on,

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.950
you can use a multi-line comment,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.740
which begins with a forward slash and

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.040
then the star and then ends with the star and the forward slash.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.060
That's the end of this video on comments on display in JavaScript.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.620
Thank you for watching, and we'll see you in the next video.
