00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.405
In this video, we're going to take a look at JavaScript dates.

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:13.740
Let's get started in the usual way and create a new folder.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.840
I'm just going to duplicate the mini-challenges from the last video and call it Dates.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:29.110
Then open up your text editor and then drag the dates folder in there.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.210
Now the title is going to be JavaScript dates.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.750
We can just delete the code from the last video between the script tags.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.115
Just to begin with, we're going to start with

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:56.375
a simple way of creating a new dates object,

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.180
and we're going to store that inside a variable.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.315
Start by creating a variable,

00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:03.315
and you can call it whatever you want.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:07.020
I'm going to call mine show date.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.190
Then we need to set that equal to a new date.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.790
You need to put brackets after that.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.640
Then we can use a document.write or any other method which you

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.930
prefer to show the variable of show date,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.595
so put that in-between the brackets,

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:32.350
and then a semicolon.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.340
There we go, so now we get the full date printed on the browser and you'll

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.650
obviously get a different dates on there depending on

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.735
what day you're watching this video, and your time zone.

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:48.000
Using this day object, it gives us the current day, the month,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.490
the day of the month,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.085
the year, the current time,

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:54.660
and then the time zone.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.450
This formula is pretty long and often we don't want all this information.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.305
I'm going to show you next, get and set methods.

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:06.345
They're pretty much what they sound like,

00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:10.665
a get method is used for getting a certain path of the date.

00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:13.500
So we can get the individual hours,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.615
we can get the individual day,

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:18.510
or the seconds, or the time.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.365
Then we can also use set methods which are used for setting a path of the date,

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:29.770
such as set the current time or set the current date.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.175
Let's start by taking a look at the get methods.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:37.055
Each one of these get methods I'm going to show you,

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.680
I'm going to store it inside a variable.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.580
To start with I'm going to set the variable called date,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.470
and then set that equal to a new date,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.825
starting with a capital D,

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:53.470
and then the brackets.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.110
Now we've got the current date.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.890
We can split that up into the day of the month.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.940
Again, it doesn't matter what you call these variables,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.805
just make them descriptive.

00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:12.530
I'm going to set that equal to the date variable that we created,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.395
and then paste that in, and then use dot,

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.345
and then get date.

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.745
You can actually see of the autocomplete there.

00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:24.415
This will give you an idea of what we're about to do.

00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:29.865
Get dates and a semicolon at the end.

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:32.060
We're creating a new dates object,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.055
and then we just get an individual property each time.

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:39.065
I'm just going to duplicate that line.

00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:43.130
This time I'm going to call it the day of week,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.930
then this time its date.getDay.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.710
Then to get the month, let's create a new variable of month.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.365
You could probably guess what we're about to do here.

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:01.940
It's date.getMonth.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.620
You can also get the current year. We need to get year.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.020
By the way, you can have to just copy and paste these,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.395
or I'm using command or control D to duplicate in brackets.

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:23.760
If the text editor you are using doesn't duplicate,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.410
just copy and paste.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.040
After the year we can get the hours

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.480
and then minutes, date.getMinutes.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:56.780
Then the last one I want to show you is the seconds, so date.getSeconds.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.200
We'll just comment out these two lines out, we don't need them.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.650
Now we've got all these variables created and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.700
we may want to just use certain parts of the date.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.605
For example, we may want to create a string,

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:17.600
such as today's date is,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.505
and then input the day,

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:21.335
the month, and the year.

00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:25.920
Let's give it a go. Let's do a document.write.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.410
Then between the quotations,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:39.555
I'm going to create a string of today's date is and then a colon.

00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:43.700
I'll put these on separate lines so it's a little bit more readable.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:51.750
We want to show the day and then the month, and then the year.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.950
We wanted to display this in the browser, just as it is.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:04.035
We can put some HTML break tags in there and then end the string on there,

00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:08.145
and then we need to concatenate to join the strings,

00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:10.260
just use the plus symbol.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.850
Because each one of these words is a string,

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.760
surround them in the quotes.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.130
The same with the year.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.340
It's pretty simple to do this,

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.755
so we've got the day string with a space and then plus.

00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:36.745
Then the day is the variable called day of week.

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:42.490
We can join now onto the end of the month.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.115
We need to join on the variable name of month.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:51.810
Then the year, simply add the year.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.580
We can see our code is pretty readable now because we've used descriptive variable names.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.340
Make sure you do that when you can.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.735
Then lastly, we just need to add onto the end

00:07:02.735 --> 00:07:08.330
a break tag just so they are on separate lines and then another join at the end.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.380
The break tag needs to be displayed like that.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.910
Then do it on the next line too.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.635
Copy that, and that brings us up to our next line, as you can see by.

00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:24.570
We don't need that.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.225
Then finish that with a semicolon.

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:30.600
We started with a string there, today's date is,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.585
we put break tagging to get onto the next line,

00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:37.730
and then we're going to have three separate lines which display the day,

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.695
the month, and the current year.

00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:45.315
Let's save that and see if that works okay in the browser. Refresh that.

00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:49.805
So we've got the today's day is, the day number,

00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:53.600
the month number, and the year is 116,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.220
so we need to change that.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.230
We've done the year.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:05.065
We need to put the get full year into there.

00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:08.055
There we go. So it's 2016 now.

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:10.710
I hope that makes sense.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.745
I'm just going to comment this section out now.

00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:16.460
These are the get methods,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:22.490
and I want to move now onto set methods which are used to set the date.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.840
Let's begin with a new variable called set date,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.850
and just as above,

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.250
we're going to set that equal to a new date.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.280
Then now we can set some parts of the date.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.090
So if we wanted to set the column month,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.420
we could use the set name variable,

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.660
then dot, and then we need to set

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:55.890
the month and then place the month that you want to set inside the brackets.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.785
We can set that as 11, for example.

00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:02.210
Then if we wanted to set the year, again,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:08.520
use the set date variable and then dot set full year.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.565
You can set that to whatever you like.

00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:14.130
I'm going to put in 2020.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.905
You can see that these are pretty similar to the ones that we used above,

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:22.085
we're just replacing get with set.

00:09:22.085 --> 00:09:25.750
Let's check if it's working with the document write.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.200
Then inside document write we're going to use the set date variable.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.250
So we take a closer look there,

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.645
you can see that we've got the month of December.

00:09:41.645 --> 00:09:43.745
We put in the 11th month,

00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:49.039
which is actually the last value because the set month goes from 0-11,

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:52.080
so 11 would be December.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.370
We set the full year to be 2020,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.395
and you can see that inside the browser there.

00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:04.035
We haven't touched the time, so that's the current timezone there. There we go.

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:05.610
I hope that makes sense.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.855
Do have a little play around with what we've just looked at.

00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:12.570
Thanks for watching, and will see you in the next video.
