00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.830
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.020
we're going to be taking a break from the theory and creating a mini challenge,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.969
which is going to be a simple,

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.620
higher or lower game,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.050
and it's basically going to consist of

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.855
a computer generated random number between one and 10.

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:24.780
Then we need to guess if the number that

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.640
the computer will generate it is higher or lower than five.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.790
We're going to create a simple webpage with a couple of buttons on which is higher

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.970
or lower and then we need to create a display which shows if the guess is correct or not.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.300
Most of the things that you need for

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.735
this challenge has already been covered in this section.

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:53.135
The only thing that we haven't looked at yet is onclick events and that is basically when

00:00:53.135 --> 00:01:00.745
a user clicks on the button on the webpage and that triggers a function or an event.

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:03.650
This function will contain the code which compares

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.225
our guess with the computer's generated number.

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:10.490
So if you'd like to give the a go yourself,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.855
feel free to do that.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:17.915
Or I'm going to get started and start with the HTML and show you the onclick events.

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:21.740
So if you prefer, you can follow along with me, open SoloLearn,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.125
and then give the JavaScript to go at the end

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:27.935
or follow along with me right to the very end if you prefer.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:31.060
So let's get started with its own folder.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.475
In the control flow and loop section,

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:39.425
we can duplicate the last video and it's number 6.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:44.370
So higher, lower game.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:55.290
Then open your text editor and then change its title,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.180
higher or lower game.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.800
We don't need the switch statement from the last video.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.085
So just delete that and get back to a basic HTML index page.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:14.975
I'm going to start by creating the webpage of the user interface.

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:18.360
I'm going to start it with a div.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.320
I'm going to get this class, well,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.690
this is a Bootstrap class which will hold all the divs that we're working on.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.780
It will make it stand out with a background color.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.465
Also, I want to use the class of text-center,

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:41.340
and this will pull all the text into the middle of the page.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.285
I'm just going to put some instructions on the page you start with.

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:49.684
So it's title first,

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:55.580
higher or lower and then a level 2 heading,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.235
which is the instructions on how to play.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:08.640
So is my number 5 or less or higher than five.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.655
Then some p tags below.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:17.850
This is just going to show the range.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.300
The range for the random number is 1-10.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.415
Then below that we need a empty div.

00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:29.035
So I'm just going to put a level 3 heading in there.

00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:31.970
Initially there will been no content in between

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.510
these tags because we're going to put that in using the JavaScript.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.050
This would be where the text is displayed to say if you won or lost.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.440
Let's give it an ID so we can tag that with the JavaScript later.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.630
So I'm going to call mine textField.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.480
Let's just take a look at that and see how it's looking.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.790
We've got the name on the instructions.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.240
Now we need to create a couple of buttons below.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.610
One with higher, and one with lower.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.020
Let's put that in a input.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.970
So the input type is button.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.595
Let's add some Bootstrap classes to that just to make it look a little nicer.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.740
So btn and btn-info,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.840
and that's going to create a nice blue button for us.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.275
The value that we need, this is going to be the text which appears inside one.

00:04:38.275 --> 00:04:40.865
Let's put this one as higher.

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:43.600
Then we mentioned at the start of this video that

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.910
we're going to take a look at onclick events.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.595
We'll look at these in a little more detail later on in this course.

00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:56.880
But for now we just need to know if we add the attributes or onclick.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.035
Then we can pass in the name of a function.

00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:02.075
When this button is pressed,

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:04.485
it then triggers the function.

00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:07.060
Let's put the function name.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.960
Although we haven't created the function yet, we can still put it in.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.935
Then because it's a function,

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:15.549
put the curly brackets afterwards,

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:20.120
just in the same way as we would normally call or invoke a function.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.610
We'll create our function soon.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.010
That's the higher button.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.080
Copy and paste or duplicate our inputs and that will make

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.970
the lower button and change the function this time to lower.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.450
Then let's take a look.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.380
Great. There's our higher and lower buttons.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.010
Just the last thing I want to put in for the user interface is a third button,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.370
which is just a Play Again button.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.440
After each case we can press ''Play Again'' and the page will be reloaded.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.370
I'll put this in its own div, so appears below.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:13.920
The div, we'll also give this the class of well text-center,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.795
just like this div above and then a input with a type of

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:29.680
button and then some Bootstrap classes of btn btn-info.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.840
The value is Play Again.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:48.450
Then the onclick events and then we'll call this one reset with the brackets afterwards.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:54.010
Let's refresh the browser and take a look. That's looking better now.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:00.605
Now we've got to the stage where the HTML or the user interface is complete.

00:07:00.605 --> 00:07:03.805
If you like to give that a go and finish off yourself,

00:07:03.805 --> 00:07:05.240
feel free to do that.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.990
All you need to do is create a random number and then create some functions which

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.310
are triggered every time these buttons are pressed

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.970
and then to check against the randomly generated number.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.720
So give it a go, if not,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.490
just follow along with me.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.355
Let's go back over to the text editor.

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:25.810
I'm going to start working between

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.020
the script tags because we just need to do the JavaScript now.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.435
To begin with, we'll get the randomly generated number.

00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:38.290
So we'll put that inside a variable called

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:47.860
computerGuess and this is going to be a math.random.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.520
If you remember from a couple of videos ago,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.575
math.random generates a random number between zero and one.

00:07:56.575 --> 00:07:59.710
Because we want 10,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.795
let's multiply this value by 10.

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:05.820
Then we need to round that number up.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:12.825
So let's change the computerGuess now to be equal to math.ceil.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:17.380
This will round up and then pass inside the brackets,

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.420
the variable that we want to round up, which is computerGuess.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.440
Now let's just print this to the console and

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.640
check that it's all working correctly with a console log,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.770
and I'll put inside the computerGuess,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.500
and hopefully we should get a random number between one and 10.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:46.955
So go into the Developer Tools and there we go.

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:52.265
We've got the value of seven inside the console and then refresh and as a 4,

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:59.570
9, 9, 9 again and a 1, a 2.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.825
That seems to be working okay.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:07.820
Let's just get rid of the Developer Tools and we can move on.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.670
We can remove the console log now we don't need that.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.860
Inside the HTML we created the onclick events.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.700
I'm going to start with the higher function because we called the function,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.880
but we haven't declared it yet.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.305
Back between the script tags.

00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:31.870
Hopefully you can remember how to create a function using the function keyword,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.910
then the function name with the brackets.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.430
What do we want this function to do?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:43.565
Well, we want it to check if the computer's guess is higher than five.

00:09:43.565 --> 00:09:46.680
Let's create an if statement in there,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:55.470
if the computer's guess is greater than five.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.650
Now we want to display a message.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:05.060
If you remember, we created a empty h3 tag with an ID of textField.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.315
So we can use JavaScript to grab

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:13.715
this empty div or empty heading and then insert some text into there.

00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:21.590
So document.getElementByid, and the ID that we want is

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:30.570
textField and then we want to use the innerHTML.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:37.840
So select innerHTML, I'm going to set that to be equal to You Win.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:45.180
If the user clicks higher and the guess is greater than five, the user wins.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:51.640
So else, let us copy this document.getElementByid,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.305
else and then the curly braces.

00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:58.280
So if the guess is lower than five or five itself,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:05.905
we can then grab the textField heading and this time print a text, You Lose.

00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.080
That will also create the higher function and now we need to

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.950
create the function if the lower button is pressed.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.875
Because this is going to be fairly similar,

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:24.070
we can copy the function that we just created and then we'll change this to lower.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:31.160
This time, if the computer's guess is lower than or equal to five,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.080
then the user wins.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.675
If not, the user loses and the message will be displayed.

00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:42.065
Now we've got the functionality if the guess is higher or lower.

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:46.970
Now we just need to work with the reset button just to clear

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:52.480
the screen or to refresh the screen every time the user wants to play again.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.470
This is going to be a simple function,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.645
but it's something we've not quite looked at yet in this course.

00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:07.590
So function reset, and then to reload the webpage,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.760
we crop the window.location.reload,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.639
and then the brackets afterwards.

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:20.255
Every time this reset button is pressed,

00:12:20.255 --> 00:12:24.875
the webpage will be refreshed with this line of code.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:29.610
Let's save that and take a look and refresh the browser.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.635
Let's start with higher,

00:12:31.635 --> 00:12:36.970
so you win, play again, lower, you lose.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.670
Let's try a few more times so you lose.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:47.585
You win, you win, you lose.

00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:49.900
That seems to be working okay.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.230
That's the basic functionality or working for the game.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.655
If you'd like to take it that little bit further,

00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:59.555
when the user's guess is incorrect and you lose,

00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:01.895
you can then put some text in there,

00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:05.860
which displays the random number generated by the computer,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.030
just so you can check what that was.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.420
But for now, I'm trying to leave this game there, and thank you.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.290
I hope you managed to do at least some more yourself and join me in

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:20.970
the next video where we'll take a look at loops and how they're used in JavaScript.
