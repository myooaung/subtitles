00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.295
Congratulations on getting to the end of this course,

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:07.890
and now we're going to go into a really fun part where we're going to get

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.620
to create a business card application.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.650
This is an example of what I'd like you to build.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.595
It's something I've created to go through and show you how it's done.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:21.660
However, I've intentionally left it fairly basic,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.365
so I'd like you to really get creative and show off what you can do.

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.990
So I'd suggest giving us ago as usual,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.155
and then getting all the basic layout created,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:35.325
and then getting all functionality working using JavaScript.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.835
In my version, I've created two sections.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:44.470
The left-hand side is a user's inputs where they can put in the name of their company,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.335
and they can also add various texts such as names,

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:51.230
job titles, and contact information.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.620
They can also add a little bit of style into the business card using

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.415
the background colors and also change the color of the text and the text alignment,

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:04.730
and then there's a right-hand div which includes a sample business card,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.880
and all the changes which are placed inside

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.910
the left div and then dynamically inserted into the business card.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.225
You can see as soon as you put in any information in the left-hand side,

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:19.820
it's then replicated into the business card.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.655
You can change any of these values,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.960
and it's all changed straightaway.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.230
Have a go replicating this yourself and see what you can create,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.610
and then upload it at the end.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.530
I'd love to see what you can come up with,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.275
and hopefully, you can achieve all this by itself.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:40.445
If not, just follow along with me,

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:43.600
and I'll show you how I created this.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.535
Let's start with its own folder.

00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:53.040
Let's just copy any of the videos which has the HTML skeleton,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.890
and then rename the folder,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:06.030
business-card-project, and drag it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.090
into brackets and change the title.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.440
That's now the clean page,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.920
so I'll get rid of the style tags and anything else is inside the HTML or the JavaScript.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.470
The example I've copied has

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.135
the index page photos and we also need an external JavaScript file.

00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:33.745
I've already got the alert.js,

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:36.445
so I'm just going to change this to

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:42.980
custom.js and then also create a new page for the style sheet.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.480
This is a style.css,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.790
and then let's add these into the next page.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.770
Let's add the style sheet to start with,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.095
and this is just in the root directory.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:01.170
The link is your style.css,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.830
and then the script tag, I'm going to add right at the very bottom of the body.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.880
Then the source, again,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.120
it's in the root directory so we can just go to custom.js.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.540
Let's make some space there.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.520
To begin, I'm going to create some divs and I'm going to use

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.560
the Bootstrap grid to help us out on that.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.510
Let's get started with the heading of the page.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.280
Let's create a div with a class of container-fluid,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.565
and we'll make this a responsive project.

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:41.710
Then the div with the class of row,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.545
and then to make this the full width of the page,

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:48.650
let's create a div with the col,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.870
a class of col-sm-12,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.265
and then the level 1 heading,

00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:58.930
which is Business Card Designer,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.085
and then a second container fluid,

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:12.320
which is going to be the container for both the left div and the right div.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.610
A new div with the class of container-fluid,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.170
and let's make some space there.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.315
So there's going to be two sections to this part.

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:25.625
There's going to be the input,

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:29.950
which is where the user inputs the form information.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.890
Let's just create a comment of input section,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.670
and then let's create the grid for this.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.395
Let's create a div with the class,

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:51.810
the Bootstrap class of col-sm-12.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.760
It's 12-column grid for width on the smaller devices.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.040
The medium sized devices will make it half the width of the page, so col-md-6.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.225
Then so we can style this ourselves,

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:09.800
I'm going to add our own custom class of backgrounds,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.050
and we'll use that in just a bit in the CSS.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.524
Now, we need to create our HTML form for all the user inputs,

00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:24.250
and let's give this form an ID of cardInfo.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.590
You can call this whatever you want. It doesn't really matter.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.614
Then let's add some classes,

00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:34.480
so a Bootstrap class of form-horizontal.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.860
Then inside this form,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.830
let's create some Bootstrap form-groups.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.455
The first form-group in its own div.

00:05:46.455 --> 00:05:49.280
Inside this class of form-group,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.270
we're going to create some sections of the form.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.860
We're going to create the labels on the left-hand side and then the inputs on the right.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.640
We want the label on the left-hand side to use a Bootstrap grid.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.070
This is going to take up three columns,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.140
which will leave a remaining nine columns for the input.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.900
Let's create the label now.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.820
This label is for the input,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.070
which will give an ID of inputCompany.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.045
The way I'm going to arrange the IDs in this project is anything on the left-hand side,

00:06:25.045 --> 00:06:30.400
which is the user input is going to have an ID begin with input.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.895
The first one is inputCompany and level of input message for example,

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:39.505
and then on the right-hand side in the business card,

00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:41.110
I'm going to create the ID,

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.390
so this section, to begin with output.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.175
This will be outputCompany and outputMessage for example.

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:51.505
Just so it's clear, once we get to the JavaScript section,

00:06:51.505 --> 00:06:54.550
which ID we're currently using.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.180
Now, we've got the label for inputCompany.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.905
Let's add the Bootstrap classes.

00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:08.680
This one is col-sm-3 and also control-label,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.500
and the text is Company Name,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.070
and then a colon, and then the input next.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.680
The input we want is just text,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.140
and then the class, again,

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.180
a Bootstrap class of form-control,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.050
and then the ID.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.990
It's just the ID that we've put inside the label.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.045
The ID is equal to inputCompany,

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:46.930
and then the last thing is the onkeyup.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.050
Every time a key is released,

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.040
we want it to trigger the function of printCompany.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.010
So this will print the company name to the business card side.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.090
Let's save that and let's open the browser.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:13.720
It's a little bit messy now. I think we just need to put the input inside a div.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:19.300
Let's create a Bootstrap div with the class of col-sm-9,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.390
and then move the closing div to after the input.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.695
The label's got the three parts.

00:08:31.695 --> 00:08:35.800
The input has remained nine columns.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.955
That's looking a little bit better now.

00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:43.020
Let's move onto the company message.You can

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.130
either type all this all over again or you can just copy this div section,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.585
and then just paste that below,

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:55.795
and then just a simple case of changing some of the values.

00:08:55.795 --> 00:08:58.525
This one is inputMessage.

00:08:58.525 --> 00:09:02.750
The company name is now our Company Message,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:12.540
and then we need to change the ID and then also the function name to be printMessage,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.670
and that should be all we need for the message.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.880
Let's just refresh and there is the message.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.235
Now, we need to move onto the background on the text color.

00:09:25.235 --> 00:09:32.640
Let's go back over to the text editor and then we can paste in the form-group again.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:40.395
The inputs, I'm going to call mine inputBg for background,

00:09:40.395 --> 00:09:44.080
and then change the ID.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.280
Change the label to background color.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.440
Because of selecting a color,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.620
we want change the input type to be color.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.420
The ID is correct,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.505
and then we need to add a value,

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:07.025
and this is going to be the initial value.

00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:09.595
I'm just going to add a value into that,

00:10:09.595 --> 00:10:13.100
a hex value or ffb74d.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.325
We're going to use a different event handle this time.

00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:21.190
This time I'm going to use onchange.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.440
Every time the color is changed,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.920
it will then trigger the function called changeBg,

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:36.300
and we can also reuse this part because the next one is to change the text color.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.710
This also needs to have the input type of color,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:45.030
but we just need to change inputBg to inputText.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.240
Change the input id and then this time,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.680
we need to change it to Text color.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.040
I'm going to change the spelling mistake there.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.400
The text color, I've got the input type of color.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.535
The ID is correct.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:08.460
The value, I'm going to change mine to 262626.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.300
Then the function, onchange again. It's going to changeText.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.520
I'm going to save that and check out how that's all looking in the browser.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.110
Refresh, so now we've got it says our company name, company message,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:30.020
and then we've also got the color picker appearing once we select the background color,

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.570
and also once we select the text color.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.100
We've also got the default color showing inside there.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.940
We'll leave this video there and we'll continue in the next video.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.165
We'll start adding the text alignments and we'll finish off the form section.

00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:49.410
Thank you and I'll see you in the next video.
