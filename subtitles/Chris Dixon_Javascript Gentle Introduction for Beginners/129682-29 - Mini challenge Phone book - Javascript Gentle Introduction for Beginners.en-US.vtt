00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.860
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.290
we're going to take a look at a mini challenge,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.825
which is going to put into practice the for loops that we used in the previous video.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:15.475
On this mini challenge is going to be about creating a simple phone book.

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:22.165
The phone book is going to print out the values of all your friends names in an array.

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:25.390
It's going to sort them into alphabetical order.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.150
Again, I'd like if you could try it out yourself and see

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.240
how far you go before you follow along with me.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.855
Just try and get that to work if possible without my help.

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:37.390
But don't worry if it's something you struggle with.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.430
You can follow along with me at the end,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.730
and I'll show you a way of doing that.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.680
Let's create the folder for this project.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.630
This is number 10. I want to call it the phone book challenge.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.950
Then open this up in brackets.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.190
Then set the title,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:15.520
phone book challenge, and start with a blank script tag.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.155
In this challenge, I'm going to get started with creating an array.

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:23.545
The array is going to hold the values of your friends.

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:28.065
Because we want to use JavaScript to sort these out into alphabetical order.

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.680
When you place the values inside the array,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.185
try not to put them in alphabetical order.

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:35.810
Because we want JavaScript to do this follows.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.925
Start with an array.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:40.234
I'm going to start with Chris,

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:44.980
I'll just put values of as many people inside that as you want.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.860
I'm going to start with five values.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.465
Just to get us started with.

00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:58.490
Just like that. Then I'm going to use a for loop,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.770
which we looked at in the last video to loop

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.750
through all the values and then print them to the screen.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.530
Let's start with the for loop and then

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.580
just simply print the values of the array to the browser.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.630
I is going to be initially set to zero,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.880
which is the first value of the array.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.760
Then we want the loop to keep going.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.970
While I is less than the names array.length.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.840
Then on each pass of the loop we want to increment I by one.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.225
Let's give this a go and see if it works.

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:38.180
Let's do a document write to the browser.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.170
Then let's take a look at names, and then I.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.910
Let's see what we've got now.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.750
There we got, Chris, Paul,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.595
Mike, Andrew, and Dave.

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:53.780
There's all the five values of our array, which is fine,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.035
but it doesn't look very good and we also want to sort these to be in alphabetical order.

00:02:59.035 --> 00:03:02.550
Let's begin by sorting them alphabetically.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.490
We've currently got all our names stored in the variable of names.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.520
We need to set these to be alphabetical.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.860
We do that with names.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.695
Then we use the sort method.

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:21.240
It's now going to be using an alphabetical order when we refresh, there we go.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.920
That works okay. We've got Andrew,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.500
Chris, Dave, Mike, and Paul.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.185
That's all in alphabetical order.

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:30.810
Just to give this project a little bit style,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.150
I'm going to add some pre tags.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.780
I going to add these just before and then also I want to add a just after.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.080
Don't forget the plus symbols in between we'll set the forward slash.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.030
Let's see how this looks now.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.270
That's now a little bit more readable.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.450
We've got all our names printed in

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.375
alphabetical order and with a little bit of a background to each value.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.330
If you've got this far, well done.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.900
I just want to add one more thing just to finish this off.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.260
I just want to add a number next to each person's name.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.630
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.205
so we know how many names we've got inside the phone book.

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:18.005
Just after the pre tag,

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:22.119
we can get that number with the value of i,

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:25.880
because is going to be incremented with every loop.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.680
Then also a colon just to separate the name with the number.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.850
Refresh. Now we've got 0,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.110
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.805
Just because the first value is zero,

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:45.475
I'm going to add i plus 1,

00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:50.230
so it begins at one rather than zero and refresh.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.350
That's better now. We start with the value of one and then we can

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.530
see how many different names we've got in our array,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.175
or our phone book.

00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:00.150
Hope you managed to do that,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.325
or at least give it a go and see how far you

00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:06.695
got and that's the end of the mini challenge and the end of the section.

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:08.270
I'll see you in the next section,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.100
which is called JavaScript and the DOM.
