00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.965
Hi, my name is Chris and a big welcomes my JavaScript calls for beginners.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:09.615
If you were looking at stake your HTML and CSS skills to the next level,

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.385
then you come to the right place.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.715
This course will give you the knowledge and confidence to

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.480
add interactivity and cool features to your websites.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.675
Along with the ability to build standalone applications,

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:27.210
we'll begin with the basics including understanding JavaScripts and what it is used for,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.919
where to include JavaScript in your websites,

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.255
datatypes, and how to get JavaScript displayed on your web pages.

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:38.630
We'll then move on to cover JavaScript essentials such as variables,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.095
arrays, functions, strings and string methods, and JavaScript objects.

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:47.720
All the sections will have various many challenges to get hands on

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.300
experience and make sure you understand exactly what we're doing before moving on.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.020
Once you have a grasp of the basics,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.360
we will then introduce you to more techniques such as JavaScript, math and dates,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.010
control-flow and loops, how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.145
and of course many challenges along the way.

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:09.110
Then finally, at the end of this course,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.005
you will build in this exciting full project,

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.430
you will have the chance to build

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.760
a fully functional business card application which

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.735
takes the user's inputs and creates a business card using JavaScript.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:22.295
By the end of the course, you'll have

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:25.310
all the required skills to complete this by yourself.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.025
This course is designed to be beginner friendly.

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:32.410
However, JavaScript often works alongside HTML and CSS.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.830
So basic knowledge of these languages is definitely recommended.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.280
Thanks for your interest and I look forward to you joining me on this exciting cause.
