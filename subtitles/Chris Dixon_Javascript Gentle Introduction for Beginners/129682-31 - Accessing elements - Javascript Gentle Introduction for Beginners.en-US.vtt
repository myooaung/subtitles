00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.640
Now we know that JavaScript can interact with DOM.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.395
In this video, I'm going to show you some methods of selecting elements on a web page.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.840
Let's get started with a new folder for

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.470
the new section and then call this section the DOM.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.730
We need to get a folder from any of the previous videos.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.815
Just the starter template.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:25.905
Copy any one of those and paste them in.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.215
This is number 1,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.510
and this is called accessing elements.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.570
Then open it up in your text editor.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.890
Drag it in like that. We need to get started with a new title; accessing elements.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.610
Then we can delete all the code from below between the script tags.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.510
In previous videos, we've looked at document.GetElementById,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.725
and then we can select an element of the web page.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:19.370
If we add a level 1 heading and insert an ID,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.615
for example, of title.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:28.035
We can then grab this level 1 heading by its ID of title,

00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:30.890
and then we can do various things such as setting

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.400
the inner HTML to be equal to anything you want.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.240
So let's set this to displaying JavaScript's in web pages.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.130
When this is opened up in the browser,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.525
the empty level 1 heading should have the text which you've placed at the bottom there.

00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:53.030
So let's open up. There we go,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.200
there's our level 1 heading.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.925
There's also other methods we can use to select elements on a web page.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.620
The next method I want to show you of grabbing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.310
elements on web pages by using the querySelector.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.280
As well as selecting elements by their ID,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.655
we can also select elements in the same way as it would

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:17.660
in the CSS by using the CSS selector.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.320
Let's create an example with some text.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.590
So let's create three P tags with some class names.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.460
This one can be first and then the content can be the first line,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.940
and you have to copy that twice.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.610
With second and the class of third.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.260
Just leave this third one blank for now.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.785
Now we know how to access a element by its ID.

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:59.660
Next, I want to move on to accessing an element by its CSS selector.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.310
We can do that with document.querySelector. Let's take a look at that.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.090
Document.querySelector. Inside the brackets,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.545
we want to pass in the CSS selector.

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:18.185
In our case, we're going to put in the class.

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:22.525
So let's put the class of second inside there.

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:24.960
Then we can make some changes.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.340
We're going to add style.backgroundColor

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.650
and then we set that to be equal to any value we want.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.810
Let's set that to be red.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.780
Now the second line should have a background color of red. Let's save that.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.470
In fact, we can just comment this section out and then refresh inside the browser.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.810
Now we've selected the second line by its ID and replaced the background color.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.780
If we were to change this to be first,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.750
we could just change it over by its class name and that would select the first line.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.745
That can be really handy for selecting elements on a web page.

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:17.390
So as well as selecting elements by their CSS name,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.405
we can also select elements by their class name.

00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:24.440
Let's just delete this example.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.610
We can use the paragraph text from before.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.085
Let's create a variable called selector.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:41.200
This is going to be set to documents.getElementsByClassName.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.860
Just be wary that, this has got a S on the end of elements where

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.920
getElementById doesn't have the S on

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.565
the end because we're only selecting one particular ID.

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:59.210
Whereas getElementsByClassName will return all of

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.140
the elements on that page with a particular class name.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.920
Then we want to select the class name to target.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.060
So let's add a class to the level 1 heading of

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.350
heading and then we just put this inside the brackets,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.205
and then a semicolon at the end.

00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:23.950
This would select all the elements with a class name of heading.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.560
If there was more than one, we would then need to

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.785
declare which element we want to target by its index number.

00:05:31.785 --> 00:05:34.640
In our case, we want to go one in class of heading.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.220
So that will be index number 0.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.140
If we had a second line with the same class,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.805
this would be index number 1.

00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:52.695
Let's change the inner HTML and set that to some text.

00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:55.570
Class name selected.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.150
Let's run that inside the browser.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.695
There we go. That's our level 1 heading with class name selected.

00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:10.990
Another one which you may find really useful is document.getElementsByTagName.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.500
It works in a pretty similar way to the last example.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.960
The tag name is either the H1 or the P,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.855
or it could be any one of the elements on the web page.

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:27.070
It can even be a GIF or a image.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.810
This time the selector is going to be equal to document.getElementsByTagName.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.505
Let's select the P tags.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:38.190
Then just the same as before,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.905
we can then put an index number.

00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:42.620
So 0, 1, and 2.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.960
Number 1 is the second line of text on there.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.050
This time so we know it's working,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.215
we'll simply print out tag name selected.

00:06:52.215 --> 00:06:54.765
Save. There you go.

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:58.140
Now line 2 has changed to tag name selected.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.690
If it changes to zero,

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.370
tag name selected should now be the first line. There you go.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.680
The last example I'm going to show you in this video is to select

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.550
the number of images inside the documents with document.images.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.120
To do that, we need to create some images inside the web page.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.410
You don't actually have to have any images physically there,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.900
we can just make up some image names.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.415
So image 1, image 2,

00:07:32.415 --> 00:07:36.165
image 3, and then image 4.

00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:40.525
Then if we want to know how many images are on that web page,

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:45.530
we could create a variable called number of images.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:52.710
The number of images is going to be equal to document.images.length,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.015
and then we can print to the screen the number of images in a string.

00:07:59.015 --> 00:08:02.870
So let's create a empty element to display these in.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.520
A H1 tag with ID of example.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.315
Then let's do a document.getElementById,

00:08:15.315 --> 00:08:18.790
and then select the example.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:27.270
Then paste that in. We can set the text with the inner HTML.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:36.220
Let's set this to this page has and then a space, plus the variable,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.735
which is going to contain the number of images on the page,

00:08:40.735 --> 00:08:46.085
then plus, and then we want the word images inside a string.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:48.130
Okay, if that works well,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.445
we should get the text displayed of this page has,

00:08:51.445 --> 00:08:54.280
and then four images.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.810
Let's save that and take a look.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.875
Great. That's working fine.

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:01.670
If we were to delete one of these images,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.100
that should now be changed to you three. There we go.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.575
There's lots of different methods you can use to access elements on a web page.

00:09:09.575 --> 00:09:12.350
I recommend you to take a look at the Mozilla website,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.165
which I'll provide a link to.

00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:16.700
There's many more examples on there.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.910
Hopefully, now we understand that we can access pretty

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.885
much any part of a document or of a web page that we want.

00:09:23.885 --> 00:09:28.050
In the next video, we'll move on to how we can manipulate or change these elements.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.210
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.540
Thanks for watching and I'll see you there.
