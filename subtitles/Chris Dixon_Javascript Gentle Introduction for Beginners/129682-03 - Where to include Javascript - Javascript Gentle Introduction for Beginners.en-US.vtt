00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.220
Welcome back. For this course,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.230
I would recommend creating a new folder on your desktop or somewhere you can access it.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.395
I'm going to create mine on the desktop,

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.060
and I'm just going to call this JavaScript.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.320
Within that folder, we can save all the examples that we create on this course,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.770
and then you put them to hand if you need them for reference.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.840
Within the JavaScript folder,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.450
I'm going to create one new folder,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.150
and this is going to be called understanding-javascript.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.980
That's the name of the section on the course.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.620
The first thing we're going to look at is where to include JavaScript,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.040
so I'm going to create a new folder called where-to-include-javascript and save that.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.355
Then if you go to your text editor,

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:03.810
I'm going to use Brackets,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.550
drag in the folder that you just created.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.935
We want to create a new page,

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:16.230
so âŒ˜ or Ctrl+N,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.020
save this as index.html.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.890
To start with, I'm going to put in the basic HTML structure,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.685
and I'm going to use a plug-in called Emmet.

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:34.790
Emmet is available for most of the popular text editors.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.815
If you're using Brackets like me,

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:39.400
go into the Extensions,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.450
and then search for Emmet, E-M-M-E-T.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.455
I've already got Emmet installed,

00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:49.660
but if you don't, just click on the "Install" button.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.890
Emmet is a great plug-in which allows you to use shortcuts such as html:5,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.260
and then press tab, and that creates a new structure for you.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.720
But if you're not using them, it is not a problem.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.650
Just pause the video and type this out,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.670
and we can duplicate it for future videos.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.120
In the title, I'm just going to call it Where to include JavaScript,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.950
then just make a little space after the title.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.059
I'm just going to include the Bootstrap stylesheets,

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.365
which will allow us to make our webpages look nicer.

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:36.359
Just search for Bootstrap,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.030
and then go to getbootstrap.com,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.790
and then go to Get started,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.355
and I'm just going to include the Bootstrap CDN,

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.740
which is the hosted link for the stylesheet.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.995
I'm just going to copy the top section,

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.544
which is the stylesheet.

00:02:56.544 --> 00:03:03.620
I'll copy that, and then paste that into the head section just below the title.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.800
Now it's all set up, we can take a look at some different ways

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.840
we can include JavaScript into our project.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.620
JavaScript can be placed in either the head or the body section.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.260
I'm going to get started, and we need to start by including some script tags,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.265
so type out the opening and closing script tags.

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:27.775
All the JavaScript that we type needs to go between these two.

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.865
To check everything's working okay,

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:32.715
I'm going to get started with a simple alert().

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:38.640
An alert() is a pop-up box which appears in the browser and alerts a message to the user.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.740
Between quotes you can either use single or double quotes, it doesn't matter.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.675
I'm just going to alert,

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:53.155
Javascript is working, and add a semicolon onto the end of that statement.

00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:57.125
If we save that and then go over to the browser,

00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:01.570
you can see a alert box pops up saying, "Javascript is working."

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.640
This is your first time writing JavaScript.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.525
Congratulations, you've just got your first work in Scripter.

00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:13.030
Just click on the "OK" button to get rid of that for now,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.380
and head back over to the next page.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.380
We mentioned before that JavaScript works in both the head and the body section,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.005
so if we just cut the section,

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:29.885
out with the head, and then paste it in the body section,

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:32.540
and straight away, we got a change.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.640
We're being taken over to the browser,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.770
and again, exactly the same thing has happened.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.780
We've got the alert box popping up saying,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.090
"JavaScript is working," so that's all fine.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.165
Sometimes, when we've got a lot of JavaScript on the page,

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:53.205
we want it be separate from the HTML just to make it more readable and easy to maintain.

00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:57.635
We can do that by adding the JavaScript into an external file,

00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:02.660
so create a new page in the project and save that.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.810
I'm going to call my file alert,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.630
and it needs have the extension of.js for JavaScript.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.265
Then, go back over to the index page,

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:19.110
and we can link this external JavaScript in the head section.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.475
Again, we open up the script tags,

00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:25.520
then we need to tell the browser where find the JavaScript

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.910
file by using the src attribute.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.215
Because our file is in the same level as the index page,

00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:34.805
we can just type in the file name,

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:37.525
so that is alert.js.

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:39.785
Now, we can get rid of the script tags

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:42.200
because we're going to put these in a separate file,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.070
so go over to the alert.js.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.975
When we're working in an external JavaScript file,

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:50.150
we don't need to include the script tags.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.790
We can just start typing the JavaScript.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.030
Create a new alert.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.685
Between the curly brackets and the quotations,

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.635
we could put in our message again,

00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:07.745
Javascript is working, and the semicolon at the end.

00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:12.345
Save that, and save the next page,

00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:14.145
and go over to the browser,

00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:16.830
and then refresh. There we go.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.860
Great. The alert is working also in the external file.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.090
External JavaScript files are useful for storing JavaScript you may want to use

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.105
on different webpages so you don't need to type the same script over and over again.

00:06:31.105 --> 00:06:35.030
You can just link in the file that you want to use on every webpage.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.020
As mentioned before, it also separates the HTML from the JavaScript,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.180
and makes your code more readable and maintainable.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.800
The external JavaScript link that we placed in the head section can also be placed in

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.710
the body section at the very bottom of your page just above the closing body tag.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.500
This way, the HTML is not blocked by loading scripts so we can improve page load times.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.010
Just save that, and refresh the browser again,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.385
and you can see everything is still working.

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:13.700
So that's three different ways we can include JavaScript into our project.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.250
Thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next video.
