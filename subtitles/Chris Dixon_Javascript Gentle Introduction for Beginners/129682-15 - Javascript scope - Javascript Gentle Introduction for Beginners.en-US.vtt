00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.200
Welcome back. In this video we are going to be taking a look at JavaScript scope.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.970
Scope basically defines which variables we have access to.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.635
Let's create a new folder,

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:15.435
and we'll take a look at that.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.285
So duplicate the last video.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.575
This is video number 11,

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:23.310
and we'll call it Scope.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.820
Open up as usual.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.640
Inside the text editor, and then change the title to Javascript Scope,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.225
and then you should remove this section.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.730
Let's start with a function.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.689
We're going to call this function multiply,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.075
and we don't need any parameters in there just for now.

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:03.445
So inside this function,

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:06.070
I want to create a couple of variables,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.620
so variable a and set that to two,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.510
and variable b, give a value of five,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.630
and then create a alert of a multiply by b.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.480
Let's now call this multiply function,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.215
and we should get the result of 10 appearing on the screen.

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.285
So that's all working fine.

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:39.330
So we created two variables inside this function,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.670
and this is what's call local scope.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.120
Meaning that these two variables can only be accessed within this function.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.005
So if we were trying to alert one of the variables,

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.134
so we try to alert for example,

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:59.080
variable b, which has been declared inside the function,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.510
and then if we go over to the browser,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.170
you can see that when we refresh that nothing actually happens.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.450
If we go into the developer tools,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.770
we get the error message saying,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.600
b is not defined.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.015
So only create a variable inside a function,

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:18.335
if you only want to use inside that function.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:21.410
If you want to use that variable outside of the function,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.880
what I need to take them out,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.240
and put them outside the function.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.775
So now these two variables have global scope,

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.850
so they can be accessed not only within the function,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.175
but also anywhere in the rest of the code.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.790
Now if we alert b, we have access to that variable,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.565
which is number five.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:49.370
Also if we use the multiply function,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.990
if we just remove the comments and then refresh the page,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.140
that the function also has access to the two variables too.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.210
So there we go. Start to look at the scope of variables, I hope that helps.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.300
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next section.
