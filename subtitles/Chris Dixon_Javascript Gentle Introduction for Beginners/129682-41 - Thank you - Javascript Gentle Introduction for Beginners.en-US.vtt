00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.035
So a big congratulations on getting to the end of this course.

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.035
I really do hope you've enjoyed it and learned many things from it.

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:09.900
You've covered quite a lot in this course.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.499
We began with JavaScript basics and understanding

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.475
things which has variables, strings, and arrays.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:24.060
We also looked at other fundamentals such as JavaScript functions, scope and objects.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.754
Then we moved on to looking at math and dates and how they are used in JavaScript.

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:33.800
We'll then step things up a little and we will took a look at control-flow and loops,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.990
which involved many statements such as

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.490
switch statements and various different types of loops.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.550
We then introduce you to JavaScript and the DOM,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.290
and we took a look at how we can access elements

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.580
on a web page and how we can manipulate the elements,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.800
and we completed various mini challenges along the way to test

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200
your skills and we really hope you manage

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.475
to come up with something creative for the final project.

00:00:57.475 --> 00:01:00.420
So that's it. So that's the end of the course. Thank you very much.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.600
If you enjoyed it, please do leave a review.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.640
It would really help other students,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.310
and hopefully I'll see you soon in one of my other courses.
