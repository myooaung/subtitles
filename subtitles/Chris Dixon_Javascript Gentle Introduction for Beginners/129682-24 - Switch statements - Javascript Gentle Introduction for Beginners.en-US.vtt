00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.860
In this video, we're going to take a look at switch statements.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.765
Switch statements work in a similar way to if else statements,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.225
which we looked at earlier in the section.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:17.370
In switched statement, we provide multiple outcomes or cases.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.745
Then when an expression matches one of these cases,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.830
an action is performed.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.105
Let's take a look at how switch statements work in JavaScript.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.520
Let's create a new folder,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.830
and it's number 5, and it's called switch-statements.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.490
Then it got opened up in our text editor,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.140
and then drag inside the switch-statement folder,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.390
and then open up the index page.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.770
I'll make it a little bit bigger so you can see it.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.230
Then we'll change the title again to switch statements.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.870
Then remove all this between the script tags.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.300
With switch statement when we're comparing a statements,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.805
or in our case, we're going to create a variable.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.940
I'm going to call this variable the month,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.400
and then when I set this to January,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.740
and then to create a switch statements,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.465
we use the switch keyword and then open up some brackets,

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:28.795
and then the curly braces.

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.795
Basically it looks a little bit like an if statements out the stage.

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:37.175
Like the if statements, we pass in inside the brackets,

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:39.305
the condition we want to check.

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:43.555
In our case we want to check the variable of month.

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:48.440
Then we're going to provide multiple cases that we want to check against,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.175
and we use the case key word.

00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:54.935
Then we start to give it some outcomes that we want to check.

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:58.505
If we check if the value a January,

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:02.725
and then use a colon, and if it is January,

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:05.235
we can provide a outcome.

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:06.915
I'll around some code.

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:08.460
I'm just going to do a document.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.725
write, and now it is passing a message in there,

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:15.300
such as happy new year.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.750
Then afterwards you want to use the break keyword,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.839
and when an expression is matched to the particular case, in this example,

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.360
January matches the case,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.455
because this is matched, we then use the break keyword,

00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:35.600
and we'll put this after each case,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.210
and as soon as the condition is met,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.985
it then breaks the switch statements.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.400
But we said earlier that switch statements are

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.370
useful for checking many different outcomes.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.120
We simply just do this with more cases.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.610
Let's put some more months we add in there.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.190
Let's put in July in there and then a document.write.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.970
This time I should put an halfway through the year.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.650
Then the break keyword again,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.810
just after the document.write,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.660
just in case this condition is matched,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.180
make sure all the cases in

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.505
between the two curly braces of why start to run into problems.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:32.630
We can keep going with as many as you like.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.685
I'm going to create one for December, and then a colon,

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:45.820
in fact, we'll just copy this document.write, and then paste that in.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.010
This time for December, we're going to put in,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.850
nearly the new year and then the break, just after it.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.110
This is essentially how a switch statement works.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.690
It will go through the individual cases until the statement is matched,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.065
and then it will break out of the switch statement.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:15.215
But, if an outcome can't be found,

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:18.550
we need to provide a default case.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.330
This is a default code to run,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.210
it's known of the cases are matched.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.940
Defaults and a colon,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.380
and then it's putting the default code in there.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.855
I'm just going to put in the month is,

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:41.350
and then I'll just put the month variable into there.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.635
If we count much one of the statements up,

00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:45.750
and if can't prints out the message,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.400
will just get the default,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.195
the month is, and then in our case in January.

00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:58.110
So save that, and then it's opened up in the browser.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.560
Because we got the month as January,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.480
we set the case to be happy new year,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.860
which is just the first one there.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.940
If we change the month to July,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.780
we should get the half way through the air message.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.420
Refresh that, and halfway through the year appears.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.765
Let's just try December.

00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:31.515
How much get the third case of nearly the new year and refresh.

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:34.760
They look great, and if we put in a month,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.310
which is not one of these cases,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.705
so we'll try March.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:41.975
Hopefully, we should get the default case,

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.595
which is the month is,

00:05:43.595 --> 00:05:47.865
and then March. There we go.

00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:51.095
We can also put in as many cases as you like,

00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:56.900
and you can even provide more than one case with the same piece of code to run.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.685
For example, if you want it, another case on there,

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:04.835
and we want it to say nearly the new year for

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:08.150
November and December, that's not a problem.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.960
We can just do our cases like this,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.350
and then this document.write,

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.715
will be run if the case is either November or December.

00:06:17.715 --> 00:06:27.300
Let's just try that. So change the variable to November.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.295
Nearly the new year,

00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:32.660
and that should work the same for December too.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.020
Still nearly the new year,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.135
we'll just try one more.

00:06:39.135 --> 00:06:42.610
So October, we don't have a case for October,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.770
so we should get the default,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.050
which is down at the bottom,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.520
refresh, and there we go.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.140
So the month is October.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:57.080
I hope that makes sense and I hope you understand that switch statements are

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.510
really useful for when we want to check

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.895
a condition against many possible different outcomes.

00:07:03.895 --> 00:07:06.920
In the next video, we'll move away from the theory.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.180
I will move on to a mini challenge where you can start by your skills you've learned,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.040
in the section into practice.
