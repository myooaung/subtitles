00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.275
Welcome back. This video is called Manipulating Elements.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:11.445
As usual, let's start with our own folder,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.210
so this is number two, Manipulating Elements.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.750
Then let's open this up.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.120
Then let it started with its own title and an empty script tag,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.895
so this time manipulating elements,

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:41.610
then just clear all this up.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.810
We start with our blank index page.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.350
We know from the last video how to access elements,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.680
so now let's take a look at how we can change these elements using JavaScript.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.815
So let's create a level one heading as an example,

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:03.650
and let's give it a ID of title and then some text

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.050
between the level one heading of changing HTML elements.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.315
We've looked at manipulating a value by using the in HTML.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:21.595
That was document.getelementByID.

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:28.250
Then we know we need to grab the ID of the element you want to change, which is title.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.045
Then we've used inner HTML to

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:35.810
change the contents of the elements to anything that we want to.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.670
We're going to put any text in there that we want.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.670
So as well as the inner HTML,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.865
we can also change the CSS or the styles of a particular element,

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:50.185
and we'll do that with.style.

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:52.805
Then once we've selected the style,

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:57.320
we can go further into the CSS by using the dot.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.015
You can see using brackets that as soon as we use a dot,

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:06.950
we then get a list of all the available CSS properties that we can select.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.735
So I'm going to start it by selecting the color.

00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:13.395
Then we're going to set that equal to,

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.535
I'm just going to start with red.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.695
Let's now open this up in the browser and take a look.

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:22.805
We've got the level one heading of changing HTML elements.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:25.610
Then well add in a CSS style,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.460
and then we'll set in the color of the text to be red.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.380
So let's that up.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.380
It's now about the text all red on the page there.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.250
We can add many different CSS properties on there,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.710
we can change the font size,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.695
and let's make this text really big so we can check its working.

00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:50.570
For 100 pixels, so have a little play around with

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.100
that and try and select some of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.310
the different CSS values and see what you can achieve with them.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.160
But I'm not going to move on to getting and setting

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.480
the class names or the ID's of HTML elements.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.850
Let's start with getting the class name or the ID.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.460
So to do this, we need to add a class to our level one heading.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.130
So let's just add a class of

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.560
red and then we can find out what this class name of this particular element is.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.900
Let's select the document.getElementByID,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.440
so let's let the title id and then.class name,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.670
with the semicolon at the end.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.845
So because we are grabbing a className.

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:40.685
I want to store this inside a variable so we can access easily.

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:46.665
So variable of class name is equal to document.getElementByID.

00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:50.370
We'll grab in a title, and then we'll select in the class name,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.400
let's now do a document right and then check.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.185
We've got the class name correctly stored inside the variable.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:03.265
Let's just put this inside the brackets and then refresh.

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:07.990
You can just about see that we've got the class name of red appearing at the bottom.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.605
This also works with ID.

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.244
You just need to change className

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:19.995
to.ID and then just display the results once again inside a variable,

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:24.330
so ID name, save that.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.185
We've got the ID set to title in this case.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:34.190
That's how we can grab or how we can get the class name or the ID of an element.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.680
Sometimes you want to add an ID or other class or even an additional class to an element.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.295
Let's take a look at how we can add classes and elements.

00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:51.385
I want to add some styles and create a few new classes that we can to this element.

00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:54.220
Let's use our red class.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.410
Let's set the color to be red and make it a bit more readable,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.310
we'll set the font size to 2 ems.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.730
Then it's also create a second class of blue,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.910
and then we can add this to our elements and change the color to blue.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.695
Then let's add an additional ID that we can add the element two.

00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:32.000
I'm just going to set the font-family to be fantasy.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.450
Below we got the ID and also the class of the particular elements.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.670
But if we want to set the ID,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.105
we just simply use the.ID and then set that equal to the ID name that want to add,

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:49.340
so in our case it's ID1.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.945
If this is added correctly,

00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:54.940
we should now get the font-family change to fantasy.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.670
So save that, and then head over to the browser and refresh, there we go.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.099
Great. We've got the different font-family,

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.385
so the ID is being added to the element.

00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:08.715
Adding a class works in exactly the same way,

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:12.510
so let's just duplicate this line,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.465
and then we'll set the className.

00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:22.165
Grab the element by ID of title and then.className.

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:25.045
Then instead of the red class,

00:06:25.045 --> 00:06:28.445
let's add the class of blue that we've created,

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:32.910
and then save that, and let's get rid of the ID name,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.730
so save that and then refresh,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.140
and now we'll get the blue color,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.435
so that's all working correctly.

00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:43.765
Now we know how to add IDs and classes to elements,

00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:48.115
we also know how to access the particular class or ID.

00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:53.435
Next, I'm going to show you how to create and to add new elements to a page.

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:56.310
Let's start with a blank script tag,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.955
and I'm going to store these in variables.

00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:04.620
I'm going to create a variable called a new element.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:12.780
The new element we want to create is going to be equal to documents.createElement.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.890
Then inside the brackets we need to put the name of the element that we want to create.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.370
I'm going to create a new div.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.735
This will create a new div and store it inside the variable called New Elements.

00:07:26.735 --> 00:07:31.705
Inside this div, I want to create some text to put inside there,

00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:36.960
so let's create a new variable called addText.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:48.470
The way we can add text to a div or to a document is by using document.createTextNode.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.330
Then inside the bracket I'll put inside the string that we want to

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.920
create, new text string.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.215
We got our texts, and we've also got our new div.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.735
So to add the text to the div,

00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:09.040
we select the new element variable,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.580
which is the div, and then.appendChild.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:20.955
The child which we want to append or add to is the addText variable.

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:24.105
So just put that inside the brackets.

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:27.890
Now we've added the new text to the new div.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:37.275
Let's now add this to the documents, so document.body.insert Before.

00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:42.485
In here we tell the browser exactly where we'd like the content to be added.

00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:45.755
InsertBefore takes two parameters.

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:47.840
So the first one is required,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.775
and this is the content or the object that we want to add.

00:08:51.775 --> 00:08:57.550
We want to add the new element variable that we've just created,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.945
so that goes in first.

00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:02.240
The second value is optional,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:08.395
and this is the marker in HTML where the new element will be added just before.

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:13.915
If we wanted to add new elements to just before our level one heading,

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:18.180
let's create a new variable called new content,

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:25.830
and then let's set content to be equal to this heading at the top.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.315
So document.getElementByID.

00:09:30.315 --> 00:09:34.750
We want to grab the ID of title,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.300
so just put that between the brackets,

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.935
just like that we just want to make sure that that's a variable.

00:09:41.935 --> 00:09:45.270
So there's a bit going on there so we'll just take a little look at this again.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.095
We're creating a new element, or a new div.

00:09:49.095 --> 00:09:55.585
Will then add in a new text string to that div using appendChild.

00:09:55.585 --> 00:09:59.990
Now we've got this information stored in a variable called new element.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.545
We'll then add this to the document using insert before.

00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:06.980
The section of code we want to add is

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:12.420
this new elements which contains the new div and new text string.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.765
Then the second value of new content is where we want to add this new element two,

00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:20.780
and we want to add it just before our level

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.430
one heading and then go to the browser and refresh.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.850
There we go, there is our new text string.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.215
If you wanted to give that particular div and ID,

00:10:31.215 --> 00:10:38.150
you can do that with new elements or the newElement variable.Id.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.495
Like we used in the last example,

00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:44.930
we're going to set the ID to be equal to anything you want.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.660
I want to set mine to my ID,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.330
and then save that, and now when we refresh the page,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.670
if you go into the developer tools,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.100
and then if we select the new texturing.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.830
You can see the inside the body we've got a new div with an ID of my div,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.320
and the content is new text string.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.480
That's how you can add new elements to HTML by using JavaScripts.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.575
So thanks for watching and in the next video we'll move on to a mini challenge,

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:18.440
which is create a temperature converter and it

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.725
will put into practice what you've learned over the last few videos.

00:11:21.725 --> 00:11:25.170
Thank you and we'll see you in the next video.
