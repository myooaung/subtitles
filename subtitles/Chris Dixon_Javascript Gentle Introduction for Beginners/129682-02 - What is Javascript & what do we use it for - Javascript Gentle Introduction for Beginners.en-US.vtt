00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.780
In this video, I just wanted to give you a overview of what

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.205
JavaScript is and what exactly JavaScript can do.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.700
First of all, let's take a look at what is JavaScript?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.300
JavaScript is a programming language which

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.665
we have traditionally used to make web pages interactive.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:27.870
When you're browsing a website and things such as a pop-up box appear or

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.065
if you hover over a menu and you get a dropdown with different menu links,

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.670
basically a lot of the features which happen without

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.100
refreshing the page, that's all JavaScript.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.520
JavaScript can also be used to create standalone applications.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.915
Traditionally, we've used JavaScript in web browsers and websites.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:52.935
Now JavaScript is become a more and more popular, finding more uses.

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:56.240
JavaScript is now being used to create full applications,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.565
both the front and the backend.

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:00.575
Nowadays it's really easy to make

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:05.400
a full stack application with just knowing one programming language.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.660
I mentioned that JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive and the reason that can

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.790
happen is because JavaScript is built into and runs on all the major browsers.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.050
JavaScript even works when the user is offline.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.290
The fact that JavaScript is built into the major browsers and is a default script and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.200
language for web browsers means that JavaScript is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.290
here to stay and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere soon.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.700
The Java programming language is

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.350
a completely separate language and it's not related to JavaScript.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.810
That's the basics of JavaScript.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.090
Now let's take a look at what JavaScript can do.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.420
We know that JavaScript can make web pages interactive.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.510
It can also change the HTML and CSS elements on a web page.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.515
It can change the colors,

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:00.900
it can change the font sizes,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.135
it can change the text upon a click,

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:04.690
various things like that.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.610
This is what's called manipulating the DOM.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.270
We'll look at the DOM more later on in this course, but for now,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.890
just understand that JavaScript can change elements on a web page,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.900
and that's exactly what we're doing now with this demonstration.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.065
We're manipulating the DOM by clicking on a button on the left,

00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:25.330
which is adding some text into an empty paragraph tag.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.485
Next, JavaScript can also validate data.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:35.045
As an example, if you fill in a form with your name and address,

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:40.550
JavaScript can check that the information you provide is correct such as,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.630
it can check that there is no letters in a phone number,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.110
it can check if your email address is correctly formatted before it gets submitted,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.755
and it can even restrict how many characters is entered in a text field.

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:58.770
This is all done in the browser without any help from the server.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.200
JavaScript can also be used to create full stack applications.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.780
By full stack we mean the front-end which the user can see and interact

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.565
with and also the server side which is the backend of the application.

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:18.235
Historically, JavaScript is just being used on the front-end in the browser,

00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:21.140
but now more and more applications are being wrote with

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.010
JavaScript for the full stack, thanks to Node.js.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.590
As well as websites and applications,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.840
JavaScript is also popular to creating cross-platform games.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.750
We can write game once in JavaScript and use something such as

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.820
PhoneGap to deploy your game to different devices such as Android or iOS.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.080
We can use JavaScript to patch holes in browser spots,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.220
so we can provide polyfills and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.480
feature detection to check if a older browser supports a certain feature.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.070
If it doesn't, we can provide a alternative way of dealing with that.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.600
JavaScript and HTML5 work hand in

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.115
hand and JavaScript powers a lot of the new HTML5 features,

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:14.605
such as the Canvas and of course, much, much more.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:20.065
JavaScript is becoming so popular now that there is new uses being created everyday.

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:25.195
There's also new libraries and frameworks being created all the time for JavaScript.

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:27.585
So it really is a great skill to have.

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:31.350
Thanks for watching and enjoy the rest of the class.
