00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
Welcome back and welcome to this new section called JavaScript and the DOM.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.635
In this video, we're going to take a brief overview of exactly what the DOM is.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:14.340
The DOM is short for the Document Object Model

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.010
and I'm just on the Wikipedia page for the Document Object Model,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.660
and you can find out small information just on there.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.765
It starts by saying the DOM is a cross-platform and language

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:32.450
independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.380
XHTML, and XML documents.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.045
You may be wondering exactly what that means.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:42.815
To keep it simple, all the sections or elements,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:49.135
or all the nodes in every documents or web page is organized into a tree-like structure.

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:53.450
If we go over to the W3Schools section on the DOM,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.085
you can probably get a better idea of exactly what's going on.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:02.690
We can see a visual diagram of all the HTML DOM tree of objects.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.880
This is our basic webpage,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.480
which starts off with the documents right up at the top.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.635
We've used up before in this course when we've been selecting elements by ID.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.870
We started with document and then get element by ID.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.170
We've got document right at the top of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.415
the tree and then all the different elements on the webpage,

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.400
a branch down from the document.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.640
We've got the head section and then we've got the body section,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.885
which are the main two elements inside the HTML root element,

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:36.800
and this should all look fairly familiar from HTML webpage.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.630
Within the head section,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.275
we've got a title.

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:43.880
Within the body section we've got the attributes, the elements,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.260
such as the headings,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.180
the anchors, and then all the text contained within those.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.140
You may be wondering what this has got to deal with JavaScript.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.600
Well, basically, JavaScript can make webpages dynamic because

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.705
JavaScript can control or manipulate all of the elements in the DOM tree.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:06.080
We can grab any one of these elements and we can override it,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.805
we can manipulate it,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:09.350
we can add to,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.560
we can add certain attributes or elements,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.450
we can change CSS styles or even remove any of these elements.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.630
In the next few videos, we'll be taking a deeper look at how we can

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.335
access these elements and how we can manipulate these elements.

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:28.070
But before we do that, I just wanted to give you a brief overview of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.920
exactly how we can do that and why the DOM is important to JavaScript.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.030
But for now the main thing to understand is how a HTML document is laid out and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.670
also understand that JavaScript can access or

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.525
manipulate all of the elements in the DOM tree.

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:46.520
We'll now move on to the next video and we'll take a look at how

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.520
we can access all of the elements inside this DOM tree.
