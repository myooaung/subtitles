00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.745
Very well. You have now successfully created your account with by an S.com.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:20.115
Okay, I'd officially a member of binaries now know a very important activity,

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:25.500
unless a very important thing that they all need to do before we all go handover,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.225
do any kind of things when this plateau we had to verify yourself.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:36.210
So what you can do is you can click this icon and right upper corner.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.760
And then you can see email is unverified.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.360
Here. It is written on verified,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.675
so you have to click on that and then verify outcome. By IC.

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.600
You need to verify before anything you

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.095
do in this platform because this is a security mission.

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:02.875
So if you verify yourself, then non-leader,

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:07.720
it sees more secure for you to start trade in because you're going to put all your money

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.700
into this and somebody else is trying to take it away from mu,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.440
then it is very easy on leave via a counties with that password only.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.850
So this platform by an enzyme giving us the option to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.705
have two-factor authentication, the wave fare.

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:29.825
So you can see here you have registered account.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:36.709
Now you have to verify your account and activate two-factor authentication to F8.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.970
So RTO going to do here is I'm going to give a phone verification,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.380
not only a password,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.830
but also your phone number will be

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.365
given to this as you are going to enable SMS authenticator.

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:54.514
Then after you select your country,

00:01:54.514 --> 00:02:00.530
you can select the country based on the country that you are living in,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.109
say, let's say from say France.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.220
And I have to select the country and enter the phone number.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.100
And then I have to do is I have to click on this same card.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.190
Now when I count in 30 in the phone number.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.539
The phone number.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.425
Okay, I intend a phone number and then you click constant called.

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.840
Then what will happen is,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.460
by finance will send you an SMS to your mobile number,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.815
which is this number.

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:48.380
And then when that SMS,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.765
you will see the finance

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:55.835
Authenticator or as authentication code which you have to in any year.

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:57.740
That is a simple verification.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.160
If you before, if you have involved with

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.495
any bank transactions and think this is kind of a family a day.

00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:08.375
After you enter that authentication,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:10.535
then it has to be exact match.

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:18.260
And then you can do is you can simply enter your email address.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.495
Again, the verification here.

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:23.930
You might notice please enter the correct SMS.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.400
God, because it exactly must be.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.600
The similar chord that undermine ends is sending.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.705
Otherwise they will not accept you to proceed further.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:39.515
And likewise, you have to enter your email address again.

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:45.230
And then you have to go into an e-mail and click on that notification.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.530
And then you will find a color that you had to paste it here,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.020
and then only you can submit.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.195
So you're enabling two-factor authentication likewise.

00:03:56.195 --> 00:04:00.905
And every time you tried to log in,

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:05.165
you will have to do your password.

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:07.970
And before phosphate will be,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.380
there will be a kind of test that you need to make sure that you are not a robot.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.050
And then you have to enter your password.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.760
And also that authentication will be Aspirin new side.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.520
And so now I will show you how you can sign into finance.com since you have successfully

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.430
created your account and you have done the two-factor authentication, right?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.270
So I'm here, I'm going to log in from my older the create an account.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:52.325
And I simply enter my email address and the password and click login.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.755
Then as I said before,

00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:57.110
you will be asked to prove you're not a Robert.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.345
Do you have to simply drag this and match it with the space given?

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:08.720
Then your verified you will be asked to take on the same card.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.260
So in IP condensate and covert might form number,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.320
they will send a finance gone.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.425
Yes, I just received it.

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:24.390
I have to enter that.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.200
Yes, they're edifying it.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.950
