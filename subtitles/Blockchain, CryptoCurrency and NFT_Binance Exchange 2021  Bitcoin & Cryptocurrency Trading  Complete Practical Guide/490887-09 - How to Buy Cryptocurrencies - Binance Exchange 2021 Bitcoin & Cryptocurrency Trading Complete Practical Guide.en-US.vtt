00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:15.750
All right, now we will look into how we can by any other cryptocurrency.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
So any kind of cryptocurrency now,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.590
we looked into now the exchanges I have set to be DC per USD.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.679
That mean how much of BTC of Bitcoin I can buy from my USD D balance.

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:42.040
You also again selected simply lie this be ETC, slash USD.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.125
And then you can select this option.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:49.625
I'm going to buy Bitcoin using the USD.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.290
Now.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.330
It shows 0 here.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.000
This means my USD balance in my wall at D, C,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.955
because I have more,

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:07.025
some USD D and I have already utilize it for some other cryptocurrency.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.139
Now for your training purpose,

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:13.520
imagine I have some USD balance, however,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.200
that USD balances through the deposit method.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.015
I have already.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.600
How certain balances and Mark do you have to do is,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.950
since 0 already selected that the Bitcoin,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:38.690
the BTC to you is d t. Then you're going to go for this by Bitcoin from the USDA.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.185
It will list here the foreign price.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:47.750
So say how many VDC or much trouble bit coins you need to buy.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.380
Now you have to specify the amount or mugshot Bitcoins unit.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.050
I would say I need two bitcoins.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:02.030
Then two by two Bitcoin's total US DT.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.700
This much or totally with the D I need to have in my USD D balance.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.460
So that is something you have to deposit then keep if you are to buy a Bitcoin and all,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.650
okay, I'm not going to buy two VDC.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.435
It is too expensive for me.

00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:23.480
I would by 0.001 BDC.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.165
So I will get 47.

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:35.900
I will have to spend 47 USD two by 0 BTC.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.155
And now always keep in mind there will be

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:43.160
certain maximum amount when we are going to do tread that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.180
a certain maximum amount that we

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.875
need to buy that or some certain rules when we are going to bite.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.620
So that delineates display at the maximum here,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.135
the maximum on Syria because I have no USD D Here, the balance.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:02.435
Okay for you all and yes,

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:03.950
nor no balance here.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.485
And then click on the BDC.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.795
I will show you now,

00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:11.060
I discuss about the BTC by him.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.510
So I will show you how I can buy,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.100
say, some other cryptocurrency.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.210
Like I'm going to buy EDA Cardano cryptocurrency.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.645
You will see in my area imbalance.

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.720
I have some small amount for this training purpose,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.610
some small w for it Ethereum,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.920
its current price are now for ethidium.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.385
Go says this, this is the type Price.

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:50.885
And yes, I have some 0.0061 for this balance of it.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:59.630
And how much AD I can buy with that AD price.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.775
You can see the idea price here in terms of ethereal.

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:09.140
Say, I need to buy ten,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.720
no icon by obtain from the balance available,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.390
I only can buy seven AB.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.835
So I put 7 here because I cannot exceed the amount of,

00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:22.475
because I'm going to buy it from it Ethereum, right?

00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:25.250
E-t it, I have some balance in that.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.140
I'm going to exchange the idiom for EDA cryptocurrency.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.745
So only I can buy Eclipse tool based on the value that I have in my wallet.

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.530
So my value is this amount,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.810
so this value of it EDM,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.329
I can only buy seven AB.

00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:48.710
So what they are simply do is you have to enter the 10.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.510
If I tried to enter a no,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.100
it will indicate maximum amount I can buy from the balance available is seven.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.600
So I put seven and click on by then,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.640
or they will be placed.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.475
So answer, your order is placed.

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.530
You can check it here.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.260
You can see the order history now.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.695
I didn't do previously any transaction.

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:14.150
If you see here,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.710
the transactions that I have done within the last three months,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.975
the things that I have bought and sold will be listed here.

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:30.620
So the dose you can see your history by going into the order history and check.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.770
Do you have more than one devo sold?

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.960
Everything can be seen from this app or the history.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.915
That is how you're going to buy.

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:44.810
All right, I hope now you archaea,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.170
what currency you would need to buy against what?

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.225
And any currency can be converted to any, any cryptocurrency,

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:58.355
even if you want to buy USD and in by using any other crypto,

00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:02.480
then you can select it from here. And so we did.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.065
And then through for the foreign market price,

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.060
you can exchange it.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.380
So why, what is the concept behind exchanging?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.120
Is that why as investors or other traders,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.520
we always see to the trends.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.800
And what is some trend towards that TO,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.440
let's say the amine is going downward.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.210
So what I would do is I

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.360
would wait until it goes down and say,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.850
there's another crypto making profit because it increase,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.699
I bought for two entity in its I vote for $1.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.570
Now it increase for $5 and with that $4 profit.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.880
And the DVM, I am seen it is going down now,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.285
but I also predict the script again,

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.220
have a future value,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.405
a high-value, say 28,500,

00:07:05.405 --> 00:07:11.900
but it was previously around 2 thousand,

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.605
so 500 days, but I still see a possibility,

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:18.080
some merit and not the one to two years.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.120
This might risk for 5000.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.325
So it's better.

00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:25.325
You also can buy eclipse tours,

00:07:25.325 --> 00:07:32.075
which are only having possibility to increase in the long run.

00:07:32.075 --> 00:07:36.410
And by the time and the prices goes down,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.470
novae call it as a crash.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.395
So when it is crashing,

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:45.470
people used to by n whole inking,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.985
this will increase in the long run.

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:53.810
So that is something we do as

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.625
investors we keep and meet hold by event the prices are lower.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:04.760
And then I would say by what time I would sell.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.700
Let's discuss this in the next video.
