00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.960
Welcome again, and we are going to lose on trading now,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.970
this is going to be very interesting.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.720
Now you all selected from the previous video of what coins

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.994
that you would like to invest and what could have a future.

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:25.950
Now you have done so Dan analysis as you watch

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.220
cryptocurrencies that you are planning to invest, right?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.840
So with that in mind,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.035
let's do some trading festival.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.655
Yeah, I have to go beside gum,

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:40.475
which is right beside the Biden's logo,

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:44.045
like nine boxes and when new deck Iago as they are,

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:48.900
and you can see a menu, click on exchange.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.935
Now the exchange is loaded.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.155
This is also considered as

00:00:54.155 --> 00:01:00.170
the world's largest crypto exchange in terrorism volume traded here.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.090
So initial screen it shows,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.150
I know this is like manf,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.205
black, green, and red.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:12.500
But you will be more fair,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.020
Emilia, I will take you through step-by-step.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.760
You will be more family estimate.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.650
We need to initially focus.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.450
And are we can understand this exchange was to fall right before we train.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.905
It's like the fingers and they determine in here and there.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:31.730
Of course we need to understand what this doesn't,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.090
how we can have a clear picture about this.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.165
The interface that we are seeing right now.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.135
If you see here BTC,

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:47.510
USD disease that the cryptocurrencies,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.220
if I am going to,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.965
what is the value now here actually it says,

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:56.585
what is the value of b it is in terms of with DT.

00:01:56.585 --> 00:01:59.105
So what is a trend that is,

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:03.560
but this chart says also how you can

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.540
select this is you can simply type BTC from this bond,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.510
the top right corner be ETC slash USD to always

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.990
keep in mind to check your cryptocurrency in terms of u is d, d.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.730
That is easy because we always come back in with the dollar value, right?

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.055
What is the value if?

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:31.730
Because we are very used with the dollar spendings.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.540
So we have a very good understanding about how much is a dollar value,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.270
and we need to compare it with the dollar value then only we will

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.550
have a very clear image it now mind

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.420
exactly how much we are going to invest in this crypto.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.260
So I'm going to select the VDC into USD t. So when I click that,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.585
it will be the same.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:03:03.290
That will pop up because it is already selected by default to us DT.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.225
And this chart, this green color attack shows the price right now.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:13.640
It changes. I can't see you.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.020
I can't even read this.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.540
It change right in seconds.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.340
So this is the price right now,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.460
this is how the price changing.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.195
And if you see the chart,

00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:29.750
you can see this axis, the ears.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.120
And here are the values.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.035
Okay? So in two thousand, two thousand,

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:47.810
eighteen, the value, it may have already read at all 19000.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.380
And likewise now we are in 2021 now

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.285
the prices 47,500 and it also reach two more.

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:03.050
Or you see here 58000 amount,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.110
you can see that shows the maximum or

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.625
the highest Bitcoin price that went up to right now.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:15.800
So this might be reading by the time you wash and trick.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.095
So from your cursor and refuse column B,

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:24.590
t, You can see a very zoomed,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.930
right, Like what has happened.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.120
The green shows the positive,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.535
it increased, but the red shows it decreased.

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:39.740
So you can see it increased all the time, right?

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.020
From the amount of tone, but it increased.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.780
It you see here the date, October 1st, 2021.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.220
The prices increase.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.690
It shows in lead and also this trend lines it shows for us it

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.970
is making us more easier to understand what is a trend.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.824
So then I can zoom in through my mouse,

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:13.895
the scroll button, and then it will show a better picture of what is happening.

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:16.460
What is the gap between the price increase?

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.720
So that is, that is what the gap here he has a so this is how I can see what is

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.530
the current price and what has happened by about did

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.330
it increased by one day or did produce and what is the overall trend?

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.875
I'm actually looking into timeframe of one month.

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:40.175
And likewise, I can also click on 1D.

00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:44.600
That means within the day what has happened is also shows fluctuations.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.630
Light, green shows it increase,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.575
and that I chose it decreased likewise.

00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:55.430
So what, again, you need to understand from

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.295
this chart is if you see here The market trends,

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:03.380
this shows the color,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.500
the exchange, how much people buy is green,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.520
how much people said it's all in BDC or much values,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.235
everything comes in and goes out.

00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:18.800
So this exchange, what determines this price?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.980
How much you are demanding to lie?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.875
It will impact the price to increase.

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:28.295
And now much you're selling.

00:06:28.295 --> 00:06:33.530
And then that will have an impact on this phase as well.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.170
So that is how the fluctuations happen.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.990
By itself then demand that you make the script dose.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.135
Right now again, okay,

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:49.100
we will look for another, another cryptocurrencies. Okay?

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.740
I'm going to now, okay,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.380
we reject AB right? Cardano.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.480
Can you remember from the previous video,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.455
Let's see what is happening to that crypto.

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:03.530
Is it good to buy or not?

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.440
Usd T.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.730
Here we go.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:15.320
A DAU is D. D will see what has happened and my friend could buy the coffee.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.970
It, it is increasing, right?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.205
If you see the trend is increasing,

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.710
right now it's in my tank,

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.270
that means it is, the price is downwards.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.100
But in few seconds the scandal up as well.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.650
So if you see look into this now.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:42.560
As of now and from the second of February,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.140
28th of February that has a vitamin decrease in terms of the daily view.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.330
And I found to look through this in a week view,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.315
of course, as a good thing.

00:07:56.315 --> 00:08:01.020
But the current week there is a downward.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.205
This is how, this,

00:08:04.205 --> 00:08:06.050
this is how the exchange,

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:15.065
and this is the price that you get if you are to buy ADA cryptocurrency right now.

00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:16.775
Okay.

00:08:16.775 --> 00:08:19.310
I hope this is clear and medically.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.410
Now with this view,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.200
green shows the improvements.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.660
Increase in rent shows the decline,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.850
not the downwards, the trend.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.670
And now you can select that cryptocurrency.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.865
What do you need to modify and Martini to buy?

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:41.670
It is you can type here.
