00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.280
Welcome.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.620
Now we relook in to how we can deposit crypto currencies into our code.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.140
If you can see I've already deposited,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.310
but we will look into how we can deposit newly.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.250
That means before you start trading,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.775
imagine your balances is 0 and you do not have any balance here,

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:36.575
then definitely you need to deposit some cryptocurrencies into account, right?

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:39.260
Then only you can start creating your orders.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.230
You can buy any other cryptocurrencies on leafy,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.650
have cryptocurrencies in your wallet.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.025
So how we can do that is we can click the pause it here, the yellow button.

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:54.785
And once you click deposit,

00:00:54.785 --> 00:01:02.045
you will be redirected to the network off here ten spot.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:04.385
That trade in method.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:11.975
So say you want to buy initially to find your car.

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.390
You're not directly going to buy Bitcoin,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.655
let's say you are going to buy you is DT.

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:20.210
This is also considered to be or less fee value of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.040
a new buy USD and USDA D or so-called Tanja and VT is equal to the dollar value.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.035
Say most of the people by day by USD

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:38.615
is that since this is going to be equal to the dollar value,

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.750
and this is a cryptocurrency.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.590
So people use to fund and deposit through USDA D,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.855
because it allows to buy any other cryptocurrency using USDA D,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:56.585
because the USDA DO that tender is also considered to be a cryptocurrency.

00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:00.245
Now, a very interesting part here.

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:04.490
Now, we selected the fear tends portrayed in and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.395
you're going to deposit crypto when you selected us DT.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.590
And now here your deposit network.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.370
Deposit network here means the seas,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.450
your wallet address based on what currency are going to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.520
receive and what is your wallet address that you are going to receive,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.390
for example, now, how you can receive on this through

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.520
a friend who will be sending new cryptocurrency,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.480
then walk through how to do is he might say, Okay,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.775
I'm going to send you as DT,

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:45.079
or let's say you're going to do some initial bank transplant.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.655
Nick, he is a friend of you.

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:48.665
Normal bank transfer.

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:51.890
And then he is going to transfer you from

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.370
his wallet clip taller Tojo wallet address then gave

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.800
allows us to understand here is that there will be different

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.890
that addresses that will be shown ERC 20 on me TLC to enter.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.110
These are the methods.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.210
Now you can see here

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.850
the ERC 20 DCS called another method allowed by some unit costs,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.265
just TRC to NP is a token stand. And he said.

00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:35.885
Based on the implementation of the smart contract when using the Tor network.

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:43.130
So since this is if the transaction is going to happen to your network,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.220
then you can simply copy all at address here

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.970
and you click it didn't automatically get the copy to clipboard.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.730
What else you can send your key work or to your friend who is going to send you crypto.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.660
Okay?

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.205
And this is a special bases.

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:08.180
This the wallet address is very unique and it can be duplicated.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.870
And if you notice that

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.020
the characters between 26 to 35 characters when it comes to a one at address.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.760
And therefore it is more secure and it will never be duplicated and it cannot be a guest,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.985
of course, you can see from the look of it.

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:29.045
So if your friend is,

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:34.370
he's going to send you through the C 20 or through the term network you can send.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.630
This address is let's say ERC 20,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.435
what is the C2 and D Now when it comes to the ERC-20 MD,

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:46.715
it is the theory of network.

00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:50.015
Now, when we look into the difference,

00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:53.870
USDA DRC 20 is

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.755
a USD T-Shirt Biotech based on the ETH net network, that ministerial network.

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:05.225
And the USDA drawn PRC to NP

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:10.460
is a USDA issued by theta based on the trauma network, right?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.440
So the currency deposit addresses the throne address.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:23.705
If you are going to use this TRS-80 AND which will be happening on the network.

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.720
So you are sending copy this and send him to jail.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.515
Friend who will be sending you the USD, USD D.

00:05:30.515 --> 00:05:35.840
But one important note is you can read here,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.755
send only USD to this deposit address,

00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:43.310
sending kind not talk and other than u is d t to

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.074
the centers may result in the loss of your deposit.

00:05:47.074 --> 00:05:54.530
Why do this is because you have selected the clip total receiving as the USDA the end.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.210
This is specifically the sad message delivered if you are to receive you as the d,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.050
and then only you have to send this address, the alert address.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.690
If not, you should not send this atlas if you

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.660
are receiving through any other cryptocurrencies,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.400
let say the area,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.760
and then there will be different options in that case.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.345
So you have to select the relevant law to hundreds of you.

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:19.790
All of these addresses with b belong to you,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.710
that mean very unique to your account.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.450
And then you can send to them.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.130
So they will send you the tons from the cryptocurrency.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.705
So as they transfer,

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:33.110
you can simply go into the overview and

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.470
check your balance whether you have received it or not.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.560
So here you can check whether you have a CAT DO NOT.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.785
And also you will get a notification.

00:06:54.785 --> 00:06:58.010
If you deposit the successful,

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.080
you will get a notification here.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.315
The force it's successful you have is w SDD on this dead this time.

00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:10.820
So that kind of multiplication also you can check from the bell-like and here.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.940
And that is one way of depositing funds.
