00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.590
Currently I'm on the list of template tags available on WordPress all template tags are stored in nine

2
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590
files and those list of files can be found here.

3
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.940
You basically find them inside the WP dash includes directory.

4
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.490
We're going to work our way down this list to start things off.

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.510
We'll explore the general tags as you may expect General tags are tags that don't necessarily fit in

6
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.390
any other category that are more general purpose and so you'll find a lot of functions for various scenarios

7
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.470
the kind of functions you can expect to find are includes log and functions blog info archive calendar

8
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.750
etc..

9
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.600
The first set of tanks are include tags.

10
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.410
These are functions that take care of loading a template file inside another template file.

11
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.120
We've actually explored every single one of these functions in the past two sections so you already

12
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.050
know what to expect out of these before we move forward.

13
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.400
I want to highlight that the comments template function isn't listed here despite being a general tag

14
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.920
in the resource section of this lecture.

15
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.730
I provide a link to this function.

16
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.270
If you were to scroll down to the source section you'll see that the function is defined inside the

17
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.430
comment dash template dot P HP file.

18
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.310
Just be aware that some tags aren't defined in the same files as the other tags.

19
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.940
Despite it not being defined in those files this is a template tag.

20
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.230
The next set of template tags are log and tags.

21
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.300
We haven't gone over authentication in this course but we will soon.

22
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.320
This is just a general overview.

23
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.280
The first function is the WP log in out function that will output a link to the log in or long out pages

24
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.780
depending on if the user is authenticated.

25
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.650
The next two functions will provide the URL to the log in or log out or else.

26
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.300
This is just in case you don't want to use the function above and have more control over your links.

27
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.770
Then we have the log in form function which will just output a simple log in form followed by the lost

28
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.810
password you URL and register your functions which will output links to those pages.

29
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.590
Lastly we have the is user logged in function which will return true or false if the user is logged

30
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.300
in let's play around with some of these tanks.

31
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.280
Right now I'm inside the experimental template inside the content area.

32
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.470
I'm going to echo out the value returned by the function WP logging you URL.

33
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.140
Let's go to our browser and refresh the page.

34
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.230
As expected we get the URL to the log page.

35
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.680
Something worth noting is that this function doesn't check if we're logged in or not.

36
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.210
Right now I'm logged in so I shouldn't be able to view this you are out.

37
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.510
If we want to let WordPress handle this and we can go back to the editor and change the function to

38
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.540
WP log in out this function doesn't need to be echoed out so we can remove the echo statement Save your

39
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.570
changes and refresh the page.

40
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.030
This function will take care of outputting the link while also surrounding it with HDMI tags.

41
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.170
A lot of this is very straightforward stuff

42
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.290
the next function is the blog info function.

43
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.330
This function will return information about your site.

44
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.900
There are two versions which are the blog info and get blog info functions.

45
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.840
Something worth highlighting is that you can only retrieve one value the value returned depends on what

46
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.550
you pass into the function.

47
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.940
Here are some examples of what you can pass into the function.

48
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.840
You can pass him the same values to both functions.

49
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.510
The only difference is that the blog info function will echo out the value and the get blog info function

50
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.770
will return the value.

51
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.180
Right now I'm on the documentation page for the blog info function.

52
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.880
If you scroll down to be possible values section then you'll find all the values you can get from this

53
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.010
function as you can see we can grab information such as the name you are L character set etc..

54
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.570
There is one thing I want to highlight about this function.

55
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.020
If you scroll up you'll find the change logs section.

56
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.650
This function was introduced in WordPress version zero point seven one.

57
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.930
It's been around for quite some time.

58
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.540
When it was first introduced there weren't a lot of ways to get certain values from the database.

59
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.350
However five major versions later WordPress has introduced a plethora of functions scrolling back down

60
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.970
you'll see that WordPress recommends alternative functions to grab certain values.

61
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.530
For example the you are rail description states the following displays the site address set in settings

62
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.190
general.

63
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.310
This data is retrieved from the home record in the WP underscore options table consider echoing home

64
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.100
your URL function inset.

65
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.290
There is no right or wrong answer here.

66
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.610
It really boils down to preference whenever you use the blog info function.

67
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.980
Always check the documentation for alternative solutions.

68
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.330
The next set of tags are archive tags archive tags are specifically for archive templates like categories

69
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.230
tags and taxonomy.

70
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.540
Apart from that they can also be used outside of the loop which can save you code in space.

71
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.960
Despite their appearance archive templates are one of the most complicated pieces of pages WordPress

72
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.740
has.

73
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.690
This is because you can archive a post by category date tag taxonomy etc..

74
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.920
There's just so much information attached to a post because of this archive tags are just as weird and

75
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.010
complex I'm back inside the experimental template.

76
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.130
I'm going to comment out any code we have here.

77
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:57.810
Then I'm going to call the function single post title as you would expect this will output the title

78
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.060
of the current post on top of that.

79
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.400
You'll notice we're not inside a loop.

80
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.730
Let's refresh the page and see what we get.

81
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.400
The title of the post now appears here.

82
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.460
That's great.

83
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.280
I won't be able to show you all the archive template tags but I do want to show you one thing I'm going

84
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.900
to open the category template for a moment inside the page titled section.

85
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.600
You'll find that we're using the template tags the archive title and the archive description.

86
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.880
WordPress provides another function for displaying the category title which is single cat title

87
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.950
once you have that set go back to your browser and view a category page a small change has occurred.

88
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.900
The text category does not appear before the name of the category.

89
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.290
Other than that everything else is the same.

90
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.350
So at this point you may be thinking what's the point.

91
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.420
What makes one function better than the other.

92
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.580
Well let's peek at the documentation for a second and the resource section of this lecture.

93
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.970
I provide a link to the the archive title function.

94
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:09.320
If you scroll down to the source code section then you'll see that this function calls the get the archive

95
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.890
title function.

96
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.380
Before we check out this function I want you to take note of the change long section which says this

97
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.480
was introduced in version four point one of WordPress.

98
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.960
This is important to note and you'll see why in a moment scrolling down further you'll find a section

99
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.150
called related uses which provides information about the functions used by this function.

100
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.760
I'm going to click on the link for the get the archive title function this time.

101
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.660
If you look at the source code you'll see that there is way more going on.

102
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:45.230
This function will check if the current page is a category tag and date archive.

103
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.480
Taking a closer look.

104
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.240
The single cat title function is called when the page is a category archive.

105
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.230
That's very strange but let's keep going down the rabbit hole to understand what's going on.

106
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.150
Scrolling down to the related uses section there should be a link for this function.

107
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.160
Click on it.

108
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.280
Two things worth noting on this page.

109
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.910
First up is the function.

110
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.830
If you call this function then you'll see that it's just passing off the data onto another function

111
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.090
called single term title.

112
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:18.880
That's strange because that's also a template tag listed on the general template tags file.

113
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.690
Anyway let's go to the related uses section once more and click the link to this function.

114
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.300
Now this is the function that actually takes care of grabbing the data we want.

115
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.800
WordPress goes through a lot of hurdles just to display a simple title and that's what I want to highlight.

116
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.880
On one hand archives are very broad and therefore they're complex.

117
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.530
A lot of checks have to be performed in order to grab the correct piece of information.

118
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:48.680
On the other hand this also shows that WordPress is not as organized as one may think.

119
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.430
WordPress receives criticism for gluing code together.

120
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.030
That's partially true.

121
00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.060
The reason we have the archive title function is because developers still had to add this logic to their

122
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.340
templates.

123
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.970
This made the code look sloppy and unorganized.

124
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.500
That's why the archive title function was introduced recently.

125
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.980
Despite all these functions being around for a while.

126
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.010
Luckily the team behind WordPress is working really hard to clean things up.

127
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.630
It's starting to become clear which functions should be used.

128
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.810
This is why we use the archive title function.

129
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.580
It's because it takes care of checking for everything rather than us doing all the work.

130
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.020
That was a lot to dig through but hopefully you understand what's going on behind the scenes.

131
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.870
If you were to go back to the list of template tags and clicked on the single tag title function you'll

132
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.030
see that this function does the exact same thing as a single cat title.

133
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.790
In my opinion it's better to use the archive title function so you don't have to memorize various functions.

134
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.320
I'm gonna go back to my catagory template and reverse the changes.

135
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:59.890
The next set of template tags are the calendar tags calendar tags aren't used much so I won't be diving

136
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.190
too much into them.

137
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.760
The most commonly used template tag is the get calendar function which will output a calendar in a table

138
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.210
format.

139
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:13.000
Lastly we have these other tags which don't necessarily belong to a specific category.

140
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.060
None of these are worth going over but you're more than free to check them out in the documentation.

141
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:24.250
Strangely enough the WP NQ script function is also listed as a template tag.

142
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.490
You already know what this function does so no need to recap on this.

143
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.080
All right.

144
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.210
That does it for the general tags.

145
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.690
I highly recommend you explore these tags once you finish the course.
