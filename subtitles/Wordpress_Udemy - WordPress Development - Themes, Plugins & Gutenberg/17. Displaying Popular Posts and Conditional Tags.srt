1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,570
One section we haven't gotten around to is this breaking news which is keeping track of popular posts

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,620
can be tedious and it's not exactly built into wordpress.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,840
Luckily there is a plugin out there that will help us out with that.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,350
I want you to go to the admin dashboard and add a new plug in the plug and I want to install is called

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,090
WordPress popular posts install and activate the one by Hector.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,160
This plugin will automatically help us keep track of what posts are popular by views

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,970
under settings.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,010
You'll find a menu item called WordPress popular posts here.

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,180
You can control what posts are popular and additional setting.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,240
We don't need to make any changes at this moment right now.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,580
None of the posts are popular.

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm going to open the home page with in a new tab and view at least three posts.

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:06,520
I want you to do the same refresh the admin page after you've done so and you'll now see those three

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,160
posts being displayed as popular posts.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,720
This is great so far.

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,040
There are now two things we need to do.

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,400
We need to display the popular posts and then we need to let the user control whether or not they want

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,500
to display it while we're at it.

19
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,280
We will also make the text breaking news changeable.

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:30,610
First let's display these posts inside the WordPress popular posts admin page.

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,930
I'm going to click on the parameters tab.

22
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,260
This plugin allows you to display the popular posts two ways.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,370
One way is through a short code and the other is through a template tag.

24
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,420
I want to use the template tag.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,630
You'll find a list of parameters we can set to modify the output we'll be using these shortly inside

26
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,070
the index template.

27
00:01:51,070 --> 00:02:03,110
I want you to perform a conditional check around the popular post widget.

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,770
I want to check for two things I want to check out the page being displayed is not a single post and

29
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,700
is the home page.

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,930
Using the functions exclamation point is single and is home.

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,920
These two functions are at WordPress calls conditional tags conditional tags or a way to check what

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,250
kind of page is being displayed in the resource section.

33
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,190
I provide a link to learn more about conditional tags.

34
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,100
Here is what WordPress has to say about it.

35
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,500
Conditional tags can be used in your temple of files to alter the display of content depending on the

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,110
conditions that the current page matches.

37
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,370
They tell WordPress what code to display under specific conditions.

38
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,770
Conditional tags usually work with p p if else conditional statements.

39
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,450
The Code begins by checking to see if a statement is true or false.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,660
If the statement is found to be true the first set of code is executed.

41
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,570
If it's false the first set of code is skipped and the second set of code after the else is executed

42
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,490
and set.

43
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,790
You can read up on this page to learn about the many conditional tags there are.

44
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,820
But for now the ones we're using will suffice.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,860
Throughout this course we'll be using conditional tags to help us change the final result.

46
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,140
All right now that we know that this is indeed the home page we can begin displaying the breaking news

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,940
widget.

48
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm also going to check if the WPP get most popular function exists

49
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:42,860
we can now call a function called WPP get most popular this function has a one parameter and that is

50
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,250
an array of settings we can set back on the admin side.

51
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,550
You'll find that the plug in WordPress popular post gives plenty of examples on how to use these settings.

52
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,020
There are only three that I want to use and those can be found at the very bottom.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,740
These last three keys determine how the posts are output it.

54
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:11,330
The first key we should set is the WPP start.

55
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,070
This will be the H2 CML.

56
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,790
That will be output and at the very beginning we have the static version of widget here.

57
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,950
I'm going to copy everything from the beginning all the way up to the opening tag with the class of

58
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,810
slider dash wrap.

59
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:32,580
I'm going to paste this in as the value the next key I want to set is the WPP end.

60
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,160
This should have all the closing tags.

61
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,980
The only thing we have left are these three links.

62
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,100
We only need one.

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,270
So I'm just going to cut one and get rid of the rest.

64
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,660
The last key to set is the post H GMO.

65
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,540
This Key's value will be the H GM l we just cut.

66
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,230
Previously

67
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,740
now we have to replace the static parts of this H2 UML into something like the function we'll be able

68
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,750
to read and replace.

69
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,580
If you look at the documentation you'll find that the developer provide you with what values can be

70
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,690
inserted and replaced the only ones we're concerned with are the your bell and text underscore title

71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,010
content tags.

72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,850
We just replace the static content with these content tags.

73
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,540
Make sure to surround them with one pair of curly brackets so that the plugin will be able to replace

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,700
the

75
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,840
let's refresh the page and you'll see the three posts we previously viewed being displayed as popular

76
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
posts.

77
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,280
The last thing we need to do is to make an optional to display this widget or not inside the miscellaneous

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,190
customized her.

79
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm going to create two new settings.

80
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,470
The first setting is called J.

81
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,600
You show header popular post widget which will have a default value a false.

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:08,530
I don't want this widget to be turned on by default.

83
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:14,740
The second setting will be j you popular post widget title which will have a default title of breaking

84
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:22,560
news.

85
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,080
The next step is to create a controller.

86
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm going to assign these two controllers to the AM I A C section the first controller will be a checkbox

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,610
with an I.D. of J.

88
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,370
You show header popular posts widget input

89
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:54,590
the second controller will just be a text input field with an I.D. of J You popular post widget title

90
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:54,980
input

91
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,850
there's nothing new here.

92
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,750
After creating these two settings and its controllers it's time to update the theme to reflect those

93
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,960
changes back inside the conditional statement.

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,740
I'm going to add one more check.

95
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,790
This will be checking if the theme mod J you show header popular post widget is turned on

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,730
the last thing I'm going to do is change the breaking news static text into its theme mod J You popular

97
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,900
post widget title

98
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,640
save your changes and let's check out the customize.

99
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,250
The checkbox should be unchecked and so therefore the popular post widget should not be showing.

100
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:52,220
Try turning it on and then change the text to popular posts after confirming if everything worked on

101
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,870
the preview then save your changes and double check on the front it.

102
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,130
That's it for now.

103
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,510
You'll notice that I spent an awful lot of time talking about other plugins and how to integrate them.

104
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm going to show you something in the resources section I provide a link to the theme for a site under

105
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,660
WordPress popular themes.

106
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,940
You'll notice a lot of themes are killing it and making massive amounts of sales.

107
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,850
I'm going to click on a Veda and you'll notice that this item highlights it's compatible with various

108
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,700
plugins and even comes bundled with some.

109
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,910
It's extremely common to bundle your themes with plugins that help it with certain tasks and functions.

110
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,440
Of course you'll be put in a situation where you'll have to make your own custom solution and we'll

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,210
definitely learn how to make plug ins soon.

112
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,810
For now don't worry bundling plug ins doesn't make you a bad developer just a more efficient one.
