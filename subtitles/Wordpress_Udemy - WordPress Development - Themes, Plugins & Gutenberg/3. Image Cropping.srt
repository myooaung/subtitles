00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,490
In this lecture we'll be exploring image cropping and image sciences.

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,000
WordPress makes it easy to crop images without having to download or use any external third party libraries.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,010
If we take a look at our posts on the home page you'll see our images fitting nice and tight.

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,640
However just like Buddy press the images may be bigger than they should be.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,330
Inspect the element and check the sizes of the images inside this little preview box you'll see the

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,860
size that's on the page and the natural size of the image.

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,960
We want the natural size and size on the page to be as close as they can be to save on bandwidth to

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,470
do this.

9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,860
We have to register the image size we desire in the resource section of this lecture.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,430
I provide a link to a function called Ad image signs.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,660
This function allows you to add a custom image size that WordPress will use whenever a new image is

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,400
uploaded by default.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,160
WordPress has some built in image sizes such as the thumbnail size which is a size we've used before

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,640
inside the setup function.

15
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,390
We're going to call this function.

16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm going to add this code right after the theme support functions.

17
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,700
Let's call this function now and the first parameter is the name of this size.

18
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,960
Any name will do.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,910
I'm going to set this to J you dash post dash image the second and third parameters are the width and

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,570
height respectively.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,780
These are values you'll have to test out through trial and error.

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:45,650
The sizes I like are 860 by 570 fine the last parameter is whether we want a soft crop or a hard crop.

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,100
If you're unfamiliar with soft or hard cropping then check out the link I have in the resource section

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,200
of this lecture.

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,460
This is a very long article that goes over image cropping and WordPress.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,420
It's definitely worth reading but I'm going to give you a quick rundown on what you need to know.

27
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,740
If you scroll down a bit you'll come across these two images from the author.

28
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,420
These two images are full sized and not cropped at all by default.

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:16,040
WordPress will set the fourth parameter to false meaning that images are soft cropped.

30
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,690
If you scroll down further you'll come across the images resize as you can see the images are not exactly

31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,700
the desired size the author wanted them to be the size the author put down is two hundred by two hundred.

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,670
So technically these images should be squares but they're not.

33
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,800
This is what WordPress calls a soft cropping.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,100
WordPress will resize an image to the dimensions you specify.

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,970
However if the ratio of the images cannot be kept intact it will then resize the image to as close as

36
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,410
to the dimensions you input it without having to crop any piece of the image or distorting it.

37
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,100
The next type of cropping is hard cropping harder cropping will resize an image to the exact dimensions

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,120
you inputting.

39
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,830
However if an image begins to look distorted it'll crop the image to prevent any distortion.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,270
So you're only getting a piece of that image if you scroll down you'll see how that's done.

41
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,170
You just pass in true and WordPress will crop the image from the center.

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,970
If you're not looking for a centering position you can't configure the fourth parameter as an array

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,040
and specify where you'd like the cropping to begin.

44
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,390
If you scroll down the examples you'll see the many ways images can be hard cropped so that's basically

45
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,240
this article in a nutshell.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,810
After this lecture is over I highly encourage you to give it a good read.

47
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,190
All right so I'm going to set my fourth parameter to false as I want solved cropping.

48
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:46,440
I prefer my whole image viewable without any cropping the size may be off and what I desired but I'm

49
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,500
fine with that.

50
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,010
Usually the size difference is only by a few pixels.

51
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,410
I'd rather have an image off by a few pixels than have an image off by a hundred or even a thousand

52
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,720
pixels.

53
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,180
Now that our image size is registered we can begin to use it in our own theme.

54
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:11,640
Open the content dash excerpt template part file look for where we outputting the featured image previously

55
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,340
we set this to full.

56
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm going to replace this with our custom image size and set this to J you dash post dash image

57
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,370
refresh the home page and expect the element

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,410
the size may or may not be exactly the sizes we specified but it's pretty close.

59
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,780
I'm going to open the single Templar file and do the same since the width of the post is the same as

60
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,880
the home page.

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,250
Look for where we output at the thumbnail and use the custom size

62
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,160
having your own image size is great.

63
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,140
But this will not always work.

64
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,100
Some users who install our theme may be installing it on an existing WordPress site if they have existing

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,640
images.

66
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,900
They may not all be resized only new images are resized and some old ones.

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,610
In this case we have to force all images to be resized to prevent any problems.

68
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,640
Luckily there's a plug in that does this go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plugins add new.

69
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,230
Then I want you to look for the plugin regenerate thumbnails install and activate this plugin

70
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,480
after installing this plugin.

71
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,620
Go to Tools region thumbnails the plugin will go through all the images uploaded through Wordpress and

72
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,280
resize them all for you using the default settings and your own custom sizes.

73
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,160
If a plugin also registers a size it will also resize the images according to that size.

74
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,460
All you have to do is click this button.

75
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,720
This may take a while especially if you have a lot of images.

76
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,690
Just be patient

77
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,570
after all the images have been resized.

78
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,190
We are assured that our image size has been applied to all images on the site.

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,510
This is a plug and we are going to recommend to the user when they install our theme.

80
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,100
We'll be going over a how to bundle all the plugins we installed so far with our theme.

81
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,190
In a future lecture.
