00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.700
A problem has appeared that really isn't visible at first glance.

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.440
If you take a look at the editor you'll see this button called Ad media right above it.

3
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.250
This allows you to use the media uploader inside the text senator.

4
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
It's really useful but not completely usable for everyone.

5
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.160
I want you to log out and then sign in as the test user we created earlier.

6
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.500
If you don't remember those credentials then just create another account and try submitting a recipe

7
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.150
you'll notice that the button we had previously is gone.

8
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.700
Long out and log back in as an admin.

9
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.130
So what exactly is going on.

10
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.790
Well first let's check out that capabilities versus roles table first in the resource section of this

11
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.210
lecture.

12
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.720
I provide a link to this page and table I've shown you this table before.

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.620
It lists all the roles and their capabilities by default.

14
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.550
All new users are assigned to the subscriber role.

15
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.130
Unless you manually set it scroll to the very bottom of the table and you'll see that the subscriber

16
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.850
role only has one capability which is read in order to see the ad media button.

17
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.530
You need the capability upload files.

18
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520
This is a very important concept to understand.

19
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.920
WordPress doesn't care very much about what role a user is in it cares more about their capabilities

20
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.760
WordPress plugins and themes will check your capability over your role.

21
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.410
All a role does is group your capabilities together.

22
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.810
If you scroll down this page even further you'll find the default capabilities described in detail and

23
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.480
what you can do with each one.

24
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.700
With that being said we have to decide on a way where the user can have the capability upload files.

25
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.910
The first solution that comes to mind is just to make it so all users who register are assigned to the

26
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.110
author role.

27
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.630
However this would also assign them other capabilities we may not want users to have.

28
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.510
Another solution is to modify the subscriber role and just and the upload files capability.

29
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.330
The problem with this is that we shouldn't try to modify default WordPress roles.

30
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.320
The last solution is to just create our own custom roll with custom capabilities.

31
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.910
This is the best solution and it's quite simple to implement open the plug and activation file.

32
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.130
At the very end of the function I'm going to grab the WP rolls global variable.

33
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.380
This variable contains information about the current roles in WordPress.

34
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.150
We need this.

35
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.120
If we're going to add our very own role with capabilities to add a role we need to call the function

36
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.070
add role.

37
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.200
This function has three parameters.

38
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.420
The first parameter is the role name.

39
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.620
This can be thought of as an I.D. for the role.

40
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.340
I'm going to set this to recipe author.

41
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.620
The second parameter is a readable name of the role.

42
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.650
I'm going to make this translatable and set this to recipe author the last parameter is a list of capabilities.

43
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.330
This role will have there are three roles I want to assign.

44
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.380
I want to set the read edit posts and upload files capabilities to true

45
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.230
all these capabilities will now be grouped together with this role.

46
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.850
That's all you need to do.

47
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.130
I want you to deactivate and reactivate this plugin.

48
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.840
You shouldn't receive any errors

49
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.530
now all we have to do is tell WordPress that all new registered users should be assigned this role.

50
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.890
Luckily you don't have to write a single line of code to accomplish this.

51
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.060
Go to Settings general if you look at the new user default role setting.

52
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.070
You'll notice that the recipe author role appearing as an option.

53
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.230
I want you to select this role and then save your changes

54
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.190
to save some time.

55
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.880
I'm not going to create a new user I'm just going to modify the test user and change their role to the

56
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.650
newly created role and save

57
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:27.140
that I'm going to log out and log in as the test user again try submitting a recipe.

58
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.640
You should see the ad media button up here for the user.

59
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.580
This is exactly what we wanted.

60
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.870
We can now proceed as normal.
