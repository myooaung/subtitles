00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.680
Throughout this course I've introduced you to various APIs and concepts related to WordPress.

2
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.230
Everything we've dealt with so far can be put under the word press corps API is the word press corps

3
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.230
API as is the general term for all the API is WordPress encompasses.

4
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.100
First let's understand what an API is an API is basically a set of functions variables and classes provided

5
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.440
by a system for you to use to interact with that system.

6
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.240
In our case WordPress is that system.

7
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.860
We've already been using some of those API is when we created our theme and plugin we didn't have to

8
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.270
create many of the queries ourselves or have to process a lot of the data.

9
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.900
A lot of it was taken care of by WordPress.

10
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
We used a list of functions provided by WordPress.

11
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.320
This reduced the time required to develop a theme and plugin in the resource section.

12
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.920
I provided a link to all WordPress API is available to us as you can see WordPress has quite a few API

13
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.390
lines.

14
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.880
I want to make one very important point about these API is all these API APIs are available in both

15
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.220
plugins and themes.

16
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.440
So let's say we use the database API you can use these functions when you're developing either a plugin

17
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.880
or a theme.

18
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.220
We won't be able to go over every API in this course but let me give you a brief overview of each one.

19
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.060
We've already talked about most of these API is already we've talked about the dashboard widgets API

20
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.070
and database API.

21
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.690
The file header API is one we haven't talked about yet.

22
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.620
This API allows you to read files in search for file header information.

23
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.370
If you can recall file headers are blocked comments that help WordPress to take plugins and themes.

24
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.700
If we were to open the main plugin file you'll find the file header we created at the very top.

25
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.970
These set of functions are what WordPress uses to read this information.

26
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.070
You're more than free to use these functions if you ever need to read file header information.

27
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.140
We won't be going over these but it's always nice to know that WordPress allows you to use the same

28
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.220
functions it uses the next API is the file system API.

29
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.870
This is an API we haven't gone over either.

30
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.900
This API is what WordPress uses to update itself traditionally to transfer files you would create a

31
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.310
form with an upload input and process the files after submission.

32
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.760
However this API goes beyond now by allowing you to securely connect with an external server and securely

33
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.610
transfer files between your server and the external server.

34
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.720
We won't be going over how this works because it's very uncommon to use this API however you're more

35
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.710
than free to read up on this API to learn more after you're finished with this course.

36
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.740
Let's keep going down the list.

37
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.070
We've already gone over the CTP API and metadata API.

38
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.780
The options API is what we'll be covering in the next few lectures as well as the settings API.

39
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.780
So I'll skip going over those for now.

40
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.490
The plugin API is the hooks actions and filters we discussed quite some time ago.

41
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.700
The quick tags API allows you to add buttons to the editor but we won't be using it as there are other

42
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.800
and better ways to accomplish this.

43
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.070
It's also outdated with the introduction of Gutenberg.

44
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.720
We've also gone over the rewrite API and short code API.

45
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.770
You'll notice there are two API here which are the modification API and customization API.

46
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.010
The customization API is specifically for the WordPress customize or the modification API is for theme

47
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.290
modifications settings which are saved in the database.

48
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.240
These two APIs are connected together but despite that WordPress addresses that the two can be separated.

49
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.010
You don't have to use customize your API to use the modifications API.

50
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.590
You can add and remove modifications wherever you want.

51
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.650
The next API eyes are the transients and widgets API.

52
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.060
We've already discussed how to use these.

53
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.500
The very last API is ex email RBC WordPress API.

54
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.160
This API is a very special case use it gives developers who make mobile apps desktop apps and other

55
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.810
services.

56
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.910
The ability to talk to your WordPress site WordPress provides developers a way to write applications

57
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.590
that can do many of the things that you can do when launched into wordpress via the web interface.

58
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:40.290
These tasks include publish a post edit a post delete a post upload a new file get a list of comments

59
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.580
edit comments we won't be going over this API as this kind of stuff goes beyond the scope of this course.

60
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.790
That pretty much sums up all the API is in the next few lectures will work on improving the recipe plugin

61
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.220
before we get into the more advanced topics.
