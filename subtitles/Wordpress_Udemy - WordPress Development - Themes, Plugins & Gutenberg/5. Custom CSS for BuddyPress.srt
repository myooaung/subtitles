1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,250
We're almost done with Buddy press.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,670
The last thing we want to do is learn how to make some custom CSF changes.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,480
It's simpler than you may think.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:22,000
Inside the buddy press default nouveau template you'll find a folder called CSX buddy press will look

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,730
for a folder named CSX.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,980
Inside your themes folder if it's available then it will look for a file named Buddy Prescott CSX and

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,840
automatically load it for you.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,760
I'm going to copy the entire CSX folder and paste it into our things folder like so

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,310
to verify that this is working.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm going to open the buddy press men dot CSX file.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,550
I'm going to select the buddy press I.D. and apply a random background color change

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,560
refresh the page.

13
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,600
After doing so you should see the changes applied.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,730
This shows that Buddy Press is now loading the style sheets from our theme rather than its default stylings.

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,480
I'm going to remove the code we just added now that we verified the CSF file is being loaded.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,210
We can now make some changes.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,660
You're free to modify this C assess file any way you like.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,490
It is as simple as that.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,420
The only unfortunate part is that you need to name these files a certain way and they must be placed

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,850
inside a folder called CSX.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,820
Other than that everything else is customizable so that does it for the buddy press development part

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,800
of this course.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,630
There isn't much to it honestly.

24
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:40,270
You'll end up doing one of three things you may want to modify the templates HDMI all you now know how

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,480
to do that you just study the HCM L or read the template hierarchy and add that file to your theme in

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,150
their respective directory.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,570
Afterwards you can make the changes you'd like to see.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,550
You may want to hook into certain parts of Buddy press.

29
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,980
It's as simple as looking for the do action function inside the templates and using that hook to output

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
some HCM out.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,090
In case you don't want to modify the template directly.

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,940
The last thing you may want to do is make some CSF changes and that's as simple as creating the buddy

33
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,520
Prescott CSX SS file before I wrap up this lecture and move on to the next thing.

34
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,940
You may be concerned about drastic changes to Buddy press.

35
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:25,010
Luckily buddy press will always inform you about template changes if your theme supports buddy press.

36
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,540
It's always best to keep up with the latest updates and to read about them when they do release notes.

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,400
However if for some reason you miss an email you can always go to the buddy press theme development

38
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,060
documentation page on the sidebar.

39
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,180
You'll find a list called template updates followed by the version number.

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,630
I'm going to click on two point seven.

41
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,590
You'll be shown a list of changes made to their templates.

42
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,530
If you made a change to any of these templates then you just have to read through this and apply the

43
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,200
changes manually.

44
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,680
This is the benefit of only copying the templates you use into your theme.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,050
If you were to copy the entire directory into your theme then you would end up having to apply every

46
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,360
single change documented here.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,210
This is why I highly recommend you only override the template to actually want to make changes too.

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,340
Also as you can see here there is a lot of code and changes you'd have to make.

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,130
It's almost an entire nights worth of code here.

50
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,040
All right that does it for Buddy press in the next couple of lectures.

51
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,880
We're going to begin working on new commerce development.
