1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,500
We're going to start things off by creating a theme as I stated previously.

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,140
This course does not focus on most of the HDMI out see assess and JavaScript provided to you.

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,700
This is because WordPress is very flexible when it comes to developing themes.

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,700
With that said I already have a static template ready.

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,760
You can download this template in the resource section of this lecture.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,100
This template was built with Version 4 of bootstrap.

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,650
I've done nothing to this template that makes it WordPress ready.

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,060
I will walk you through every step to convert it from a static template into a wordpress theme.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,070
If you have a template ready then feel free to use it.

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,390
You don't have to make any CSX or H team l changes at this moment any kind of template will work.

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,800
If you're new to WordPress development then I recommend you use the template I provide.

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,790
Let's take a look at some of the pages.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,110
Let's view the home page as you can see everything is pretty standard.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,570
We have a header footer sidebar and a list of posts everything that you see here will be turned into

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,940
a fully functional theme while the design is simple and clean.

16
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,330
Don't let that fool you.

17
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,200
We're going to make this thing very flexible now that we have an idea of what we're going to create.

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,670
It's time to start coding open the text editor of your choice and point it to the WordPress directory

19
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:33,320
we installed in the previous lecture inside the wordpress installation navigate to WP dash content slash

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,160
themes.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,350
This is where WordPress will search for theme files from the start.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,030
WordPress has already prepackaged some themes for you.

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,110
We want to keep our theme separated from the rest of the themes so create a new folder called Udemy

24
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,690
it's required that you create a folder for your theme.

25
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,560
This is so themes don't conflict with each other.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,610
It's also great for organization.

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,260
Inside this folder you will have to create two files.

28
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:09,710
The first file is style that CSX and the second file is indexed not BHP.

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,360
These are the only two files required by WordPress to create a theme.

30
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,540
These style dot CSX file is where we will place or file header information.

31
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,520
A file header is just a comment block placed at the very top of the style that CSX file that describes

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,530
our theme.

33
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,980
Let's open this file and create a file header in the resource section.

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,250
I provide the link to more information about the file header the file header is a block comment placed

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,500
at the top of the file that has met information about a theme or plugin.

36
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,190
I'll explain more in just a moment but let's see this in action.

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,900
Scroll down to the theme file header example section.

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,350
Copy and paste this into the style that CFS file.

39
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,030
I'm going to remove most of this info except the theme name change this value to you to me.

40
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,990
That's it.

41
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,480
This is the absolute minimum requirements for a theme.

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,920
Go to your WordPress admin dashboard and navigate to appearance themes an empty block with the theme

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,230
name Udemy should appear.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,960
You can actually activate this theme and start using it.

45
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,120
If you did everything right then you should receive no errors.

46
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,220
Let's go to the front end of the site.

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,970
You'll see an empty page.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,410
However WordPress throws no errors because we did everything required.

49
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,870
If you take a look at the source code then you will find that WordPress added absolutely nothing because

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,430
that's our team's job.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,820
As you can see WordPress gives you complete control over your theme.

52
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,390
Let me prove this even further.

53
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,970
Open the index top page PDF file and add the text.

54
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,810
Hello World

55
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,820
refresh the front page and you will now see it output it.

56
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,890
Wordpress is very smart and will automatically load this file without us having to write any logic the

57
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,810
index stop page PDF file can be thought of as the default template for wordpress.

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,890
There are various templates we can create but we'll cover that later.

59
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,570
I'm going to temporarily switch back to the theme 2017

60
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:25,400
then I'm going to delete the index stop the HP file.

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,910
I'm going to refresh the admin things page and you'll notice that the broken theme section appears below.

62
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,690
It's telling us that the index stopped Pete.

63
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,400
Templar file is missing.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,460
Wordpress is capable of finding out this information even though this theme is inactive the absolute

65
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,060
minimum requirement for creating a wordpress theme is the style that CSX indexed P2P files and the file

66
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,730
header with just the name of a theme.

67
00:04:51,730 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm going to create the index stop page file again so we don't see this broken theme section let's go

68
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,810
back to the file header in the style that CFS file.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,220
Let me go over what's going on when WordPress retrieves a list of themes in your wordpress installation.

70
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:17,080
It'll go to the WP dash content slash themes folder each theme should have its own folder and WordPress

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,820
will go through each one and look for a file named style dot CSX.

72
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,130
If this file is available then WordPress will scan the contents of this file and look for something

73
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,660
called the file header.

74
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:35,080
If a file header is available WordPress will then extract each piece of information from that header.

75
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,830
The format is the name followed by a colon and then the value the data inside this comment is what WordPress

76
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,620
calls meta information for themes.

77
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,200
The only thing you need is the theme name.

78
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm going to rehab the medic information we previously removed.

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,230
Let's go over this one by one.

80
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,370
The thing you are awry is a link to where users can view where your theme can be found officially.

81
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,390
I'm going to remove this piece of information.

82
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,140
Feel free to keep or remove it as well.

83
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,390
The author is the name of the creator of this theme.

84
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,860
This can be your own personal name or if you're on a team then the name of your team.

85
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,910
I'm going to set this to Jack.

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,040
The author you are why is the U.R.L. to your own personal site or you are to your team's site.

87
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:29,170
I'm going to set this to HDD P.S. Cohen slash slash u to me dot com the description is a brief summary

88
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,190
about your theme.

89
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,490
Let's set this to a simple bootstrap wordpress theme

90
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,700
the version is the current version of this theme since this is a brand new theme.

91
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,130
We'll be setting this to one point zero.

92
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,160
You can use whatever version schematic you want.

93
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,550
WordPress doesn't force you to stick any specific version schematic.

94
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,050
The license is simply the name of the license you'll be using.

95
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,220
I'm going to leave this as is for now.

96
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,400
We'll be going over licenses later in this course.

97
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,570
The license you are righ is the your l to where the user can find more information about the themes

98
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,900
license the tags is the comma separated list of words that describe your theme.

99
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,600
This piece of information is used by wordpress theme repository to help users find your theme.

100
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,040
If you plan on uploading your theme to WordPress dot org then setting this piece of information is important.

101
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,710
I don't plan on uploading this to the repository so we can remove this.

102
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:39,870
The last property we can set is the text domain the text domain is very important when it comes to translating

103
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,880
our theme.

104
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,900
You can think of the text domain as a unique idea for our translations.

105
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,460
It's common practice to set the text domain to the same name as your folder.

106
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,850
In our case we're going to set it to you to me I promise you we'll be going more over what the text

107
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,950
domain does and its role in WordPress development later in the course.

108
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,410
For now just know that if you want to make your themes or plugins translate ready then set the text

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,240
domain to something unique.

110
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,000
Right below there's this small bit of text you do not have to add this bit of information.

111
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,880
Authors usually use this space to add in more info about the theme such as license info or developer

112
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,750
notes.

113
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,220
WordPress will not bother standing this part of the file so you did not have to worry about it.

114
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,450
I'm going to remove this bit.

115
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,550
Let's go back to the themes admin page and refresh the page.

116
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,950
You can click on the theme and you will now see some of our information displayed.

117
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,630
As you can tell so far WordPress handles a lot for us.

118
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,750
If you'd like to know more about file headers then I highly suggest you read the Codex page I provided

119
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,890
earlier.

120
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,170
This page details what metadata you can create.

121
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,230
You'll notice that it provides information about creating plugins.

122
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,370
I want you to ignore this for now as will be developing plug ins in a future section.

123
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,170
There's one last thing I want to do before I end this election while not required.

124
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,790
WordPress will search for a file called screenshot dot PMG.

125
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,430
This file is basically a screenshot of your theme that will be displayed on the admin side of WordPress

126
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,680
and the resource section I provide a screenshot.

127
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:32,150
You can use for our theme upload it to the Udemy theme directory we just created.

128
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:38,260
You can now refresh the themes admin page and you will now see our screenshot being displayed.

129
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,100
You can create your own screenshot if you'd like.

130
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,280
The recommended size for a screenshot is 8 80 by 6.

131
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,970
However you should double the size for retina devices.
