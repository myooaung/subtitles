1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,720
We're almost finished.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,750
Folks the last step to any plug in or theme is distributing it.

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:19,870
Let's start by talking about licensing admittedly WordPress has had a controversial history with licensing.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,960
Back in 2009 people predicted that WordPress would die due to dual licensing or split licensing.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,200
Wordpress is licensed under the GPL license.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,040
It basically means that the software is free to use modify and distribute.

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,160
There is no secret encryption or files that you are not allowed to access.

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,850
It's all available to you.

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,990
This was considered great to many but there was one important question some had.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,860
What about commercial themes and plugins.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,640
Well technically all plugins and themes must all be distributed with the GPL license to this concerned.

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,120
Many developers because it meant that all their code would have to be made available for free.

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,290
However this is far from the truth.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,110
You are still allowed to sell plugins and themes.

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,150
Your code must be available to modify but that doesn't mean you can't sell it.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,340
It's perfectly fine to sell your plugins and themes.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,340
You can also create a license system that provides buyers a way to receive updates and support.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,470
If you're providing your plugin or theme for free then this topic shouldn't worry you so much.

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,620
You can simply go to WordPress dot org create an account and upload your plugin.

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,230
The rest is taken care of for you if you want to sell your plugin and or theme then you have two main

21
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,270
options available to you.

22
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,330
You can create your own site to attract buyers.

23
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,430
This would mean you wouldn't have to take care of everything from MCO to processing transactions and

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,500
creating a licensing system.

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,870
A lot of developers have taken this route and are successful to this day.

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,600
For others this can be a bit time consuming as it can take a long time and money to market your plugin.

27
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,060
Luckily there's another alternative.

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,730
There's a marketplace called Code Canyon MTM forest.

29
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,780
Both marketplaces are owned by a company called and vato.

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,430
Right now I'm on the Infowars looking at the top selling wordpress themes page.

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,690
The most popular theme here is called a veto.

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,620
This company is selling about 2000 copies a week at the price of sixty dollars.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,400
Through theme for us they're able to generate a lot of revenue in Votto provides the licensing transaction

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,330
processing and the marketing of your plugin and or theme there's a rating system a form a lot of buyers

35
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,320
and the tools to help sell your code.

36
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,560
All you have to do is provide the goods.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,370
Of course there is a variable fee of around 20 percent but it's well worth it.

38
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,300
I've personally sold on this platform and have made a decent amount of sales selling both themes and

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,210
plugins.

40
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,490
If you want to start receiving sales quickly then I highly recommend you consider selling on code.

41
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,130
Kenyan MTM forest.
