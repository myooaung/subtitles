00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.920
Right now I'm looking at the list of classes we can use for the controller.

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.450
We've gone over how to create a regular input field.

3
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.620
Now I want to show you how to use the color picker and upload controllers.

4
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.470
Here's what we're going to do.

5
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.690
I want to allow users to be able to change the color of these read more links inside each post excerpt.

6
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.170
Then I want to allow them to upload a PDA report so their visitors can download it.

7
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.610
Let's get started.

8
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.560
Open the miscellaneous customized function.

9
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.240
I've minimized a lot of the code in here so it's easier to read.

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.640
As usual the first step is create the settings the first setting will be called.

11
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.420
Jay you read more color with the default value of hash 1 abc 9 see this as the default color value for

12
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.020
the links

13
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.040
the next setting will be.

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:09.730
Jay you are poor file with a default value of an empty string.

15
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.990
The next step is to create a section.

16
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.280
However I plan on assigning the controllers under the MERS c section so we can skip on to Step 3.

17
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.390
We'll start with the color controller at the very bottom called the ad control method.

18
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.580
Let's go back to the list of controller classes and view the color controller.

19
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.880
As you can see it's not really complex to use at all.

20
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.110
I'm going to copy the code inside this controller and paste it into the ad control method like so let's

21
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.800
go through this one by one.

22
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.640
These parameters are exactly the same as the regular customize or controller.

23
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.570
The first parameter for this class is the WP customize object itself.

24
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.030
The second parameter is the idea.

25
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:04.490
I'm going to set this to J you read more color input the label will be read more link color which will

26
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:13.040
also be translatable then I'm going to set the section and settings key to their corresponding values

27
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.810
nothing really new so far.

28
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.460
WordPress takes care of the rest.

29
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.950
Setting up the color picker.

30
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.880
I'm going to call the ad control method again.

31
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.870
This time we're going to set up.

32
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.150
Use the upload control class.

33
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.330
Go back to the list of classes and this time let's check out the upload control class.

34
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.850
Just like the color picker.

35
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.500
The upload controller is also very simple.

36
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.440
I'm going to copy this code and paste it into our method.

37
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.140
The code is exactly the same as last time.

38
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.600
The WordPress team does a great job of making their customized classes consistent.

39
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:05.100
I'm going to set the I.D. to J you report file input the label key will be set to file a report

40
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.330
then I'm going to set the section and settings key to their corresponding values

41
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.240
just like that.

42
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.140
We now have the settings and controllers all set up.

43
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.220
The next step is to have these values reflected onto the theme.

44
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.140
Let's start with the read more color.

45
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.940
Open the NQ function for the front end.

46
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.160
I'm going to add my code right after where we end queue the files.

47
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.280
The color we have will be dynamic dynamic CSX is kind of hard to pull off because of the solutions that

48
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.310
are available.

49
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.670
There are two ways we can go about this.

50
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.330
The first solution would be to create a PHC file that will output that dynamic CSX and change the headers.

51
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.750
The second solution would be to use inline styles.

52
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.490
Both of these solutions are completely valid and I've seen developers use one or the other.

53
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.060
It is really up to you.

54
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.320
This is a really simple C assess change.

55
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.920
So I'm going to use inline styles.

56
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.590
It's quicker and easier to understand.

57
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.800
I'm going to call the function WP add inline style as the name suggests this will load inline styles

58
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.490
inside the head tag of the document.

59
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.630
The great thing about this function is that it will only load the inline styles if a particular file

60
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.010
is in cute.

61
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.470
You can specify that as the first parameter.

62
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.480
I only want to load these inline styles if the j u custom file is loaded.

63
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.330
The second parameter is the CSX itself.

64
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.250
You input this as a string.

65
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.880
I'm going to paste in some simple CSX.

66
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.350
There's nothing really complex going on here.

67
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.770
All I'm doing is changing the color of the link in its border using the dynamic color setting.

68
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.620
Just like that the read more link will be dynamic.

69
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.440
The last thing to do is to display the link to the downloadable report.

70
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.060
Open the footer file.

71
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.500
I'm going to add this code right after the copyright text inside a conditional statement.

72
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.320
I'm going to check if the mod Jay you report file has a value.

73
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.420
The upload controller will set the value to the full 8 GDP or l to the file itself.

74
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.290
It will take care of uploading and processing the file for you.

75
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.890
With that said if there is a file then I want to output a simple Ankara link with the text download

76
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.790
report.

77
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.490
Make sure to add a brake tag afterwards

78
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.040
that basically wraps it up.

79
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.150
Let's refresh the Customize here and check if everything works by default.

80
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.430
The links should still be this green blue color and the download link in the footer should not appear.

81
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.400
Change the color to any color you want and then upload a file for the report in the resource section

82
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.060
of this lecture.

83
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.140
I provide a link to this report.

84
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.660
Feel free to download it and use it after making your changes.

85
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.740
You should see everything work properly.

86
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.410
That's it for the customize.

87
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.320
It's a lot of code to write but the process is very straightforward.

88
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.560
I highly encourage you to play with it more to get better at using it.
