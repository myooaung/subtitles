1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,880
Let's keep adding onto the recipe plug in the next thing we want to do is create one of these Dashboard

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,340
widgets on the WordPress admin page.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,740
A lot of plugins add dashboard which is to provide more info about the plugin itself or the data it

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,800
provides.

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,520
It's perfect for adding a little news widget feed so users can be kept up to date with your plugin.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,220
Let's create one ourselves.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,260
The widget we'll create will provide the latest five ratings inside the main plugin file at an action

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,620
hook called WP dashboard setup the function to call is our ad Dashboard Widgets

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,090
create a file in the admin folder named dashboard dash widgets dot P. HP and define the function here

10
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,420
as always.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,770
Make sure to include this file from the main plugin file

12
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,160
creating a dashboard widget is really easy.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,540
You only have to call one function which is the WP ad Dashboard widget function.

14
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,030
There are three parameters we need to set.

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,740
First is the slug which can be thought of as a unique idea.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:27,870
Set this to our latest recipe rating which it the second parameter is the title of our widget.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:35,790
Set this to latest recipe ratings the last parameter is the function to call which will display the

18
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,380
contents of the widget.

19
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:44,070
Set this to our latest recipe rating display in the same file.

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,940
Let's define the display function.

21
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,970
We want the widget to display the five latest ratings to do this.

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,370
We'll need the WP DB global object.

23
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,430
Create a variable called latest ratings that will be set to the value returned by the Get Results method

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,560
of the WP PDB object

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,960
the query will be using will simply select all the data in the recipe ratings recipe

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,050
to get the latest entries.

27
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,880
We have to set the order by for the I.D. column in descending order.

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,420
Lastly limit the amount of results returned by 5

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,880
next.

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,690
Echo out some UL tags and in-between these tags will run a for each loop that will loop through the

31
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,980
latest ratings array

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,430
the Get Results method will return an array of results each item in the array will be an object.

33
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,910
Now I'm going to create two variables for the title and perma link to get these values we can use the

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,730
functions get the title and get the perma link which will return the values we need about a particular

35
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:10,770
post notice that we're using these functions inside a plugin and outside of the loop to use these functions

36
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,550
properly.

37
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:18,300
We have to pass in the post I.D. we can get the I.D. by accessing the recipe ideas property from the

38
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,590
rating object.

39
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,470
This is where we stored the post I.D..

40
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,800
Lastly I'm just going to paste in some HCM El nothing special going on in here.

41
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,810
I'm just echoing out the values and displaying a message that informs the user about which recipe received

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,910
a rating and the rating itself.

43
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,970
Save your changes and let's view the admin dashboard again.

44
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,490
We will now see our latest recipe widget along with the latest ratings.

45
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,170
If you don't see any ratings then try reading a recipe and come back to this page.
