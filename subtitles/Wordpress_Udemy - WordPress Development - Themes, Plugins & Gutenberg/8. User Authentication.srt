00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:13,370
In this lecture we're going to finish up our short code by making the log form work inside the main

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,630
dot J.S. file.

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,510
I'm going to copy and paste the previous javascript code we used for the register form.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,380
I'm going to change a lot of this code from the field to the status messages so that they reflect the

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,400
log into form instead the action will be recipe user log in.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,620
Make sure to update the status messages and selections.

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,860
Nothing crazy here.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,720
It's what we did previously create a new Ajax action hook with no privileges.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,040
I'm going to copy and paste the action I used in the form object like so

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,100
create a file inside the process folder called log and BHP and define the function inside here.

11
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,560
Make sure to include it from the main plugin file

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,670
inside this function.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:14,520
I'm going to ground the first two lines from the Create Account file and paste it in here I'm creating

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,670
an output variable grabbing and verifying the nonce and then checking to see if the user name and password

15
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,950
was submitted.

16
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,890
I'm going to remove the email and password confirmation from this check.

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,340
Really nothing new so far.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm going to create a new variable named a user that will contain the value returned by the function

19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,870
WP sign on this function will authenticate users for you.

20
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,760
This is the function I recommend you use when you're authenticating users who have already logged in

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,960
before this function has two parameters.

22
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,980
The first is an array of the log in credentials a will use to verify and authenticate the current user.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,010
There are three fields we can set the user log in except the user name.

24
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,100
I'm going to sanitize this while I'm at it

25
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,900
the next key is user password which accepts the password.

26
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Lastly the remember key allows you to specify whether the user should be remembered on this device.

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,170
I'm going to set this to true.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,080
This will sign the user in just to make sure we're going to create another conditional statement checking

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,710
if this function and returns an error object using the is WP error function.

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,000
If it is an error object then we'll just kill the script.

31
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,520
Otherwise we'll update the status to 2 and kill the script once more.

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,170
That will take care of everything.

33
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:59,060
If you haven't already log out and then try logging in after confirming that everything works.

34
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,210
There's one last thing we want to do.

35
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,250
We're almost finished.

36
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,260
I promise.

37
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,480
If you were to go to the admin dashboard and navigate to settings general you'll find a setting called

38
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,400
anyone can register.

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,460
This setting controls word presses registration form even if this is ticked off plugins can still create

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,870
accounts with code.

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,470
We're going to use this setting to our advantage.

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,820
I want to hide the form.

43
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,320
If registration is disabled we'll start by creating a place holder inside the template.

44
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:36,190
Find the div tag that contains the whole registration form and add show Reg form will replace this place

45
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,980
holder with a style attribute inside the shortcut function.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,160
Add another string replacement function

47
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,000
for the replace function.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,460
We're going to use a ternary operator.

49
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,120
We'll be performing a check using a function called Get option.

50
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,640
We haven't discussed the options API but this function will grab the options from the options table

51
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:07,620
using Heidi yes Q Well you can open the WP options table WordPress stores all of its settings here.

52
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,630
It also stores transients and plug in options.

53
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,770
One of the options is users can register.

54
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,610
This is the option that is updated when you tick the checkbox on the admin settings page.

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,760
If the value is 0 then that means the registration is closed.

56
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,000
If it's 1 then that means registration is open.

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,380
We can pass this into the get option function and it will tell us whether or not registration is open.

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,540
If this check returns false we'll have the registration form with a simple display CSA style

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,030
otherwise it'll be empty and display as is.

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:55,590
Save your work update the settings to disable registration and try viewing the form.

61
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,010
It should not display the very last thing you want to do is hide these forms.

62
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,440
If the user is logged in right now I'm logged in and it should not be displaying inside the short code.

63
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,980
Function.

64
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,890
Create a conditional statement at the very top.

65
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,490
Call the function is user logged in.

66
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,680
If this returns true we'll just return an empty string

67
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,390
refresh the page and you should see nothing appear that's it.

68
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,830
We're finally finished.

69
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,190
It was a lot to go through but well worth it.
