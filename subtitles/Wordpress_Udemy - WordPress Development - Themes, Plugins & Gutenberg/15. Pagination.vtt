00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.760
Padgett nation is pretty simple in the resource section.

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.440
I provide a link to world presses page nation Codex page typically page nation tends to be difficult

3
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.260
because you have to account for various scenarios.

4
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.210
However as you can see here WordPress provides a few functions that we can use for Patch a nation.

5
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.240
These functions will work universally on various templates and different types of pages.

6
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.270
This is great because now you don't have to do a lot of the work WordPress will do the heavy lifting

7
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.180
for you.

8
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.950
All you have to do is call these functions in the appropriate locations open the index template inside

9
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.200
your editor at the bottom of the template you'll see the static pageant Asian buttons right above the

10
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.800
links.

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.840
I'm going to place my code here.

12
00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:01.540
Call the function next posts link this function is pretty simple it will check if there are older posts

13
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.080
and if there is then it'll output a link to that page.

14
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.500
There is an optional parameter which is the text to display.

15
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.990
I'm going to use the text I had in the static pages nation link.

16
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.870
Next we're going to use a function called previous posts link which does the same thing as our previous

17
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.310
function.

18
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.780
Except it checks for newer posts.

19
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.700
I'll also pass in the same text in its static version.

20
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.490
I'm going to common out the static version of the patch a nation links.

21
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.620
We'll be needing them later.

22
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.610
So no need to get rid of them.

23
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.740
All right let's refresh the page and test out the page nation links.

24
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.210
The links shouldn't be appearing and working.

25
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.950
However there is a problem they don't have the nice styling.

26
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.370
Unfortunately these can't be changed through the function.

27
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.660
Instead we have to use something called filters to accomplish this.

28
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.070
We haven't gotten that far.

29
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.550
So for now we're going to leave things as is in a future lecture.

30
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.730
We'll be fixing these passive nation links to look more like the static template after we've discussed

31
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.080
filters.

32
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260
Now that everything is working perfectly.

33
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.220
Let's take a look at our template.

34
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.800
When we started we had a few hundred lines of code with the help of WordPress.

35
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.750
It's been reduced heavily to less than 100 lines of code.

36
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.750
We worried very little about the code.

37
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.170
It's extremely easy to integrate your template into a word resting.

38
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.960
We haven't had to write one single database query or perform any checks.

39
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.970
This is the power of WordPress.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.070
It is this simple.

41
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.840
This concludes this section.

42
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.440
We started out with a static HD email template and converted it into a functioning WordPress thing.

43
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.550
This theme is not even close to complete but look at how far we got in such a short amount of time.

44
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.280
I'm going to recap over some of the things we've learned so far.

45
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.790
One of the most important steps we took was loading the style sheets and scripts.

46
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.590
We did this by registering and then queuing them a lot of beginners usually want to avoid this step

47
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.700
and just manually link them in the head tax.

48
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.570
However this is considered bad practice.

49
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.650
You end up missing out on a lot of the features WordPress provides.

50
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.270
There are plugins out there that provide compression modification and concatenation all these concepts

51
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.150
speed up your site significantly.

52
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.300
These features are only available if you register and then queue your files so it's always important

53
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.180
that you use the proper hooks and functions for loading your files never manually place them in the

54
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.570
head tags.

55
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.890
The next thing we did was start displaying the menus.

56
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.130
There are two ways to go about this.

57
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.120
You can manually create your own menu system.

58
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.690
This is a completely acceptable solution but it is not a common one.

59
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.830
WordPress provides this feature along with others for you.

60
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.250
All you have to do is register a menu and then display it in your template.

61
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.390
WordPress takes care of managing and processing the data for you.

62
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.550
After that we began splitting up the template into various sections.

63
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.980
This makes our code more readable and easier to manage.

64
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.820
We also took care of creating the form and began displaying the posts.

65
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.150
The steps we took were pretty simple.

66
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.820
I want to stress that even though all this was simple You shouldn't take this process lightly.

67
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.070
Most developers will try and stuff all their coding in as little files as possible.

68
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.980
While this does speed things up it can make things harder to scale.

69
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.020
You should be very conscious about how you organize your files and what you put in them.

70
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.010
You'll repeatedly see me try and separate our code throughout this course and the next section.

71
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.740
We're going to start working on other templates templates gives you the opportunity to display content

72
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.170
in various styles.

73
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.030
You'll see what that looks like in the next few lectures.
