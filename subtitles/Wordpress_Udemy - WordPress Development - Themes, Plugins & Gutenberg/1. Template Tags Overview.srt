00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,330
I want to get into talking about plugins but before we get to that let's go over Temple attacks again

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,010
in the past two sections.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,950
We've been using template tags to display content.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,280
They're pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,340
You simply call a function and data gets output.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,880
The purpose of a template tag is to make your code cleaner rather than querying the database and processing

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,530
the data.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,460
You can just call a simple function.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,930
This is ideal because it allows you to put logic into its own file.

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,050
You even have the ability to create your own template tags just create a regular pitch function and

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,960
then call it in your templates you can use the function's dot P. HP file to define your custom template

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,540
tags since that file gets loaded before your template does.

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,230
Let's break down template tags even further.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,780
In most cases you'll find that template tags come in one of two versions.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,330
There's the get version and the non get version.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,490
This doesn't apply to every tag but it is common.

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:11,950
The non get version will echo out the value immediately the get version will return the value in the

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,140
past we've used both versions for various reasons.

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,370
Usually you want to use the non get version unless you need to process the data further.

20
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,650
Another thing you should be aware of is that most template tags have parameters to modify the value.

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,280
And this example I'm using the title function if we wanted to apply some div tag to the title then there

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,310
are two ways to go about it.

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,520
We can surround the function with the H CML or we can pass it into the function as parameters.

24
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,480
These two solutions will result in the same thing.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,950
The main difference is whether you'll allow WordPress to handle it.

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,100
There is one advantage to passing in the HCM although WordPress has a feature called filter hooks which

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,980
allow you to modify values template tags contain hooks which can then be used by developers like you

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,980
and me by being provided the HCM.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,220
We can make changes to it if we wish for the most part though most developers tend not to pass in the

30
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,050
parameters and heart Kobe H email instead.

31
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,200
When we start working on plugins you'll understand how you can use these parameters and extend them

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,750
on your own for this section.

33
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,560
We're going to need a template that we can experimental create a new template called experimental dot

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,470
p p.

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,790
You can name this whatever you want since this will be a custom template.

36
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,980
This template will be pretty straightforward.

37
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:42,860
Open the full dash with Dash page template and copy the code from that template into our new one.

38
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,740
We're going to be making big changes to this template.

39
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:54,470
First we're going to remove the loop completely then up in the page title remove the subtitle and change

40
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,730
the main title to experimental code.

41
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,010
Lastly let's update the template.

42
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,210
Name two experimental once you've made those changes.

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,510
I want you to navigate to the WordPress dashboard and create a brand new page you can name this page

44
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,560
whatever you want.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,080
It doesn't matter what does matter is that you select the experimental template in the dropdown and

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,010
save your changes

47
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,300
now that we're finished with that we can begin exploring template tags.
