00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.700
Just recently WordPress introduced a new editor called Gutenberg Gutenberg is a visual editor for creating

2
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.820
posts and content.

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.210
If you were to go to the admin dashboard and create a new post then you should see something like this

4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.200
Gutenberg introduces a more modern and intuitive editing experience like never before.

5
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.120
For the past decade WordPress used tiny MCP as the main editor.

6
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.100
It worked but it was lacking in many areas.

7
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.300
If you've used WordPress before then you are probably familiar with it.

8
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.110
If you don't know what it is then that's perfectly fine.

9
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.750
It's currently being pushed out of WordPress so it isn't required to know regardless if you're a fan

10
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.860
of Gutenberg or not.

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.770
It's part of the core now so it would be beneficial to know how to extend it during the creation of

12
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.550
this course.

13
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.690
I struggled with how to approach Gutenberg development.

14
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.950
It's not just the editing experience that has changed but the development experience has changed as

15
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.880
well.

16
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.980
Certain hooks aren't encouraged as much anymore.

17
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.140
The short code's API and metal boxes are being replaced with something called blocks.

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.790
If you've taken my course before then you may be familiar with these concepts.

19
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.120
If not then that's perfectly fine.

20
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
I do go over some of the stuff later in this course.

21
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.420
The reason I'm mentioning it now is because you may look for more tutorials online and those tutorials

22
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.900
can be outdated because of the introduction of Gutenberg.

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.650
On top of some breaking changes Gutenberg also has a higher learning curve.

24
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.430
Gutenberg is built with react and therefore you should be confident with your javascript skills from

25
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.030
the beginning.

26
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.850
I told you that you should have a solid understanding of HDMI Gemmell CSX and JavaScript.

27
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.820
However we're going to begin diving into more advanced topics so I don't expect you to know these advanced

28
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.480
concepts before you can get into Gutenberg development.

29
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.570
You need to know what arrow functions imports and d structuring are.

30
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.770
That's what I'll be teaching you in this section if you are already comfortable with these topics then

31
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.890
you can skip this section and move onto the next one.

32
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.010
This section will completely step away from WordPress to discuss these important topics before we get

33
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.700
started.

34
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.540
I do want to clarify that there are two ways to approach Gutenberg development.

35
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.820
The first approach is by using iOS 5 or simple javascript.

36
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.040
This is the more simpler approach.

37
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.950
This is how we've been creating our plugins and themes thus far no fancy tools or libraries.

38
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.310
You just write regular javascript and you're good to go.

39
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.720
The problem with this approach is that it makes your code harder to read and manage.

40
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.670
By now you should know that I'm all about organization and management.

41
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.210
While it does require a little more work organizing your code allows for better scaling by using plain

42
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.860
javascript and P HP.

43
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.210
You make Gutenberg development more difficult for yourself.

44
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.150
The second approach is by using react when packed and Babel.

45
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.550
This approach has a higher learning curve but it's well worth it.

46
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.980
You will find it easier to manage and organize your code.

47
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.780
This is the solution we'll be using for the rest of this course.

48
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.620
Once again you're not required to know these things.

49
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.010
I will teach you how to use technologies and how they specifically tie to WordPress.

50
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.400
All right let's get started.

51
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.230
I'll see you in the next lecture.
