1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,630
I want to improve the way the users are displayed and the information presented on the posts in this

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,950
lecture will explore how to create custom author fields and avatars.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,360
Let's start with the custom fields first.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,070
I'm going to edit my admin profile to include a biography.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,630
I'll keep it simple and short.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,140
Let's go to the front end now and view a single post.

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,340
If we take a look at the author box you'll notice that it displays the author bio.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,480
Wouldn't it be nice if it could also include social media information like Twitter or Facebook.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,590
That's totally possible and easy to do with Wordpress.

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,520
The first step is to add the fields on the admin side inside the function's file.

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,740
Add the action hook.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,610
Show user profile the function I want to call is j u custom user profile fields

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,030
this hope will only run if a user is viewing their own profile in the admin dashboard.

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,040
However I want admins to be able to view these fields as well.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,220
So we have to copy this line and change the action hook name to edit user profile which will run if

16
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,390
another user is viewing these fields.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,440
We'll be calling the same function.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,830
WordPress will be able to determine which one to run.

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:31,100
Depending on who is viewing the profile inside the includes folder create a folder named admin and create

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:39,460
a file named author dash fields dot P. HP to find the function inside this file and make sure to include

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,810
it from the function's file

22
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,340
this function will receive a user object that will have information about the current additive user

23
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,870
inside this function.

24
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm going to paste in some H2 UML code.

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,670
This is just some email code to format the input field to match the other fields.

26
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,290
I use the HP email from the page and modified it to suit our needs.

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,790
It's nothing complex.

28
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,280
There are two things that need to be highlighted.

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,840
The name attribute should be unique so that we can use it to save the data later.

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,690
The other thing is the value.

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,430
All I'm doing is grabbing a user medically called J U Twitter which will save later.

32
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,640
This function is new to us but it's a function that uses the metadata API posts aren't the only things

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,890
that can have metadata attached to them.

34
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,520
Users can also have metadata the user meta functions work the same as the post meta functions.

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,900
Now that we are displaying our field it's time to save it inside the functions file.

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,450
I'm going to add a new action hook called personal options update the function I want to call it will

37
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,320
be named J.

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,260
You save extra profile fields just like last time.

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,420
This hook will only run for the user's own profile for other users such as admins in order for them

40
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,310
to modify this value properly.

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,790
We have to use a different hook the other hook is called edit user profile update.

42
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm just going to copy the hook above and rename it back inside the author dash Fields file.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm going to define the function here as well to keep things simple.

44
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,710
This function will be passed in the user I.D. which we'll use later.

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,500
I'm going to check the current user capability and see if they have the capability and it user if this

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,630
returns false.

47
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm going to return the function.

48
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,350
We only want users who have this capability to be able to edit profiles if they pass this check.

49
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,370
I'm going to call the function Update user meta and update the information properly passing the user

50
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,960
I.D. set the key to J You Twitter and pass in the post variable

51
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,650
now that the user meter is being updated properly.

52
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:13,320
We can begin to display it in the author box open the single template for the theme right at the section

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,600
where we grab the author I.D. I'm going to create a new variable named Twitter.

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,780
This variables value will be assigned to the value returned by the get the author Meadow function will

55
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,710
pass in the name of key which is J You Twitter and the author right.

56
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,150
Next let's move on to the author box which is placed under the post and check to see if the variable

57
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,610
isn't empty if it isn't empty.

58
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,950
We'll echo it out with this HCM El

59
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,500
positive video if you need to.

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,410
All right now that we have that all set up let's test the form refresh the page you should now see the

61
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,000
field inputs appear and your Twitter handle and then update the user

62
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,440
next go to a single post that this user has created.

63
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,350
You should now see the Twitter handle appear right inside the author box like I'm seeing.

64
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,440
That's how you would go about adding and saving fields.

65
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,040
All right.

66
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,070
The next thing I want to do is add in a custom avatar for default users by default.

67
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,400
We're using the mystery man avatar.

68
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:47,660
Go to the admin dashboard and navigate to settings discussion at the very bottom you can assign a different

69
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,520
avatar for new users.

70
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,610
However you don't have the ability to add in your own custom ones just like everything else you can

71
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,830
add custom avatars with hooks inside the function's file.

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,670
Add the filter hook called Avatar defaults and the function to call will be named J.

73
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,840
You new avatar

74
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,860
inside the includes folder create a file called Avatar dot p p and defined the function inside here.

75
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,470
Make sure to include it as well.

76
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,500
This function will be passed in an array of default avatars.

77
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,330
You can add in your own avatar to this array or remove already set ones.

78
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,240
I'm going to create a new variable named Avatar you URL which will be a you are well to an image.

79
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,340
I've uploaded online

80
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,780
this is an avatar of wacko.

81
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,750
I'll provide a link to this in the resource section of this lecture.

82
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,400
Next I'm going to add this to the array by setting the key to the URL and the value to a human readable

83
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,210
name.

84
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,380
I'm going to set this to default Udemy avatar.

85
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,870
Lastly I'm going to return the avatar array

86
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,510
just like that.

87
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,940
We have our very own custom avatar added to the list.

88
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,470
Refresh the page and you should see the avatar being loaded.

89
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,370
The admin can now set this avatar as the default avatar for new users.

90
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,340
I'm going to select this avatar and save my changes

91
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,080
if I go back to the single post.

92
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,670
You'll find the avatar being displayed.

93
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,280
That wraps it up for this lecture before I end it.

94
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,030
I want to talk about the HDMI markup we use for the forms rather than using our own markup.

95
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,630
We used WordPress markup however WordPress doesn't provide much documentation for it.

96
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,130
We're left to study the current markup and learn it through trial and error in the resource section

97
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,960
of this lecture.

98
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,780
I provide a link to a plugin called WordPress admin style.

99
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,890
This is a plug them that will show you the markup WordPress uses for reference.

100
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,110
I want you to install and activate this plugin

101
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,800
you'll find a menu item called admin style.

102
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,990
If you click on it you'll find this long page of the various WordPress stylings you can use.

103
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:25,040
This is a great plugin to have in hand when you're developing plugins or themes.
