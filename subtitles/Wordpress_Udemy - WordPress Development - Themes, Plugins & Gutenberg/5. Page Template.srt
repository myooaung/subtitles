1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,200
The single template is finished.

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,180
The header and footer are something we need to work on but we'll get to those later.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,020
Right now I want to focus on creating more templates.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,950
As I stated before the index template is the default template WordPress will load if any other template

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,220
is unavailable.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,960
Let's examine the order of WordPress will use to determine what file to load WordPress will begin by

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,630
looking for a custom template file.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,000
You are free to create custom Temple files with custom names but that's something we'll explore in a

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,090
future lecture.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,870
If it doesn't define a custom template then it'll begin searching for a template called page followed

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,120
by the slug of the page.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,160
You can also use the I.D. but that comes secondary to the slug.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,190
Lastly it'll search for the page singular and index template files in that order for this lecture will

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,170
be creating the page top HP template.

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,940
To understand why we're going to create this template let's view our site.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,600
If I were to view the About Us page you'll notice that we have the same problem as single posts.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,300
It's not exactly displayed how we would like it to be displayed.

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,050
Let's start creating the page template now from the template hierarchy page.

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,010
We have to name this file page dot BHP.

20
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,090
So let's create that file now.

21
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,980
I'm going to copy and paste the single template into the page template.

22
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,400
We're going to strip this down massively.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,360
I'm going to remove the metadata tags remove any links related to other posts and the Post author box

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,850
what you'll end up having is the title content and the comments template.

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,140
Let's see what WordPress recommends for this template.

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm in the theme development Codex page and I'm on the page dot P HP section.

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,490
I'll provide a link to that in the resource section of this lecture.

28
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,530
WordPress recommends we display the title in content.

29
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,060
We're already doing that so let's move onto the next point.

30
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,410
Actually we're already doing most of these but bullet point five.

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,160
Number five recommends we add an edit link but like last time WordPress already provides this in the

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,790
top bar.

33
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,430
So we've covered all bases we'd like to cover.

34
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,340
Let's open the HCM out page template and see if we're missing anything from the original design.

35
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,440
If you take a look you'll notice that there's one huge difference between this template and the page

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,750
we currently have.

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,360
That would be this big strip that contains the title.

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,950
We'll have to make a couple of modifications to achieve this goal switch back to the editor first.

39
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:13,360
I'm going to remove this conditional statement that checks if there are posts.

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,130
The reason I'm removing it is because WordPress already checks if this page is actually available.

41
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,290
If a page does not exist then WordPress will load the forum for template so there's no need to make

42
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,090
this check ourselves.

43
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:35,050
Next I'm going to remove the title from its original position since it'll be called elsewhere then I'm

44
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,530
going to open these static HCM out page template and look for that bar that displays the title it'll

45
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,100
be these section tags surrounded by the page title comments.

46
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,260
I'm going to copy this and place this right after the header page like so

47
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,270
you'll notice right away.

48
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,620
We have a situation.

49
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,350
Our page title GMO is outside of the loop.

50
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,430
There are two solutions for this.

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,680
We can either move the loop to encompass all this or we can repeat the loop in this situation.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,290
I want to reuse the loop rather than move all the HCM out.

53
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,000
So just like last time I'm going to call another loop like this.

54
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,700
Then I'm going to move this section inside the loop and replace the title with the template tag the

55
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,090
title

56
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,180
I'm going to remove the title from down below next.

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,990
We need to reset this loop.

58
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,470
We've experienced multiple loos before but those were two different loops.

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,510
When you reuse the same loop you need to reset the loop just like you would if you're using a different

60
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,150
loop.

61
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:04,820
The function we have to call is called rewind posts in the resource section of this lecture.

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,820
I provide a link to this function.

63
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,600
This is what WordPress says.

64
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,070
Rewind the loop posts in order to reuse the same query in different locations on a page.

65
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,100
This is definitely the function we need.

66
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,710
The very last thing we need to do is add a subtitle.

67
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,070
However there is no subtitle feature available in WordPress.

68
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,110
This leaves us with two options.

69
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,520
We either created ourselves or use a plugin.

70
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,890
We will be going with the second option.

71
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,870
A lot of developers will want to go with creating their own plugin but for something as simple as this

72
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,460
it would be best to just go with a third party solution and the resource section of this lecture.

73
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,110
I provide a link to a plugin called WP subtitle.

74
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,100
This plugin is super fast and simple to use in the description.

75
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,050
You'll notice the developer provides info on how to add this plug into your theme.

76
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,030
It's as simple as one line of code.

77
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,020
I'm gonna go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plugins add new I'm going to search for a plugin

78
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,700
called WP subtitle then I'm going to install and activate it

79
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,420
once activated.

80
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,750
You can now edit the about us page and you will see this newly created field called subtitle add a subtitle

81
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,070
quickly and then save your changes to see the subtitle on the page.

82
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,040
All we have to do is just copy and paste this one line of code onto where we want it to appear.

83
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:43,710
I'm going to paste it into the spam tax refresh the page and you should now see the subtitle up here

84
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,370
before we declare this template finished.

85
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,070
We have to do one more thing.

86
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:55,680
If I deactivate this plugin then BHP will throw an error because the subtitle function is undefined.

87
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,840
I'm going to wrap this function in a conditional statement and use the function function exists and

88
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,360
pass in the function name.

89
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,210
The subtitle

90
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:19,520
this BHP function does add its name suggests if this function exists and we know that the WP subtitle

91
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,450
plugin is activated and this page may have a subtitle will then display it like so.

92
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,060
All right.

93
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,800
So that's one way to go about this but we can make this even more cleaner.

94
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,460
I haven't been completely honest with you.

95
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,260
You don't have to create a loop like this to get the title outside of the post.

96
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,230
There's actually a template tag that does this.

97
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,870
I'm going to copy my HCM CML and paste it right above.

98
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,260
Then I'm going to replace the title function with single post title since we have this function ready

99
00:07:51,410 --> 00:08:03,040
then we can just remove the loop and the function rewind posts like so.

100
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:09,590
This is much cleaner code wise so if this function was available why did I teach you how to recreate

101
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,750
the loop in some situations.

102
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,210
You may need to create two loops.

103
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,880
I just wanted to show you an alternative solution to this problem.

104
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,700
Neither of these solutions are wrong.

105
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,560
It's just what you prefer.

106
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,390
If I refresh the page then you should see both titles up here.

107
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,220
The subtitle also appears because the developer of the plugin has made it so that their template tag

108
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,310
function works in and outside of a loop.

109
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,370
I'm actually going to delete the loop solution and just keep this simpler version.

110
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,360
Like I said before neither is the wrong solution.

111
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,570
It's just what you like best.

112
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,420
That wraps it up for this template.

113
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,690
Let's move on to creating more templates.
