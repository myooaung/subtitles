1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,820
We're going to start things off with Buddy press development.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,200
What I want you to do is install buddy press by the buddy press community.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,020
This is a pretty large plug in so it may take longer than most plugins to install once installed click

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,590
activate

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,640
currently buddy presses on Version 4.

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,780
We'll be going over the latest concepts for Buddy press before we write a single line of code.

7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:41,180
Let's modify some of the settings the bunny press settings can be found by going to settings buddy press.

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,110
I'm going to turn everything on so that we don't miss a thing.

9
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,690
When we installed buddy press it created a couple of pages for us.

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,020
Let's check those out.

11
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:03,340
It will generate the following pages activity members groups you can view any of these pages and you'll

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,750
see that Buddy press will generate the content for each page.

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,490
I'm going to view the members page.

14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm going to click on the admin profile and here you'll see a profile generated for us with different

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,690
sections separated with tabs.

16
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,700
We didn't have to do a thing buddy press is an extremely powerful plug them that will generate this

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,590
UI and functionality for you.

18
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,830
I'm going to go back to the page manager.

19
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:34,060
I'm going to try and view the edit page you'll notice that nothing here is out of the ordinary.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,900
There are no special settings.

21
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,870
It's just a regular page.

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,700
So how does buddy press know that these pages are associated with it.

23
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,940
Well if you were to navigate to settings buddy press pages you'll find the settings where you can tell

24
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,400
Buddy press which pages it should display its content on.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,690
There are a lot more features to Buddy press but we'll see how those work as the course progresses.

26
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:04,050
I'm going to go back to the admin profile you'll notice that there's this gray trip above the profile

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,220
and it has a sidebar.

28
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:11,040
It's really nice the buddy press took the time to try and match the design of the site as much as possible

29
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,770
but we could improve upon it.

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,300
What I want to do is make this page for with an update some of the sea assess to match our own site.

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,040
So where do we even begin.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,970
Well keep in mind that Buddy press uses the same system we use something that Buddy press does is leverage

33
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,640
the templating hierarchy system in the resource section of this lecture I provide a link to the buddy

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,100
press template hierarchy page.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,720
This page shows you how buddy press loads a certain page that it generates just like WordPress it'll

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,710
look for a certain file names and your theme and then goes down a list until it finds a file.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,430
If it doesn't find anything then it'll just use the index top page template.

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,610
The rest of this documentation details all the various pages and their templates you can set we'll go

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,440
over how to generate these templates in a bit.

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,130
For now I want to generate the base template the base template is the template that encompasses all

41
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,750
other template buddy press is a plug in and it doesn't want to generate a whole lot of templates.

42
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,380
It would rather depend on one template and generate sections for that template the base template can

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,240
be named any of these names right here on the page.

44
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:28,080
I'm going to create the buddy press stop HP template inside the themes folder then I'm going to open

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,930
the full width page template and copy everything from here into the new template.

46
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,320
We are going to strip this template down to the bare minimum.

47
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm going to get rid of the title header we see at the top of every page

48
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,000
then I'm going to remove everything inside the loop except for the post function

49
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,690
next I'm going to call the function the content.

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,390
Lastly I'm just going to remove some space and format this neatly

51
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,730
as you can see our template is extremely basic.

52
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,410
The reason for this is because Buddy press will take care of generating the contents of the page and

53
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,430
its format.

54
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,770
Don't worry we can override them later.

55
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,810
This is just to get us started.

56
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,690
Let's see if everything is working.

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,940
I want you to reload the member profile page.

58
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,920
You'll now notice a lot of what we saw previously is gone except for the content up buddy press generated.

59
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,910
This is exactly what we wanted.

60
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,010
There are some CSF changes we'd like to make and of course update some of the HD email here and there.

61
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,890
Which is totally doable.

62
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,540
What I really want to change is how the user profile looks.

63
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,550
I really like how the rest of these pages are formatted.

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,360
It's centered and their space which mean the menu and the content for the profile.

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,500
I want to make this cover image stretch all the way from left to right.

66
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,190
I also want to remove the space between the menu and content.

67
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,660
Let's read the buddy press template hierarchy page for a minute.

68
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,360
If you scroll down a little bit you'll find a section called Single Member pages.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,340
Here is what Buddy press says.

70
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,770
If you are on a single member page buddy press will use the following template hierarchy.

71
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,640
Then it proceeds us to tell us more about what files will be loaded.

72
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,860
Unlike the WordPress hierarchy template system you'll notice that Buddy press will look for the files

73
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,890
within a certain folder structure.

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,330
This is very important to highlight as Buddy press requires dozens and dozens of templates and template

75
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,100
parts.

76
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,720
So the team decided it would be wise to use a folder structure so that the root theme folder doesn't

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,850
become cluttered with various files.

78
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,620
We will be using number 5 from this list.

79
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,460
I want you to create the folders buddy press slash members slash single inside your themes folder

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,710
then I want you to create a file named index stop BHP.

81
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,840
This is the file that Buddy press will look for when creating the single member profile page.

82
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,440
Next I'm going to copy the contents of the buddy press based template into this new template.

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,290
Since I don't want spacing and I want the cover image to be stretched I'm going to remove all these

84
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,070
tanks.

85
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,490
I'm going to take the time to format this a bit so that it looks cleaner

86
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,590
what you should have is the header a basic loop and the footer.

87
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,760
It should all be page code.

88
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,250
I know this looks very basic but I want you to bear with me on this.

89
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,600
The tags we removed are what causes the content to be centered and spaced.

90
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,470
Even though I want that spacing to be applying to the rest of the content it's kind of necessary to

91
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,950
remove it since the cover image was inside those tanks.

92
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,830
We could do some C Ss hacks to make it appear stretched but I think a better solution would be to apply

93
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,370
the centering and spacing to the tags inside rather than outside.

94
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,610
Let's test this out really quick refresh the single member page and you'll notice right away that the

95
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,200
spacing is removed and all the content is stretched.

96
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,100
This is almost what we wanted.

97
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,210
The only thing to do now is central the content itself.

98
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,920
We'll get to that in a moment.

99
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,480
I want to make sure the rest of the pages weren't affected.

100
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,810
I want you to view any other buddy press generated page like the activity page.

101
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,990
This page should still be centered and spaced.

102
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,690
After confirming that only the single member page is updated let's move on to the next task in the next

103
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,150
lecture will tackle cleaning up this template.
