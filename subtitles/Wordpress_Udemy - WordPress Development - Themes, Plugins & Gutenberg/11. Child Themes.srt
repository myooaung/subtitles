1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,490
Let's get started with child themes.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,500
If you heard of child themes but don't know what or how a child theme works then this lecture is important

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,340
for you.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,500
A lot of developers avoid child things because WordPress doesn't really make it clear how to develop

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,120
or use child themes.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,030
I don't want you to be one of those developers.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,270
A child theme is extremely powerful and useful.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,010
What makes it so useful is that you can modify an existing theme without having to worry about your

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,940
code becoming irrelevant or overwritten back in the old days.

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,420
If he wanted to modify a theme then you'd have to directly edit the files.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,020
Then when an update was available you'd have to start all over again and keep track of all the edited

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,370
files and changes.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,070
It was very annoying and time consuming when child themes were introduced.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,480
The whole process became so much easier because your code was never overwritten and the theme was also

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,040
not modified.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,190
Now that you understand what child themes are let's get started with creating one go to WordPress dot

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,500
org and go to the themes pages.

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,210
We're going to download a theme called M H magazine lite.

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,890
Then we're going to add this theme to our WordPress site by opening the themes folder and then dragging

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,950
the contents of the zip file into this folder like so

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,740
next.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,020
I'm going to copy this folder and I'm going to paste it in again.

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm going to reading this folder and use the same name except I'm going to append dash child so I know

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,470
that this is a child thing

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,670
WordPress doesn't require you to name a child theme anyway.

26
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,990
This is just how I prefer to do it and how I recommend you do it open the child theme and select every

27
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,630
folder and files except the functions style and screenshot files delete these files

28
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,020
I'm now going to open my editor and look for the trial theme.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,180
Open the functions file and delete all this code.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,750
I'm just going to leave an open page p tag for later.

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,570
We're going to do the same to the style dot CFS file except you should not delete the headers that come

32
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:25,930
with it.

33
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,560
From here we're going to make two changes.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,060
The first change is the name of this theme.

35
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,390
I'm going to add a child theme to the name

36
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,950
once again.

37
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,040
This is not required but it makes it easier to tell which theme is the parent theme and which is the

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,130
child theme.

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,270
Next we have to define a new property called template the value of this property will be the name of

40
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,270
the parent themes folder name.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,270
In our case it would be MH dash magazine dash like

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,090
this value is case sensitive.

43
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,560
Be sure to set this value correctly.

44
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,370
After that you're all done.

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,360
Let's go to the WordPress dashboard and navigate to appearance.

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,660
We now have two MH magazine light themes activate the child themed version and then try visiting your

47
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:27,040
site.

48
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,190
We don't get any errors not even in the console.

49
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,740
But the site isn't displaying correctly.

50
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,740
Why is that.

51
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,270
Well it's pretty simple.

52
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:41,180
Wordpress is loading these style dot CSO file because that's what the parent theme does.

53
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,150
WordPress will load the functions file from the parent theme and load the child themes function file.

54
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,340
Let's take a look at the parents function file

55
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,270
if you scroll down a bit the parent theme and accuse a file with the function get style sheet.

56
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,400
You are right.

57
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,780
This function will return the you are right to the current theme style dot c SS file even if we're using

58
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,820
the child theme.

59
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:15,200
This would be the child style dot CFS file and not the parents style that CFS file the parent style

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,110
dot CSA as contains all the main styles for the theme.

61
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,630
The question is how do we load both the parents styles and the child styles.

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,260
There are a couple solutions here but the developer friendly one is by using action hooks lets open

63
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:37,670
the child things function file and add the action hook WP and Q scripts.

64
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,990
I'm going to be using an anonymous function since we won't be doing much with this child thing.

65
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:49,700
I'm going to register the parent style to get the parent style that CSX we first have to use a function

66
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,400
called Get template direct REU or I

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,600
this function will get better rectory of the parent theme without the forward slash.

68
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,720
Since we're in the parent theme directory we can append the style dot CSX file name

69
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,080
next.

70
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,620
I'm going to register the child theme style dot CSX file by using the function get style sheet you are

71
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:28,890
right which will return the URL of the current theme style dot CSX file.

72
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,980
Lastly I'm going to include both files.

73
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,550
Refresh your site and you should now see that it's working properly.

74
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,700
Just to make sure I'm going to open the child's style dot CSX file and change the background color of

75
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,990
the body to yellow

76
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,230
refresh the page.

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,850
That's absolutely hideous but at least we know our styles are loading correctly.

78
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,060
If your changes aren't being loaded you can press control f 5 on Your keyboard to force a refresh with

79
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,280
a clear cache for this page.

80
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,220
That's pretty much it for child themes.

81
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,740
From here you can add anything you like.

82
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,440
If you were to create a file named for for dot P HP inside the child theme.

83
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,550
Then the child themes for all for template will load instead of the parent themes version.

84
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,170
It's that simple actually.

85
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,930
Let's try that really quick.

86
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,250
In the address bar of your browser type in some random characters and you'll see the parent themes for

87
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:41,510
all four template being loaded let's create our version by creating a forum for dot P HP file inside

88
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,540
the child theme and just add the text for all four

89
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,930
let's refresh this page and you will now see the child theme template being loaded instead of the parent's

90
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,950
version.

91
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,830
Wordpress is smart enough to know which template to use your child themes templates will be loaded over

92
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,510
the parent themes templates you're now free to overwrite anything from the parent theme.
