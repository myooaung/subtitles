00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,700
The home page features a list of posts submitted.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,100
However I want to expand on this.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,960
I also want to display recipe posts as well.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,810
There are two solutions to accomplish this.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,280
The first solution would be to create our own query ignoring the main query.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,610
However that's a lot of work to do and we don't want to completely ignore the main query as other plugins

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,570
may want to modify how it works.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,680
Luckily we can modify the main query to suit our needs.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,520
This is the best solution and it's easy inside the function's file at an action hook called pre get

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,450
posts.

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,110
The function I want to call will be named J You modify a home page.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:55,220
Query inside the includes folder create a file named home dash query dot P HP and define the function

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,650
inside this file.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,340
Lastly include this file

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,000
this hook will be called when the main query is created but it will not be executed at this point since

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,510
it's not being executed.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,800
We have the opportunity to modify it as we please.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,160
This function will be passed in an object called query.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,530
Whenever we work with the WP query class we always created a new instance.

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,350
However at this point we already have an instance to modify a query after it's created.

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,110
We have to use a method called set but we'll get to that in just a moment.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,010
Something that you need to keep in mind is that this hook will always give you the main query for every

23
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,490
page not just the home page.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,520
Since this is the case we have to use a conditional statement to check for two things.

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,270
We have to check if this query is for the home page using the is home method

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:02:01,310
then we need to use the is main query method to check if this is the main query if both return true.

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,370
Then we'll modify query.

28
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm now going to call the set method and set the post type parameter to an array that contains the name

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,700
of the post types.

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,200
I'd like to retrieve I want to get the post and recipe post types

31
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,020
in the resource section of this lecture.

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,360
I provide a link to the WP query classic and you'll find more information about these methods and properties

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,780
that I'm using.

34
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,250
All right now that we've modified the main query let's check out the home page.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,560
If you refresh the page you should have both recipes and posts appearing.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,830
That's all there is to it.

37
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,340
Before I am this lecture I want to talk about a function called query posts which you can find in the

38
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,750
resource section of this lecture.

39
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,870
There is a function that you can use to modify the main query but I highly recommend you don't use it

40
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,130
if you take a look.

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,760
You'll find this note from WordPress that says.

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,800
Note This function will completely override the main query and isn't intended for use by plugins or

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,760
themes.

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,040
It's overly simplistic approach to modifying the main query can be problematic and should be avoided

45
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,370
wherever possible.

46
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:14,360
In most cases there are better more performance options for modifying the main query such as via the

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,050
pre get posts action within WP query.

48
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,950
This must not be used within the WordPress loop.

49
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,360
Try your best not to use this function.

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,220
There are a lot of things and plugins out there that use this but it's just bad practice to do so.
