00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,510
Ezio is a beast of its own as a developer.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,520
You should take every step to make sure your theme is SC already and is compatible with most SEO plugins.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,280
There are dozens of them out there throughout this course.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,780
We've prepared the theme to be SC already but we can definitely take it a step further.

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,880
Right now I'm on a site called scheme dot org.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,410
I'll provide a link in the resource section of this lecture schema is a way to tell bots and crawlers

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,590
more about the content on your site.

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:41,690
Currently if a crawler like Google's crawler were to read through our HD PML it would have to guess

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,940
what kind of content is being read.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,870
Google's algorithm is smart enough to be able to sort through all the H2 UML and make good guesses.

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,540
However we can help.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,040
This is where micro data comes into play.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,820
You can add attributes to certain tags to let the crawlers and bots know what they're looking at and

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,200
decide how important the content is.

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,160
Most SEO plugins will assist you by adding some micro data for you but there are just some sections

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,320
that can't reach.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,710
So it's our job to cover those missing spots.

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,650
This site will provide you everything you need to know about micro data.

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,700
If you go through the documentation you'll find a link for getting started.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,070
We won't be going over every little thing.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,920
I'll just cover the main points.

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,110
It isn't that hard.

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,930
Micro data is just a fancy word for a few set of specific HDMI attributes that specify what kind of

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,720
content a bot or crawler is viewing.

25
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,080
The first attribute you use is called the item scope.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,750
Just by including this attribute you're specifying that the HCM element contains information about something

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,050
the next property is the item type where the value of this attribute is a you are well to where more

28
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,720
information about this element can be found.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,340
The U.R.L. must point to schema dot org and to the appropriate page.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,010
We'll talk more about these your roles and how you would go about setting them the last property is

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,900
item prop which is an attribute you set to specify how the element is related to the item type.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,800
It gives you the ability to fully describe the content these three attributes are the attributes you'll

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,570
use the most.

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,160
When adding micro data to your templates it may seem kind of confusing at first but you'll get the hang

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,620
of it once you start adding them.

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,140
Let's start using them on the schema site.

37
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,550
I want you to click on the schemas link.

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,200
You'll be taken to a page where you can view certain types or view the full list.

39
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,350
I'm going to view the full list on this page you'll see the full hierarchy of types.

40
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,590
You can select when you get started with micro data.

41
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,000
The very first thing you want to do is think about what type you want to set.

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,840
In general your Web site is a type of data that sounds weird but just go with me on this.

43
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,300
If you look around you'll find a type called Web page.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,350
Click on this.

45
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,780
Here is what schema has to say about this type.

46
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,220
Every Web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type.

47
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,090
Web page.

48
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,840
So the various properties about that web page such as breadcrumb may be used.

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,260
We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified but if they are found outside of

50
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,120
an item scope they will be assumed to be about the page.

51
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,990
We really don't have to set this type but I believe it's a good example when it comes to getting started

52
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,860
with micro data.

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:35,840
I want you to open the header file from our theme search for the opening body tag and applying the item

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,000
scope attribute.

55
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,440
This is the first step by applying this attribute.

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,530
You're telling the crawler that this element contains information the crawler should be aware of the

57
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,150
next attribute you need to set is the item type attribute the value of this attribute is the you are

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,550
well to that type.

59
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,140
This is an important step.

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,690
As I stated previously it must be a you or rail to where more information can be found about that time

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,710
that you are well is the full you are rail H GDP colon slash slash schema dot org followed by the type.

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:15,920
You can also just copy and paste the euro RL you find here it's important to understand that only you

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,980
are real to the schema dawg site are allowed all other sites will just be ignored.

64
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,500
The bot will see this and then look at the euro well for reference by looking at this page it'll understand

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,270
what kind of properties you can set and what you can expect to look for when it's scanning all the children

66
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,170
elements.

67
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,920
That's the basics of it.

68
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,870
There is one more attribute but I want to use that in another example.

69
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,420
It's perfectly fine to specify a type and no properties.

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,560
I'll expand more on this later but let's move on to the next example open the single template and search

71
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,770
for the author box this element contains information about the author.

72
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,270
It would be ideal to apply some micro data to it just like the last element.

73
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,790
We need to decide on the type.

74
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,670
If you look through the list you'll eventually find an item called person.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,540
Let's use this inside the template and the item scope and item type attributes.

76
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:20,960
Copy and paste the euro as the value for the type.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,640
This time I want to specify more information.

78
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,730
If you look through this documentation you'll find all the properties we can set for this type.

79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,690
One of these is name.

80
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,940
Every person has a name and our author box displays the author's name to apply a property you have to

81
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:46,090
use the item prop attribute apply this attribute to the span tag which encompasses the name then set

82
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,860
its value to name.

83
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,930
We're only going to apply this property you are more than free to apply more properties.

84
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,180
You'll also notice that we have a type on the body tag and it type for this element which is inside

85
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,310
the body tag.

86
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,760
This is perfectly allowed.

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,880
Types can have types inside them to reiterate what's going on when search engines scan this page they

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,270
will eventually come upon this element Upon scanning it.

89
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,730
It will find the attribute item scope telling it that the developer is specifying what kind of information

90
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,270
is inside this element.

91
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,820
It will then look for a type which in this case is person.

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,100
It will then search through the properties for this type.

93
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,100
This is how you would go about using micro data.

94
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:33,470
So far we've used only the web page and person types but there are dozens of them on this page.

95
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,750
Some are even children of certain ones.

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,890
For example the type thing is the parent of all these types including web page and person.

97
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,410
If we look at the Web page type you can see we can get even more specific with the type by seeing the

98
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,790
page is an about page or contact page type.

99
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,730
The more specific you are the better I'm going to give some closing thoughts.

100
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,000
Adding micro data is absolutely not required.

101
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,990
You'll find that a lot of sites don't use micro data.

102
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
It's more or less a way to help search engines better understand a page.

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,110
If you forget to add micro data to a comment or to an article then that's fine.

104
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,080
Search engines will still scan the elements and try to understand the content on its own.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,550
These attributes are just a way to help it better understand your content without having to guess.

106
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,950
If you're having trouble using micro data I highly recommend you work with an NCO specialist and work

107
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,890
together to maximize the CEO of your theme.

108
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,240
To test your snippets you can go to the structured data testing tool from Google.

109
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,750
I'll provide a link to this in the resource section of this lecture.

110
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,230
You just paste in a you are real or just paste in a small snippet of code and Google will tell you how

111
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,590
it reads that data.

112
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,050
Since we're on a local server we really can't test it.

113
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,030
That basically sums up micro data and how to use them.

114
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,760
I highly encourage that you read the documentation to learn more about what you can do with micro data.
