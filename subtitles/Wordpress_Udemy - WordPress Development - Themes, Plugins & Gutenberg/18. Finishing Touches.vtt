00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.700
Our theme is not complete yet we're nowhere close to that.

2
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.660
But I want to make some simple adjustments before we move on to plugins.

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.630
I would like to create a plugin that will allow users submission user account log and slash registration

4
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.910
and a bunch of other features.

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.290
But let's add some finishing touches to this theme.

6
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.230
What I want to show you are just things we overlook when we were creating the theme.

7
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.350
But these topics don't need a lecture of their own so we'll be jumping around a little bit.

8
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.350
The first thing I want to do is replace these two attributes in the HCM l tag.

9
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.600
I'm going to call a function called language attributes which will generate the female attributes we

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.950
had previously this course assumes you know HDL.

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.130
But I'll explain what these two attributes to the first attribute created is called desire which is

12
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.840
short for direction.

13
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.150
This attribute will tell the browser whether or not the language used on the site is left to right or

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.380
right to left.

15
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.840
Most of the time WordPress will not generate this attribute because most browsers by default assume

16
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.890
left to right the next attribute is called Lang which is short for language.

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.030
This attribute will specify what language the page is currently using.

18
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.570
This is beneficial because scripts and styles can display the content differently depending on the language

19
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.360
and the resources section.

20
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780
I provide a link to more information about this attribute.

21
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.580
If you scroll down to these styling pages section you'll see how this attribute is used using CSX.

22
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.150
You can check what language the page is using and update the CSX accordingly.

23
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.100
In this example the default font family is palettes Hino Linotype but if the language was Arabic and

24
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.550
the font family would change to traditional Arabic WordPress will handle generating these attributes

25
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.180
for you without a problem.

26
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.260
The next thing we want to do is create a meta tag with the cares set attributes set to the W returned

27
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.510
by the function blog info in the resources section.

28
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.720
I provide a link to this function.

29
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.820
This function will return any value you specify inside the function.

30
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.590
This function will return information about the current wordpress installation such as the version or

31
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.180
language.

32
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.680
If you scroll down you'll notice one of these is care set which is short for character set.

33
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.380
This is very important as it'll determine how a lot of your characters are displayed.

34
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.490
If you let the browser handle it then some characters will be output differently than you'd like.

35
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.920
By setting the character set you instruct the browser to display it the same way every time.

36
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.980
That's it for the header.

37
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.100
I'm going to close this and open these single template and make a change inside the loop.

38
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.270
Every post is assigned an I.D. and classes I'm going to modify the root div tag inside the loop.

39
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.270
This tag encompasses everything about this post.

40
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.400
Create an I.D. attribute that begins with post Dash.

41
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.850
Then I'm going to open up some p p tags and I'll put the I.D. This function will output the idea of

42
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.800
the current post by doing this.

43
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.510
The Post will always have a unique idea.

44
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:20.460
I'm going to call a function called Post class this function will output various classes for this post

45
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.210
that plugins or your theme can use to stylized this post.

46
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.730
I already have a few classes being outputting so I'm going to put these inside this function like so

47
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.630
now these classes will be added onto the list of classes.

48
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.990
That's about it for now.

49
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.440
There are still a few things we can do but we can take care of that later.

50
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.150
Let's finish talking about theme development and then move on to plugins.
