00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.710
So far we've talked about adding settings to the customized.

2
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.660
But what if we wanted to make some changes to the default customize her.

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.920
That's completely possible and allowed if you believe you know a better way to customize or should be

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.400
displayed for your theme then you're completely allowed to do that.

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.250
Let's explore some ways to customize this.

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.450
The first thing I want to do is group my sections into something called panels.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.760
Panels are a way to group sections.

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.660
If the theme customize or had a hierarchy it would be panels sections controllers creating a panel is

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.760
pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.850
Inside the main customize your file.

11
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.100
I'm going to call the add panel method.

12
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.730
I'm calling this method inside this function instead of a separate file because it encompasses everything.

13
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.350
However you're free to organize this however you like.

14
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.820
This method has two parameters which is the idea and an array of settings.

15
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.210
I'm going to set the ideas to you to meet the array will have three keys.

16
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.880
The first key is the title which should be human readable.

17
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.530
I'm going to set this to you to me and make it translatable the next key is description which will be

18
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.150
you to me theme settings.

19
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.790
It's important that you add some p tags as it'll formatted properly the last key is priority which will

20
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.190
determine the location.

21
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.080
The higher the number the lower placement it gets.

22
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.220
I'm going to set this to 160.

23
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.840
This will add a panel to the customize.

24
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.830
Now we can add the sections to this panel to add a section to a panel.

25
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.110
You have to specify it inside the add section method open both customize your files for the social and

26
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.520
miscellaneous settings.

27
00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.650
Look for the ADD section method calls and add a new key called panel and pass it in the panel.

28
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.630
As we said earlier

29
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.480
refresh the page and you should now see the panel Udemy.

30
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.010
And if you click on it you'll find both sections appearing under it.

31
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.560
Which is what we wanted.

32
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.960
Now let's talk about customizing existing controllers and sections.

33
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.630
There is this section called Site identity.

34
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.360
Let's say I wanted to change the title to general to do that you need to grab the section or controller

35
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.510
and modify its settings before we can do that.

36
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.940
We have to know the ideas of what we want to grab inside the main customized file.

37
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.600
I'm going to var dump everything and format it with pre-tax

38
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.830
refresh the page and you should see this huge object output it.

39
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.000
You'll find a lot of information related to the customised including all the sections controllers and

40
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.880
panels.

41
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.920
I'm going to skip to these sections array here.

42
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.690
You'll find all the sections defined so far as you can see.

43
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.350
You'll find all the keys similar to the ones you can set when using the add section method.

44
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.200
I'm going to look for the section with the title site identity after finding it.

45
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.210
I now see the idea is title tag line back inside the customized file.

46
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.500
I'm going to call the get section method

47
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.410
this method will grab a section and all its settings.

48
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.550
You have to pass in the I.D. which would be titled tag line as we saw earlier from here I can then modify

49
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.100
any property I want.

50
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.150
Previously when using the ad section method we use an array for the settings.

51
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.360
However after a section is added the settings will be converted into an object with properties and methods.

52
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.060
Because of that we have to change the settings as if they were properties despite the conversion.

53
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.870
The names are usually the same in this case.

54
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:05.430
We can set the title to general like so this is how you would modify any section panel or controller

55
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.690
for controllers.

56
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.930
You use the get control method for panels it's get panel for settings it's get setting.

57
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.020
If you're unsure about a name or an I.D. or a particular value it's always good practice to dump the

58
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.570
Customize object like we did here.

59
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.600
I'm going to comment out this bit of code all right.

60
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.900
The last thing I want to do is customize the user experience whenever we update a setting.

61
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.820
You'll notice the page refreshes which is pretty decent but the loading time is something that's not

62
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.830
really desired.

63
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.250
In this case we will want to make some settings not refresh the page.

64
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.990
Rather we can use javascript to update the settings to accomplish this.

65
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.710
We'll have to make some minor tweaks to the settings we defined earlier.

66
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.480
Open the MSE function and search for the card and search button settings.

67
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:04.900
I'm going to define a new key called transport and set it to post message.

68
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.670
There are two possible values for this key by default.

69
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.290
It's refresh which will instruct WordPress to refresh the page whenever this value is updated by setting

70
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.640
it to post message.

71
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.130
You're telling WordPress that you will use custom javascript code to reflect the changes on the page.

72
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.990
Open the file assets slash J.S. slash theme dash customize dot J.S. file I created this file for you

73
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.240
already and all it is is an empty J query initialize or function.

74
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.350
We'll be updating this very soon.

75
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.110
I only want to load this file if the Customize R is loaded otherwise it would just be a wasted download

76
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.400
to do that we have to add a new action inside the function's file called customised preview in it.

77
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.230
The function to call is J.

78
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.260
You customize preview in it.

79
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.340
I'm going to create a file inside the customized or folder called and queue and define the function

80
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.260
here.

81
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.910
Lastly I'm going to include this hook will only run if the Customize is loaded.

82
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.130
Its purpose is for loading style sheets and scripts only.

83
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.170
I'm going to call the WP NQ script.

84
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.590
Function

85
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:31.710
the I.D. will be Jay you theme customize your pass in the url like we did previously

86
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:44.400
the value for the dependencies is very important here we require two things which is J query and the

87
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.280
customized dash preview the customized preview file has some helper functions and methods for working

88
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.250
with the customize.

89
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.610
You'll see what those are.

90
00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.170
In just a moment the version will be false and I want to load this in the footer.

91
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.540
Just like that our file should now be loaded.

92
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.920
Let's go back to the J S file to make the finishing changes.

93
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.480
Since the customized JavaScript file is being loaded we're provided with an object called WP which contains

94
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.390
all the methods and properties related to WordPress.

95
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.850
One of these methods is called customize which allows you to get the value of a particular setting.

96
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.360
In this case it would be j you header show search.

97
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.790
The second parameter for this method is a callback function for using the value the callback function

98
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.610
is provided the current value.

99
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.390
I'm going to bind this value so that we can keep an eye out for any changes.

100
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.520
This method takes in another callback function that's passed in the new value.

101
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:54.110
We will refer to it as new Val since this is a checkbox.

102
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.310
We can simply check to see if there's any value set.

103
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.090
If there is then we want to show the search button otherwise hide it.

104
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.710
The idea of the search button is top dash search.

105
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:17.730
We can use the show and hide J query methods respectively.

106
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.170
I'm going to do the same for the card button.

107
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.650
It's the same bit of code we're just replacing the ideas

108
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.940
let's refresh the customized one more time.

109
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.400
One thing I should note is that sometimes your code may not be loaded as some browsers will cache files

110
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:41.010
so be sure to clear your cache if that's the case test out the code and you shouldn't see the buttons

111
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.990
disappearing depending on if the boxes are checked.

112
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.670
You should not have any page refresh.

113
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.360
All this is being done with javascript code which makes for a smoother user experience.
