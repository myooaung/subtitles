1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,170
And this lecture we're going to continue working with the WordPress customized API.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,830
There are five fields we'll be creating that we'll do the following.

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,400
The first two fields is for these two button icons on the menu.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,920
We'll let the user decide if they want these buttons to be available.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,540
The next option is the text for this copyright message on the footer.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,240
The last two options will allow users to select the pages for the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,230
links.

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,570
Before we get started with the customize our I'm going to make the search form in the header functional.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,510
I'm going to open the header and search form templates look for the search form inside the header template.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,080
You'll notice right away these forms are completely different in appearance and markup so I won't be

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,630
using the function for grabbing this template.

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,520
Instead I'm just going to copy and paste some of the PDP parts into this template.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,730
There are only three things we really need to make dynamic that would be the action for the form the

14
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,440
value for the input.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:17,430
And lastly make this text translatable.

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,890
All right let's get started with the customized.

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm going to make a file inside the customized folder and name it in my SC dot PDP which is short for

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,550
miscellaneous to find a function named J U m my SC customize your section.

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:41,830
This function will accept the WP customize object from the functions file.

20
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,430
I'm going to include this file

21
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:59,290
the very last step is to call this function from the main customize your function.

22
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,080
I know that was a lot to do but trust me you should always do this as it'll help you keep things organized.

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,940
I've been in that situation where I would stuff my code in the least amount of files possible and it

24
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,100
was always a pain to maintain.

25
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,310
Just like last time we'll be using the three step process to create these new settings.

26
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,960
The first step is to create the database values using the add setting method.

27
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:33,810
The idea for the first setting will be j you header show search and the default value will be yes.

28
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:40,920
I'm going to copy and paste this for more times and update the names for each of these.

29
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,470
Feel free to pause the video so that you can have what I have.

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:51,700
I have the j you headers show cartoon setting where the default value is also yes the j u footer copyright

31
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,660
text will have its default value to the original copyright text the j u footer TRW page and J You put

32
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,390
her privacy page will both be set to zero.

33
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,130
These will be assigned to pages later on.

34
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,250
That right there is step one.

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,890
We have all our database settings ready.

36
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,780
The next step is to create a section or hold all our controllers call the ad section method and give

37
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,940
it the I.D. of J U M ISC section

38
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,890
the title will be Udemy M ie SC settings with a priority of 30

39
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,250
the last step is to create the controllers for each study.

40
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:44,030
The first controller will be a standard HMO input field so we'll be using the WP customize control class

41
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,270
to help us out as usual.

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,380
I'm going to pass in the normal stuff.

43
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,420
There are a couple of things I should highlight.

44
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,140
The I.D. will be Jay you headers show search input.

45
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,750
I will make sure this is assigned to the miscellaneous section and make its settings correspond to the

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,820
correct settings value we created earlier instead of a text input field.

47
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,700
I want to create a checkbox.

48
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:16,540
I will set the type to checkbox the values we use for the checkbox can be set by adding the key choices.

49
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,550
This keys value will be an array of possible values available.

50
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:28,430
We only have one value and that is yes the name of the key is the actual value that will be compared

51
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,640
to check if the setting matches the checkbox.

52
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,790
The value of the item is human readable text next to the checkbox so the user knows what the checkbox

53
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,840
is for.

54
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,640
Let's refresh the Customize are and we should now see our section and the checkbox being displayed.

55
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,620
As you can see the checkbox is already checked because the default value for this setting is yes.

56
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,910
I want you to do the same for the card button while you're at it try creating the copyright text controller.

57
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,660
It's just a text field nothing complex.

58
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,270
Positive video and try it out.

59
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,210
If you didn't get it that's fine.

60
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,520
It's really simple.

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,980
I'm going to copy and paste the previous controller twice and change a few things.

62
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,850
I want you to update the I.D.

63
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,120
then I want you to change the label and these settings key for the card button.

64
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,480
For the copyright text I'm going to remove the choices and type he's by default.

65
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,710
The type will always be text like last time.

66
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,550
You'll only need to change the IP label and these settings key

67
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,120
that should do it for the two buttons and copyright text.

68
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,130
The only fields we have to create are the fields for the pages.

69
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:56,100
I'm going to paste this one more time and remove the choices key and update the I.D. label and settings

70
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,090
keys appropriately

71
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,810
this time I'm going to change the type to dropdown dash pages.

72
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,190
This is a special type.

73
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,640
We can set WordPress or generate a drop down menu and set the options to all the pages that are published.

74
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,940
The value of each option will be the page idea which we can use later.

75
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:29,500
This is exactly what we want since the terms of service and privacy policy will be separate pages.

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,790
If you don't have a page in mind then you should set these settings value to zero.

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,000
So WordPress won't set a page by accident.

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,740
This controller is for the terms of service.

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,520
I'm going to copy this and set the I.T. settings and label for the privacy policy now

80
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,860
just like that we should have five controllers in the miscellaneous section refresh the customized.

81
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,890
And you should see something similar to what I have because this is a testing environment.

82
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,400
I'm going to set a two page dropdown controller to some random pages.

83
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,310
I'm also going to update the copyright text to something simple.

84
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,160
Make sure to save the changes.

85
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,170
The last thing we need to do is make these changes reflect on the theme.

86
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,650
Open the header template and look for these search and cart buttons.

87
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,690
I'm going to surround these in conditional statements like So

88
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,100
the condition will check if the values for both these models are set to Yes.

89
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,920
Make sure to update the values in both these functions so the appropriate setting test the Customize

90
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,770
your really quick and see if everything works correctly.

91
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,770
The buttons should appear and disappear depending on if the box is checked or not.

92
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,910
I'm going to close the header template and open the footer template.

93
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,380
Let's get to work for the copyright text.

94
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm just going to echo out the setting

95
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,870
next.

96
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,680
I'm going to wrap the links in conditional statements and check off the settings have a value.

97
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,660
Keep in mind by default these settings values are zero.

98
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,940
This is also equivalent to false.

99
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,120
So we don't need to perform any checks besides what's returned

100
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,480
replace the links and use the perma link.

101
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,930
Function

102
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,370
template tags can we use outside the loop.

103
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:05,490
However there is one condition You must pass in the idea of the post or page you like to retrieve information

104
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,370
from most template tags.

105
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,740
Have this as their first parameter.

106
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:18,360
Let's do that now call the get name mod and get the appropriate setting for each link if you don't pass

107
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,970
in an I.D. and you're using this function outside of the loop then you'll receive an error.

108
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,670
Let's check out the site now.

109
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,990
Save any changes you made an exit out of a customized to make sure the links in the footer work.

110
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,650
After confirming so then you're all done.

111
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's take a moment to explore our theme.

112
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,550
When we first started we had a bunch of links and styles and the content was broken.

113
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,730
Now we have a fully functioning theme.
