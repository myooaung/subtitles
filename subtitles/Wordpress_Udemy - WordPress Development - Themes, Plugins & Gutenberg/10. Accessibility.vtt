00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.140
One of the best things you could do is make your site accessible to people with disabilities.

2
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.140
Accessibility is a pretty huge topic and there are a lot of steps you need to take to cover every area.

3
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.140
This lecture will be an overview of what you can do to make your theme and plug and accessible to people

4
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.740
with disabilities.

5
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.860
Before we make any changes it's important to understand the various kinds of disabilities you may come

6
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.790
across.

7
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:38.120
Usually they can be categorized into four different topics visual such as blindness or color blindness

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.580
hearing such as deafness or being hard of hearing motor such as a lack of fine motor skills or difficulty

9
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.620
in using a mouse or mouse pad.

10
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.770
Cognitive such as learning difficulties attention deficit disorders or dyslexia.

11
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.020
It's usually up to the producer of the content to determine how to tackle these situations.

12
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.030
However as developers we should also take the time to help users navigate around the site

13
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.660
the topic we're discussing is what HD L5 calls Aria Aria is short for accessible Rich Internet Applications

14
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.730
in the resource section of this lecture I provide a link to where you can find more information about

15
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.150
this topic as you can see there's a lot of information here and a lot of attributes you can set.

16
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.250
We won't be going over all of them.

17
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.990
This is just a brief introduction to this topic so let's get started.

18
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.800
One of the first steps you can take is to make the elements on your page more understandable.

19
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.000
For example on the sidebar I have the search widget if you can recall this is formatted using these

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.460
search form template.

21
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.010
To us it's clear what this will do.

22
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.570
However that's because we can identify the search icon inside the button and know right away what it

23
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.950
means for people who can't or don't understand.

24
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.750
We will need more information especially people who can't see this visually.

25
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:11.390
Open the search form template this button is entirely made up of h t email and no text in order to provide

26
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.160
more information about this element.

27
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.960
We can apply an attribute called Aria dash label the value for this attribute can be anything you want.

28
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.660
Usually you would provide a short and concise description about this element.

29
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.590
I'm going to input search just like that.

30
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.590
If a user is using a device such as a screen reader then they'll easily be able to identify what this

31
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.010
button does.

32
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.350
You can apply the RTA dash label attribute to any element you like.

33
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.150
There are some exceptions though.

34
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.250
Image tags don't need this attribute because there's the alter attribute that already does something

35
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.520
similar to the Aria dash label attribute.

36
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.000
Let's keep moving forward.

37
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.320
One of the biggest ways you can make your site navigable is by using rolls rolls are a way to categorize

38
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.980
the sections of your site.

39
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.940
They're very simple and straightforward to use.

40
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.850
If you look at the search form template you'll notice we have an attribute called roll by adding this

41
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.550
attribute.

42
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.270
You can specify the type of content that's inside this element.

43
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.170
This is a great and simple attribute to use.

44
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.160
It allows for users to skip around without having to go through each individual element.

45
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.190
Let's play with the role attribute some more open the header template.

46
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.110
I'm going to apply the roll attribute to the header element.

47
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.880
I'm going to set this to banner the banner is the value you want to set to the element that contains

48
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.410
the logo and navigation links go to the page that describes aria in detail.

49
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.330
If you click number 2 You'll be taken to a list of all the values that roll can be set to.

50
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.230
There are dozens of them available will only be using the more major ones.

51
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.830
So we told the user where the header is the next region we can set is the main content sidebar and footer

52
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.790
open the single template.

53
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.100
Next applying the role attribute to the div tag with the class.

54
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.480
Post content.

55
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.810
I'm going to set this to mean this will tell the user.

56
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.880
This is where the main content is located.

57
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.410
I want to highlight that you should only apply this region once as a standard.

58
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.040
You usually only have one region for the main content you don't want to confuse the user.

59
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.780
Be conscious of where you define this region.

60
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:43.630
All right let's keep going on open the sidebar template and apply the role complimentary attribute.

61
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.540
This will specify the sidebar region.

62
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:55.740
Lastly open the footer file and apply the roll content info attribute to the footer element.

63
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.570
This is a weird name but this is usually the name of the region for the footer.

64
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.590
Just like that we set all our regions.

65
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.300
There are so many more things we could do to make this thing accessible but I'm going to stop right

66
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.630
here if you want to test a theme for accessibility.

67
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.520
You can simply use a tool called Wave web accessibility.

68
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.460
I'll provide a link to this in the resource section of this lecture.

69
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.530
I'm going to give some final thoughts.

70
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.220
I find that adding accessibility to my themes is not a high priority.

71
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.120
I usually tackle accessibility last and I don't build upon it unless the product I'm building has high

72
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.320
usage.

73
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.780
It really is a case by case scenario.

74
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.720
It's up to you in the end if you want to make your themes and plugins accessible.

75
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.690
It's never a bad idea to do so.
