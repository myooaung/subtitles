1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,140
I want to display my custom taxonomy on the front end before I do that.

2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,040
I want to add some settings from my taxonomy.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,710
If you were to go to the origin edit page you'll find a list of origins and a forum for creating a new

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,330
one.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,780
This form is pretty basic but I'd like to add onto it.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,530
I want to add a U or L for more information about an origin to pull this off.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,630
We'll have to do a couple of things.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,160
The first step is to add the form fields inside the main plugin file.

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:42,680
Add the action hook called add form fields.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,690
This is a dynamic hook right before the hook name.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,460
You have to append the name of the taxonomy which has origin.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,220
This is how WordPress knows which taxonomy this hook should run under the function I want to call it

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,720
will be named R origin ad form fields next.

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:09,540
Create a file inside the includes slash admin folder named origin dash fields not P HP.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:18,900
Define the function inside this file and make sure to include it from the main plugin file.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,850
I'm going to paste in some H2 email into this function let's break this down the H2 e-mail here is the

17
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,150
same HDMI l you'll find if you were to inspect the element on the form.

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,250
Nothing really special here except for two things.

19
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,670
The first thing is the name of the input field.

20
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,980
It should be unique.

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,420
I set this to are more info you are out.

22
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,940
The next thing is the paragraph tag which contains a short description about the input field.

23
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,010
This is completely optional to add but it's useful to give your users more information about this field.

24
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,980
That's all there is to creating the input fields.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,240
You don't have to worry about adding form tags as this will already be wrapped in one.

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,370
The next step is to save the value back inside the main plugin file.

27
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,250
Add a new action hook called Create underscore

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,980
this action hook is also dynamic it is followed by the name of the taxonomy which is origin the function

29
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,250
I want to call it will be named R save.

30
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,420
Origin Metta.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,320
I'm going to create a new file inside the process folder called Save dash origin dot P. HP with the

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,860
function defined inside.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,670
This function will be passed in the term I.D..

34
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,790
Lastly make sure to include it from the main plugin file

35
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,280
inside this function.

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,630
I'm going to check if the field is set.

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,440
If it isn't then I'm just going to return the function

38
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,770
just like posts.

39
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:08,270
Terms can have metadata to clarify the origin is a taxonomy but each individual origin is called a term.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,300
This goes for any taxonomy the individual categories or tags for a post is called a term so you can

41
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,800
have term metadata the metadata API can be used for this.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,770
WordPress provides a set of functions to save.

43
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,510
Term metadata which work the exact same way as the Post metadata functions.

44
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,970
The name of the functions are just different.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,180
I want you to call the update term meta function.

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,240
The first parameter is the idea of the term.

47
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,690
The second is the name which will be more info you are real and the last parameter is the U.R.L.

48
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,790
I'm going to wrap the value with the function escape you are raw which will make sure this is a safe

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,020
you are El.

50
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,430
This will take care of creating the term.

51
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:04,640
It's important to note that taxonomy is will have two different forms of form for creating the taxonomy

52
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,630
and another for editing a taxonomy to save some time.

53
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,270
I'm going to go back to the main plugin file and copy this action and replace the second one from create

54
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,730
underscore origin too.

55
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:23,970
Edited underscore origin the edited version will be used when a user updates that you are out the function

56
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,740
will be the same.

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,940
We're almost done.

58
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,430
The last thing I want to do is create the form field for the edit form page.

59
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,950
The HCM l will be different but the idea is the same.

60
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,650
I'm going to add a new action hook called edit form fields where the beginning of the hook is the name

61
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,120
of the taxonomy which will be origin.

62
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,090
The function I want to call it will be named R origin.

63
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,210
Edit foreign fields.

64
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,450
I'm going to define this function inside the origin dash fields file

65
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,040
a couple of things will be different from the new form.

66
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,280
This function will be passed in an object called term that will contain information about the current

67
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,040
term to grab the metadata.

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,650
I'm going to create a variable named U.R.L. and its value will be the value returned by the function.

69
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:24,880
Get term meta the term object has a property named term ideas that will pass in as the first parameter

70
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,030
the next parameter is the name which has more info you are L and the last parameter will be set to true

71
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,080
now.

72
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,090
But I have my you are L I can display the form with it.

73
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,660
I'm going to paste in some HCM L which is a tad different than the function above.

74
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,510
I know it seems weird but the HCM CML tends to be different for both fields.

75
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,630
The edit form field uses tables to format the form.

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
What's most important is the input field for the value.

77
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm echoing out the you are out.

78
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,410
This will take care of the form and saving the data.

79
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,920
I'm going to test this.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,990
Refresh the page and you should see the field appearing.

81
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:13,240
I want you to create a new origin.

82
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,840
You can paste in any you or l you want.

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,090
I'm just going to paste in a U or L to the France Wikipedia page.

84
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,540
You'll now see the term appear to the right.

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,430
Click on it and check to see if the edit form is working as well.

86
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,470
You don't have to change any values but if you press update then you should still see everything intact.

87
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,000
The next step is to make the origin appear on the front end along with the more info you are out open

88
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,100
the filter content file.

89
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,990
This is the file that contains the function to modify the output onto the front end.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,550
I'm also going to open the template for this.

91
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:58,250
I'm going to make one modification to the template I want you to add another list item that has three

92
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,590
place holders for the name.

93
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:06,770
The actual value itself and many placeholder for the more info you are El inside the filter function.

94
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,830
We will replace the tex holder with origin for the actual value itself.

95
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,960
We're only interested in the first origin itself.

96
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,470
I'm going to create a variable named origin which will contain the value returned by the function.

97
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,480
WP get post terms

98
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,870
this function will get all the terms associated with this post.

99
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,710
The first parameter is the idea of the post.

100
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,770
The second parameter is the taxonomy which is origin

101
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,080
this function will return an array of terms.

102
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,570
I'm going to create another variable named.

103
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:49,170
More info you are l I'm going to use the ternary operator to assign the value for this variable.

104
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,770
I'm going to check if the first item in the origin array is set.

105
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,440
So we know we have at least one item in The Origin array if there is a value.

106
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,990
I'm going to get the more info you are well metadata using the Get term meta function.

107
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,540
Otherwise I'm going to set this as an empty string

108
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,830
now that we have our values prepared let's display them for the origin itself.

109
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,410
I'm going to use the ternary operator again if the first item in the array is set.

110
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,070
I'm going to output the name of that term each item in the array is an object in the resource section

111
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,900
of this lecture.

112
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,800
I provide a link to the function WP get post terms.

113
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,330
If you scroll down to the return value section you'll find the properties for each object in the array.

114
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,500
One of these is the name which is what we're using here.

115
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,300
However if the first term is indeed empty we're going to use the phrase none

116
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,360
the very last step to all of this is to display the more info you are out.

117
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,980
I'm going to use a conditional statement to check if the more info you real variable is empty.

118
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,310
If it isn't I'm going to replace the place holder with a clickable link.

119
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,130
Otherwise I'm just going to replace it with an empty string let's test this out.

120
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,800
Now I want you to view a recipe without making any changes to it.

121
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,880
You should see the origin list item with none next to it and know you are well appearing after you've

122
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,640
confirmed that you can now edit this recipe.

123
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,400
I want you to assign the origin we created earlier save your changes and view the recipe again.

124
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,030
You should now see the origin appear along with the more info you are.

125
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,150
That wraps it up for this lecture.

126
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,060
We've learned how to make taxonomy and settings for our taxonomy is.
