00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Ketkee] So as we have seen,

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.030
they provide a clean and safe way

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.080
to execute concurrent tasks

4
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.000
within the context of the Java Enterprise.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.080
It is integrated within the specification itself,

6
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.000
and hence, developers can be totally sure

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.030
to trust all the JEE 7 compliant servers

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.060
like JBoss, WebSphere, et cetera to implement this.

9
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.070
They need no additional libraries or frameworks

10
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.020
to be included and will work as intended out of the box.

11
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.080
The JSR specification has provided a base

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.020
for all future concurrency utilities

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020
from Java's Standard Edition to be easily ported

14
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.000
to the Java Enterprise Edition,

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.020
thus keeping the platform future ready and self-contained.

16
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.000
So until we meet the next time, enjoy coding.
