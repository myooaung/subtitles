00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] So far, we have talked about processes,

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.050
we've talked about threads,

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.030
we've talked about scheduling priorities,

4
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.050
all of that theory.

5
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.060
Now, let's start looking into the Java Standard Edition

6
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.030
concurrency utilities.

7
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.040
We have to do this because when we get to do

8
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.080
the enterprise edition part of it,

9
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.030
it will become easier to understand

10
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.040
the concurrency utilities for enterprise version, okay?

11
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.090
All right, so Java Standard Edition multithreading overview.

12
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.070
We have already spoken that the Java platform supports

13
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.000
concurrency programming through multithreading.

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.090
Now, in order to do that on the standard edition,

15
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.060
we have two levels of APIs: basic and high-level.

16
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.060
When you talk about the basic APIs,

17
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.060
we have two entities:

18
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.050
the thread class and the runnable interface.

19
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.010
All of these reside under the java.lang package.

20
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.040
And then, there's a high level API,

21
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040
which we call executor framework.

22
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.020
Very important.

23
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.070
And all of these lie under the java.util.concurrent package.

24
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.000
So, in the upcoming videos,

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.050
we are going to see them most for the thread

26
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.070
and the runnable class,

27
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.020
then we'll have a quick look at all the APIs

28
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.070
that we have in these entities,

29
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.060
and once that's done, then we will move on

30
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.000
to the executor framework.
