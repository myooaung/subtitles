00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Ketkee] Many of us probably know

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.010
the standard edition APIs for concurrency,

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.020
but when it comes to an enterprise environment,

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.000
the picture changes entirely.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.050
Prior to Java Enterprise Edition Version 7,

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.080
we did have an opportunity to create threads

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.020
using the standard edition,

8
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.080
but it was considered a dangerous practice.

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.010
But with the advent of the enterprise version now,

10
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.010
which supports concurrency utilities,

11
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.000
we have options where we can easily seamlessly integrate

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.060
the background processing or parallelism tasks

13
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.060
in an enterprise application.

14
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.010
So in this course, we are going to look

15
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.080
at the four basic APIs

16
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.060
under enterprise edition concurrency utilities,

17
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.000
and then we'll go on to do demos for each one of them.

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.070
We will also talk about what happens

19
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.030
with concurrency in a distributed environment

20
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.040
and if there are transactions in there,

21
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.080
how do we handle them.

22
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.000
So let's get started.
