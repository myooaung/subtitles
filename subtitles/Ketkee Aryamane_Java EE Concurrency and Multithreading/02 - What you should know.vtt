00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] In order to get the most out of this course,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.060
let's take a look at the basic skills

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.010
that we definitely need,

4
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.060
which will help us on our way

5
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.040
when we get on with the course.

6
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.060
The first thing is, a practical experience

7
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.030
with all the fundamentals of the Java Standard Edition APIs

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.040
is necessary.

9
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.090
We're going to use Java version 1.8,

10
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.040
and it will be really good if you know thoroughly

11
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.090
the APIs under it.

12
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.040
You have to be comfortable using Eclipse, NetBeans,

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.060
or any other integrated development environment

14
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.050
to do all your development activity.

15
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.020
Experience using an application server

16
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.080
like Jboss, WebLogic, or GlassFish or any other,

17
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.070
will really help because this course is going to talk about

18
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.060
an enterprise environment.

19
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.050
Basic knowledge of Enterprise JavaBean APIs

20
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.020
is also required because we are going to use these APIs

21
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.000
when we build applications as a part of this course.

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.020
Lastly, we are going to develop a RESTful web service,

23
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.030
and a basic to intermediate knowledge of RESTful services

24
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.090
is also required for this course.

25
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.020
Lastly, we are going to have few database interactions,

26
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.000
so it is always good to know few database concepts.
