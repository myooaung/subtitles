00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Instructor] Okay, so lets pick up

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.010
from where we left.

3
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.000
Now to run this RESTful API application,

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.090
I will need the Application Server.

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.040
Right, we talked about the need of Java EE Concurrency,

6
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.060
and we said that there's a server container environment

7
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.000
that is necessary.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.020
So now, I'm going to use GlassFish Server Version 5.

9
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.080
In case you have no idea

10
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.080
how to add the GlassFish Server to NetBeans IDE,

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.090
I will quickly show you that procedure.

12
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.030
You have to go to Tools, Servers,

13
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.030
and then you can say Add Server, right there at the bottom.

14
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.020
When you say Add Server,

15
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.040
it'll tell you what you can name your server.

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.000
You can choose which server that you want to use, right,

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.010
right now we're using GlassFish,

18
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.050
you're free to use JBoss, or WebLogic, or WildFly,

19
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.010
and then say Next, and then provide the path

20
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040
to the GlassFish installation directory.

21
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.060
So in the initial setup, we've already seen

22
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.050
as a part of this course,

23
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.070
we want to download GlassFish Server, right,

24
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.080
so that installation directory path

25
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.040
has to be provided here.

26
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.070
Once that's done, you just have to click on the Next button,

27
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.040
and make sure that the server gets added, right.

28
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.030
Okay, so I'm canceling this,

29
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.020
because I have already got the server

30
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.050
added to my NetBeans IDE.

31
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.010
So lets close this.

32
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.050
So now that the project has been built,

33
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.060
I want to run this application on the GlassFish 5 Server,

34
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.010
so lets right-click and say Run.

35
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.030
So here it's asking me to select the Server,

36
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.050
so I'll select GlassFish Server 5,

37
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.050
and maybe I'll say remember this server

38
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.090
for the current IDE session,

39
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.000
or maybe you can even say Remember Permanently,

40
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.010
it's your choice, and say OK.

41
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.090
So now, the GlassFish Server is gonna get started,

42
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.090
and it'll deploy that project.

43
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090
Okay, great, so it's already deployed,

44
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.050
and the basic URL is ready for me right out here.

45
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.040
Okay, so I am going to use the Postman tool

46
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.000
for testing RESTful services.

47
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.020
We have already seen this as a part of the setup,

48
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.010
so lets copy this URL, close this,

49
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.080
and I have the Postman tool open in front of me.

50
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.040
So once you download and install it,

51
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.080
you can just open it, maybe register with Google,

52
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.070
or whatever login it asks you for,

53
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.090
and then it's ready right there in front of you.

54
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.030
So now, I'm about to test out

55
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.030
that GreetResource RESTful API.

56
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.090
How do I do that?

57
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.090
You have to say Ctrl + V, because that's the basic path

58
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.040
of your application.

59
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.030
Then, you will have to make sure

60
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.070
that you access the JAXRSConfiguration's basic URI,

61
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.090
which is this, okay.

62
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.020
Lets go back and copy that,

63
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.010
and to this, you're going to append

64
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.090
the actual RESTful Beans path too.

65
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.080
So you have to take this, greetUser,

66
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.010
and go to the Postman tool, and append that,

67
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.000
and then click on Send.

68
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.030
There you go, you have the output ready in front of you,

69
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.060
Java EE concurrency starts.

70
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.050
So we have been able to successfully

71
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.000
make a RESTful Bean in a RESTful API project,

72
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.010
and also test it out.

73
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.070
Okay, so that's the basic setup.

74
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.000
So hence forward, whatever the (mumbles)

75
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.090
we're going to do,

76
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.050
we are going to use the Managed objects

77
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.050
using RESTful services.

78
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.010
A couple of other points, we talked about Managed Resources

79
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.090
of the Server.

80
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.000
In the previous discussion, we said there are two ways

81
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.060
of getting those resources,

82
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.050
either by an entry in the deployment descriptor,

83
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.090
or by JNDI lookup or Resource annotation, right.

84
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.000
So if you're trying to have

85
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.010
the deployment descriptor configured,

86
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.080
that's the entry you want to make into it,

87
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.040
the web XML file.

88
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.050
So you have a resource environment reference name,

89
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.090
a name of your choice,

90
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.000
and then the fully qualified class name

91
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.010
of the managed object of the container

92
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.080
that you want to use in your application.

93
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.020
If you do not want to do this,

94
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.030
there's this other option of JNDI lookup

95
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.050
or Resource annotation.

96
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.040
So, the container by default, always provides you

97
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.080
a set of Concurrent Resources.

98
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.070
How do you know that?

99
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.070
Lets check it out.

100
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.040
So we are going to access the Admin Console

101
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.070
of the GlassFish Server.

102
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.030
The Admin Console of GlassFish Server

103
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.060
is available at the port 4848.

104
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.080
Lets click Enter, it automatically takes you to the Console.

105
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.010
There we go, that's the GlassFish Console, okay,

106
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.080
and do you see the Resources option here?

107
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.060
And under that, you have Concurrent Resources.

108
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.000
Those are the four APIs that we have been discussing,

109
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.040
Contact Service, Managed Thread Factory,

110
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.060
Managed Executor Service,

111
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.040
and the Scheduled Executor Service.

112
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.020
So when you click here, do you see

113
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.060
that there's a default Managed Executor Service object

114
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.020
already ready for you?

115
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.010
That's right, so you either define

116
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.000
your own environment reference variables

117
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.080
by making entries to (mumbles),

118
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.060
the way I showed you before, or,

119
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.000
you already have these default objects available

120
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.010
on the Console, on the Container IDE,

121
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.000
you can use them directly in your code,

122
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and that's what we are going to do for this course.

123
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.030
You're gonna pick up these default executor object,

124
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.010
or Concurrent objects, as we say, which are already present

125
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.000
and utilize them to see our demos.
