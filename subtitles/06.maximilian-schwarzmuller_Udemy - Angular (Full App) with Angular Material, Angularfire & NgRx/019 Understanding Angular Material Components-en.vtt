00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.960

You can wisit material that Eyler thought I know which is the official page of the annual material project.



2

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.280

And there you can already see the CDK thing I mentioned here on the top you can learn more about the



3

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.780

different utility features it contains because you can use to CDK as a basis for your own component



4

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.050

kit if you wanted to.



5

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.880

So as an alternative to angular material if you want to create your own components with your own styling



6

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.090

This is not what we'll do in this course though we will use the angle material components which you



7

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.580

can check out by clicking on components and there on the left you see a list of all the components that



8

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.140

are part of the package.



9

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.490

And this list will grow over time.



10

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.460

So at the point of time you're viewing this course there might be one or two extra components.



11

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.560

This is why in this course I won't go through that list and simply show you how to use that would be



12

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.640

rather boring.



13

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.060

But why instead of want to show you how you learn how to use it and how we use it in the example project



14

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.820

you can then always stif into a component which we might not cover in this course but which sounds interesting



15

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.250

to you like for example the slider and you will always find the documentation that structured like this



16

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.290

an overview document where you can read more about the component how to use it in different configurations.



17

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.890

This is the most important page then an API overview which essentially is a little bit nicer formatted



18

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.570

worship of the source code where you see which properties of a certain class are buyable like your that



19

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.540

you could bind to the inward property of the math slider component to it and word it so that you can



20

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.480

use property binding to go figure out some of that will be mentioned on the overview page though.



21

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.780

But you can read the entire API here.



22

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.880

This can be really important to find out how to get to get specific behavior you need.



23

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.070

And you also get one or more examples then on the last tab and on all examples both on the examples



24

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.990

tab as well as the overview tab.



25

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.810

You can always click that view source button here to view well the source code of the example for HVM



26

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.010

all the types of code used for it.



27

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.220

And the C US code used for it.



28

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.620

Does this how you can work with the documentation and how you should work with the documentation.



29

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.120

I won't walk you through all the components.



30

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.020

There would be no singly I could build where I fit all of them in there.



31

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.150

Instead in this course we will build a real app where we use a lot of these components so that you can



32

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.630

see how I dive into the documentation how we use it how you have to import things to use certain features



33

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.210

and that you can see the bigger picture.



34

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.890

So this is the angular material package.



35

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.530

Now enough talking about debt Utset we should get started and to get started we should install it.



36

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.640

We should install a project or set up an annual project where we use that annual material package.



37

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.350

If you click on guides and then getting started you'll find all the steps you need to execute.



38

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.860

But we will do that together in the next lecture.
