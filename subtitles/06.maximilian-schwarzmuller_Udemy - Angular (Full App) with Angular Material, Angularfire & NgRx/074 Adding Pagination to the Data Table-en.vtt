00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.660

We added sorting and we added filtering filtering was particularly easy and as you saw from a data table



2

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.840

perspective it was only about assigning the filter property and the data source.



3

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.840

Now let's work on page a nation that's alost important thing you often need on tables page anation is



4

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.950

all about showing how many rows you display and allowing the user to cycle between pages to switch between



5

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.340

the well rows for each page.



6

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.460

Engelen material gives you a special component you can use for page anation if you check out the page



7

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.610

anation docs you'll learn how to set up this component and how to connect that to a data table and the



8

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.710

computer I'm talking about is actually added below the table not inside of it.



9

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.150

It's not part of the table and you can actually use it in the pendant of the table.



10

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.870

But here it's the Matt page nature component.



11

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.560

So let's simply copy this component here.



12

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:09.330

And in the past training component HVM file are placed below my math table component.



13

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.600

Now the map page in nature here has a page sized property which in this case is bound to a number 10.



14

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.620

This term is how many items should be displayed on a given page.



15

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.270

Also the to one so that we can quickly see a result and page size options to find out which steps we



16

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.790

want to present to the user.



17

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.090

Besides the forward and backward buttons so to jump to page 5 10 and 20 maybe we also assign a local



18

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.290

reference your by which we can grab access to the page and 8 or later.



19

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.340

So this is deep page and later.



20

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.820

And since it's a separate component we need to add an ORDER to the material module.



21

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.160

So they're at the top all import.



22

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:01.530

Matt page Nadr module and I'll wrap this and add it to both imports and exports.



23

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.400

Now with that added here we can go back to their past training component.



24

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.350

This should now work and we should already be able to see this component to be honest if we quickly



25

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.810

do log in here.



26

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.600

We can see the page anation component below the table.



27

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.050

As I said it looks nice with the table but it works in dependently of that and you can find out more



28

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.380

about pagination and how it works independent of their table by clicking on the page name or article.



29

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.160

This will explain what it actually returns you and how you may use it.



30

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.570

Now back to the table though and back to our application we got the page NHL here and we can switch



31

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.080

between pages but we will get no data so this won't really work.



32

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.650

Let's make sure that it does work for that we need to connect it to the data table.



33

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.600

By the way keep in mind the page size options is bound by a property binding as a page size.



34

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.370

So we're passing a real number and a real array here.



35

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.510

But back to connecting it to connect that we have to go to the typescript file.



36

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.510

There we have to get access to the page and eighter and then set up a connection to data source page



37

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.810

and atre Let's get access First we get X in the same way we got access to the sorting directive.



38

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.660

We use view child and select Matt page and later like this.



39

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.230

We could also use the local reference we placed on it but I'll use a different approach so I'll get



40

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.150

rid of it.



41

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.340

So here I'm using Map page and Aitor all stored in a property named page and later though the name is



42

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.150

up to you it doesn't matter.



43

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.770

And the type will be met page and enter.



44

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:50.740

Now just as with sorting in Engy after you in it we assign this to this data source page and later this



45

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.680

will connect the two and Anglo material will do the rest.



46

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.210

Behind the scenes let's see this in action.



47

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.650

We now connected it.



48

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:06.590

So let's quickly log in and here you see I can't do anything.



49

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.710

Now let's go back to the exercises and do two exercises since I find a page size of one.



50

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.580

We should get page nation already after only doing two exercises.



51

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.330

So if you go to paths exercises we indeed only see one row.



52

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.840

If my thoughts are here we still filter across all pages by the way so that's really cool but we only



53

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.140

see one road but we can go for it to see the second page and backward and that's all bandaged for us.



54

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.340

The styling and the behavior.



55

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.220

If I set the items per page size to 5 while then we see obviously 5 items so does allow us to override



56

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.870

the default.



57

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.630

We set up here



58

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.850

so this is the page and Atre you the find a page size here and you can find which options you want to



59

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.670

present to the user if any here for example that you can switch to 5 10 or 20 IPs per page we can of



60

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.620

course also add one here.



61

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.400

It is an array.



62

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.720

You simply add items to it and you can check the page nature by accessing it with the child and then



63

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.920

assigning it to the page and enter property of the data source and that is all this was sorting filtering



64

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.220

and using Page anation with the data table and as you saw these are some patterns you probably have



65

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.730

to remember or look up from time to time but in the end it's not difficult at all.
