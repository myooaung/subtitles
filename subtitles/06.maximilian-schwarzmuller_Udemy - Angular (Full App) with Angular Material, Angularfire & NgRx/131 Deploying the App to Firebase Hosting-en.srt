1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,940
Get your app deployed you can log into your project on firebase and click on hosting.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,080
And there you will actually be able to click on get started to see the steps you need to execute to

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,670
get your app onto firebase hosting.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,720
And the first step is that we need to install these firebase tools package which gives us a seal which

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,910
makes the deployment really easy.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,650
So let's just run it in the command line.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,970
And on Mac and Linux you probably need to add a pseudo in front of it to get the right permissions because

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,450
we're installing it as a global package.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,860
And now with that this will download it and install it on our machine and we can already go to the next

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,280
step.

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,440
Now now here do you see the three steps you need to execute to get your project onto firebase.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,260
So let's run the first command firebase log in.

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,680
Now I don't want to get that.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,870
Thank you.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,580
Now you should get a window in the browser where you have to log in.

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,230
I'll quickly do that.

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,850
And once you did this you should be forwarded.

18
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,310
Thereafter you can run firebase it needs to put this project under firebase control or to use various

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,900
features configure various fire of his features in that project.

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,960
That includes for example the database or fire store.

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,550
And this does not affect the fact that we're already using that in this project we could just apply

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,650
rules and configure the database from within that project.

23
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,350
But I don't want to do that.

24
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:37,190
I want to go to hosting and you can hit space and then enter to enable hosting for this project folder

25
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,710
choose your app thereafter and hit enter.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,080
And then you have to choose where you are to be deployed.

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,330
Files are located now for us.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,290
It's not the default which would be the public folder but the disk folder.

29
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,420
So simply enter disks here.

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,160
Thereafter you can choose yes.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,310
This should be configured as a single page app which will ensure that we always return the index age

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,930
to him out file which ensures that the angular router always gets a chance of handling incoming requests.

33
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:15,590
If you would not choose yes year then you would get 4 0 4 errors for anything but the route route because

34
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,020
your routes are not known to the server and angular wouldn't get a chance of taking over by setting

35
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,380
this too yes it will.

36
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,170
And we get the warning that the next age tomorrow already exists there.

37
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,700
No I don't want to override that.

38
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,160
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:38,240
With that we can simply run firebase deploy now and this will upload all the files in the dist folder

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,900
to the firebase hosting configure everything for it there.

41
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,620
And once it's done also give us a link.

42
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,640
Here it is.

43
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:53,810
So this is D U R L which I can open and if I do so maybe zoom Suman a bit we can see our application

44
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,070
here.

45
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,110
So let's quickly log in.

46
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,330
That's looking good.

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,730
Let's start some Berberis

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,260
let's finish them let you all exercise.

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,960
We also see the whole exercises here by the way which makes sense because we are sharing the same database

50
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,320
behind the scenes filtering and so on.

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,840
That works.

52
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,040
And this is our application deployed.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,650
So let me quickly create a new user to confirm that this all works.

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,640
Let's use a different e-mail your birth date and agree.

55
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,980
Oh I guess I took this e-mail too so let's use a different one.

56
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,000
That works.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,270
We're locked in.

58
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,300
And let's now try this new e-mail address for logging in

59
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,350
and there's all the works.

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
And that also all works on the mobile.

61
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,160
You there as you can see by zoom in a little bit so that you can see it better here.

62
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:03,520
We of course also could use crunches and let's complete this exercise and watch our working end final

63
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,310
app run in the browser.

64
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,480
This is what we built.
