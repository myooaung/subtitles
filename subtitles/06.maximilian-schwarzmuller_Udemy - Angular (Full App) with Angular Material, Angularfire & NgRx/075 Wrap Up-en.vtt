00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.160

In this module we again achieve a lot.



2

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.040

We add a data table and besides that we added services and models to the entire app so that our app



3

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.910

does now not just look good but also work with real dynamic data.



4

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.140

And at the end of this module you'll learn about the math data table a very powerful component that



5

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.520

can be used to output data in a structured form in a table where you can easily add features like sorting



6

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.670

and filtering and Page nation without having to write much code.



7

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.870

That's really powerful and useful in the next machos.



8

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.830

We will continue enhancing the sap.



9

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.840

And for example connect to a real server and we'll see the power of a girl of fire while it's doing



10

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.530

so.



11

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.510

Let's move on.
