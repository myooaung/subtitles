00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,260
In the last lecture we injected our training service let's now connected to the new training start button.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:14,630
Right now I image does training start event which I then consume in a training component but now I want

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,100
to do all of that through services for debt in the training service.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,960
Let's first of all add a couple of properties.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,410
The first one is the running exercise which is of type exercise.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,330
This should store the exercise which the user selected if any.

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:43,490
With that we can now add start exercise method here which I want to call from the new training component

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:51,740
wouldn't be clicked the start button were a set exercise the user chose for dad all pass or all received

9
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,170
to select that idea which should be a string.

10
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,650
I will have to make sure that this is passed from the component and then I will find the exercise to

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,300
user selected.

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,800
So the selected exercise which will temporarily store this constant can be found in my A-Whale exercises

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,870
with the help of the find method where it will execute this arrow function on every element in the array

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,680
and return an object where I return true here in that arrow function.

15
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,020
I want to return true if the exercise ID.

16
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,650
So the exercise is currently looking at.

17
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,070
Again it will look at all exercises in that array.

18
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,930
If that's equal to the selected ID because then I know they selected ID matches the optic I'm currently

19
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,740
looking at.

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,480
You should return true because we found the optical one to find.

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,930
So ultimately this will give me the object the user selected.

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:58,570
And now all store does in running exercise I'll store my selected exercise in this property.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,700
And yes we could skip this extra line.

24
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,770
We could also just set this running exercise equal to that.

25
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,410
So this running exercise equal to that would all be perfectly fine.

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,310
Now with that set up we're storing the exercise user selected in the service.

27
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,470
That is great but only part of what we wanted to do.

28
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,050
I still want to inform the training component about the select that exercise so that it can hide the

29
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:33,960
maktab group and show the current training and stat for that in the training component.

30
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,400
I'll have to get informed about Webroot use or picked new training or not.

31
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,430
So I want to set up this event driven approach here too just as we did it for authentication.

32
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,350
I guess this is another great place for you to practice this.

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,230
We get a certain event the user clicks the start button which you need to connect to your start exercise

34
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:03,350
method here and then you have to admit an event to which you subscribe and the training component to

35
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,000
change ongoing training.

36
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,210
True whenever Well it occurs.

37
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,350
Does this your challenge in the next lecture we'll do it together.
