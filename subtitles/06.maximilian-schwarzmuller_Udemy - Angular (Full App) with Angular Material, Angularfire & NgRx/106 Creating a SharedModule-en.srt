1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,440
So we did a lot with all these modules and now the app Marchal is really really lean.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,660
We could also create a core module to put all the features of the app module into that but I'll leave

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,440
it in the app module instead.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:22,250
What I wanted to do though is create a shared module because if we have a look at the training module

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,850
then we see that we import common Marchal and forms module there as well as material and flex layout.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,520
And we do import the same things in our off module.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,560
So a shared marshal for these things certainly makes sense.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:47,240
So in a shared folder all create a shared module Dud's TS file and I'll name it shared module decorated

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,820
with at Ngee module of course and import Engy module from an angle or Clor.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,670
So let's add this import ngi module from at angular core like this.

11
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,560
And now indeed shared module here which is just a normal module which we'll use for sharing though.

12
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,430
All I could define clear declarations of components which we share across Martial's but we got nodes

13
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,080
such components but I can import some things and export them again so that I can use them in other modules

14
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,260
because as I said by default a module keeps its imports and declarations to itself.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,400
But if you add exports it actually shares it with any Alber modules that import this module does the

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,070
same pattern we already use on a material module by the way they are we just import and export a bunch

17
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,690
of stuff.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,860
So this essentially already is a shared module.

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,090
Now we're taking this a step further and create an additional one for more than just material components.

20
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,570
So in the shared module here what do we share.

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,500
Well as we just identified the common module in the forms module material and flex layout D reac the

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,480
forms module is only used in the off module.

23
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,470
So I will leave it here but I will cut the comment at the form's module and add them to the imports

24
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:16,550
array of my shared module as well as tree exports array so that we can use them in our modules too.

25
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,720
And the same for material and flex layout angle of fire off is going to stay off Marchal because that

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,680
of course is only used here.

27
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,890
So let's move these two things we just picked all the into the shared module both imports and exports.

28
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,720
Now obviously we need to add the import Puff's to import statements for these things.

29
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,270
So in the off margin that would be the flex layout module and that would be the common module.

30
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,750
And of course also the forms module.

31
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:56,080
So all copy these remove flex layout and Carmen from the off module remove forms module from the at

32
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:03,440
Angola forms import and put these imports I just copied into my shared module here however I don't need

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,260
the reactive forums module.

34
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:13,040
Now what import is missing and that is the material module which I'll also remove from the module and

35
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,480
which will also now add to my shared module.

36
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,360
The payoff is the same as before since the old folder level is the same.

37
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:30,260
So now I get my share shared module prepared and I can import this shared module into my off module

38
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,200
so here and imports array.

39
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,970
I'll add my shared module and of course you also need to add an import statement at the top where you

40
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,730
point to the shared folder and they are to the shared module file.

41
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,360
And we don't need exports are really off module because we're not exporting anything.

42
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,790
So that's the shared module.

43
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,030
Now we also have our training module there.

44
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,560
We can also get rid off the common and the forms module the material and the flex layout module and

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
simply add the shared module instead.

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,070
And just as in the module you need to add an import statement for this year to import the shared module

47
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,430
from the shared folder and from the shared module file.

48
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,020
So with that we are using a shared module.

49
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:25,340
Let's take a closer look at the app and see if everything still works if we reload the page if we now

50
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,580
log in.

51
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,140
That's looking good.

52
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,920
That's also looking good.

53
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,690
Let's start some side lunges here.

54
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,040
So does this now all working great.

55
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,500
So now we're using a shared module.
