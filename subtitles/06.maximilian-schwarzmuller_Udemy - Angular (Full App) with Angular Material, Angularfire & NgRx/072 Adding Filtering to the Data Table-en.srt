1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:10,020
Let's add some filtering to our math table filtering is surprisingly simple.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,010
First of all we need to add the input into which the user can type we at is above the math tables so

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,090
not inside of it.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,760
It's not strictly connected to it.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,920
It's a neural input.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,030
Just as you could add it anywhere else on your page.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,100
So you're all at the map for feel to have a nice looking input with a floating label and so on.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,780
And then there are and no real input with math input as a directive.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,920
And that's almost it also set a time to text.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,130
So this is now my full input field.

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,620
I want to use now on that input field.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,700
I want to register an event listener that fires whenever we type.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,650
So I will add a key up listener.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:01:00,820
And here I will execute to do filter Meffert where I want to forward de-value to user entered I can

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,520
access this on the dollar sign even Optik angler gives me this simply and closes the default Dom event

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,170
that is emitted.

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,090
And there it connects the target and pass on the value.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:19,960
So that is expected the string the user entered also add a placeholder to the input where they say FELTER.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,520
So this is now my input field.

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,310
Next I want to use that so I need to implement the dual filter method in my component.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:38,350
So in there I will add a new method to filter where I will get the full value which will be a string.

22
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:46,250
So this is what the user entered I know can filter very very simply by simply accessing the data source

23
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,480
and they're setting the filter property equal to the string I got here.

24
00:01:52,610 --> 00:02:00,650
So to filter value the only thing I want to do is I want to call trim to remove any whitespace and then

25
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,480
to lower case.

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:12,470
The reason for this is dead angular or angular materials data source or a material table will in the

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,160
end concatenate all values of zero.

28
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,580
So if we have calories duration and so on next to chavrusa it will put this all into one row and then

29
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:29,990
search for our filtered string here in that long string it's created by doing it like this it will always

30
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:37,880
take into account all our rows and we therefore should provide a string which is trimmed and all lowercase

31
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,690
because angular will also put its long string to lowercase so that we have a unique casing for which

32
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,390
we falter.

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,890
And then we don't have to worry about casing.

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,380
You can override its default filtering mechanism and you can read more about this on the data table

35
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,820
page by clicking on filtering.

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,120
There you see there you can cast your own filter predicate function if you want to overwrite this.

37
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,470
Now back to our cupholder though here I don't want to override this and in a lot of cases you don't

38
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,260
want to.

39
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,720
So here let's simply ensure that all files are saved.

40
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:22,220
And then let's quickly log in here and start a couple of exercises and cancel them as before.

41
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,730
Just that we got some values.

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:35,510
Yes and now we get that the filter inputs we need to work on the positioning but it will work if I enter.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,620
Here you see with full the four crunches awls if I enter a lower case if I enter 0.6 we only see Deadworld

44
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,370
adorations Sirat 6.

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,280
If my filter for bird ILEC the bird piece does this how easy that works.

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:59,180
Now let's make sure the positioning is all right and I do that by going back to my component and there

47
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:07,970
are two H.T. mail file and we simply need to style There's field the input field we positioned above

48
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,120
the material table there.

49
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:17,150
I will wrap this in a death so let's wrap this and put it into the div

50
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:29,290
and I will add X lay out your facts lay out a line to be precise and set this to center center

51
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:39,770
and give his a width of 40 percent.

52
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,540
Now let's have a look at this.

53
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,290
We don't need to add new values for Nabl in order to be able to see this and does this looking ready

54
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,310
got to me

55
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,750
I all should name this placeholder though to see the placeholder.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,190
So now if you go back one more time we should have a nice looking folder field here setting about the

57
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,360
data table.

58
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,660
Also if we increase Dishon with and now we can enter our filter string here and have a data table which

59
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,160
works just like that out of the box.
