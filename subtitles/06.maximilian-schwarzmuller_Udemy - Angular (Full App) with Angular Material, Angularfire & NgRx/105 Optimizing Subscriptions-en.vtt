00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.350

So now that we also created the training module there are two things I recognize we can optimize for



2

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.760

one.



3

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:15.220

We should put the angular fire marshal Gengler fire of modules I mean into the off module and not in



4

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.220

the app module I forgot that.



5

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.980

So here let's add the angle of fire off module into the imports array of the off module.



6

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.400

And this means we need to add an import as well.



7

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.430

So we need to import angular fire of module from angle of fire to slash off.



8

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.820

This now allows us to go back to the app module and close close this gap and also removed the import



9

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.550

of angle of fire to off the angle of fire marshall should stay in the air marshal because Dadis the



10

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.350

module which is used to initialising LA fire and we want to do that right at the start.



11

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.900

India module.



12

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.480

And another improvement I recognized is you can get an error or from our subscriptions where we unsubscribe



13

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.730

if you don't have them for some reason.



14

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.790

If Engy on the stroy for some reason is called before the subscription is created therefore we should



15

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.700

check where we say if loading ceps exists then I want to unsubscribe.



16

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.310

And we should do this for all subscriptions that are apt to be safe and be protected against this error.



17

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:30.340

So the loggin component I will also check if does loading subs is true or is not falles at least is



18

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.800

not undefined in which case I will unsubscribe.



19

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.790

So thats loading and sign up.



20

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.960

We should also do the same in all Avro components.



21

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.590

So encourage training.



22

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.420

Its not relevant.



23

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.790

We dont have engine destroy there we dont have a subscription there and stop training.



24

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.630

We also don't have that in new training though we do so here in NGO undestroyed we get two subscriptions.



25

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.070

We have to check each of these so check if exercise is subscription and only if that is not undefined



26

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.500

only then we do unsubscribe.



27

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.100

And the same is true for the loading subscription of course.



28

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:15.520

So only if this is not the find only data I want to unsubscribe and past trainings there we also have



29

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.460

a subscription.



30

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.400

So here I should also check if this Xchange subscription if this subscription exists only if it does



31

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.580

exist only then we will unsubscribe.



32

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.690

Now in the training component itself here we do have a subscription and we don't even unsubscribe.



33

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.320

So that's something we definitely have to fix.



34

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.750

Add on the stroy here because if you forget it you risk running into memory leaks.



35

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.560

So let's ngi let's add this year and on strike and let's check if this exercise subscription exists



36

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.440

and if it doesn't exist then I will use it and unsubscribe from it.



37

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.690

So good thing we check that and a welcome component there we get no subscription in the app component.



38

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.690

There we have this Lisner which we initialized but is instead handled in a service.



39

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.150

So with that we now improved all our subscriptions and we fixed the positioning of the angular fire



40

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.810

of module.



41

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.120

Now before we add lazy loading there's more we can do regarding modules.
