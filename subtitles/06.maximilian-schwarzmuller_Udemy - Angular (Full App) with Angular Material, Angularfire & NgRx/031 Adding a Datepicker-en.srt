1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,970
So over the last lectures we added our basic form.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,970
We added validation hints and you'll learn how the angular material components.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,540
Mostly the math for Imphal component when it comes to forms gives you a lot of out of the box working

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,560
functionalities to create beautiful forms which provide great user experiences.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,090
Now let's add more form fields because of course you're not limited to just inputs.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,070
If you have a look at the official angular material documentation under form controls you'll find things

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,060
like order completing inputs.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,710
You can learn more about that here on that page of course.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,750
And also the date picker and the checkbox to component.

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,210
I want to use for now.

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,560
Later we will also see the select input.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,940
So let's start with the date picker the date picker is actually a bit of a more complex component but

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,860
still easy to use.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,940
Let's have a look at its code here.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,730
You see you typically use it by wrapping it in a map form field since you typically use it enough for

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,900
him and one to have things like the floating label one to have things like maybe hints and arrows.

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,640
You don't use a normal input with madded put which you connect to the date picker to output the date

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,060
picked by the user.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,180
And then you have to the actual date picker component which consists of a toggle.

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,550
So a button that opens the date picker and then the date picker which is shown if you click the toggle.

21
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,760
Now one crucial part of the picture is that it also manages to date format.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,860
So if it picked this date your it outputs this in this format and that's of course important for us

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,050
because we want to use a format that fits to the locale of our application.

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,770
Now you can learn more about the date picker here in this article of course some advanced use such as

25
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,780
how to restrict pick a date and so on.

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,600
And also about internationalization.

27
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:08,260
Now here you actually got a working internationalization out of the box and you can easily inject your

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:15,540
own data local into providers of your root module where you define which locale your app should use.

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,120
And this will control how the data is actually formatted automatically for you.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:29,410
For this all to work there's one important part and that can be found here under choosing date implementation

31
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,680
and date format settings.

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:39,330
Now you can actually choose from different ways of how the data should be formatted and handled.

33
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,360
There you see we basically have to map native state module which is built into material angular material

34
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,590
where it only end USA supporters but which also has no dependencies.

35
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,530
Or you use them more powerful math moment date module where you have more support locales.

36
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,890
You can click this link to actually see more about that.

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,090
Here are all the locales that are supported but where you also have a separate dependency moment Chase

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,130
which is an external library you need to install in this case.

39
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:19,060
No I will go with the native date module but in the end all comes down to just importing this module

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,430
which will do in a second possibly then setting this data locale which will only work with momentary.

41
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:32,680
Because the native one only supports us and then automatically getting dates which are formatted for

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,720
the language you're using.

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,470
Now important you can also go as far as customizing the parts and display formats entirely.

44
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,330
It does it's highly wants though and not something I'll cover here but in the end you can essentially

45
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,250
write your own data that if you want.

46
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,120
However I will not do this here if you want though.

47
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,350
Here's an example in the code.

48
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,470
It shows you how to set this all up and how you could create your own date parser.

49
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,150
Before we go to add once though let's simply add a date picker shall we.

50
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,930
So to do so let's go back right to the start and let's have a look at this example.

51
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,820
Let's add a new date picker before this button here.

52
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,790
And let's add Matt for field as a wrapper.

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,950
So this component which gives us access to floating labels and so on.

54
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,290
Let's add our normal input here where I will add math input this directive to turn it into material

55
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:40,770
input that works nicely together with Matt for field and then lets also add a placeholder maybe choose

56
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:49,600
a date or maybe your birth date because let's say Dad is what I want to fetch your birth date like this

57
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,690
with that if we save this and we go back to our application we got this input which is a normal input

58
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,200
and no date picker.

59
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,190
It'll stay in normal input but our goal is to automatically populated with a date value we pick from

60
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,570
that date picker.

61
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:15,390
For that I will add a new component right below the input and that's the Matt date picker toggle that's

62
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,510
the button which opens the date picker.

63
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,700
You can see it here.

64
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,330
Now for this to work we need a date picker too.

65
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,600
And as you see the two interact by adding a four property binding to the toggle where we point to some

66
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,110
local reference which is assigned to the actual date picker.

67
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,340
So let's implement this pattern here too.

68
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,980
Let's add Matt date picker.

69
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,130
This is the actual date picker which is hidden initially.

70
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,080
Let's give it a local reference.

71
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,790
You can use any name you want.

72
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:52,310
And let's then bind the 4 property of the date picker toggle component and set it equal to this local

73
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,510
reference here.

74
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,670
Now if we save this it wouldn't run though the reason for this is very simple.

75
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,900
We haven't added an import to our material module so let's simply do that.

76
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,580
Let's add the Matt date picker module here.

77
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,310
Now let's add it to build imports and exports.

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,970
So here I'll add Matt Dave picker module split this up over multiple lines.

79
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,960
So here's Matt date picker module.

80
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,120
Add it to both imports and exports.

81
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:32,540
With that if we go back to our application I still get an error and the error is that no provider for

82
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,550
date adapter was found.

83
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,590
Now as I said there are two built in ones you can choose from but we have to choose at least one or

84
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,080
just one.

85
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,580
So here I'll use the native one.

86
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:52,670
So mapped native Dave module and this should now also be added to imports and exports so that the picker

87
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,250
can format the date automatically.

88
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:02,620
Now it redirect me to where it comes let me quickly go back to sign up and on this page we now get the

89
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,160
toggle button.

90
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,020
But if you click on it we get no associated input.

91
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,630
Well that makes sense because how Or should the date picker know where to enter to date.

92
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,910
We actually picked.

93
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:22,570
We want to intrude into dis input but it can't assume that it's the next input which is next to a toddler

94
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,000
or something like that.

95
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,460
We have to tell it explicitly of course and this is a good behavior.

96
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:35,560
Otherwise it might get really hard to control more complex forms to tell it dead it just does input.

97
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:42,560
We add a directive to this input which is matched date picker distractive stand alone doesn't work.

98
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,260
We need to bind to a property of that directive which is also called Matt.

99
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,180
Picker.

100
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,560
And as a side note this is important.

101
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,330
Matt Dave picker is directive coming from the Dave picker module.

102
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:02,710
It's not a property of input it's a directive and this directive happens to have a property named Max

103
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,330
date picker to which we bind with this syntax.

104
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,580
So now with that we can assign a value here and that should be the picker.

105
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,850
So this local reference with that to toggle is connected to the Speaker and his input is connected to

106
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,040
the value this pic or spits out.

107
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,110
We now save doesn't go back to our application and I click the toggle again.

108
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:33,370
Now it works and if I enter something it's kind of NTSA say it into our input but then it doesn't right.

109
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:41,220
This looks really actually the I Can the toggle is positioned right below the value simply because we

110
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:48,690
can configure this toggle and we can add Matt suffix to position this as a suffix at the end of the

111
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,440
input.

112
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,310
If we add this the toggle switches to the right.

113
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,290
And now this looks much better and we can choose a date.

114
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,640
Now let's say we want to restrict the range of dates the user can pick from because maybe we only want

115
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:11,250
to accept people that are at least 18 years old they shouldn't be able to pick a date dead would make

116
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,700
them younger than that.

117
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,020
How can we restrict the range.

118
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,060
Let's take a look.
