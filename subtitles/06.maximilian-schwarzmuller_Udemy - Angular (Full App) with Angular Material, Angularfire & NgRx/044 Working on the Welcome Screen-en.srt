1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,910
We were at quite a bit on the navigation.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,760
Now when I work on the Welcome screen before we continue with the more complex training screens for

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:16,640
the welcome screen I got a little bit of code attached which you can find at Hetchy this video which

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,780
I'll just put into this.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,640
Tim I'll follow the welcome component HVM I'll file here this.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,550
Now this is some aged e-mail with some text some passwords as you commonly see it on such Starling's

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,450
pages.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,410
And if we have a look at it it looks all right but especially on bigger screens.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,290
It looks really ugly.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,310
So we can improve the styling and I will do this entirely with flex layout.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,410
We actually won't have to put too much work into that.

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,660
One thing that would be nice would be to center it I guess.

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:58,610
So we should set up the layout and my idea is that the items are sitting next to each other on bigger

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,570
screens and below each other on smaller ones.

15
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:09,800
So we could say the default set up is Cullin to well just as it is right now to position them beneath

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,930
each other.

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,730
Then I want to add F X.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:21,140
Lay out a line and set this to center centered centered on both the cross and the main axis or other

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,460
way around main and cross.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
So that this is all centered.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,870
Finally we got this welcome class.

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,390
So why don't we use it as is.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,920
C S S class here and set text align to center so that the text is also centered and not sitting on the

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,500
left.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Does looks good on small screens on bigger ones.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,750
Why don't we position this next to each other though.

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:52,420
That is why we can use the responsive features of flex layout to change column to row on bigger screens.

28
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,360
And this is a little challenge or task for you.

29
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,010
You learned how to do that or at least alter where to look.

30
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,480
It's all about adding some notation to ethics layout.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,470
You saw this earlier in the course and I want you to basically add a second eFax layout where you set

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,160
this to row four big or very big screens.

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,430
Try this on your own.

34
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,230
I'll show you my solution in a few seconds.

35
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,680
Where is accessible.

36
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,670
Let's try it together.

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,920
I'll add a second eFax lay out and set it to row.

38
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,290
Now if I do this and leave it like this then as you can see the second one wins on all devices.

39
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,060
However I only want this to be the case on very big screens not on small ones.

40
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:51,690
So what I'll do is all actually ethics lay out and I'll add G.T. LG here as notation.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,270
This means four screens greater than large as to find by the break points by just peg edge you can find

42
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,670
the exact breakpoints in their documentation only for large or very large screens.

43
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,740
We'll switch to a Rollei and if I save this and go back you see everything is positioned beneath each

44
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,480
hover.

45
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,990
If I entry's the size here and I have to increase it even more than I have a whale here when I'm Sundin's

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:26,630
all quickly sumed out self-assumed out and a Danding Trista's then a chum's next to each other.

47
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,930
And actually since I have to surmount quite a bit I guess we can make the chomp a bit earlier.

48
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,060
So let me go back in here.

49
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:44,120
And let me make this jump already ofter medium sized screens so greater than medium sized will switch

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,180
to row then we still have everything we need over here.

51
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:55,080
But if I increase the size here it goes next to each other very close next to each other though.

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,650
So why don't we also add F X lay out Gap.

53
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,430
You're also only for a greater than medium sized screens of let's say 20 pixels.

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,360
If we do that then we got no gap here.

55
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,910
It's the same as before.

56
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,700
But for very big screens you see there's a little bit of spacing in between.

57
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,960
So I guess this is a setup with which we can live and which looks all right with that we can leave the

58
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,860
welcome component.

59
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:29,090
We had a little bit of more practice of the Flex layout classes which I guess are pretty straightforward

60
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,470
to use once you use them a little bit more.

61
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,390
And with that let's continue onto the training components.
