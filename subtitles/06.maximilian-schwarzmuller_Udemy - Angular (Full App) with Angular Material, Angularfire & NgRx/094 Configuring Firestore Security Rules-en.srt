1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,860
Back in the firebase console Let's go back to fire story.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,450
And they are under rules.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,370
Let's work on security rules.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,620
Right now everyone has access and we get a warning about this because we simply allow read and right

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,070
now I want to allow read and write it.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:29,010
And we do this by adding a colon and then if if request off is not equal to null.

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,520
Now what does this strange syntax mean.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,400
It means you should allow read and write access

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,600
the incoming request has an authenticated user deaths.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,260
Basically the information hidden in that of property if that is not null.

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,690
So if the authentication status is not null which it would be if authentication fails then we should

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,300
get read and write access.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:06,270
If I publish this I can go back to my app and log in.

14
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,270
And now you see

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:21,790
that I still can't access everything now isn't that strange because I personally would expect that an

16
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:30,110
error or because now we turned on protection on fire store so that unauthenticated users can't access

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,640
this and still it works.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,030
Now you could of course argue yeah we did just log it right.

19
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:47,330
True but behind the scenes it actually requires us to send this token to fire store to work.

20
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,200
And it turns out that it automatically does this for us.

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,830
Angular fired does this for us if we use angle of fire to manage authentication too.

22
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,660
So just because we signed in with email and password meant that angle of fire or behind the scenes also

23
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,970
sports dead token which we received Madchester token.

24
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:17,660
As I mentioned when I showed you that slide and attaches it to outgoing requests so that we can work

25
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,020
with the database just as we did before.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,080
But the major difference is that it's now protected that an authorized access is now not possible.

27
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:36,620
And I can prove this point with the unoffended can an access that's not allowed by temporarily disabling

28
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,870
our off guard so that we can access the training pages without being authentic data.

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,640
So I'd just returned TRUE in there only for a second.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,940
And that will also go to my office service and connect this log out method to reach out to my angle

31
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,850
of fire of package to the off part and call sign out here.

32
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,510
This will get rid of the token and everything.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,740
So let me quickly show this to you if I now save this and they go back to my app all still see all these

34
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:18,320
things and it's a bit broken so let me quickly log in here so that I am treated as locked in and hit.

35
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,910
Log out.

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,360
Now everything is clear.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,020
And now we get an error or missing or insufficient permissions.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,260
We get that because we've got an ongoing subscription.

39
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:35,090
And if I access the trading page now and we got the app therefore And I'm not offended that we also

40
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,000
get that error because we're not locked in.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,440
So disproofs my point now I'll go back to the guard and reverse the code and we will have to do some

42
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,710
work regarding the log out to work correctly because even with the rewards code will face an issue.

43
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,460
If I do log in now then everything works but if I log out we still get that error and I don't want to

44
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,580
get that error.

45
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,070
So we'll work on that and we'll track all of state differently.

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,830
But the key takeaway is we got protection now and the whole behind the scenes stuff regarding our syndication

47
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,880
with the token and so on is managed for us.
