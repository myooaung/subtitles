00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.830

We added a checkbox in the last lecture Let's now finish up the form and the first thing is the positioning



2

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.380

of the submit button.



3

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.790

I want to add some margin so that it's not sitting directly next to or below this checkbox.



4

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.190

Now we could of course manually add a c as S class but we can also use a convenience helper directive



5

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.730

provided by the flex layout package.



6

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.130

If you click on static API there if you scroll down you don't just have a container and child element



7

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.840

properties you can use.



8

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.760

You also get these F X lay out gap you're on the container.



9

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.260

So there we can go back to the form where we have ethics lay out and lay out a line.



10

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.320

We can also add lay out GEP and set this to 10 pixels.



11

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.930

We now save this and we go back to our application.



12

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.920

Now you see there's some spacing between all these controls and this ensures that the bottom has a little



13

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.020

bit more distance.



14

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.620

Of course if you don't want to have a gap between all these controls which I think is quite nice though



15

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.700

especially if we have errors you don't want that.



16

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.380

You can of course go back to a solution where you simply add some CSSA to this button only.



17

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.620

Now the other part I want to do is I want to make sure that this is disabled if the entire form is invalid.



18

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660

Now we got access to the entire form.



19

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.410

It's stored in this f local reference here on the form element.



20

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:38.520

Now we can use that to disable this but conditionally by binding to the disabled property off the button



21

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.090

element and setting is to disable if f which refers to the entire form is invalid.



22

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.540

So if this invalid property This form has is true now with that if we save this that reloads you see



23

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.530

the button is disabled and I can click it and only if I enter a valid email Avello password and pick



24

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.710

a valid birth date as well as agreed to the terms and conditions only then I can submit the form.



25

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.750

And this is our Sign-Up form.



26

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.620

Finished it of course doesn't actually sign us up.



27

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.270

That is something which will come later or from the Anglo material perspective.



28

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.200

This is looking good so far.



29

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.730

And I think we're ready to move on and also work on some other components.



30

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.460

Why don't we turn our heads towards the slash log in route next.
