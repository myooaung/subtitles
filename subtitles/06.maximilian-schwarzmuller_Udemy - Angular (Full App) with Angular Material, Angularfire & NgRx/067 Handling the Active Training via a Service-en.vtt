00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.230

Let's make sure we use the data off de-selected training as we're storing it in the training service



2

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.120

in our current training component.



3

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.270

So we select the training and store it and running exercise.



4

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.390

We do this year.



5

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.940

We actually even emit an event whenever we choose a new training.



6

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.150

Now we need to use that information in the current training component.



7

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.340

Keep in mind we'll load the current training component whenever we start a new training.



8

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.170

So how do we extract that data.



9

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.450

And they're now in the current training component.



10

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.560

I first of all want to inject the training service.



11

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:50.370

So besides injecting the mat dialogue thing here also inject private training service of type training



12

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.280

service and that of course is something which you all need to add here as an import training service



13

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250

from the training service file.



14

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.160

Once you did at this and we therefore injected it here we can initialize our component with the selected



15

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.360

training.



16

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.650

So what does this mean.



17

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.020

This means that here in central Well these steps by which we want to increment this actually you should



18

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.610

depend on the duration of the selected training.



19

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.000

It might also make sense to outputs the name of the current training.



20

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.720

So here right now we only output a motivation in that phrase and the progress of course we could also



21

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.400

put the name of the selected exercise.



22

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.860

So let's start with the steps here and start or reassumed timer.



23

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.050

I need access to the selective training in training service.



24

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:59.870

I currently Hightower's as a private property so I should add a Meffert get running exercise where I



25

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:08.810

return a new object which simply is a copy of this running exercise again to make sure I can't mutate



26

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.090

this from outside of the service.



27

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.630

Now I can call get running exercise to get data about the running exercise and it will do so in start



28

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.380

or resume timer in there.



29

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.410

I need to calculate a step.



30

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.040

Let's say we want to increment progress by one and not by five.



31

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.110

This means we need 100 steps to get to 100 percent.



32

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.080

And does this set in stone because the Met progress spinner works in a way that it goes from 0 to 100.



33

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.400

What we can change is how quickly it updates from one progress step to the next so step doesn't necessarily



34

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.020

have to be one second.



35

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.630

If our training takes 40 seconds one step should be 100 divided by 30 or actually since this is in milliseconds



36

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.490

100 divided by 30 times 1000.



37

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:11.740

So if our duration of the exercise is 30 then we want to execute this process 100 divided by 30 times



38

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.850

we're actually since this is milliseconds it's 100 divided by 30 times 1000.



39

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:30.030

In other words a step can be taken from the training service and there from the running exercise by



40

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.580

accessing the duration of that exercise and dividing it by 100 because 100 is our fixed maximum percentage



41

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.980

since we have multi seconds we multiply this with 1000.



42

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.200

And now we get the step value.



43

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.610

So now I can use Stapp instead of 1000 to have a duration a progress spinner that takes the duration



44

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.880

off the exercise into account let's try it out.



45

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.950

Let's go back to the running application quickly log in with some random data.



46

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.110

Select the exercise like trenches and click start.



47

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.250

And now you see it updates like this.



48

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.060

If I hit stop here and quit and I select a different exercise.



49

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.610

It's now way slower because touch chose which I select the tear.



50

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.520

If you have a look at the trading service actually have a much longer duration.



51

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.520

These are free minutes instead of 30 seconds.



52

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.250

So this is working now.



53

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.780

What I also need to ensure is that when we stop the training or when it finishes naturally that we also



54

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.340

communicate that to the training service and store the exercise there either as cancelled or as successfully



55

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.550

completed.



56

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.750

This is something we'll turn our heads to in the next lecture.
