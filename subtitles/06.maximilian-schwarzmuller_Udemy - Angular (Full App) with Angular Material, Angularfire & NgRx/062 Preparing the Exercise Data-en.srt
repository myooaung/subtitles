1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,020
We worked on a syndication Let's close this chapter for now.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,440
We'll reopen it later once we add a server and let's work on the training now.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,750
Now in training section we also of course should work with data we should store exercises done by the

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,330
user so that we can output them under past exercises.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,720
So four days of first of all add a model next to my training component and I'll name it exercise not

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,400
the model that's the Fall name because in there I'm going to define how exercise should look like and

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,730
you're of course free to the finders in whichever way you want.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm going to expert a interface named exercise and exercise in my application should have an ID which

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,370
is of type string.

10
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,470
You could of course also make it of type number but I want to have a well human readable ID.

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,080
And in general have an idea that all that can consist of characters.

12
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,600
It should have a name of course which we understand something like crunches and so on duration because

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,700
not all exercises take equally long and that can be a number.

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,450
Let's say in seconds it's up to you how are you to find out calories burned if you make it over the

15
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,480
full duration.

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,020
That could also be a number or should be a number probably.

17
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:32,400
Now also if you finished or canceled the exercise a date so basically the date when you started it of

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,360
type date should be optional though because not all exercise is half that.

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,200
If we set up an exercise to populate our dropdown it's not going to have a date and you could create

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,240
a separate model but we can also mix it really nice and a state to state all is optional and this actually

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,240
is a type of assignments in Texas which you might not know you can assign a couple of possible values

22
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:08,860
as a type because I want to have a completed or canceled as a state so I'm accepting two strings or

23
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,260
now.

24
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,200
This should not be a colon.

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,080
But this pipe symbol so state deceiver a string of text completed a string with text.

26
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,280
Canceled may be spelled correctly though or.

27
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,570
Now this is my exercise Mandala which I want to use now.

28
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,590
I'll also need a service where we manage all exercises we know as well as our completed and canceled

29
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,620
exercises.

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,850
So for that I'm going to add a new fall next to this model we just created which will name training

31
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,150
service.

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,730
You could of course also name it.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,250
Exercise starts here.

34
00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:00,890
I'm going to export a class training service where I want to manage all the exercises we know as well

35
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,730
as all the exercise to be completed and so on.

36
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:12,320
I'll start with a property named away lable exercises which is of type exercise so make sure to import

37
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,420
dad from that model of fall we just created of type exercise.

38
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,440
Air raid though not a single one.

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,920
And here I want to create a couple of exercises we will start with.

40
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,170
So which are available in our app.

41
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:33,270
You can of course create your own exercises and find this to your needs.

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:42,290
Attached to this video you'll find this aere or these objects of predefined exercises with various durations

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,550
in seconds and the calories you burn during this duration.

44
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:55,880
So this is now the first thing we can use in conjunction with angular material in our new training component.

45
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,010
We hard code different training.

46
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,950
We have what we can now connect this to the way that all exercises of our training service.

47
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,550
Here's your challenge.

48
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,220
Try this on your own in the next lecture.

49
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,380
We'll do it together.
