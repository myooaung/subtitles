1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,840
We add that the toolbar and the side.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,830
Now it's time to make our website responsive.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,770
And for that we can have a look at the flex layout package again.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:18,210
Thus far we had a look at the static API with ethics lay out lay out a line gap and we also used epix

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:25,060
flex we didn't use order offset or align or fill because well you really need these you really need

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,590
to change the order.

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,590
But what I want to do now is I want to have a look at the responsive API.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:38,290
This allows us to annotate all these directives with been working with with responsive directives like

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:47,710
X asked for on small devices or lower then small so to only apply something on very small devices so

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:55,450
annotate all the static API directives with these responsive directives to only apply them on certain

11
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,460
screens.

12
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,820
Let me show you what I mean in our example here we get if we go back to the stedding API for a second

13
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,970
we get these helper directives at the bottom ethics height and show which determines whether something

14
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,480
is winnable or not.

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,960
Now we could simply hide this entire block here on the toolbar on small or very small devices and hide

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,800
the menu button on bigger devices.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,620
This way the site nav could only be open on smaller ones and toolbar navigation would only be shown

18
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,000
on bigger ones.

19
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,480
We can of course do this by adding ethics show and hide so we can go to the day if that wraps our navigation

20
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,880
items and add ethics height.

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,090
Now if I save this and I go back to my page it disappears.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,600
The navigation is gone.

23
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,380
Now that's a first step.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,160
I want to hide it only on small devices of course.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,290
Now we can add this responsive API.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,670
We can add a dot and now annotate this with any of the response of directives for example x x which

27
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,580
means only apply ethics high on very small screens and you can go back to documentation to see that

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,230
definition for this under responsive API.

29
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:22,410
You'll see that access simply applies does media query where it says only four screens to go up to 600

30
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,370
pixels.

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,160
The rule where this was added will apply.

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,580
So in our case only four screens up to five hundred ninety nine pixels.

33
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,840
They will be hidden or this layer will be hidden.

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,070
This navigation list.

35
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,520
So if we go back to our app we can absolutely see the menu here.

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,790
But if I switch to mobile mode it's gone.

37
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,140
And of course the same for different mobile phones.

38
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,360
Now this shows what I mean.

39
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,650
But we a.

40
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,790
We get no menu here but we got it here.

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,460
Now let's do the opposite for the button for the menu button.

42
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm going to grab this and now on this day which wraps the button we can add it but of course you want

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,700
to hide that on everything but very small screens.

44
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:22,150
So we could say F X s m f x hide M D and all these classes you see here.

45
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:32,640
So we have to do that for large and extra large to ethics hide large ethics hide x l by doing this.

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,580
If we go back we see no menu button here.

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,980
And if I shrink the screen it's Stehr if we go to smaller devices.

48
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,590
Actually it appears at 1030 already because sumed in if I were to soome out again.

49
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:58,060
To my normal resolution then this would not appear and would only break at 600 pixels.

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,870
So all the 600 pixels and smaller we get this button.

51
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,510
Let me Sumant again though.

52
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,910
So this is our responsive set up here where we only get this menu bar on small screens.

53
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,680
Assigning to classes like this is a bit cumbersome.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,590
Know what we could do is we could add F X show X s.

55
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,690
If we do this it's always visible though.

56
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,430
So this doesn't help us here.

57
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,460
Instead we can use a number a helper class.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,630
We all get lower and greater than classes and we want to say this should be hidden.

59
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:40,370
So ethics height for everything which is greater then extra small does is referring to this helper class

60
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,030
here.

61
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,330
And with this set up we now get the same effect as before but with less code.

62
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,920
And now we got a responsive navigation here.

63
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,240
Still of course the side they have a separate empties.

64
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,740
So that is something I want to work on next.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,460
And then we should all have a look at how we can actually split this app component up into smaller more

66
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,450
focused subcomponents.

67
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's work on all these things over the next ELECTRESS.
