00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.860

Let's add a dialogue to our application let's add it to the curred training as you saw in the last video



2

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.040

we need to inject a special component or a special component a special class to do that.



3

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.610

So bind it to a dialogue property here using that shortcut in typescript where does this automatically.



4

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.770

Well add it to class property by adding this accessor in front of the argument name and the type is



5

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.120

Matt dialogue which you must import from at a singular material.



6

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.860

Now if we do it like that it would fail.



7

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.420

We still also need to provide a module that didn't change.



8

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:52.660

So here we will add Matt dialog module to import and then to the imports array and to the exports array



9

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.120

and this makes sure that we can use that dialog injection.



10

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.760

Now with that we're injecting dialog here and in Indiana I want to show a dialog whenever we click on



11

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.610

stop.



12

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.370

So I will call clear into well but then it will reach out to the dialog and call open and now we can



13

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.540

configure it.



14

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.240

And here we actually as you can see an example we actually point to some component.



15

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.850

This one and the example which should give you dialog its content.



16

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:36.250

So we still create a component with a template for that but we're invoking it programmatically not directly



17

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.100

from the template not through NGF or anything like that but programmatically.



18

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.600

Therefore let's create this component all created next to the current training component and name it



19

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.970

stop training dot component dot TS That's the fall name.



20

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.810

And then there are expert A-class stop training component and it is going to be our regular angular



21

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.800

component and you could have used DC lighting created of course I will add the ADD component decorator



22

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.480

which we need to import with him or each component from at a singular core.



23

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.380

Now in a year we need selector.



24

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.010

So let's name it app.



25

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.440

Stop training.



26

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.420

We need a template.



27

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.700

And I'll use the inline template here because it's going to be a really really simple one you could



28

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.800

use a more complex one of course.



29

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.200

Ultimately at age 1 Tegra I say Are you sure like death.



30

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.380

Now to make the title look good.



31

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.550

There are a couple of helper components you can use like Matt dialog title which you add directly to



32

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.590

D.H. 1 or whatever you have.



33

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.680

Tech does well basically tell aler material where to position is in the dialog that is created.



34

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.390

And below that I'll add a component.



35

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.390

Matt dialogue actions you might recall that from the card where we all had such actions section and



36

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:18.560

then there we add normal buttons with Mat button directives or mat rased buttons whatever you want and



37

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:27.930

hearable say yes and then I'll add a second button where I say no and we can now add a special directive



38

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.940

to these buttons.



39

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.170

The mat dialogue close directive which also has an alternative set up where you bind a value to it a



40

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.690

value that will be transferred to the component that opened dialog.



41

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.400

So here you could set these two false and in the first case you could set this to true to check which



42

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.400

option to use or actually chose.



43

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.880

It doesn't have to be a boolean though can be any data.



44

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.480

So this is our dialog thus far.



45

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.450

I'll dive deeper into it in a second.



46

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.340

Let's make sure that we can actually open it.



47

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.290

Now to omit we first of all have to register it.



48

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:17.770

So in the app module not any material one in the app module all at my stop training component.



49

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.320

Make sure to also add an import pointing to the file we just created.



50

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.450

And now here's something special.



51

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.140

Since that component is going to create it automatically encode at runtime.



52

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.750

We have to add it to some special array here in the app module which you very very rarely use.



53

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.820

Entry components.



54

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.300

This is an array where you have to add all components that are never instantiated by using their selector



55

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.120

in your template nor by routing.



56

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.900

In other words angular has no way of finding out whether this component is going to get used and when



57

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.220

this is going to be the case with entry components you tell angular be prepared to use it.



58

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.690

And that's all angular is now prepared and doesn't throw an error when you open it programmatically.



59

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.320

Now we want to open it programmatically from within the current training component here.



60

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.310

We want to open our stop training component.



61

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:30.590

So let's first of all import this year let's import stop training component from them and now it's in



62

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.290

the stop training component file and let's pass this as an argument to open.



63

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.000

Now before we do anything else let's save this and see if it works.



64

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.120

For click on start and then don't stop we indeed see our dialogue.



65

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.810

Cool.



66

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:56.420

Now the thing that's missing is how we hand the data we get back and also how we theoretically could



67

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.450

get data into the dialogue in case you want to show something you could for example show the name of



68

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.790

the currently running training or something else.



69

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.820

So how do we do this.



70

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.580

Let's take a look in the next lecture.
