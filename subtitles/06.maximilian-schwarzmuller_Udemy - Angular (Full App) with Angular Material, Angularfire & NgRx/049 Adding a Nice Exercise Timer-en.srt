1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,980
We have the basic Spener but a lot of functionality is still missing.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,840
First of all let's ensure that it doesn't go above 100.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,990
If it does then we want to cancel it to be able to cancel the entire Well we need to store it first.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,110
So at a time or property which is a number and then I can set at this time are equal to set intraweb

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,830
does shows an error here but actually will work said entrail returns us a number an ID which we can

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,770
use together with to clear in the world method which is provided by Javascript.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,020
So inside of the method we execute every second.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,650
I want to check if this progress is greater or equal than 100 which is our exit condition.

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,110
We certainly want to stop when this is reached.

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,840
In this case we want to call clear into Will and again this is not a method provided by Engler or by

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,790
angular material.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,440
It's a default javascript method and we pass this timer as an argument.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,180
Now this will stop it whenever we reach 100.

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,350
And to ensure that we see this a bit quicker I'll actually increment by 24 now so that we only take

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,590
5 seconds.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,630
So now you see it grows and grows and grows and the number stops.

17
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,330
So this is now working.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,210
That's decrease this to 5 again.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:29,680
But let's now also ensure that we can click that stop button and pause and ultimately cancel this training.

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,830
Now to Stop all.

21
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,670
First of all at a click listener and execute on stop your or any method name you want of course.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,980
Let's add the on stop method and then let's run clear interval.

23
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,730
This timer This should immediately stop the timer.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,980
So if we start to training here and I had stop doesn't continue.

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,440
Now what I want to do is I want to show a dialog to the user where I ask him whether he really wants

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,400
to quit.

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,110
And if the user cancels then we should receive the timer.

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,410
If the user confirms then we should continue and go back to the previous page.

29
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,470
So for that let's have a look at the official documentation and let's have a look at pop ups and modals

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
and their dialogue.

31
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,380
Sounds about right.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,590
The dialog allows us to enter something here for example and click that and that is the actual dialogue.

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,300
And you can populate this with whatever you want and you don't need to enter a name or anything like

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,480
that.

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,670
First of course you're really flexible about how this dialogue should look like.

36
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,610
The interesting part here in the example code is that we don't see anything that would have been in

37
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:59,470
that dialogue because dialogue is created all in code daises word dialogue is created with dialog open

38
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,120
after injecting mat dialogue.

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,650
This is super important.

40
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,970
The dialogue is a special material component.

41
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:14,860
It's not added to the template as we did it with all abro components we used thus far.

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,790
Instead it's invoked programmatically.

43
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,520
Let's take a closer look.
