1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,580
With basic authentication and self-education even committer added let's make sure we redirect the user

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,750
whenever he the dictates or locks out and that we protect route's which should only be accessible to

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,610
authenticated users.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:25,200
Regarding the redirection we can actually do that in the off service we can inject services into services

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,830
and what to inject the angular router into the off service to be able to inject the service into a service

6
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:40,050
we need to decorate this of service with the injectable decorator which you have to import from angular

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,720
CT.

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,050
So you should import injectable from at a singular slash chord like that.

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:55,260
Now we can add a constructor to this of service and received the router you could simply use the type

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,320
router and router is imported from the angular package too.

11
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,000
So you add a second import where you import the router for on at angular router.

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:13,120
With that we got access to the router which allows us to route or navigate around programmatically.

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:21,250
So here when we were just a user we can call this router navigate and there we actually have to pass

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,030
an array of Route segments.

15
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,960
I only got one segment though training.

16
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:35,620
Now I will copy that code and run the same after log in and for log out I want to go to the logon page

17
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,020
instead.

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,810
Now we get duplicate code and register user and log in so we can actually add method to your private

19
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,590
method.

20
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,420
I'll name it off successfully or whatever you want to do.

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,780
Here I will copy the code where we emit our off Change event with true as a payload and where we go

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:07,930
to the training route or at this code here and now and log in I simply called this off successfully

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,430
and do the same here in Rochester user.

24
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,880
With that change we should be redirected whenever we log in.

25
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,370
Let's try this out.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,850
Let's go to the log in page and enter a value here.

27
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,590
And we're on the exercise page.

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,310
Awesome.

29
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,630
You also see the side nav adjusted.

30
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,080
Now that's one thing I also want to redirect.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,630
If we log out and for today we need to hook up to the log out button.

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,820
So for us we're going to go to the hatter component.

33
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:47,080
And on this lock out button here I'll add a click listener.

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,020
And to make sure we all get this hand I can all add a quick inline style where to set the cursor to

35
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,700
pointer.

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,160
Of course you could also use to see us fall for that.

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:06,180
So you're all execute on log out and all I'm going to do the same in deciding that later for now any

38
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:14,000
header component let's add is on log out Methot may be here before on the stroy to have all logical

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,740
order I guess from on in it over our efforts to destroy.

40
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:27,890
And then on log out let's call the off service and there the log out method without arguments.

41
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,910
Now implement the same in the side nav list here.

42
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:45,000
There are all the add on log out and execute this off service log out log in log out and in the template

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,140
off that component.

44
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:54,070
I'm going to need to add a click listener whenever we well do click this button.

45
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,070
The problem just is this button already has a click listener on clothes.

46
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,780
Maybe we should call on log out here instead.

47
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,690
And back in the typescript file I will actually also call this on close here.

48
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:17,110
We'll actually do this first with this and all files saved.

49
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,720
If we go back and reload the app.

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:30,290
And I hope the side menu and I log in and redirect it if I click log out I redirect it back to the sign

51
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,850
in page.

52
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,720
This is working the route protection is missing.

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,830
Let's add this in the next lecture.
