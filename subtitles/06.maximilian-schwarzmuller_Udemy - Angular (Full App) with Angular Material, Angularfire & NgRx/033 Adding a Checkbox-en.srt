1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,750
We added the date picker.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:10,970
Let's now add a number map for field for the last control I want to add to does sign up for.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,650
And that should be a checkbox which ensures that the user confirmed the terms and agreements of our

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,070
page.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's say a pretty common use case.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Now for that we got a separate component which we can use.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,010
The mad dash checkbox component.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,100
Now we of course need to add an import to material module for that.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:38,570
So from an angle or material I'm going to import the matte checkbox module here.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:45,980
Wrap that and add it to both imports and exports of course so that it's a way label everywhere.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:53,380
Now with that added We can use it in the sign up component and Matt checkbox takes the label that should

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,310
be displayed next to it between the opening and closing tag.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:04,780
So maybe agreed to terms and conditions and of course you could put some link in there which actually

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,510
links to your terms and conditions page.

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,770
Now by default the label here is positioned offered a checkbox or put in other words the checkbox is

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,520
positioned in front of the label.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,090
You can change this behavior though.

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,890
But before we do that that's safe doesn't go back to your app and you will see that we get an error

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,250
because the checkbox actually is not trapped by a foreign field because it's no input.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,830
And if you remember the documentation of math form field you probably will recall that it only listed

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:42,610
inputs and text areas as developed children as well as other components like mad Aromat hint they picker

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,260
which interact with the form feuilleton checkbooks however works stand standalone.

23
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,580
So if you save it like this now it works and you see the checkbox here you now all see that the checkbox

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,700
is centered because we had our eFax lay out a line set to center here for all the inputs.

25
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,070
For me that's fine.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,230
We can't absolutely centredness here.

27
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:12,400
Now back to that label thing though if you go back you can add something to that checkbox.

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,400
You can at the label position property binding and set this to before you save this.

29
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,200
Now the label is actually in front of the checkbox.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,240
So this is the alternative you have.

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm going to switch back but I want to bring this to your attention.

32
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,720
You can change the positioning of the label now and back to the default where it comes after checkbox.

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,980
Now even though it's not wrap by Matt form field checkbooks is still compatible with Angey little forms.

34
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:49,710
So we can and we of course should still gift is Angi model and a name like agree maybe and we can also

35
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,620
add the required validator to make sure that this is actually required and the whole form is only deemed

36
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,510
valid if we did add it.

37
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,010
By the way we should also add and model to the date picker input here.

38
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:12,200
So there at the end I'll add and you model and the name of birthdate.

39
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,450
I will also add required here.

40
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,270
Would that be added validation to all our fields.

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,110
Now we got our whole for belly data and controlled if I had to submit everything is invalid here.

42
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,300
As you can see still or automatically it gets some styling.

43
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:36,450
And if we have a look at the submitted form here on the value we can see a birth date email and password.

44
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,010
All of course MTV I do check is an assessment again.

45
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,440
Then on the newly submitted form we would see that it reset to truth.

46
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,580
So this works.

47
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,970
One important note I also want to share.

48
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,940
You can also change the theme of the checkbox so not just the position of the label but you can also

49
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:05,030
set a color property and set this to primary for example the default was excellent year so that the

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,820
checkbox wasn't is pink color.

51
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,200
Now it's actually in the primary purple color.

52
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,680
This is how we can set this all up.

53
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,090
Now let's finish up the form by improving the positioning of the submit button so that there's a little

54
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:26,220
bit more space and also making sure we can only click it if the entire form is valid.
