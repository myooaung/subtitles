00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.200

We're now using NTR X to manage our authentication status and this broke our app like here and the off



2

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.710

guard let's fix it let's fix it by using the energy or X store for this.



3

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.200

First of all import the store because we need to inject it.



4

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.320

So import store from at NCR X slash store.



5

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.720

I'll also need to import my state so import everything as from Route from my app reducer file.



6

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.370

This now allows me to inject the store into the off guard.



7

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.340

So here instead of the off service actually I'll simply inject my store of type store which is a generic



8

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.270

type that wraps my root state just as we did check it in other files.



9

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.260

Now I need to check whether we are often dictated or not.



10

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.710

And this can be done relatively easy.



11

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.030

It can activate.



12

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.170

We don't have to return true or false.



13

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.060

We can always return an observable that returns true or false.



14

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.070

So we could return this store select from root get is off.



15

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.490

This will in the end return true or false.



16

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.270

It will give us an observable which will give us true or false.



17

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.880

Now I can take does return function also put it into can load.



18

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.270

Now let's save this and let's work on the other parts like the Hetrick-Martin where we also relied on



19

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.470

getting this information from NCR X here from the office or is I mean I'm sorry.



20

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.680

So here are all the imports to work from at ngi our X store and just as before the patterns all it's



21

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.490

the same import everything as from Route from.



22

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.530

And now let's go up to our app whip's from to our app reducer like this.



23

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.270

Now we can inject that into this file here instead of the off service.



24

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.550

Actually our import store of type store which wraps from root state if you want then I'll remove the



25

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.820

import of off service I don't need it.



26

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.550

And the same is by the way true for my off guard I guess.



27

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.910

So here we can also get rid of the office service import.



28

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.800

So there's one thing but let's go back to the header.



29

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.870

We inject the officers no more but the store instead and therefore an engine in it.



30

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:36.920

I can now simply use this store select from root get is off to get that boolean and I want to store



31

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.590

it in my is off variable or property which will now turn into an observable.



32

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.230

That wraps a boolean and observable needs to be imported from our exchange as in the later versions.



33

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.270

Just our exchange says this is why I have these kinds of imports the same year subscription.



34

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.780

Also in late awareness of our exchanges.



35

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.440

So it should come from just Arctic's just like this even though we see an error message there.



36

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.260

So this is now my observable being imported and is of being an old storable knowable assigned us value



37

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.680

here in NZ and in it.



38

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.720

This is off dollar sign.



39

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.330

We'll hold the absorbable return by de-select function.



40

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.400

Now I can also remove on the stroy here also remove does implementation here.



41

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.100

And remove the import up there.



42

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.630

And I made one mistake.



43

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.210

I still need the off service here.



44

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.340

There was an error.



45

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.920

We still need to log our function all re-inject the office service don't remove it from that file of



46

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.270

service should be added at the import.



47

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.930

So this should not be removed because we need it.



48

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.340

Now the headers should be fixed though.



49

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.540

Let's now work on the site Neph there.



50

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.150

I also need to keep the service you on log out.



51

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.940

I won't need NGO undestroyed anymore though because I'll also soon inject to store and manage everything



52

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.070

from that.



53

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:13.990

So let's get rid of these imports and let's add two new imports just as in the file import store from



54

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.500

at Engy our X store and let's import our route reducer import everything else from Route from.



55

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.960

And now let's go up to the app.



56

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.970

Not app routing to the app reducer file like this.



57

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.690

Now we got the producer imported here too.



58

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.320

Now we can inject the story for that reason.



59

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.050

So let's add it let's add private store of type store which in the end will give us access to our route.



60

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:52.240

State and now with that an entry on it I again want to store this in a new is off property which is



61

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.830

an observable which will in the end give us a boolean.



62

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:07.590

So it does a generic type 2 and we import both subscription and absorbable from just our X J.S. So does



63

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.880

this how does should look like.



64

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:18.750

Now with that we got our obsolete engine in a method we can remove that implementation of on in it can



65

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.040

remove dead import.



66

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.270

Now with that import that we can go to Engy on in it and then use our view is all observable to store



67

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.530

this store select from root get is all this boolean.



68

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.600

Now of course we need to use the value in the component then.



69

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.590

So in the template there when we use is off we should change the async pipe and at the dollar sign and



70

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.270

that of course should be done for all occurrences occurrences of is of here and here and here and in



71

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.860

the case where we checked the opposite we need parentheses just as we needed it for is loading.



72

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.190

So with that in all cases in the template where we accessed is off.



73

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.980

I'm now using D-New is off which is an observable and the same in the header component and the header



74

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.890

component.



75

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.560

Whenever we check is off we should use is off with the async pipe.



76

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.230

And in cases where we check for the opposite we should wrap it in parentheses.



77

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.730

Now with that let's reload the application and see if it works.



78

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.260

Let's go to the training area.



79

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.140

This seems to fail.



80

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.470

Let's try again.



81

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.390

Logging in fails.



82

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.620

So we somehow are blocked from entering the training area.



83

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.910

Probably related to the off guard.



84

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.270

Let's take a look.



85

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.050

Keep in mind that observable Here is an ongoing construct.



86

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.990

It constantly emits new values.



87

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.850

The guard only runs once.



88

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.380

Though this is why we have to add a special operator here.



89

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.950

Take one now with angular five does won't work anymore.



90

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.550

Instead you should use pipe and Navier operator which we have to import.



91

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:10.880

So let's import both pipe and take from our exchange slash operators pipe simply allows us to apply



92

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.910

multiple operators to a given observable sequence.



93

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.620

And with this addition of piping take one we essentially tell Engy our ex or the guard here that we



94

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:28.070

want to finish off after getting one value take one simply takes one value and then closes this subscription



95

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.750

year and pipe doesn't even need to be imported.



96

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.840

Sorry my mistake just imports take.



97

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.900

So this out of the way now we successfully get there we can still log out and hopefully can log in again.



98

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.350

So this all works now to Garda's working.



99

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:51.650

And now your state is working as you can also see in our header and on the mobile view here too.



100

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.950

If I do log immobile



101

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.320

we all see that here.



102

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.890

This is adjusted too.



103

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.750

It is not all that working.



104

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.360

So with that we added all functionality.
