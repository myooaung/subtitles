00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.310

We get everything set up to start working on this app.



2

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.250

Let's start in the off part of it and there may be indeed.



3

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.870

Sign up for them.



4

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.740

Right now we only have Sign-Up works here in the sign up component or HQ mail file.



5

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.490

Now I want to add a whole form for that.



6

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.240

First of all add a second year to have it as a wrapper just so that I can later add some styling.



7

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.410

And then there I now want to have a form element a regular aged female element without an action because



8

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.550

we're going to handle the submission of that form differently.



9

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.460

Now in that form component here we want to have some inputs and inputs of course should be styled with



10

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.080

angular material and work in a material way.



11

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.190

Now in my sign up for him I went to grad to use her email password.



12

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.460

The birth date and that's all add a checkbox sold and we get the usual confirmation of our terms and



13

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.100

conditions and we only want to enable the form submission.



14

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.390

If all these inputs are valid.



15

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.520

So if they fulfill our validation criteria.



16

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.390

Now to add a form field we can of course add input here.



17

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.480

That's make it of type email and say we want to get user e-mail here.



18

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.680

Now if I say would like this and I go to slash sign up your well then we get this default HTL input



19

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.570

which doesn't look in a material way at all.



20

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.110

Let's go back to the components documentation and their form controls.



21

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.140

It's the very first part actually in here we get the input and a form field.



22

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.650

Now what's the difference let's start with the input which sounds about right.



23

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.730

You see my input is a directive that you can add to a normal input or text area which then gives it



24

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.800

the material the assigned look and feel like the floating up placeholder.



25

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.380

So the text here.



26

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.720

It also says that you should wrap it with a map form field.



27

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.750

This is the form field component here which is a wrapper that allows you to use your material to sign



28

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.400

input components in rapping form element.



29

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.150

Not so much because it's neither technically but because on that foreign field you can do cool things



30

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.680

like getting the labels here to float.



31

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.580

There's actually only works in conjunction with this not with input alone.



32

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.030

And if you scroll down you can also output hint labels and error messages.



33

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.730

So these are cool things.



34

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.630

You can expand the code sample here of course to see how it works.



35

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.150

Now let's go back to our Sign-Up component and let's the mad dash form field component here.



36

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.040

As I said this is a wrapper or so in there we definitely will put an import component which all set



37

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.310

to type email and where will anti-med in port directive to turn it into a input component which is control



38

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.970

through Anglo material or else or add a placeholder whereas say your email.



39

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.050

Now if we save this and we let this compile if we go back to the app we will just see an error that



40

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.640

mad form field is not a known element and we saw this error before.



41

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.220

So does time definitely go ahead and try fixing it on your own.



42

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.680

Where are you successful.



43

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.590

Let's have a look how do we fix this.



44

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.580

We have to go to the material module and add all the components we plan on using in this case the math



45

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.230

form field module and we can already add another one demand input module because we're going to use



46

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.000

that man's input directive.



47

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.900

So we will actually need both.



48

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.050

And we will add both to imports and exports.



49

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:06.390

So we look at demand for field marshal to both anti-med input module both like this.



50

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.170

Now we added for fuel and input module to both imports and exports.



51

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.740

And now if we go back to the application let us reload just looks much nicer and if we click on the



52

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.660

input the placeholders now floating up.



53

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.670

So we made our first important step.



54

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.900

Now let's add a second input.



55

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.120

Now I'm going to copy that first mad form field.



56

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.850

Place it right below it here I'll It's not the type to password.



57

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.910

To also get the user password and go to say your password as a placeholder here.



58

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.680

And with that if we save this and we go back we have this password input sits right next to the e-mail



59

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.260

though.



60

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.030

So it would be nice if we could all to control delay out of our page and not just add components.



61

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.160

Let's have a look at how we can use another package to control the layout of our components in the next



62

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.640

lecture.
