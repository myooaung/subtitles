00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.880

If we look around in our application we got a Sign-Up screen a log in screen and a training screen and



2

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.420

all of that.



3

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.730

Of course also in our response.



4

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.130

Let's lay out here.



5

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:25.430

Now we can start a training do our dialogue here where we want to quit or not and never quit or continue.



6

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.180

So this is all working.



7

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.500

Now one thing is missing.



8

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.210

Obviously if we quit here we don't see past exercises.



9

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.390

We got no content here.



10

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:45.070

Now before we add days where we will use a really cool and behind the scenes more complex to us not



11

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.240

really complex component.



12

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.610

I wonder why are all these things up with real data and use less dummy data.



13

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.620

Time to add some services and make sure that everything interacts smoothly once this is done we will



14

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.700

implement does table component and thereafter we'll all see how we can actually connect everything to



15

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.720

the Internet.



16

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.390

So the next module is time to wire everything up.
