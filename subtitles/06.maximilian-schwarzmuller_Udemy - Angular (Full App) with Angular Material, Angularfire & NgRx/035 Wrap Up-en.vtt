00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.410

By now you should have gotten a general idea of how you use angular material how you work with it and



2

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.440

what does behind the scenes.



3

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.730

A lot of things.



4

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.970

It's more than just some CSSA.



5

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.440

As you can clearly tell with all that floating these automatic errors and so much it's styling and there's



6

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.470

a full English component behind it angular component where you can bind properties to find the position



7

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.280

of the labels or the color of a button or angle or a component that automatically detects Weber input



8

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.690

is valid or not and changes to color and displays an error.



9

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.350

This is what angular material does for you and how you use it.



10

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.550

Important parts are that you always import the components you use into your material module.



11

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.550

And then of course that you use them as instructed in the official documentation which I can only encourage



12

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.090

you to look into.



13

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.050

I showed you where to find it how to read it because it's so important that you can really fine tune



14

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.020

your app to your needs.



15

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.920

We're not done of course though we only had a look at a couple of these components.



16

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.320

We haven't even touched on navigation toolbars and aside Nath.



17

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.930

These are all things we're going to do in the next course module where we will dive deeper into angular



18

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.800

material.
