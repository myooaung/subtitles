00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,990
It's now time for a deeper dive into angular material.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,390
In the last March you'll learn the very basics about it how it works and how we use these angular material

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,320
components.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,820
We all take a brief look at angular flex lay out a package which allows us to position our elements

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,860
and use flex blocks in an easy to use index.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,020
But we didn't take a closer look at that to be honest.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,820
And there are so many more components we can explore.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,210
So let's do all these things in this module and that Steiff deeper into angular material and also angular

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,500
flex lay out I guess.
