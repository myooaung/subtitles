00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.460

I outlined the project we'll build.



2

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.960

Now what specifically is inciters course.



3

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.540

Well obviously the full project a fitness tracker.



4

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.530

But we'll get there step by step.



5

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.860

The first step is an angular refresher I offer there and dismantle I'll make sure that we're all on



6

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.920

the same page and that at least the very basics of angular are refreshed.



7

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.100

Again this does not replace an entire angle of course but if it's been some time since you last worked



8

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.020

with angler this should get you back on track.



9

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.240

You can absolutely skip this module if you already know angular.



10

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.210

Thereafter we'll have our first real content module.



11

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.050

The angular material module I'll dive into Anglo material.



12

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.630

Explain what it is and how we use it.



13

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.320

Dive into the official docs and this is actually not just one course module.



14

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.530

I have multiple marshals on angular material starting with the basics.



15

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.090

Diving deeper and using more advanced components and also a module where we create our own material



16

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.600

theme.



17

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.240

So a lot of angular material content in this course after this module will have a look at the angle



18

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.710

of fire too which is a third party package that makes connecting to firebase a breeze and establishes



19

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.740

real time connections to that data base there.



20

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.790

I'll also dive into firebase there to explain what that is.



21

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.200

And after dis Marchal our replication will not only look good but also work with a lot of data which



22

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.400

live updates even across multiple users.



23

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.230

Oh we'll also add authentication that I mentioned that yes we will there after We'll have a look at



24

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.240

energy x energy or existe the advanced state management system of angular.



25

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.760

Now in this module I'll show an example implementation how you could use ngi are X in a real project



26

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.990

and how we can take our knon and G.R. X project to ensure X Project how to turn the project which already



27

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.020

works for that module into a project that still works but now uses NCR X. And once we're done with that.



28

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.340

Of course also to Lloyd the application will deploy to a steady host.



29

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.930

I'll show you how this works and will then see our application run on a real server.



30

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.670

I'm really excited to get started with you and we get a broad range of topics in this course very different



31

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.760

topics from styling based topics which are about Angle material over data all the way to state management.



32

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.810

But I guess there's a lot of cool things to learn for you.
