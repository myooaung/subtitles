1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,810
It's time you built our first component.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,010
But before we do that let me quickly also mention to good repository of the Anglo material project.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,110
You can simply click on the Get Up Link on material dot angular dot.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,800
I know this is word yangs material project or package Estival up.

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,560
You can check out the latest release by clicking on the releases link here.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,050
There you can find bug fixes and breaking changes.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:32,320
And you'll also find a list of all the English material components with notes a link to the documentation

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,620
as well as planned components.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,940
So this might be interesting to you if you plan on using this in your next project and you don't know

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,130
if something is implemented or what's coming what's in the pipeline and what the latest change brought.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,810
Now with data out of the way it's really time to get started and not just look at these components but

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,350
use them.
