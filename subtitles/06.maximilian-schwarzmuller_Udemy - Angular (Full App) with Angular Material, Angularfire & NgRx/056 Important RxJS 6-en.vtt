00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.230

Before we dive into this module Here's one important note in case you're using Anglo version 6 or higher



2

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.130

starting with that word an angler uses are extreme as worst than 6 or higher.



3

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.120

And our next years is the library responsible for the observables.



4

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:26.890

Now it generally works exactly as before but the imports change now I actually used the new imports



5

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.960

index almost everywhere in the course and I added some notations throughout the course in places where



6

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.020

you can adjust it but to make sure that the exact same code as shown in this course works.



7

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.820

You should install an extra package with NPM install dash dash save.



8

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.730

It's our extra Yes dash compact.



9

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.830

With that the entire code in this course will work without any adjustments.



10

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.820

If you want to use our Extreme's version 6 without that extra package as I said there will be notations



11

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.000

in the course that allow you to update your code accordingly and well use it without that extra package.



12

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.490

But this is a fine work around to ensure that you don't have to do anything.
