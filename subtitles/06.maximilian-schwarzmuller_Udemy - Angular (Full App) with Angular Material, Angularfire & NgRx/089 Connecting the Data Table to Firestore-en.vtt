00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:10.000

In the last lecture we added one single line to store our data on our database using firebase firestorm.



2

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:17.200

Now of course we also want to get that data from that finished exercise collection to output in our



3

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.420

data table.



4

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.180

Now it's actually pretty simple to do that.



5

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.020

Our data table in past trainings is connected to the data returned by get completed or canceled.



6

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.280

Exercise here.



7

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.570

Of course we can dynamically set the date up property here we can update this whenever we fetch new



8

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.220

data from our backend.



9

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.790

So what we can do is we can go back to our training service and then we got exercise changed and exercise



10

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.820

has changed all add a third subject which is finished.



11

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.790

Exercise has changed which also gives us an exercise array but of course we're not talking about the



12

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.700

equatable exercises but about these exercises down there I can there for all the named these finished



13

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.290

exercises.



14

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.360

So whenever DS change I want to admit this event now to ensure that I'm informed about these changes.



15

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.370

I first of all have to set up a subscription using angler fire that listens to changes in my fire's



16

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.270

store on the server.



17

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.420

We actually already have a method get completed or canceled exercises and go to name and fetch complete



18

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.070

the directs were canceled exercises to make it really clear that this is for fetching data from a server.



19

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.900

And then last year I will not return anything but instead I'll use my database collection call here



20

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.150

and reach out to finished exercises so this collection we're storing the data in and then call value



21

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.140

changes.



22

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.350

Now this only gives us an array of the document values without the idea of the document.



23

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.290

But I don't need to add ID here because we only get a read only access here anyways.



24

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.430

I don't need the ID for anything.



25

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:21.810

So your value changes is what I call and I will now call subscribe on that I'll get an array of exercises



26

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.400

I can add a type in rotation to be really clear about this.



27

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.180

It's going to be an array of exercises which I get your and I want to do something with that array in



28

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.300

this function.



29

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.670

I could replace this finished exercises with it for example that sounds like a good start.



30

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.310

So let's say it does finished exercises equal to exercises but we could even skip this step because



31

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.600

the main thing I want to do is I want to emit finished exercise has changed.



32

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.460

I want to call next year and simply pass the exercises I get back from the server to whoever's interested.



33

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.050

So I can't get rid of this line here.



34

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.480

And that also means I can get rid of the finished exercises array up here.



35

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.030

Not only am adding a value whenever we get new finished exercises from the server and we initiate our



36

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.950

listener here when we call fecche completed or canceled exercises.



37

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.420

Now this listener or this method here is called from past trainings heater and until now I stored the



38

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.770

result as data of my data table.



39

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.470

This will no longer work though because the newly named fecche completed or canceled exercise Meffert



40

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.600

doesn't return the values.



41

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.130

Instead we now simply emit an event whenever devalues change.



42

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.820

So it's this subject I should subscribe to.



43

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.790

So in past trainings I will actually use that subject and create a subscription.



44

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.930

Here in NZ and in it I'll use the training service the finished exercises.



45

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.930

Changed subject and subscribe.



46

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.740

And here I will actually get my exercises.



47

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:23.110

Arrays of type exercise array which I can now assign as a data source so this data source data is now



48

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.750

simply exercises like this.



49

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.120

Now of course we should also unsubscribe if this component is destroyed.



50

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.750

So XDR undestroyed interface and import it from at angular core.



51

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.960

That's super important to prevent memory leaks and will therefore also add my energy on destroy it.



52

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.410

Lisner or method I should say and I need to store it this subscription in a subscription property.



53

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.760

So import subscription from our x Jay SNL.



54

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.380

Now with that important I can create a new property here.



55

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.000

Prior bad acts changed subscription whichever name you like.



56

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.870

It's of type subscription.



57

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.700

And I will set my subscription which I set up here in NC on in it equal to that newly created property.



58

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.890

So the exchanged subscription and unsubscribe to that or from their subscription in on Destroy like



59

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.610

that.



60

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.660

So now this is cleaned up and we prevent memory leaks and now our data table should update whenever



61

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.310

the data on the server updates.



62

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.280

Lets have a look.



63

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.730

Let's go back to our application and log in.



64

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.630

And let's quickly go to past exercises and there we start with one value which makes sense because we



65

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.340

got one value stored in the collection.



66

00:05:52.350 --> 00:06:01.940

And if I were to delete that value by clicking on the free dots your delete document Yes starts delete.



67

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.830

You will see that in the fitness tracker it actually also was deleted.



68

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.940

Now if I start a new exercise here this one maybe and I stopped that.



69

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.290

And let's complete some Burpy.



70

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.760

So I'll wait for this to finish.



71

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.440

It's almost done now it's done.



72

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.430

If I now go to past exercises we have to exercise again.



73

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.350

Don't be deceived.



74

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.960

We got to exercises.



75

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.810

We just have page Nations set up to only show one per page.



76

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:40.990

But what changed change does we see both exercises and we can of course still sort and also filter.



77

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.640

So that still works.



78

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:50.050

The coolest thing is if I now open this and open another browser window next to it let me quickly do



79

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.130

that.



80

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.940

Now I'm still logged in on the left and on the right.



81

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.620

I started a new instance of this app running on the same server and then log in there to see the same



82

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.510

exercise because we shared them across accounts it's not user bound right.



83

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:11.070

So now if Why go there and start some crunches and I cancel them.



84

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.420

You see them up here on the left so we got a live updating going on here due to our dynamic observable



85

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.970

based subscription Wrangler fire.



86

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.320

And this shows the full power of angle of fire.



87

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.810

We're not done yet though.



88

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.420

We work a lot with the angle of fire story.



89

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.280

But there's more we can explore there and we haven't even touched authentication lets do all that.
