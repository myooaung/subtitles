1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:08,350
So now that we also created the training module there are two things I recognize we can optimize for

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:08,760
one.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:15,220
We should put the angular fire marshal Gengler fire of modules I mean into the off module and not in

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,220
the app module I forgot that.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,980
So here let's add the angle of fire off module into the imports array of the off module.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,400
And this means we need to add an import as well.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:32,430
So we need to import angular fire of module from angle of fire to slash off.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:39,820
This now allows us to go back to the app module and close close this gap and also removed the import

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,550
of angle of fire to off the angle of fire marshall should stay in the air marshal because Dadis the

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,350
module which is used to initialising LA fire and we want to do that right at the start.

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,900
India module.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:01,480
And another improvement I recognized is you can get an error or from our subscriptions where we unsubscribe

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,730
if you don't have them for some reason.

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,790
If Engy on the stroy for some reason is called before the subscription is created therefore we should

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,700
check where we say if loading ceps exists then I want to unsubscribe.

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,310
And we should do this for all subscriptions that are apt to be safe and be protected against this error.

17
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:30,340
So the loggin component I will also check if does loading subs is true or is not falles at least is

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,800
not undefined in which case I will unsubscribe.

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,790
So thats loading and sign up.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,960
We should also do the same in all Avro components.

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,590
So encourage training.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,420
Its not relevant.

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,790
We dont have engine destroy there we dont have a subscription there and stop training.

24
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:52,630
We also don't have that in new training though we do so here in NGO undestroyed we get two subscriptions.

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:02:00,070
We have to check each of these so check if exercise is subscription and only if that is not undefined

26
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,500
only then we do unsubscribe.

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,100
And the same is true for the loading subscription of course.

28
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:15,520
So only if this is not the find only data I want to unsubscribe and past trainings there we also have

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,460
a subscription.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:24,400
So here I should also check if this Xchange subscription if this subscription exists only if it does

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,580
exist only then we will unsubscribe.

32
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:34,690
Now in the training component itself here we do have a subscription and we don't even unsubscribe.

33
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,320
So that's something we definitely have to fix.

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:45,750
Add on the stroy here because if you forget it you risk running into memory leaks.

35
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,560
So let's ngi let's add this year and on strike and let's check if this exercise subscription exists

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,440
and if it doesn't exist then I will use it and unsubscribe from it.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,690
So good thing we check that and a welcome component there we get no subscription in the app component.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,690
There we have this Lisner which we initialized but is instead handled in a service.

39
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:18,150
So with that we now improved all our subscriptions and we fixed the positioning of the angular fire

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,810
of module.

41
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,120
Now before we add lazy loading there's more we can do regarding modules.
