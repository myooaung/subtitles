00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.070

Over the last modules we spend a lot of work on this application but it's now really looking good.



2

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:15.630

It's time to deploy it and an angular application once you built it is just a static application.



3

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.360

A bunch of H U M L C S S and javascript files.



4

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.630

Let's see this.



5

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.080

We can build it by running Engy build dash dash peron's.



6

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.360

This will build it for production.



7

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.450

Optimize it from a coding perspective or from the code base perspective I should say and also use ahead



8

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.350

of time compilation which means it will already parse all the angular templates and turn them into vanilla



9

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.230

javascript that executes really fast once you deployed it and doesn't need to be analyzed by Angola



10

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.070

first.



11

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.400

So with that we get really performant bundle which we can then ship onto a server to run our app.



12

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.070

Now let's wait for this to finish.



13

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.900

And once it did finish you get dead dist folder here and you'll need to deploy only one thing and that's



14

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.930

the content of this disk folder.



15

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.040

That's all nothing else is required.



16

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.070

Just what's inside this folder.



17

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.500

Does this your entire angular app..



18

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.340

Now how do you deploy it.



19

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.830

Then you can apply it to any static hosting provider you want such as AWOS as free but since we already



20

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.940

used firebase in this course why don't we all the lawyers on firebase because it turns out that firebase



21

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.210

has a service called firebase hosting which is just a static host and therefore perfectly suited to



22

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.690

run our angular app..



23

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.170

So let's put it there in the next lecture.
