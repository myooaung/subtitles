1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,350
So in the last lectures we look at how we implement authentication and protect our Bakan everything

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,250
works fine as long as we are logged in.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,760
We can then send our requests.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,910
And of course fetch all available extra sizes if we log out.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,730
Everything all kind of works.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,070
But then we get an error that we're not authentic hated and that's true.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:32,950
The problem is we get this error because our fire store subscriptions and the training service still

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,000
are active.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,730
Even if we alog out so here and the training service we got subscriptions for all kinds of stuff for

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,420
example for fatting available exercises.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,220
And this is of course a life subscription.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:54,940
It doesn't finish just because we locked out so we can do a couple of things to fix this issue or work

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,610
with it.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,800
One thing we can do which we should do anyways is besides this first method we passed to exercise this

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,400
first function where we handle the data.

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,660
We can't pass a second function where we handle errors.

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:22,460
So for now let me simply output that error here and now if we go back and we lock bag in and log out

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,460
it changed.

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,910
We still get the error printed here but now it's actually handled by us so to say that is why we don't

20
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,500
see that red error message.

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,640
This one is coming for our second subscription.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,560
The first one is simply locked here.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,710
If we comment this out and do nothing with our in I tried to say again

24
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,340
now we only get the Dobry error message and don't see anything about dead error.

25
00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:02,510
So if he copied that pattern and go to our second subscription which is down here and we add the same

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,380
pattern here.

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,310
Now if we log in an hour we shouldn't see any errors anymore.

28
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,770
Now clearly you could say that is a bad solution because the errors happen we just hide them.

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,230
But it might actually be OK if you say whenever it erro Chris here I don't want to do anything.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,830
Well this is an approach to Hightstown.

31
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,040
Of course you have one problem here though if you got some Obert error which you want to show to the

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,500
user Well you just hide it away.

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:34,710
Right.

34
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,970
So here we can't handle this.

35
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,670
So an alternative approach would be to cancel our subscriptions let's remove our air handlers which

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,460
you still can remember if you want to implement your own error handlers.

37
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,290
And let's now store the subscriptions we have here.

38
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,830
So all in word subscription from our ex-chief.

39
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:09,420
Yes and create a new private property which all name FHB SERPS for firebase subscriptions which will

40
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,520
be an array of subscriptions.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,930
Actually initially it's an empty array.

42
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:24,330
But then here I will reach out to my firebase substrate and Porsche.

43
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,890
This first subscription onto it so I'll just add it it still will subscribe.

44
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,980
I will just add that subscription to firebase Suppes subscription rate and I'll do the same down there

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,930
for fetching completed or canceled exercises or reach out to FBA precepts and will push this subscription

46
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:53,730
onto the now or we'll add a new method which would call cancel subscriptions doesn't take any arguments

47
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,570
but will simply take Bayat subscriptions.

48
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:07,210
And with four each I can execute some code on every subscription in that irrate and for every subscription

49
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:14,680
I simply want to call unsubscribe now I just have to call cancel subscriptions from within the off service

50
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,810
so I'll go to my off service.

51
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,710
It already has.

52
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,010
Add injectable.

53
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:33,860
So now I can inject my average service here private training service like this and when ever we log

54
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:42,700
out here I want to call this training service cancel subscriptions.

55
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,520
Now you save this and remember I did remove the error handlers.

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,380
We still shouldn't get error messages because when logging out we now do unsubscribe and therefore we

57
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,740
do that before we try to make an request to make a request to the back backend which wouldn't go through.

58
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,040
So this is also a valid strategy here.

59
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:14,650
Now there's one other thing we can now do to do some cleanup work and that is changed the way we emit

60
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,640
does you are affected event which we read now do in log out and off successfully.

61
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:27,600
Let me show you how you can take advantage of an observable based off status listener provided by angle

62
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,740
of fire in the next lecture.
