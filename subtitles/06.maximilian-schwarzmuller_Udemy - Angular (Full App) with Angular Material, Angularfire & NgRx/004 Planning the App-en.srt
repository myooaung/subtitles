1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:07,510
With all that out of the way right before we dive into the optional angle or refresher.

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,140
I already want to lay out the app will built.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,950
Now I did show the app of course here still the theory behind it or here are building blocks on a slide.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,650
We'll have a welcome part.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,590
A welcome component which will create and will also create a training section.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,420
This is the section where we'll be able to start new trainings and also of course then view to current

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,870
training and past trainings.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,390
Finally we'll also have a off section where users are able to log in or sign up now to be precise for

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,210
the training part.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,750
We'll need an exercise model which simply is like the day that definition what will work with will work

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,370
with exercises here.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,800
And as I said will have a component for the active training and for creating a new training and a summary

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,500
component for the past training and I right components there because of course they use multiple components

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,290
all the angular material will all they have a training service to manage our data.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,780
And for the off part build therefore have a user model to describe a user or off data model I could

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,900
say so which credentials do we need and then we'll have sign up and sign in components as well as an

17
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,110
off service.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,320
Now we might add more for the course.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,060
But that's the general structure.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,200
So did you have an idea of how this is planned out.

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,380
Now after the next orbital module we'll dive right into it and we'll start learning Anglo material but

22
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,120
it will be learning on the job we'll already start building up there to.
