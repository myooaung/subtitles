00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.770

Work out put some data in our application and it would be nice.



2

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.770

Child put it in a structured way in a table maybe.



3

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.550

Well there is this data table component and this is an extremely powerful component which is still easy



4

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.320

to use.



5

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.510

But behind the scenes it does a lot of awesome stuff.



6

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.000

Let's have a look if we have a look at the preview here.



7

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.820

You see it's a nicely styled table here.



8

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.580

And the cool thing is we can add features like page anation sorting and filtering to the table.



9

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.850

For example here filter we can add a type hydro gene or hydro and it automated the.



10

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.820

This table we're sorting.



11

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.970

We just click on a header here and it sorts the elements in the table for us page anation of course.



12

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.660

Well we can simply define how many items should be on a given page and then switch through them.



13

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.350

We'll have a look at all these features and implement such a data table to manage our finished or canceled



14

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.470

exercises.



15

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.900

Now for that how do we actually implement the data table.



16

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.450

Well let's have a look at their source code.



17

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.040

It looks complex but if you look closely it actually repeats the same code all the time.



18

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.290

We have a rapping math table component which we and this is a core thing of this component which we



19

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.090

connect to some data source.



20

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.840

More about this in a second.



21

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.710

And then we get this energy container element which you can think off as the invisible grouping mechanism



22

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:50.430

which simply groups together a hetero's cell and then a regular cell to tell angular which element or



23

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.010

which value to output in which column.



24

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.000

So in the headers cell we have the title of the header of the column and then here we got the value



25

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.480

of a single row of this column and Angola will automatically loop through all the values in the data



26

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.070

source and repeat this pattern where we simply define how each column should look like for all the rows



27

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.100

it has and our data source it is instructed to do so with the last two lines here.



28

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760

This tells it for all the columns we to find up your output.



29

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.570

I had a row and repeat as many rows data rows as needed.



30

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.720

So here with the find the columns and at the bottom we define to use the had a row and then output as



31

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.760

many value rows as needed.



32

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.520

This is what's inside of that table in the head.



33

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.850

Now let's implement it.



34

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.930

So let's go back to our code and in past training so the template get rid of that all add math table.



35

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.690

So this component which wraps the entire table nice sat dead we would connect us to some data source.



36

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.370

This is bound by a property binding and bind it to a property named datasource which I don't have yet



37

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.260

but which I will add before I added Let's actually define the blueprints for the columns.



38

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.540

Remember we use the energy container which is the default angular component which we can use to group



39

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.830

things essentially here on Engy container we need to assign or add a directive.



40

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.190

Matt Colomb death for a material column definition does tells angler's material or the material table



41

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:45.150

to consider all containers that have this directive and we'd give each column a clearly identified identifier



42

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.960

like date for example the date when we finished the exercise or cancel it.



43

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.480

Now we want to define a column here.



44

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.400

Keep that in mind.



45

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.360

We define a column a column has a header cell.



46

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.980

So the title and a values cell at the value of cells are repeated for all the values as I mentioned



47

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.290

the header cells to find the Mad Hatter cell component here on this component.



48

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:22.080

We add structural that are effective indicated by the star which is called Matt header cell death for



49

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.910

header's cell definition.



50

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.730

You don't need to assign a value here to simply as used by Metts table.



51

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:37.480

Internally and then you simply define the title of that header like date.



52

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.750

Now let's define a value yourself for the column with map cell and then a structural directive which



53

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.230

is the math cell death directive for materials cell definition.



54

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.860

And here we have to assign that element.



55

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.760

Now this clearly looks strange.



56

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:01.630

This simply gives us access to a element property which will be passed to us by a material table component



57

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.660

so that we can actually output the value we get through stringin appellation here.



58

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.950

So we can access element date and I know that there will be a date property because our data source



59

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:23.230

will later be our exercises array and each exercise has a date property.



60

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.420

So back to the template element date and year.



61

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.760

I will also add the date pipe to a built in pipe shipping with angular.



62

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.170

So this is our first column.



63

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.820

We already got a bunch of arrows here because we need to unlock this component to included in our bundle



64

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:53.140

so the material module I will add to import the mat table module and it will add it to both imports



65

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:01.380

and then also of course exports in the material module with that we can go back to the past trading's



66

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.440

component.



67

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.060

And now are just gone just to data sources and found.



68

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.700

But that makes sense.



69

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.450

Now we have more than one color.



70

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.310

So let's repeat this pattern here.



71

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.840

We also want to have a column for the name of the exercise.



72

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.070

So the title will be name here.



73

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.200

We still get access to the element but then we should be data up there by the way.



74

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.000

But then here we X-ists element name and I no longer need the pipe here.



75

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:36.920

Now we have more columns so let's add the number column definition here for the calories.



76

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.240

Maybe Here I'll give it a title of calories.



77

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.740

This is always the human readable title here of course.



78

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.530

And then I'm going to use element calories here.



79

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.190

Now the calories of the ship be formatted with the number pi.



80

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.860

This will output them in a nicely styled way.



81

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.000

Now there's one more column I want to add for sure and that is the duration.



82

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.700

So here duration title should be duration.



83

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.420

And I'm going to Xs element duration here.



84

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.010

I'll also use the number of pipe here because I want to format this nicely as a number two.



85

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.640

And finally maybe this state.



86

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.580

So here it's for the state.



87

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.750

Whoever does was cancelled or not here will output element state.



88

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.780

I don't need a pipe here.



89

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.890

Now with that we get all the columns you want to use.



90

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.250

Now we need to instruct material table to do something.



91

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.940

First of all I'll say hey I want to have a header so I'll add Matt header row here.



92

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:53.870

There we also have to assign a structural directive the Matt header row Rodanthe and no important I



93

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.650

set this to display columns.



94

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.890

Before I explain what's up with that let's also add the instruction to render all the rows we do this



95

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:11.910

by adding match row and assigning a Navarrete structural directive which of course is just as the structural



96

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.840

directives coming from material angular material.



97

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:23.810

So here it's the math road death structural directive where I'm simply saying hey how should the Rose



98

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:29.850

be rendered a Judas by setting lache row and then finding the columns for which I want to render rows



99

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.810

and this should be my displayed columns.



100

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:41.370

Now does Holsten text can look rather strange and in the end you can just memorize it or look it up



101

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.870

in the documentation.



102

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:49.920

What's happening is really just that we're rendering the headers so the table titles and then all the



103

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.840

rows for all the values we got this Collin's displayed.



104

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.400

Cullens thing is important.



105

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.790

We're connecting the map table to a data source but with display columns we can control which of our



106

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.370

defined columns we actually want to show.



107

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.720

This allows us to dynamically change as if we wanted to.



108

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:15.130

So we need to do two things configure displayed columns and data source.



109

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:22.950

So in the past training component typescript file I will add properties for both.



110

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.480

I'll add my displayed Calamus property.



111

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:34.220

This has to be an array of strings and the names in there have to match the names you assigned here



112

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.650

with Matt column death on your energy container.



113

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:43.790

So if you got a date name and calories here you have to match that in disarray to to find which columns



114

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.790

should be rendered.



115

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.320

So you don't want to render them all date.



116

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:53.780

Name duration calories and you also defined your order here.



117

00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:02.410

By the way calorie is and state a simple thing you can easily switch the order by switching the order



118

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.540

in this array.



119

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.350

That is why we bind to displayed columns.



120

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:16.200

I also need to define my data source so at data source property and this will be a value which I have



121

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.820

to instantiate based on something I import from angular material.



122

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:30.290

I have to instantiate a new mapped table data source you import this from any angular material up your



123

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.990

math table data source.



124

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.490

And this is simply an object which allows material table to connect to.



125

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.370

It's a generic object where you define which kind of data you're passing in.



126

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.070

For us it's going to be an exercise.



127

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.980

So we have to import exercise from our exercise model.



128

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.940

So import exercise from.



129

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.390

And now we go up a level to the exercise model file.



130

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:05.360

Now we're connecting an exercise to the math table data source and now correctly you would say don't



131

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.910

we use an array of exercises.



132

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:15.560

Yes we do but since we're working with a table max table data source always expects to get an array



133

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.700

of whichever type you are passing here.



134

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:24.380

So if you are passing an array of exercises just define exercise exercises to type not exercise like



135

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:24.670

this.



136

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.120

Not an array of exercises it'll automatically assume this.



137

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:37.840

Now with this we have our data source and now that should already be all we need to render our past



138

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.150

exercise as well.



139

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:47.350

Although of course we need to populate the data source and for this we need the training service because



140

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.790

this is where our data lives.



141

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:57.960

So all injected into this component with the help of the constructor of course training services a property



142

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.780

I create of type trading service make sure to add the import to the training service file.



143

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:14.310

And then in Engy on it I will set this data source and then there's a data property equal to this training



144

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.740

service and then there all our exercises.



145

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.770

Now for that I'll quickly add a helper method because we don't have such a method yet.



146

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.740

Completed or canceled exercises maybe.



147

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.630

And it will simply return this EXOR sizes and return slice to get a new copy.



148

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.210

Though it doesn't really matter here.



149

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:48.840

Now back in past trainings all connected to this training service get completed or canceled exercises



150

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.750

and this returns an array of exercises and as you see it doesn't complain because they expect to get



151

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.510

an array of whichever type you set up here.



152

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:04.830

Now if we save this and we go back to our application we quickly log in here.



153

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:13.530

Let's start a new exercise and let's go with it.



154

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:20.090

And under past exercises we now see this exercise as you see we only get a fraction of the duration



155

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.350

which we actually had if we completed the exercise.



156

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.430

Let's see the opposite.



157

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:31.540

By completing some Burpy last year and will quickly fast forward until this is done.



158

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.680

And we're almost done so let's have a look at past exercises.



159

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:44.790

Here we got complete herpes 60 seconds and cancell crunches.



160

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:51.350

Now one thing I think that's going wrong is in the training service.



161

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:59.310

We of course want to store this running exercises calories not duration multiplied with their progress



162

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.270
