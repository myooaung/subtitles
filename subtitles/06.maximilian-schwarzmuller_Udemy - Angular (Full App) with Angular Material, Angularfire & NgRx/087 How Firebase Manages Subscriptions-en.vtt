00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.910

In the last lecture we restructured our code.



2

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.510

We put the subscription to angle or fire or wya angle or fire into the training service.



3

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.270

So did we fetched the available exercises in that service and set up this subscription year in the new



4

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.560

training component.



5

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.940

We then only subscribed to changes in these are whaleboat exercises and not directly to angular fire.



6

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.980

This is just one possible set up that removes the complexity from our template or from our component



7

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.670

and moves it into the service.



8

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:45.110

Now one thing is important to consider though we call fetch available exercises whenever the new training



9

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.710

component gets created.



10

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.630

And this would be the case whenever we navigate to it if we navigate away from it.



11

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:00.370

We never tear down the existing subscription which gets initialized in fact available exercises we do



12

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.410

set this up whenever we call this method.



13

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.290

Now let's find out if that is a problem in the SUBSCRIBE method.



14

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:16.400

In the service lets simply console log exercises if its automatically only using one subscription at



15

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.950

a time then we don't need to do clean up and we can find out if that's the case by the fact that we



16

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.800

only see one console log with an array of all exercises.



17

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.280

If we navigate back and forth to new training and we get more and more exercises being locked then we



18

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.500

definitely need to clean up manually.



19

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.060

So let's save this.



20

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.420

And let's then lock back in so I'll enter some dummy data.



21

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.960

And we see one log the first time we are here.



22

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.810

Now let's go to past exercises and back to New exercise.



23

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.520

We don't see a lot here.



24

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.820

Right.



25

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.760

So nothing changed.



26

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.380

If I now start an exercise here and I go back now we see another law being printed but this is only



27

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.650

one.



28

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.340

Keep that in mind.



29

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.980

We didn't see two here.



30

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.100

I can prove this by clearing the log.



31

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.600

And again starting an exercise and going back.



32

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.590

Now it's only one log.



33

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.780

So even though we reloaded this component and therefore re executed fecche available exercises we only



34

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.890

get one log.



35

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.500

So this subscription replaces itself.



36

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.330

We're not polluting the memory.



37

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.200

We only got one and this is something you have to keep in mind.



38

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.660

So dessous managed for us all I'll as costs a lot.



39

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.210

And with that knowledge to is managed for as we can move on and do for things like for example store



40

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.680

exercises that we complete that in the database.
