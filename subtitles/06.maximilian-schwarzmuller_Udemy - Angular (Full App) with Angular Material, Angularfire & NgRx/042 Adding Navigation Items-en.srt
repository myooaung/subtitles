1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,170
Let's now add some biggish items to our site NEF because right now we only have in the side Neph and

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,580
I have a feeling that this is not so useful for that.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:20,230
Let's switch back to decide enough docs here on our angler material page.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,300
There you can learn more about it and how to change its behavior.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,320
But actually I'm interested in a list data something we haven't used before but I want to render a list

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,200
of elements in my side neth.

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,480
And actually there is this special navigational list's use case here which gives you a component that

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,890
makes sure that your items are really looking beautifully in a navigation list as you can see.

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:53,290
We should use this map nav list component here and then simply put our links inside of it.

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,010
Well let's do just that.

11
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,830
We can also by the way create a more complex list items by nesting a math list item inside.

12
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,450
Matt Napoli asked I'll show you both.

13
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:13,060
So let's add a math nav list component here into our math site nav and let's grab the first link without

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,040
the list item just yank or tag and put it in there.

15
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:25,380
And let's actually add all the links here without the list items as items in this neverless up here.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,190
Well there are a lot of lists items I guess now you can already see I'm getting an error here because

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,840
of what did we forget.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,650
We need to import it from material module.

19
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,180
So back to material module we added a new component de-list component.

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,490
So we need to import it and the name Asmat list module.

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:54,610
This is imported from at angleworm material and then it's added to imports and also to exports with

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,510
that make sure to save all files and go back to your application.

23
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:05,380
And now if we switch to a smaller screen and we are the side nav we see these items sit next to each

24
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,500
other.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,070
The reason for this is that I simply put a couple of list items next to each other without further setup.

26
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:23,060
If we go back to our list here you'll see that we need to add this mapped list item selector to our

27
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,750
links though this really registers them as list items in the wrapping mat nationalist component just

28
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,010
putting a bunch of text in there doesn't really you use that correctly.

29
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:40,490
So let's add this year let's add Man list item to all these links and if we do that and this really

30
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,580
loads deep.

31
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,220
If I open the site again there are no need for each other and they automatically Please notice look

32
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,070
could get a little bit of padding to the left little bit of padding to the top and bottom.

33
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,460
So this is looking good.

34
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,720
And it also works.

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,330
You can see the background it changes doesn't close we'll have to work on that but it works for now.

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,510
However I want to have an icon next to it.

37
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:12,680
Now what we could do if we have a look at the official docs is we could of course follow this approach

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,560
add a map list item component like this into our map nap list and link it next to it.

39
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,560
Dyken.

40
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,500
However this approach is recommended if you want to have a list item which as it says here has more

41
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,470
than one target.

42
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,290
So you have a link and a button and they do different things.

43
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,310
Then you can still position them in the same line and make it look good by wrapping it with math list

44
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,900
item my case you or I ever I simply want to have a link with an icon inside of it.

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,370
And for this I can recommend a different approach here.

46
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:57,770
I will simply add something inside of my a link and that something will be a mat Iken component here

47
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:06,110
for Sign-Up Let's say I want to have the face I can I can I selected prior to this recording it'll look

48
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:15,910
like a face and it's from the material Aikins page and next to it all add a span where I say sign up.

49
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,800
Let's see how it looks.

50
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,050
We go back to our application and I open this.

51
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,720
Now we have sign up with a face next to it.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,820
Now it's a little bit too close for my taste.

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,000
So what I can do is I can add a class neth caption maybe name is totally up to you.

54
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,410
Add it to D.C.'s Estival here.

55
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:45,240
Neph caption and do two things with these spans that hold the captions next to the icons.

56
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:54,580
First set the display to inline block so that we then can also maybe add padding simply padding left

57
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:02,770
of six pixels so that if we save all of that go back and open the menu We've got more space in between.

58
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,440
So this is looking good.

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,060
And as you can see the I can also gets to color the text gets.

60
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,520
So this is just it.

61
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:17,800
And it also has this light gray look if we hover over it and with that we can continue working on this

62
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,790
and add icons to all these items and then make sure that when we select an element here we actually

63
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,630
close the site now.

64
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,060
Now of course a good practice for you to do the I can thing shouldn't be too hard.

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,450
So please go ahead and search to can you personally like one for log in one for training and assigned

66
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,290
and next to these items.

67
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,420
Once we're done that we'll do the rest together and ensure that this navigation actually gets closed

68
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,860
when we click on an item.

69
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,620
Where are you successful.

70
00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:00,640
Well let's go back to the app component HMO file and let's use this pattern here where we have our anchor

71
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,990
tag we're inside of it.

72
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:09,490
We're using a Eichen in a span with a class nav caption which will add padding where we use that to

73
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,840
also work on the log in or provide a log in link.

74
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,480
Here I'll use the input I can which I think looks good.

75
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,320
And let's also add a training.

76
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:30,210
I can hear your all add again Matt I can give Does the fitness center can which I have found which looks

77
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,200
really good.

78
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,560
And also add a span with a class naff caption here where it says training.

79
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:44,120
Now if we do that and we open the site navigation we get these three different icons.

80
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:54,610
Now actually there's one more link we could add here and that would be I guess log out link.

81
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,130
Which is more of a button so let's add a button.

82
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:09,870
Matt I can button where we then add a mat I can check to ikan is quite fitting here where it can also

83
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,590
add a span with Neph caption where I say log out.

84
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,960
Let's take a closer look at how that looks.

85
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,800
I opened this we got this sitting here.

86
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,090
However the issue we now have is that this a button is not an anchor tag with Matt last item.

87
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,500
So what we can try is we can simply add match list item to that button here.

88
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,460
Let's see how that works.

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,110
We opened that still doesn't look that good.

90
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,070
So we would we should do is instead try the different approach I showed you earlier.

91
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,610
Use math list item like this.

92
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,920
And now next to the bottom inside there.

93
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:55,140
So this is how we still see this approach to its approach you should take if you don't have to as well.

94
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,210
Rob simpler approach of just having a link in your list.

95
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,690
If we now open the side if we get the log out button here.

96
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,710
Now we're almost done.

97
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,530
The one thing that's missing is that we actually closed the side.

98
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,400
Now when we click one of these buttons.

99
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:18,510
So to achieve this we can simply add click listeners to the list items by default angler already handles

100
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,900
clicks and loads the appropriate route.

101
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,650
But we can add extra listeners for example here to the first one I add a click listener and there I

102
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,950
went to close the site that saw the whole site Neph close and what side the half year I'm referring

103
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,410
to the local reference which refers to decide neth.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,600
And with this code if we save this I only added it to sign up.

105
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,480
If I click on sign up it loads a sign up page as I can prove to you and closes the site.

106
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:58,560
So that's one thing we can now add this to all our items here including the log out button which will

107
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,310
later hook up differently

108
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,080
and with DAPs.

109
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Now we got a navigation that goes out of the way once we load a page.

110
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,010
So this is Deeside now half finished and the general navigation on bigger screens.

111
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,420
We have a different approach though.

112
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,080
The log out is missing here.

113
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,130
Let's quickly add one more where we say log out and where a won't add a router link because I'll later

114
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
actually handle this differently.

115
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,190
I will just add a click listener later on.

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,610
For now let's go with this approach here though.
