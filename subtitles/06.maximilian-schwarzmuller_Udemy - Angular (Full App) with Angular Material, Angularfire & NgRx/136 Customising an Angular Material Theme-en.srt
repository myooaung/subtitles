1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,340
On material that Engler did I O you can click on Guy it's and then on theming angular material and there

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,280
you find a description of what a theme is and a link to the material design spec which shows you all

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,790
the colors you can choose from.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,530
That's good for us.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,030
We'll use that in a second.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,720
And it also mentions how to build a theme here under defining a custom theme.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,270
It's actually pretty simple.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,990
So this is what I'll walk through together with you.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,790
So let's start to start I'll close my app folder and I'll create a theme file or simply create here

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,470
next to styles of C S S I'll call it my field dot.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,140
And now that's important SPSS because we're going to use sassier.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,760
SAS is a superset of normal C S S and allows us to use special features.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,760
It will be compiled down to normal C S S by DCL automatically and we use SAS for the theme creation

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,810
because we work with some variables so that the like them can generate a file that will define the different

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,210
styles for the different components automatically based on some input variables.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,200
So in my field that is as sitting next to put files and maynt.

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,730
Yes.

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,750
And you can name this followed every want this file now needs to import something which we can see here

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,750
in our documentation.

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,510
It needs to import does it.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,060
Angular material faming package you could say let's throw that into this.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,340
S.c.s as follows.

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,430
Now with that package m ordered the next step is to include mat core.

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:44,310
Now this is a mix in and includes includes it into this file which simply makes a lot of content available

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,930
to us.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,040
For example some variables.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,590
SAS knows the variables which to find the angular material colorists.

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,950
And a lot of Ahmer functionalities that are needed to successfully create a styling file in the end.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,480
Now the next step is to define our colors and themes.

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,970
So I'll copy that over into our file and explain it.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,440
Here we define a bunch of variables we create variables with the dollar sign at the beginning.

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,120
We define variables for the primary excellent word colors and these variable names are totally up to

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,870
you.

34
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,140
The map Pelet function here is again provided by the theming package and it's essentially create such

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,580
a color palette.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,190
These variables we use here are also defined by the package and they refer to the official color guide

37
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,640
here.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,450
So here we got deep purple indigo blue pink.

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,690
These are just a nice names you see here.

40
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,600
So Indigo pink red always prefixed with a dollar sign Matt.

41
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:47,320
So you have to choose some of the colors you see here and you can add up to three shades for the default

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,950
lighter and the darker worsen which makes a lot of sense for the exent color since that's mostly used

43
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,440
on buttons and so on because these alternative shapes will be picked by angular material for example

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,270
for Hobert effects and so on.

45
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,100
If you don't define them all the effects will just take the default color.

46
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,490
So with that set up we got our free color set up the war palette is optional as you see here.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,980
The devil would be red.

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,360
And with that added We now define our own light theme here.

49
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,220
Now that is done with the mad light theme or the matte dark theme function.

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,750
The function will simply style the elements differently.

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,870
The darkfield gives everything a darker background and zone light theme as well.

52
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,960
A light background.

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,180
So it is something you can do to choose a darker or lighter mode for your app.

54
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,490
You pass your free colors or at least to up to free to dysfunction.

55
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,030
And with that the only thing that's missing is that we actually call include So use include to run and

56
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,560
never built in mixin which is called angular Dasch material theme.

57
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,820
Now to this function you'll simply pastie theme you created and you stored in this variable.

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,070
So I'll pass this here and this will now not only create the theme but also load it this also means

59
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,350
that we should go to the Stout's see us as file and come and just feed them out because we don't need

60
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,750
two feed fighting with each other.

61
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,940
That of course also means that we need to ensure that this custom my Feme file gets loaded and for that

62
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,180
we go to the angular seal either Jason fall and besides loading the stuffs that CSSA fall which we now

63
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,960
also could remove.

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,800
I guess now we get some recode in there that will keep it.

65
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,580
But besides that will now also point to the my theme that s.c.s as fall and the seal eyes upwards.

66
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,260
S.c.s essence sace compilation out of the box.

67
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,860
With that we can quit DNG serve process and we have to do that so that the changes are picked up and

68
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,270
we rerun energies Earth and this will now build the project again and we'll build our s.c.s as fall.

69
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,820
Now for subsequent changes you don't have to restart.

70
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,040
I just did have to do that because I changed the Selye configuration to tape this fall into account

71
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,370
now once the compilation is finished we can go back to our application

72
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,090
and we don't see a real difference.

73
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,270
The reason for this is that the theme we find just uses the colors we use before.

74
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,910
So let's switch everything up.

75
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,740
Let's use a primary color of red and simply safe debt.

76
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,410
And now when the EP reloads you see we got a rat primary color everywhere.

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,040
And this is how simple it is to update and change and manipulate themes.

78
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,290
Now if you want to learn more about themes dive into the official guide I was showing you off from the

79
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,540
official docs but this is how you can work with teams and how you can make sure that your app looks

80
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,550
exactly the way you want it to look.
