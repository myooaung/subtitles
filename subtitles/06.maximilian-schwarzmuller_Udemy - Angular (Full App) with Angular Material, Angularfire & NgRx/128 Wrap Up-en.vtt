00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.940

So now with all the work spend on reducers actions you should have a good understanding of how NTR X



2

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.180

works and how you add to your project.



3

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.640

Now as I said it might be overkill for a project of that size and on the other hand you can also dive



4

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.320

deeper and explore more features of NCR ex.



5

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.310

This is no entry or X specific course though.



6

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.330

I just want to show how you could fit it into this project especially since we use angle of fire here



7

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.790

in the training service and the office service we've already got a very nice way of managing our data



8

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.180

exchanges and have for example the entire all flow being managed for us behind the scenes which takes



9

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.710

a lot of work for us and also makes tools like NGO your X therefore less important maybe and with that



10

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.980

we got a nice looking and working application with Angle a material angle of fire and as you are x let's



11

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.640

prepare it for deployment.
