1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,760
So in this model we implemented a lot of changes and improvements to our code structure and all the

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,820
will lead to the error handling and so on.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,570
Now let's do a test run for deployment will not deployed yet but I want to see if it would work if I

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,110
build it for production.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:29,070
So like with Def server and then will run Engy build dash dash fraud to both for production which will

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,510
also use ahead of time compilation which means that the entire angle or templates are already optimized

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,410
and compiled now.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,490
So that in the browser dishtowels has to be done again and therefore the angle starts faster.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,150
So we do this by running Engy build dash dash Pre-OT and this will now optimize our code strip out unnecessary

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,030
code and really give us a good bundle which we can deploy.

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,960
And give us an error.

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,530
This is why I wanted to do this test run.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,140
The error is coming from our environments file.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,590
The problem there is that we can't initialize firebase for our production build because we're doing

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:15,930
this in the environment or TS file but Derrida's firebase key is only available in our well development

16
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,610
environment for the production varment.

17
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,150
We should at the same set up for our environment.

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,230
Perrott that TS file like this.

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,920
If we do this and we rerun the command it today actually finished the build process successfully and

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,580
this is one important step you have to do to ensure that your app will later work correctly.

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,860
Once you run it on a real server.

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,250
So let's not wait for it to finish and see if we got any other errors.

23
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,180
The build process finished successfully and with that we should be saved later deploy it.

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,960
With that I'm happy with all the optimizations we put into place.

25
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,800
Let's see what else we can do with our app.
