Welcome to this optional module and I want to emphasize this this module it really is optional.

00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:16,160
If you already know angle or just skip it this is a very condensed a brief refresher does not replace

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,380
an entire English course not even close but dives into all the core features which you will also see

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,920
in discourse so that in case you only had a brief look at angler thus far or spend some time since you

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,540
last worked with it you're quickly back up to speed and can follow this course.
