1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,330
Get zone the last lecture I explained how observables work in a very condensed manner let's simply see

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,010
it in action.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,810
What do you think about that.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,970
So you see it in action with first of all need some data.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,400
So let's switch back to firebase and go to the database section there.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
Now there you have the choice between two databases.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,070
The real time data and the cloud firers store.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,790
It's still in beta at the point of time recording this.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,010
But it should be safe to use and it is the next gen database offering by firebase.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,710
So let's click try fires door and there let's actually start in test mode.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,890
Now here important.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,440
Anyone can read or write your database.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,850
So this is really only for us now to get started quickly.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,580
We will later switches to lock mode to make sure that only offene cable users can read and write the

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,150
data.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,690
For now let's start in test mode here.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,220
This will now wish in the fire store for us and prepare everything so that we can use it when everything

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,050
is prepared.

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,820
This is how the cloud firestorm looks like.

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,900
Now how does the cloud firestorm actually work.

21
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,850
The official docs are a great place to learn more but let me quickly walk you through the core concepts

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,670
and then we'll show you the example of the docs because they're really great to understand how cloud

23
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,840
Firestar works.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,250
And a great place for you to dive deeper.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,340
So classifiers fires tornadoes freak kinds of turns when working with well cloud fires firestorm collections

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:40,430
which you could compare to folders on your operating system documents which you can well compare to

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,520
documents on your operating system which are organized in folders or collections in this case and data

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,870
inside a document.

29
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,490
Now that's a really good picture to understand what we're working with.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,220
The idea of falling in the fire story if you store documents and you end a document could be the data

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,320
about one single user multiple users would have multiple documents.

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,350
Now documents are part of collections.

33
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,710
You must have documents in a collection collection.

34
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,500
Remember it's just a folder.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,390
So in this example your we have a user's folder with two documents two users.

36
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:23,620
Now you can also have collections which are nested though you can't have a collection inside a collection.

37
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,700
But as a child of a document.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,230
So what you can actually have if you scroll down to hierarchical data is you can have a Rooms folder

39
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:41,790
so a collection with Room A and B which are both documents but where Room A might have a message just

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,170
subcollection.

41
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,250
So debt collection is part of the document which is part of a collection.

42
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,380
And you always have this alternating pattern of collection document collection document.

43
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,000
Now what's the data then the data is what's inside a document besides any possible sub collections.

44
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,910
So in this case your room A has the data name which holds a value of my chat room.

45
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,070
And then additionally also has the subcollection.

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,470
Now the data in the document really is like in a javascript object or to be precise like Chase and data

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,270
key value pairs.

48
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,490
This is the cloud fire story.

49
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,370
It's not meant to store files.

50
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,780
By the way you don't store images there.

51
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,250
It's there to store data text data if you want.

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,410
So this is to cloud firestorm in a nutshell.

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,450
And again you can dive deeper into firebase in general if you're interested.

54
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,580
But angle of fire is now what I want to have a look at.

55
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:43,610
But to do that we should go back to our console and simply add our first collection.

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,150
Now remember I want to set up some data which we can use to populate our away level exercise data.

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:58,040
So I would simply named is available exercises now click next.

58
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,620
And now it allows me to create a new document.

59
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,590
It actually is able to generate an ID for that document automatically which you might want to do.

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,140
And then you can assign key value pairs.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,940
For example if you have a look at our code each exercise of us has an idea.

62
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,010
Now here we had a clearly readable one.

63
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,800
But we can take the automatically generated one and then we have a name duration and calories.

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,590
So let's now create this here too.

65
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,420
Let's add a name and the first one should be crunches and it is history.

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,610
Now let's add another field here.

67
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,250
That field is the duration.

68
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,580
It's not a string but a number.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,550
And for crunches we had 30 seconds.

70
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,530
So let's enter 30.

71
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,570
Last but not least we have the calories.

72
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,360
The calories for crunches are also a number.

73
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,470
And there it was eight.

74
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,770
As you can see.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
So this is our collection.

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,740
And if you want you can of course also assign your own unique ID here and use crunches again instead

77
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,540
of the automatically generated one.

78
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,020
I will use that automatically generated one.

79
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,860
This prevents collisions of our data.

80
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,130
So that is our first document.

81
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:19,350
If we had save now it will get created and you can now see the collection at the document in the collection.

82
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,500
And as you can see you can now add more fields or sub collections does this alternating pattern that

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,480
you can follow.

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,340
But of course here I don't need some collections.

85
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,960
So we got more than one exercise though.

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,710
So let's quickly create documents for the ABA exercises.

87
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,170
So here we have the name field and the name was touched hos.

88
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,750
We can also already remember the duration which was 180 calories which were 15.

89
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,970
So let me quickly enter the name then the duration 180.

90
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:59,070
Though that is a number and the calories which was 15 also a number by the way.

91
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:07,130
In my case here I m whip's I am using the same structure for all my documents.

92
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,450
They all have a name calories and a duration.

93
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,040
This is not required though you could have different fields for different documents.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,850
Firestorm is a schema less database here however it makes sense to use the same because well my exercises

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,060
just happened to be in the same structure.

96
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,380
So let's create the next the exercise side lungis.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,590
So here the name is side lungis and then we got 120 and 18.

98
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,360
So let's quickly add this here.

99
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:44,260
Let's add a field duration is the number 120 and then 18 for the calories.

100
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,930
So here let's quickly add calories.

101
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,150
Number 18 and with that we got created.

102
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,570
Now on to the last data piece by piece.

103
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,330
Let's copy Burpy here.

104
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,000
Add a document create an ID automatically and create our name Burpy is.

105
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,680
And for Burpy we have a duration of sixty eight calories.

106
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:15,150
So let's a side iteration which is a type of number 60 and then calorie is also a number.

107
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,170
And that was eight.

108
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,030
And with that we created all the data we use in our application in the database.

109
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,360
Firebase offers us tick West now just is how do we connect angular to that.

110
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,670
The answer of course is angular fire.

111
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,930
And we're going to install and use it in the next lecture as.
