00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.470

As a next step in this project knouted we have a good looking sign up and log in screen.



2

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.450

I want to add navigation I want to add a tool bar and a site Nath so that we can actually switch pages



3

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.010

and I also want to work on that.



4

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.410

Welcome page.



5

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.930

Before we then of course also dive into our training pages.



6

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:31.850

So what we will start with is adding navigation adding a toolbar and a site neth because this will allow



7

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.700

us to switch pages without having to manually type anywhere else.



8

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.220

So let's do that as the next step.



9

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.120

For that I will use two components provided by angular material.



10

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.430

We have a look at the material documentation.



11

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.250

These components are going to be the tool bar which is like a header element you can position actually



12

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.460

anywhere not just at the top of the page but also at the top of the page.



13

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.210

And a site Neph which is responsive site navigation that you can toggle and which is then pushed over



14

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.070

your Aberlour page content or removed from it.



15

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.800

Let's start with the site neth because that's really important if you want to implement a pattern where



16

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.910

you have both a tool bar at the top like we have it on this page just a bar at the top but then also



17

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:33.610

a site near if you can toggle then you will actually need to include the toolbar into a so-called site



18

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.920

nav container.



19

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.960

But let's have a look at some example code here.



20

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.310

The first thing we need is this math drawer.



21

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.260

This is the side there.



22

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.250

So to say and consists of two parts or three parts actually a match drawer or a container which then



23

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.110

contains both the drawer.



24

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.520

So the actual side navigation which you can push in and out and the content which is your normal page



25

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.590

content that's important the normal content which is always risible above which the drawer is pushed.



26

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.790

This set up has one big advantage.



27

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.810

If you write some code outside of the match drawer container the site navigation is never going to go



28

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.610

above it and that's great if you wanted to use something like we have on this page where you have some



29

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.480

site navigation going below the top toolbar.



30

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.920

This is of course also a pattern.



31

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.200

You can create in my application here I want to create a site that goes above the toolbar though so



32

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.340

the toolbar will have to go inside the match drawer container.



33

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.310

Well enough of the talking.



34

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.790

Let's implement this.



35

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.930

And to be precise we want to use the mat drawer which is just a drawer you can add anywhere on your



36

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.770

page.



37

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.660

We will use the site nav which is essentially the same but suited for the main page navigation.



38

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.140

So if we have a look at this code here you'll see you then used the same approach but with MAP side



39

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.180

Neph here here and in the content.



40

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.120

So let's go back to our code then let's start in the material module this time by importing what we



41

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.090

need which for now will be the matte side nav module.



42

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.400

We then need to import this or added to imports and exports.



43

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.340

And now we can use it let's say in the app component because you want to have it as a general layout



44

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.650

in our page and no matter which page is loaded.



45

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.940

We want to have our site Neph rapid or be available on that page.



46

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.760

India and female we right now at the router outlet.



47

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.470

Now I will add the matte side nav container here which is the first component we need to add in there



48

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.160

we will then have the mat not Matt but Matt side nav.



49

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:03.610

So the actual side navigation that's pushed above the page and below that the matte side nav content.



50

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.620

Now in the map nigh site Neph content decides where to route out that will Guil does pattern ensures



51

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.070

that every page which is just loaded in the place of router outlet will have a site nav a way that will.



52

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.600

So we can now implement the site as a next step and for that in Matt's side.



53

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.080

Navier we can add whatever you want to display on the site navigation like a paragraph where we say



54

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.010

I'm the site neth will soon replace those with links of course.



55

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.740

Now if we save this and we go back to our running application you'll see welcome works.



56

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.190

It has a light grey shadow or border box around it.



57

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.190

We don't see a side navigation though.



58

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.200

The reason for this simply is that it's by default toggle so hidden to show it we can simply set opened



59

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.450

to true year.



60

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.400

We do that on Matt's site nav.



61

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.270

Now you see the site now being opened here and it goes above the average content.



62

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.350

And if I click on the content it disappears we can't get it to reappear though.



63

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:22.070

Now to make it appear upon it click we first of all need something we can click this will soon be about



64

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.110

an hour toolbar.



65

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.240

For now let's add a normal button where we simply use a toggle site NAV or show side nav Maybe because



66

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.860

that's what the button will do.



67

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.190

Show side nav and now you show a side nav we got of course a couple of options.



68

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.350

So often the first option is something which might already have come to your mind.



69

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:51.300

If we can set open to True or false then binding opened to either true or false might be a good way



70

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.770

of showing the site now.



71

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:01.800

So if we go to the app component and we add the open side nav property and set of to falls initially



72

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:11.510

then let's add a semi-colon then we can go to the app component and bind the bottom click here.



73

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.720

This is normal angular code bind this button to switch openside Neph to true.



74

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.890

So set this to true.



75

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:32.440

And if we didn't buy and opened here to openside Nath Then clicking this button which will not be styled



76

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:39.520

by the way then clicking this button will open the site near only one time though because thereafter



77

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.370

we did dismiss it but we never reset openside now.



78

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.570

Now there would be ways to reset it.



79

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.790

But there's another way maybe a better way of opening this.



80

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:56.330

Any ways you can add a local reference site nav and by the way you should also add role navigation for



81

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:05.240

accessibility reasons but you should at this site nav reference because this allows you to then use



82

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:13.490

it on the button to reach out to that site for reference and call the toggle method which will open



83

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.620

it if it's closed.



84

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.760

And do the other way around of course.



85

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:24.680

So now you can still open it and it works more than once because it will always just do the opposite.



86

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.820

Nikon showed us for hiding because it's well hidden by the overlay.



87

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.510

But you probably see how it works.



88

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.450

So this is a way of opening the site neth.



89

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.880

Now I'll remove the button because I want to use one in the toolbar which we have yet to add and we



90

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.800

also have image problem.



91

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.350

It's a bit actually.



92

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.110

Everything here is ugly.



93

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:52.190

You can see it if the side that was open you saw a white border around our entire page and all Also



94

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.550

the font I don't like that default font.



95

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:02.960

So let's work on this and for the font I will actually import a font from Google fonts the rowboat to



96

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:10.310

font which is the default material he signed front so you can go to any age to email and add a certain



97

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.790

import with a link.



98

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:21.950

RATH And then it's HTP as fun start Google API dot com slash see s s questionmark family equals rebottle



99

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.730

dishonesty fund.



100

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.610

I want to use rail is equal to stylesheet.



101

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:35.330

And with that we can go to dishtowels C-s asphalt and set up some logo page styles to make it look a



102

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.380

bit nicer.



103

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:48.740

In there I will style age female and body to use a font family of rebozo or as a fallback Sunseri of



104

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.300

I will also give body a margin of Ciro.



105

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.470

And with that it will look nicer.



106

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:03.950

When our issue we will have though is we don't have a toolbar we can't open the site right now.



107

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.740

Let's work on this in the next lecture and let's actually add a tool bar and then a button on the toolbar



108

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.660

that opens the side navigation.
