1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,280
In the last lecture we are at the site now.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,950
But the issue is the height is very limited.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,880
The reason for this is it's how H.T. email works.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,890
If you don't define heights then it will only take the height it needs to wrap all content which in

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,230
this case is the tool bar.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,480
Unwelcome works to fix this.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,110
We need to change some stylings for this.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,520
We should go into deep components C S S file and add stylings for Matt side Neph container which is

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,850
a container wrapping everything as well as MAP side nav content which is the container for the content

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,630
that is below Deeside Nath.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,160
Both should be set to use height 100 percent.

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,260
You also want to do that for math science.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,080
So for the actual side.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,650
Besides that you should go to Stout's thought see assess and give the whole body of the document all

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,080
to a height of 100 percent so that the entire body takes the full height.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,340
Even if the content inside of it doesn't require it.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,740
With that if we reload application still doesn't work right.

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,330
The reason is the height alone isn't enough we also need to assign it to HQ mail so we can put it into

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,740
the first rule.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,990
Now with that if we go back we can actually see that if I talk of the side in we know half the full

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,010
height which in my opinion looks much better.

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,630
Of course we have the issue that the side that only is as wide as required though so what we can do

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,870
is we can go back to the Yapp components CSSA fall and for the math side.

24
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,310
Now for the actual site navigation container not a container which also contains the content of the

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,940
page.

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,390
Just a side nav we can give it a whiff of let's say 250 pixels.

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,590
Now with that we'll use that which looks much better in my opinion.

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,050
So that's our side navigation.

29
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,660
Let's now work on the toolbar because Dad looks ready ugly.

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,750
First of all.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,030
I don't want to have a dead button here.

32
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,450
I want to have all I can BOTTEN which shows the hamburger menu then I want to have the logo but some

33
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:22,820
distance in between would be nice and they all after I want to have my links which all should look differently.

34
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,080
Let's work on all these things.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,490
Let's start with the button in the Afkham Hornet HTL fall where we have our tool bar for the button.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,840
Let's give it the mad dash icon button directive or component selector to be precise.

37
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,010
Now we can't place ikan on the button and have it look good.

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,720
We do this by adding d Matt Iken component inside of the button.

39
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,790
Me quickly restructure this so that it looks a bit easier or is easier to read.

40
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:01,200
So this is our But no end in the Met.

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,130
I can here we can use the menu icon and you can always check this material.

42
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,100
I could page I mentioned earlier maybe use the name of all I can.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,020
That looks like this hamburger menu.

44
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,380
We do that.

45
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,380
We see this Nye's button here.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,470
That looks much better.

47
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,360
Now onto the links.

48
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,560
I'd rather have them look differently and it would be nice if they were sitting on the right of the

49
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,920
toolbar and not next to the logo.

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:36,270
How can we achieve that let's start with the stylin the components CSSA fall of first of all simply

51
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,670
style my anchor tax here.

52
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,620
Q hath no text decoration.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,430
So it should not be underlined and to have a color of white let's say with that they already start looking

54
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,480
better.

55
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,470
But I went to a different style for links which I'm hovering over or which are active.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:05,060
So which you clicking on there we could assign a color of let's say light gray maybe let's see how that

57
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,000
looks like if we do that and we hover over all I can.

58
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,560
Yeah we can see which one we're hovering on.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,800
Now that's what I think but pushing them to the right was another thing I wanted to do.

60
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:23,210
And here we could take advantage of the fact that the tool bar uses flex blocks flex blocks as I showed

61
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:29,120
you in the very brief introduction distributes all elements along a main axis and the main axis depends

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,420
on the Flex direction.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:39,110
Now for toolbar as you can probably guess it's row from left to right now to get the free links all

64
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,590
the way to the right.

65
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,020
We can actually do a couple of different things.

66
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:51,880
One is to give this div which contains the links DFA X flex property and safeness No by doing this alone

67
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,110
we won't see a difference.

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,680
But one thing did change if we inspect dealings we see they are in a container that takes the full A-Whale

69
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,820
with that what's different before it before we had a container that only took as much with as required

70
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,250
as it is the case for logo and the hamberger I can.

71
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,180
So now we have that container.

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,910
We could also give this Dev D F X layout directive to turn it into a flex container.

73
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,400
Yes.

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,950
An element can be both a flex container and a flex element at the same time.

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,040
Leave the set to the default of row but set f x.

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:37,320
Lay out a line equal to flex and for the main axis which is from left to right this will push them all

77
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,040
the way to the end of their container.

78
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:47,970
So now they're at the end of this header and alternative with Ben to not use this approach.

79
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,250
So let's remove that.

80
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:56,520
But to enter a number diff between the logo and the links here and give this the eFax flex directive

81
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,670
then this for take all the available remaining space and therefore this would not all be pushed all

82
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,800
the way to the right.

83
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,680
So this would have been an alternative.

84
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:14,560
Now I'm going to use the first approach because it shows more features of the Flex layout package but

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,730
what we can see is that the links are way too narrow.

86
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:27,580
Well to fix this I will add a unordered list here does also semantically better with list items where

87
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,890
each link sits inside a list item.

88
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,100
So let's quickly do that for all three.

89
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:45,170
Let's put the log into a list item and training into a list item and with that add it it'll actually

90
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,120
look horrible because now we have an unordered list here on the right to get rid of that.

91
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:58,190
What I will do is I'll turn to an ordered list into a f x layout so that this uses flex box to distribute

92
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,260
its elements.

93
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:08,420
Now from left to right now of course we should also change the styles though so give us a class of navigation

94
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,850
items maybe.

95
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,380
And let's go to the map component see a SS file and add navigation items here and does it sitting on

96
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:23,630
the order list so there I want to set the list style to nonne and remove all padding and margin this

97
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,940
might have with that we're back to where we were before but at least Snel semantically better.

98
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:38,770
Now the goal is to add some spacing between these list items and we're using flex layout here on the

99
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,870
wrapping container.

100
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:52,990
Now what I can do is I can also add F X lay out Gap again and set this to 10 pixels by doing that we

101
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,410
get some spacing between the different flex items and you don't even need to assign ethics flex to DS

102
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,060
list items that would ensure they take all the way to that space.

103
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,440
But I actually only want to have them take as much space as they need and not as much as they can.

104
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,670
So with that the navigation is finished for now.

105
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,980
Was a lot of work but now we can navigate between Sign up log in and well training where we got nothing.

106
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,600
No when clicking on Logo I want to go back.

107
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,840
That's one thing I'll add.

108
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:31,270
So here for the logo I'll add the anchor tag were the router link points to the main page.

109
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,340
Seems sensible to me.

110
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,780
And now with Dad it truly is finished.

111
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,730
Got the logo where we can go back.

112
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,030
We get the links and we get a side nav that's working.

113
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,790
Now obviously we need responsiveness.

114
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:52,000
We want to have these links inside the site Neph and we only want to have the hamburger icon on smaller

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,910
screens where we don't on the other hand don't want to have the header and where we all want to have

116
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,720
a truly responsive layout and not assumed in worship of the Web site.

117
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,180
So responsiveness is what we're working on next.
