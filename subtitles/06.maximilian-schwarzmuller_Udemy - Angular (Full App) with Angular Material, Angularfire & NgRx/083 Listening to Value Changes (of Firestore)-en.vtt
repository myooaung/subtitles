1

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.760

So we get that data in our firebase fire store database.



2

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.010

We obviously want to use it in our angular application though.



3

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.900

So to get it into the regular application we need to connect a single or two firebase and we will do



4

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.490

this through a singular fire.



5

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:26.470

Now you can check out the angular fire to get a page by simply googling for angular fire too.



6

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.830

There you not only find the latest version but you'll also find some information.



7

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:38.680

And if you click on installation and set up all the deep well installation and setup steps as well as



8

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.220

at the end of this article the steps into deep more detailed documentation of all the features this



9

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.500

package offers.



10

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.710

Let's start with the setup though.



11

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.570

Now here it starts actually with installation of the Seelye.



12

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.020

We already did this so we can skip to step 3 where we installed the angular fire to package as well



13

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900

as the firebase package.



14

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.440

So the official firebase SDK which is a dependency of angular fire too.



15

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.710

So with that let's go back to our code here and in our project Acquisti leave open server and quickly



16

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.670

execute this command and PM install angle of fire to add firebase both with dash dash save to all the



17

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.300

store a reference and package what Jason does will now download and install these two dependencies which



18

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.810

we can thereafter use to connect our or app to our firebase app if we already go back to the documentation.



19

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.410

You can see that the next step is to connect our angler app to firebase by providing some API keys that



20

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.890

are required to offend decayed our ourselves to firebase.



21

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.940

So to say.



22

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:55.840

So you can copy this firebase conflict object here and go back to your Seele project into the source



23

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.160

environments folder and they are the environment dogs.



24

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.110

TS file in here after production you should add this object.



25

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.060

And of course replace dece values with the ones of your firebase project.



26

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.600

Now where do you get ideas.



27

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.220

Let's have a look at the console there.



28

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:26.160

You can click on Project overview and at firebase your web app if you do this you get exactly this object



29

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.060

here too to it's named differently but the key value pairs are the same ones and already populated with



30

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.000

your project specific data.



31

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.810

So you can't just copy that and then replace this data with the one you just copied.



32

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.050

This now is the configuration which will successfully connect you to your firebase bacot that'll go



33

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.530

back to the database so that we can have a look at it.



34

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.810

But now we made an important step towards connecting our app to firebase.



35

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.990

The next step already is to get angular fire started.



36

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.760

And just like angular or material this requires us to actually import a module and added to our project



37

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.120

so that we only import what we need and that we explicitly tell angular dat we need angular fire.



38

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:23.810

Q So to add firebase to your project you should go to your app module file and there we will simply



39

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:34.160

import this angular fire module from angle of fire to the exact name we import is a regular fire module.



40

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.220

Now take that angle of fire module and add it to your imports array.



41

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.500

You also have to execute a method on it.



42

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.610

The initialize AB method to that method you have to pass this configuration to what is stored in this



43

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.560

environment variable to get access to it.



44

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.980

You simply import it.



45

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:03.870

So you add an import to your import list here at the top import and worriment from.



46

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.560

And now you go to the environment's folder and there the environment file does environment object year



47

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.150

has is firebase key which you just added.



48

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.160

So this key here and with that we initialize our anger for our module with our firebase data.



49

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.270

You can now restart and she served to bring up the development server again.



50

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.110

Now we connected our regular app to firebase kind of we can now import the different features angle



51

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.610

of fire gives us thus far we only have the general set up.



52

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.910

But just like angular material that different parts of it like the old real time database the new firestorm



53

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.650

database is already off module.



54

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.490

All these things have to be brought in on the Mont. so that you don't blow your package unnecessarily



55

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.660

but only use what you need.



56

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.010

Let's use what we want and let's say we want to get to angular firestorm module because obviously we



57

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.290

want to connect to angular firestorm to get this we need to add an additional import.



58

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.570

We do also import this from the angle of fire to package but there from a subfolder the fires store



59

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.620

package from there.



60

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.120

You can get the angular fires store module angular Firestone module from angular to slash fires.



61

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.070

This model.



62

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.070

Now is also added to him or it's sort of first one angle of fire marshall does the general set up with



63

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.810

this one.



64

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:42.870

We now enable the firestorm related functionalities you don't need to call a method there.



65

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.330

Now with that or did finally we can use that to connect or to reach out to firebase.



66

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.780

Now where do we want to reach out.



67

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.320

Well remember we added data about the A-Whale exercises and we used that data in the new training component.



68

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.030

Thus far we get the away little trainings in energy on it.



69

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.190

Now I will remove this method call instead.



70

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.010

Here I now want to use angular fire.



71

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.430

So what we can do is add a new import at the top where we import from angular fire to slash firestorm.



72

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:30.100

And what we do import is actually angular fire store like this does is something we can inject.



73

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.290

So a class we can inject a service provided by this angular fired two package which we can inject that



74

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.190

gives us methods that will automatically behind the scenes reach out to firebase.



75

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.680

It can't do that because we provided our configuration.



76

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:55.320

So now it will inject it here in the constructor or simply store it in a private property named DB for



77

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:02.280

database maybe and assign a type angle or fire story doesn't actually should work because we provided



78

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.010

all these modules in the module.



79

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.250

The general fire module and precisely the angle of fire module.



80

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:20.270

So now we can inject this database class here and now in energy on in it I can use it to call a method



81

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:28.220

the method I want to call is collection collection allows me to reach out to a specific collection in



82

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:36.530

my angular fire store and the collection I am interested in is of course my a way edible exercises collection



83

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.020

here.



84

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.880

So let's pass this as a string to the collection method.



85

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.530

So now with that I get access to this collection.



86

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:54.740

Now we get a couple of methods we can call it the simplest one is value changes value changes actually



87

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.000

will give us an observable which is why we can now call subscribe.



88

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.590

Let's do that all get summersault.



89

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.990

I don't know which one.



90

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.230

And I simply want to larget to the console that we can see what we fetched.



91

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:15.020

So this is how our energy on init method now looks like in the new training component.



92

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.230

We reach out to Angelfire store.



93

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.250

We rechecked your collection.



94

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.560

We subscribe to changes to the values in this collection.



95

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:29.810

We subscribe here to be precise and whenever a new value is emitted we log it to the console.



96

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.450

Let's have a look.



97

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.800

Let's save this.



98

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.690

Let's go back to our angular application and open our console log.



99

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:42.700

And let's quickly log in so that we can get to the training component there.



100

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:52.120

You'll see after a short while we get this array with our data with the four objects the four documents



101

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.590

we placed in there.



102

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.680

You will also see that the idea is missing here though we just got the index in the array which is not



103

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.250

the ID in the firestorm that is the case because we use value changes which is a really simple Lisner



104

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:12.720

that strips out all the meta data like the ID and only gives us the values of our documents.



105

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.600

Will later also see our listeners but dessous how this works.



106

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.710

This is how the fire store works.



107

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:29.740

Now what we can do with that is we can not subscribe here and just set this up and store it is observable



108

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.140

which value changes returns in a property in the exercise property.



109

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:43.690

So this exercise is equals It is observable and we get an error because exercise is in our case is actually



110

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.950

an array of exercises.



111

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.760

We can't fix this by actually setting this to Taieb observable which I need to import.



112

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:59.450

First of all so quickly add an import and import observable from our X-Trace like this.



113

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:05.280

All now said exercises to absorbable and absorbable is a generic type.



114

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.240

And I know I will get any data.



115

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:15.170

I'd love to say we get exercice data but actually our exercise model is defined to have an ID and the



116

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.800

data we get back doesn't have that Id at least not as part of the document we fetch right now.



117

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.620

We'll work on this later.



118

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.380

So now exercises of type observable and we assign it to an observable here.



119

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:34.480

Now in our template we can output it here of course we are looping through all exercises and exercises.



120

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.270

Now is an async value.



121

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.220

It's undefined at the beginning.



122

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:44.920

It only is a label once we fetch the data from the server so we can work around this by adding the async



123

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:53.230

pipe a pipe provided by angular that simply automatically subscribes to an observable and extracts the



124

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.780

data that observable returns.



125

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:01.900

Therefore using exercise their offer is save we shouldn't existe the idea here though but maybe use



126

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:09.130

the name because Id is temporarily not equatable and output the name here too if we know safety and



127

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.810

we go back to our application and rerun it.



128

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:23.710

We can quickly log in and now here on the exercise screen you still see these exercises even though



129

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.120

we now change the way we load it.



130

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:36.370

And if you now go back to your firebase fire store here and maybe let's say change touched hose to attached



131

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.070

toast.



132

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:45.370

Well alternative words and all of them you can go back to your angular app and without reloading you'll



133

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.470

see touched toes here too.



134

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:55.870

And this and I will just emphasize it never reload it it just updates because you changed it in firestorm.



135

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.280

And because we set up this real time value change his listener.



136

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.800

So let's change this back.



137

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.470

I'll remove d e d here and have touched hose.



138

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.140

And if we go back to the fitness tracker now it's touched toes again.



139

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:18.100

And this is how this works and how we connect angular fire to a firebase and therefore how we connect



140

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.830

angular to firebase through angular fire.
