00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.440

In the last lecture we get set up with angle of fire and we could already see the power it offers us



2

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.730

with this real time updating.



3

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.990

Now back in the new training component.



4

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.010

Let's look at an alternative to value changes.



5

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.350

The downside of value changes was that it only gives us well the value of our documents.



6

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.220

And if you have a look at the firebase database here the value is the part on the right here.



7

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.400

It doesn't include their ID which is actually kind of the name of the document you could say.



8

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.780

And therefore it's true that as metadata.



9

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.060

So let's change this to snapshot changes.



10

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.040

This is a different listener or event listener which also contains some data to see what's inside.



11

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.300

Let's subscribe.



12

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.910

We will get a result which I simply want to lock to the console so that we can see what's inside it



13

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.630

and it will temporarily remove this exercises so that we don't get an error.



14

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.810

Now back in the application let's quickly log in with some dummy credentials and we still get an array.



15

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.240

But now the objects in there actually look at it differently.



16

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.400

We get a type which indicates which type of change occurred and each year they were all added to our



17

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.270

local data collection you could say so or to our array we're having in this local annular app and we



18

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.020

get a payload and then the payload we get a document snapshot which you can access and where you can



19

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.810

actually get the idea of the document.



20

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.210

Now the idea is nice but as you can see what about the values of the document.



21

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.410

While we only got a document reference here where we would have to actually execute an extra method



22

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:56.050

to get the data that's inside it but the documents snapshot is a way for us to get Demetra data at least



23

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.140

the ID.



24

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.010

So how do we now also extract the value.



25

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.830

There is a special method you can execute.



26

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.590

So here where we get the result let's quickly loop through all the results.



27

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.590

So with a simple form off loop maybe resolve this an array of items.



28

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.750

Remember that.



29

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:25.930

Now we can simply console log response or resoled payload Dawk data.



30

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.280

Now that's a Meffert And let's see what this prints we now save this and we lock back in



31

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.580

you now get the actual values.



32

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.640

So they are extractable from the data you get here.



33

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.960

So with snapshot changes you get the best of both worlds.



34

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.770

You can still access the data in your document but you also get meta data like the IDs.



35

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:07.310

And if we combine this with an observable operator we can actually map our server side data in exactly



36

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.240

the format we need to be in an exercise model.



37

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.300

So with ID name duration calories without date and state.



38

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.690

So now here what I'll do is I'll simply at this map operator which has shown in the slide earlier this



39

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.370

is an extra Yes.



40

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.380

Operator.



41

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.830

That can be used on any observable and snapshot changes of course gives us an observable.



42

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.860

Otherwise we couldn't subscribe map as an operator which we need to import.



43

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:48.080

So we should import map from our X-Trace slash operators like this map then gets exactly the same data



44

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.940

as result would have received.



45

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:01.570

Now we know that this is essentially our dark data you could call it or Doc irrate Maybe not want to



46

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.200

want to do is I want to map this into an array of exercise objects.



47

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.680

So what I'll do is all simply use dark array and call map on that.



48

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.860

And then this is now not the are extra as operator but Dawk array is an array of objects so map now



49

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.360

can be executed on it.



50

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:29.620

Since this is a normal javascript array there I will get my individual document and I want to return



51

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.900

a javascript object where we have an ID could be dog payload dog ID.



52

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.840

So here I'm just drilling into Does object we're getting back from fires to where and where I get the



53

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.270

other data too.



54

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.840

Here I will simply use the spread operator in excess dot payload dock data.



55

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.380

This method does not return an object we just Brinda these objects.



56

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.800

You're on the right where each object has the calories duration name properties and the spread operator



57

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.890

these free dots I'm pulling these properties out of the returned object and add them to this object



58

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.430

which I return.



59

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.500

So now I'm returning this object here inside this inner map function which is executed on the stock



60

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.620

array.



61

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.780

My goal is now to return this map array which is now simply an array of objects that look exactly like



62

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.150

our exercise model.



63

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.610

So now if I subscribe to this I should see exactly that.



64

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:41.240

So here if I simply Konsole log result to check this and I go back to the application and lock back



65

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:50.060

in like this then I get an array of four objects where we have ID calories duration and name.



66

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.290

This is how we successfully map the data we get back and how we utilize the power of observables.



67

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:05.040

Now we can get rid of Subscribe and re assign this to this exercises which now really isn't observable.



68

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:13.180

That includes an exercise array because keep in mind the optics we return here are exactly in that format



69

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.010

the warning I'm getting here is an error or this is actually correct.



70

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.010

Now here it's not picking up that this will successfully pull out all these fields.



71

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:31.210

So to circumvent this problem I'll manually assign name to dot payload docked data name.



72

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.340

I know that the name feel a little bit there all assigned ration to dock payload dock data duration



73

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.660

and I'll assign calories to dock payload dock data calories.



74

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.210

So this is the long work of what I had previously with the spread operator just to fix this error.



75

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.230

Now with that we can use this exercise as a template again and in there we use the async pipe to automatically



76

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.540

subscribe to that.



77

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.890

And now we get exercises which look like in our model.



78

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.400

So I can again use exercise ID here for de-value.



79

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:15.870

Now with this if we go back to the application and lock back in we again see that after a while we get



80

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.950

all these exercise this year as they are stored on the server.
