1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,470
As a next step in this project knouted we have a good looking sign up and log in screen.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,450
I want to add navigation I want to add a tool bar and a site Nath so that we can actually switch pages

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,010
and I also want to work on that.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,410
Welcome page.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,930
Before we then of course also dive into our training pages.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:31,850
So what we will start with is adding navigation adding a toolbar and a site neth because this will allow

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,700
us to switch pages without having to manually type anywhere else.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,220
So let's do that as the next step.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:46,120
For that I will use two components provided by angular material.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,430
We have a look at the material documentation.

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:55,250
These components are going to be the tool bar which is like a header element you can position actually

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,460
anywhere not just at the top of the page but also at the top of the page.

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:08,210
And a site Neph which is responsive site navigation that you can toggle and which is then pushed over

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,070
your Aberlour page content or removed from it.

15
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:18,800
Let's start with the site neth because that's really important if you want to implement a pattern where

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,910
you have both a tool bar at the top like we have it on this page just a bar at the top but then also

17
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:33,610
a site near if you can toggle then you will actually need to include the toolbar into a so-called site

18
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,920
nav container.

19
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,960
But let's have a look at some example code here.

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,310
The first thing we need is this math drawer.

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,260
This is the side there.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:49,250
So to say and consists of two parts or three parts actually a match drawer or a container which then

23
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,110
contains both the drawer.

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:58,520
So the actual side navigation which you can push in and out and the content which is your normal page

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:06,590
content that's important the normal content which is always risible above which the drawer is pushed.

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,790
This set up has one big advantage.

27
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,810
If you write some code outside of the match drawer container the site navigation is never going to go

28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,610
above it and that's great if you wanted to use something like we have on this page where you have some

29
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,480
site navigation going below the top toolbar.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,920
This is of course also a pattern.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:33,200
You can create in my application here I want to create a site that goes above the toolbar though so

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,340
the toolbar will have to go inside the match drawer container.

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,310
Well enough of the talking.

34
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,790
Let's implement this.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,930
And to be precise we want to use the mat drawer which is just a drawer you can add anywhere on your

36
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,770
page.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,660
We will use the site nav which is essentially the same but suited for the main page navigation.

38
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,140
So if we have a look at this code here you'll see you then used the same approach but with MAP side

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,180
Neph here here and in the content.

40
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,120
So let's go back to our code then let's start in the material module this time by importing what we

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,090
need which for now will be the matte side nav module.

42
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,400
We then need to import this or added to imports and exports.

43
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,340
And now we can use it let's say in the app component because you want to have it as a general layout

44
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,650
in our page and no matter which page is loaded.

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,940
We want to have our site Neph rapid or be available on that page.

46
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,760
India and female we right now at the router outlet.

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:48,470
Now I will add the matte side nav container here which is the first component we need to add in there

48
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,160
we will then have the mat not Matt but Matt side nav.

49
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:03,610
So the actual side navigation that's pushed above the page and below that the matte side nav content.

50
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,620
Now in the map nigh site Neph content decides where to route out that will Guil does pattern ensures

51
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,070
that every page which is just loaded in the place of router outlet will have a site nav a way that will.

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,600
So we can now implement the site as a next step and for that in Matt's side.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,080
Navier we can add whatever you want to display on the site navigation like a paragraph where we say

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,010
I'm the site neth will soon replace those with links of course.

55
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,740
Now if we save this and we go back to our running application you'll see welcome works.

56
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,190
It has a light grey shadow or border box around it.

57
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,190
We don't see a side navigation though.

58
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:59,200
The reason for this simply is that it's by default toggle so hidden to show it we can simply set opened

59
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,450
to true year.

60
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,400
We do that on Matt's site nav.

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,270
Now you see the site now being opened here and it goes above the average content.

62
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,350
And if I click on the content it disappears we can't get it to reappear though.

63
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:22,070
Now to make it appear upon it click we first of all need something we can click this will soon be about

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,110
an hour toolbar.

65
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,240
For now let's add a normal button where we simply use a toggle site NAV or show side nav Maybe because

66
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,860
that's what the button will do.

67
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,190
Show side nav and now you show a side nav we got of course a couple of options.

68
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,350
So often the first option is something which might already have come to your mind.

69
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,300
If we can set open to True or false then binding opened to either true or false might be a good way

70
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,770
of showing the site now.

71
00:05:53,010 --> 00:06:01,800
So if we go to the app component and we add the open side nav property and set of to falls initially

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:11,510
then let's add a semi-colon then we can go to the app component and bind the bottom click here.

73
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:18,720
This is normal angular code bind this button to switch openside Neph to true.

74
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,890
So set this to true.

75
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:32,440
And if we didn't buy and opened here to openside Nath Then clicking this button which will not be styled

76
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:39,520
by the way then clicking this button will open the site near only one time though because thereafter

77
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,370
we did dismiss it but we never reset openside now.

78
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,570
Now there would be ways to reset it.

79
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,790
But there's another way maybe a better way of opening this.

80
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:56,330
Any ways you can add a local reference site nav and by the way you should also add role navigation for

81
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:05,240
accessibility reasons but you should at this site nav reference because this allows you to then use

82
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:13,490
it on the button to reach out to that site for reference and call the toggle method which will open

83
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,620
it if it's closed.

84
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,760
And do the other way around of course.

85
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,680
So now you can still open it and it works more than once because it will always just do the opposite.

86
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,820
Nikon showed us for hiding because it's well hidden by the overlay.

87
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,510
But you probably see how it works.

88
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,450
So this is a way of opening the site neth.

89
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,880
Now I'll remove the button because I want to use one in the toolbar which we have yet to add and we

90
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,800
also have image problem.

91
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,350
It's a bit actually.

92
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,110
Everything here is ugly.

93
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,190
You can see it if the side that was open you saw a white border around our entire page and all Also

94
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,550
the font I don't like that default font.

95
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:02,960
So let's work on this and for the font I will actually import a font from Google fonts the rowboat to

96
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:10,310
font which is the default material he signed front so you can go to any age to email and add a certain

97
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,790
import with a link.

98
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:21,950
RATH And then it's HTP as fun start Google API dot com slash see s s questionmark family equals rebottle

99
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,730
dishonesty fund.

100
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,610
I want to use rail is equal to stylesheet.

101
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:35,330
And with that we can go to dishtowels C-s asphalt and set up some logo page styles to make it look a

102
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,380
bit nicer.

103
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:48,740
In there I will style age female and body to use a font family of rebozo or as a fallback Sunseri of

104
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,300
I will also give body a margin of Ciro.

105
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,470
And with that it will look nicer.

106
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:03,950
When our issue we will have though is we don't have a toolbar we can't open the site right now.

107
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,740
Let's work on this in the next lecture and let's actually add a tool bar and then a button on the toolbar

108
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,660
that opens the side navigation.
