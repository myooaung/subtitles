00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.430

I showed you what will be built and I walked to Frucci core building blocks of this course.



2

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.350

I don't want to bore you with more slides about discours I guess it's better to just get started.



3

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.730

However I want to show you how you can get the most out of this course because that really is why you're



4

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.590

taking this course.



5

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.270

You want to get the most for your money right and to get the most of the course.



6

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.650

You should obviously watch the videos.



7

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.580

It's a video based course watching them make sense I guess but you should also code along.



8

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.530

I don't throw the code at you and say here is copy it.



9

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980

I explain why we type code in a certain way and you learn the most if you code along.



10

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.260

Now you might need to pause video sometimes because maybe I'm moving too fast or at some points maybe



11

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.480

I'm moving too slow.



12

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.490

So feel free to adjust that playback speed.



13

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.610

But coding along really allows you to not just see the project but really build and learn it.



14

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.790

Now besides that if you ever face an issue please download my source code.



15

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.730

I provide a lot of snapshots from the course attached to the Course Lectures and always to the last



16

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.440

lecture of each module and with these course code snapshots you really should be able to compare decode



17

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.330

to yours.



18

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.390

Run my code and see where the differences and why your code fails.



19

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.410

And finally if you're absolutely stuck or if something is unclear please ask in the course Q and A section.



20

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.650

It's there for you to ask and I'm there to help.



21

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.040

But I also want to highlight that you should not just ask there but also answer not to do my work.



22

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.280

I will answer but because you learn way more if you answer it's harder.



23

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.720

And that's why you learn more.



24

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.900

But if you help our students we have two great benefits.



25

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.570

One you did your good deed of the day you helped another student too.



26

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.230

You'll learn more because you were challenged to think about a problem and formulate an answer.



27

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.740

And if the answer is wrong or only parts of it are correct.



28

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.360

Nothing bad about that.



29

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.330

You're going to learn even more then.



30

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.060

So please take this with you and go for the steps was falling for decors and you will get the most out



31

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.020

of this course.
