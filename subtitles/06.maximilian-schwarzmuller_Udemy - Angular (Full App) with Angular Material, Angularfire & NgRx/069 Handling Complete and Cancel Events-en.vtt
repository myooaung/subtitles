00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.310

We are already connected.



2

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:11.740

Current training to the service but when we are done we still emit an event the same for when we cancel



3

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.720

the training.



4

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.880

I no longer want to admit an event so let's get rid of that event Demeter let's get rid of the output



5

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.090

and even dimeter imports in the current training component in the training component where we implemented.



6

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.330

Let's no longer listen to training exit.



7

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.410

This is not how we stop or finished his training.



8

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.520

Instead we now want to use our training service.



9

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.410

We got to start exercise method.



10

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:48.320

I also want to have a complete exercise method and I also want to have a cancel exercise method.



11

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.460

Both don't necessarily need to take the exercise idea as an argument because we're storing the running



12

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.490

exercise in the service anyways.



13

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.040

No complete success case we're simply done.



14

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.610

We completed the entire duration cancell is where we well cancelled the exercise.



15

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.120

I didn't want to store how much we completed and calculate the calories we burn.



16

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.190

Let's start with the simpler case complete exercise in there.



17

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:26.230

I will set this running exercise to now and emit exercise changed by calling next and also emitting



18

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.370

null here.



19

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.720

This will basically mean we got no running exercise.



20

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:39.110

Now I want to store all completed or canceled exercises so let's add a new propertied training service



21

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.360

the exercises property which is of type exercise array and it's an empty array.



22

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.330

Initially incomplete exercise before we now running exercise.



23

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.220

I will actually store it is still running exercised because we didn't suddenly called from Oleate in



24

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:10.370

the exercises great so I will reach out to this exercises and push this running exercise so this will



25

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.080

push this object to exercises if we dare after set it to null.



26

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.590

We will not set it to null in the array because we just set this running exercise to now sold this property



27

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.200

not de-value it was pointing to previously.



28

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.970

So now we're pushing this into our exercise array.



29

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.980

However I don't just want to push it like dead.



30

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.470

I will instead push a new object because I want to add some properties to first of all with the spread



31

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.310

operator.



32

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.010

We can copy all the properties of the running exercise.



33

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.410

However I now also want to set a date which is just new date so the date when we completed the exercise



34

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.780

and I'll set the stage to complete.



35

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.390

Dessous the object and want to push two exercises.



36

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:07.080

If we don't cancel it but regularly finish it now for cancelling the exercise is a bit different.



37

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.420

All copy the code from complete exercise.



38

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.600

I still want to set the running exercise for null and amidst this event I also still want to push the



39

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.820

exercise to my array of exercises but of course the state will be cancelled and I also need to override



40

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:33.010

the duration because we didn't complete the entire exercise and the calories.



41

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.620

So let's assume that uncancel exercise we get the progress we made.



42

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.380

This allows us to calculate how many calories we burned and how much of the duration we actually finished



43

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:54.460

their duration is this running exercise duration times progress divided by 100.



44

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.040

Because progress goes all the way up to 100.



45

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:06.670

And for calories it's running exercise duration times progress divided by a 100.



46

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.910

Now we're storing the exercise as we well did complete or to be precise.



47

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.560

Cancelbot now with all that set up we should actually already switch in training component whenever



48

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.380

we stop or cancel or complete it successfully because we have a subscription to the exercise changed



49

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.530

and if it's now then ongoing training is set to false and current training.



50

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.250

Well here we need to adjust something we no longer emit training exit.



51

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.590

Instead here I access this trading service cancel.



52

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.310

In this case here because we did cancel and there I need to pass the current progress so I passed this



53

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:59.560

progress indie resume or start a resume timer method here if progress reaches 100 were also done.



54

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:08.550

This is where I want to call this training service complete exercise and I don't need to pass anything



55

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.520

here.



56

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.780

With that if we save all these files let's again log in with some dummy data and let's try this out.



57

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:24.000

Let's start some crunches here and let's wait for this to complete regularly without as clicking stop



58

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.520

or anything like that.



59

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:34.080

And this should now take 40 seconds so I'll quickly fast forward to when this is almost done and we're



60

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.220

pretty much done years so we're.



61

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.200

And of course we don't see if this was saved but we'll soon see it.



62

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.080

Now let's start it again and actually stop and continue.



63

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.210

So that looks good to me.



64

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.740

And stop and really quit and we're all the way back or this is all working would be nice to see all



65

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.940

our past exercises both complete and cancelled underdosed past exercises tab now.



66

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.340

Finally this is where we will use a number of angular material component and connected to our data.
