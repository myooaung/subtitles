1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,980
In the last lecture we added a shared module.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,790
Let's now finish this whole module thing by splitting up our routes.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Right now we get this app routing module and then we get the welcome component as well as the off routes

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,310
and the trading route.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,630
Now if you think about it the trading route doesn't make a lot of sense here because the training route

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,620
should belong to the training module and the off routes should belong to the off module.

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,020
So this is something I also want to do now.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:42,970
I want to put these routes into their modules for the all module I'll simply cut them.

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,070
Go to my folder and add up all the routing module Katia's fall.

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,620
It's considered a good practice to always put routes into a separate module so named the file off routing

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,420
module and this will become a eagerly loaded routing file.

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:10,900
So here I am Engy module which we of course as you know have to import from at a singular core and in

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,490
that Engy module I want to set up my routes so I'll add my routes constant which is of type routes which

14
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,160
is imported from.

15
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,950
Angular router like this which is an array of routes and I just cut the routes so add them here.

16
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,150
These two objects sign up and log in component.

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,670
We need to import them here.

18
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:44,940
So we'll add imports to sign up component from the Sign-Up folder and an import to log in component

19
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,650
from the log in folder of course.

20
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:56,100
Now we get the Router Set up and now we can go to ngi module here and add imports and import the router

21
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,560
module which is coming from the angle or router package too.

22
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,960
So this module and here we don't call for root.

23
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,060
We only call that what's in an angular app and that isn't the routing module.

24
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,090
Instead we call for child and this will then merge it with a router.

25
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:23,310
Behind the scenes here we pass our routes and then we have to make sure that we export this router module.

26
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,050
And now we can import it into the off Marchal.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,410
So the app not the app to you off routing module is now imported here added to the imports array and

28
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,620
the imports statement is also added pointing to the off routing module file with this.

29
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,180
These routes should still be available globally.

30
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,330
So in our application even though we don't have these routes and the app routing module anymore here

31
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,100
we can also remove the imports of Sign-Up component and log in component.

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,190
Now let's compile that and see if this works.

33
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:05,570
If the app loads and i log out we still can switch between Sign-Up and log in even though we put that

34
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,550
into a separate file.

35
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,760
Now it's worth mentioning that this is loaded eagerly.

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,700
So we're not using lazy loading here.

37
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,550
We use for child to add these routes to the global routes set up.

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,880
But we're doing this right at the start of the app because of education needs to be available right

39
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,300
at the start.

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:31,750
We now can also go on and have a look at the training component and see what we can do with that.
