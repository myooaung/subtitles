00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,480
In a nutshell, what is a CSV file?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,280
First of all, it is a file format that relies on text files.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,840
So a CSV file is a text file.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,750
Think of an Excel file.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,800
An Excel file is just a table with columns and lines.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,220
Each line could be seen as a record, and each column is a field of that record.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,560
Well, this is how a CSV file is structured really.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,630
Three columns.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,940
The first column is a name, the second column is an age,

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,380
and the third column is a city where that person is supposed to live in,

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:44,000
for instance. And a certain number of lines, each line representing a certain person.
