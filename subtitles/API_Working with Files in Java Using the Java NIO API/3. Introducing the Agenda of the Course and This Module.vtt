00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.580
First, let us see what the path is. The path is an interface,

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.140
and the path is not a file.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.440
You may have some knowledge of this old file object

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.280
from the very early days of JavaOne, 1995,

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.980
1996.

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.260
Not that young.

7
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.760
And we have a second object now in the JDK called the

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.930
path object that we are going to cover.

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:37.000
We are going to cover the patterns on how to create a path, fairly simple, and we are going to see what can be done with this path object.
