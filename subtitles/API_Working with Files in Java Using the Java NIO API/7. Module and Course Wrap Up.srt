1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,610
All right.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,840
So I think we are done with this module.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,460
Let us make a quick wrapâ€‘up of all you saw in it.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,540
Basically what you saw is how to interact with files in directories.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,350
First, you saw how to move files around with very simple patterns.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,210
And second,

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,770
you saw how to look for information in a set of

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,590
directories with basically two patterns.

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,030
The first one is a find pattern and the second one is the

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,040
walk pattern with two flavors of it.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,740
The first one uses a FileVisitor and the second one uses the Stream API.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,430
And since this is the last module of this course,

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,460
let's also wrap up this course.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,590
This course is both about text files and the patterns

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,540
introduced in Java NIO and NIO.2 in the JDK.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,430
So, you saw how to deal with text files,

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,490
write and read content, text content in text files.

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,080
You saw how to deal with those weird errors

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,450
generated by using the wrong charsets.

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,500
We saw that.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,620
You also saw how to analyze a CSV file using the Stream API.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,270
And then you saw how to move files in a set of directory,

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,840
how to find files in those directories using a B predicate, and

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,590
also how to traverse a set of directories,

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,180
a hierarchy of directories, gathering information with two patterns,

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,200
a visitor and the map/filter/reduce pattern.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,230
And I think we are done with this course,

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,880
so I would like to thank you for following it.

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,260
I just hope that you found it interesting.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,680
If you want to know more about the Java space,

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,000
about Java technical aspects of everything what's going on

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,470
in Java, you can follow me on Twitter.

33
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,330
You can check my GitHub account.

34
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,580
I've got several open source projects that you may find interesting. And I

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,980
give many talks in many conferences all around the world.

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,840
If you're interested in that, you can also check my YouTube channel.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you for watching this course, and I hope to see you next time here on Pluralsight.
