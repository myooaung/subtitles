Hello.

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.900
My name is Jose. Welcome back to this course. We are going to talk about

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.110
reading and writing text files using the Java NIO API.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.720
First,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.840
we are going to cover this very simple question, why text and

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.730
binary content have been separated in the Java IO API. And then

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.160
we are going to see two things, first,

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.420
how to read the contents of a text file and then how to write to a text file

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:45.000
using the NIO API. And we will also cover this weird thing called a CharSet that causes so many headaches in nowaday applications.
