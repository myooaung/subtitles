00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.830
So on the one hand, we have text files. And on the

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.990
other one, we have binary files.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.640
Java provides classes to read and write both types of files.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.440
The classes provided to read and write text files are Reader and Writer,

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.550
further extended by many classes. And for binary files, the

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.120
corresponding classes are InputStream to read binary files and

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.720
OutputStream to write binary files. Those four classes have been created

8
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.750
in Java IO back in 1995, and they are still used today to read and write

9
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:53.000
text or binary content to files. So let us concentrate on text files, readers, and writers.
