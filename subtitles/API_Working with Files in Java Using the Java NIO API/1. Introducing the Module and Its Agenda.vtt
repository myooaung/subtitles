Hello, my name is Jose.

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.020
Welcome back for the last module of this course. We're going to talk about how

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.130
to move files around a file system using the Java NIO API.

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.720
We're going to see how to create, copy and delete files.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.240
Also, how to rename them.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.630
And we're going to see how to look for a specific file in a set of directories.

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.460
And lastly,

8
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.240
and this is the example we'll cover in the live demo part of

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.720
this module, we are going to see the walk pattern that allows

10
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:45.000
you to walk through a hierarchy directories looking for some information. So let us do that.
