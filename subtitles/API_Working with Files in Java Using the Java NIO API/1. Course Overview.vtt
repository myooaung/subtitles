Hello, my name is Jose.

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.870
I'm a Java Champion and JavaOne Rock Star.

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.080
I'm talking to you from Paris where I live,

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.930
and I'm so very happy to present my new course,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.130
Working with Files in Java Using the NIO API. In just 1 hour,

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.980
this course shows you two things, first,

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.900
how to handle files using the Files factory class and, second,

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.010
how to deal with text files in Java.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.770
First, you will see how to read files, and they're with

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.450
existing formats not compatible with UTFâ€‘8.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.640
I will also show you the exceptions thrown by buggy code and how to fix them.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
Then, you will see how to analyze the CSV file using the map filter

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.000
use approach implemented using the stream API.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.330
You will map text lines to create objects and filter them

15
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.150
to remove common style, and you will also flatmap them to

16
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.340
deal with buggy CSV lines.

17
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.170
Second,

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.640
you will see how to find files in a hierarchy of directories using the

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.860
walk file tree pattern and then how to analyze a directory structure with

20
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.340
a map filter reduce approach using the walk pattern. Even if this hour is

21
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.730
packed with information, don't worry.

22
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.050
It's also full of examples and use case analysis.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm very happy to be your steward for this new course, and I can't wait to see how you will leverage all this in your applications.
