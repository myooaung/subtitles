00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,240
Before we move on, who are you and what do you need to

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,030
know to be able to further this course. The prerequisites

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,040
of this course are very basic.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,600
Basically,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,020
this is a Java course so you need to have at least some basic

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,180
knowledge of the Java language and its basic API. I'm thinking of the

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,980
collection framework, for instance. You also need to be able to write

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,240
a simple Java program in your favorite IDE, whether it is Eclipse or

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,140
IntelliJ. And, of course, you also need to know what a file system is,

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,650
what a file is, what a directory is.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,760
What does it mean to create symbolic links between elements and this

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,000
kind of thing. All this is very basic knowledge. So if you're okay with it, let us move on.
