00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,960
All right, I think that we are done with this module.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,170
Let us do a quick wrapâ€‘up.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,480
This module is mostly a use case study,

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,290
how to leverage the Stream API to analyze a CSV file. And you

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,280
can see that the JDK is not made of isolated modules that you

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,240
are going to use one by one.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,030
We use the Java IO NIO stuff to read the file, and we could

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,350
connect it to the Stream API to make sense out of the data

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,260
that was held in this file.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,040
And this is exactly what Java is about.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,140
So we have one more point to cover in this course, how to move files

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,890
around the file system from one directory to another, and also how to see

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,650
the walk pattern that allows one to get information from within a set of

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,840
directory, the structure of directory.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,000
So let us see that. I hope to meet you in the last module of this course in a second.
