1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,830
How can you create instances of this path object? Path is an interface.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,980
So to create instances of it, to get instances of path,

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,730
you have to use factory methods.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,040
Now we have two patterns to create those path instances. The original

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,690
patterns from Java 7 use a Paths factory class with an s,

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,940
and we have two get factory methods on this factory class.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,330
And starting with Java 11,

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,360
we have factory methods directly on this path interface.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,890
Why don't we have these path factory methods directly on

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,160
the interface right from the beginning?

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,530
Well,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,870
just because in Java 7 it was not possible to

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,040
create factory method on interfaces.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,160
This became possible starting with Java 8, so it has been introduced later on.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,680
So let us see those patterns.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,520
The first one is called the get method. And to this get method,

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,750
you just give a string a character,

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,110
representing the path on the file system that will access the file

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,850
or directory you need. The second one gets this path element by

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,570
element without giving the separator, and the factory method will

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,570
create the path accordingly.

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,980
And you also have a third one that is going to take a URI as a parameter.

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,400
Now you have a pattern to create this URI,

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,610
which uses another factory method. And once this URI has been created, you can

25
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,270
pass it to this get factory method to get your path instance.

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,340
And if you are using Java 11 or later,

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,020
you can also use the of factory method directly

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,740
accessible from this path interface.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:02:00,000
So here are the main patterns on how to create a path instance on the default file system of your application.
