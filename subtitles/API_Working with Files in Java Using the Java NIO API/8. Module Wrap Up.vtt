00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.220
So that's it for this introduction on this path

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.140
object. Let us do a quick wrapâ€‘up.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.440
We saw what path is really as an instance of the path interface from Java 7.

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.250
We saw how to create instances of path using the various factory methods

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.430
from the Paths factory class and the path interface itself. And we saw the

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.570
different patterns on how to check for file and directories on the file

7
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.350
system using the Files factory class.

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
Now that we have that covered, let us move on to the next module.

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.000
You are going to see how to read and write text content to files. See you there in a second.
