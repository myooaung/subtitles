00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,940
First question, what tool do we have in this API to move files around?

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,300
Well,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,000
it all turns around this Files factory class that

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,330
has a set of methods, to create, to delete,

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:23,680
to copy and to move files from one place to the other of the file system.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:32,000
Basically, all the methods are in this Files factory class, and you just need to use them.
