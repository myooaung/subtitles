00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] So now we're going to go about and set up

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.007
our first microservice.

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.004
Open up your IDE and either create an empty project

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.004
to start with or use the blank project

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.007
that I have in the exercise files.

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.008
Now I say blank but there actually are a few

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.009
folders in there for some data that we are going to

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.000
use later on on in the course.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.006
But for now, go either way.

10
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.001
From within there, we're going to create a new module.

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, each IDE is a little bit different about how to do

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.002
a new module, and if you don't want to do it

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.000
through the module mechanism,

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.008
you can always go to

15
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.009
start.spring.io to create your project.

16
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.009
But in this case, I'm going to create a new module,

17
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.005
and I'm going to go ahead and use the spring initializer.

18
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:47.008
now I'm running this on Java 11.

19
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:49.001
So go ahead and load this up,

20
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.005
I'm going to it in a group name of

21
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.009
com.frankmoley.ll

22
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:58.006
and this artifact we are going to call guest-services.

23
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.007
Again I'll select java 11.

24
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:05.005
and we'll leave everything else the way it is.

25
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.009
Now we need to pick a few dependencies,

26
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.007
so we're going to choose spring web

27
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.001
and from the sequel area,

28
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:18.000
we're going to choose Spring Data JPA and the H2 Database.

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.004
Go ahead and select next.

30
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.008
Make sure that everything looks the way we want it to,

31
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.009
and we'll go ahead and finish,

32
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.001
and allow that application to be created.

33
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.003
So now let's go ahead and open up our

34
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.009
guest-services application.

35
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.003
Now, right now Mavin is downloading all the dependencies,

36
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:36.001
and that's fine.

37
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.008
We're going to go to source main resources,

38
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.004
and I'll put up our application of properties file,

39
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:42.006
and we're going to add a property

40
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.006
that we are going to need later on.

41
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.008
So we'll just going ahead and add it now.

42
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:51.001
So spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto

43
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.006
and we're are going to set that equal to none.

44
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.005
Now, right now it's not resolving because Mavin's

45
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:56.009
downloading in my IDE,

46
00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.007
once Mavin has downloaded that property will resolve.

47
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.001
Now as that going on,

48
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.006
I want you to open up the DBdata folder that came

49
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:08.002
with the exercise files, and you'll see

50
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.005
that we have a guest-services folder in there

51
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:11.007
and there's two files

52
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.007
a data.sql and a schemea.sql.

53
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.004
I want you to copy those files,

54
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:21.000
and drop them into the resources location.

55
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.002
And you'll see that we've a whole bunch

56
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.005
of data up and running.

57
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.006
That's all that we need to do get started

58
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.001
and in the next videos we'll actually

59
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.000
develop out this microservice.
