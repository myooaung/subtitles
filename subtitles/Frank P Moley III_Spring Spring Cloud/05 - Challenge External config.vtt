00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.004
(bubbly upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.002
- [Instructor] So now it's time for another challenge

3
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.008
and this time we're going to do that challenge

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.007
using the config server.

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.000
So here is that challenge.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.005
I want you to consume the config server

7
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.004
with our other two microservices.

8
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.005
You need to ensure that they all come up

9
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.006
on the correct port and you should now be able

10
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:26.009
to run all four services at the same time.

11
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.000
Give it a go and I'll be back to you with the solution.
