00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.000
- Cloud-native applications are one of the most

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
impactful ways to build applications

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.003
for the global population.

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.005
We build applications that are able to run

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.007
close to the user with all the dependencies needed

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.009
to run that application.

7
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.006
This translates to an intense ability

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.000
to deliver applications to customers

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that operate efficiently.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.009
When building Java applications for the cloud,

11
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.007
the Spring Cloud set of projects increases

12
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.008
the speed of developing cloud-native systems.

13
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.007
Spring Boot mixed with Spring Cloud

14
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.000
gives developers a rapid starting point

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and powerful abstractions for building

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.003
cloud-native as well as micro-services based systems.

17
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.003
Hi, my name is Frank Moley, a software developer

18
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.006
and architect that has been living and breathing

19
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.007
cloud-based application development for many years.

20
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.007
I have helped transition organizations

21
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.003
to the cloud using cloud-native application

22
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:02.003
development practices and tools, including Spring Cloud.

23
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.008
In this course, I will walk through with you

24
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:07.004
how to build applications using Spring Boot

25
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.003
and some of the core parts of Spring Cloud

26
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.007
so you too can move rapidly to either

27
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.000
a public or private cloud.
