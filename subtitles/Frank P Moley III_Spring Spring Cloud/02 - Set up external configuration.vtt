00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- So, now we're going to go about

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:05.007
the process of setting up an external config repository

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.007
on our local machine.

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.008
I've already gone ahead and saved the exercise files

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.005
for this course on my desktop.

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.007
All right, I'm going to copy recursively

7
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.003
from the exercise files,

8
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.006
chapter two,

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.004
02, 02,

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.001
02, 02 begin,

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.001
spring cloud

12
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:29.002
and config

13
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.004
and I will move that to my desktop.

14
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.006
I'll move it into this config folder

15
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.005
and I'm going to do a git init.

16
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.008
And I'm going to do a git add on all.

17
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:41.009
I'm going to to a git commit -m,

18
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:46.009
initial commit of directory.

19
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.004
Now, if you actually want to just manually do this,

20
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.002
we can go take a look at one of these files here,

21
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:54.005
and you'll see that all I've done is,

22
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.004
I've denoted a server port,

23
00:00:56.004 --> 00:01:00.002
so the guest services properties file,

24
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.004
has a server port of 8800.

25
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.005
The room services properties file is 8801.

26
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.009
And the reservation services property file is 8802.

27
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.001
So if you don't want to just copy and do all of that,

28
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.002
you can create three individual files with these values.

29
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.001
Just make sure that you add them all via git,

30
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.005
and them commit them,

31
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.000
so that you can use them in our next video.
