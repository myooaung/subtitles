00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:05.005
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.008
- [Instructor] So now that we've seen how to do

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.005
one Feign call, and how to use Eureka

4
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.009
to make those calls possible,

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.002
we're going to implement a challenge exercise now

6
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.009
to complete this service that we started writing.

7
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.002
So here's the requirements of this service,

8
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.000
and this will be the room reservation service,

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.004
to be clear.

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.008
So you need to create clients

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.004
for the guest and the reservation services.

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:29.009
Now if you don't want to use Feign

13
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.002
and you want to try out ribbon,

14
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.004
that's definitely acceptable.

15
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.003
But essentially you've got to make that web service call.

16
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:36.007
From the room reservation service

17
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.005
to both the guest and the reservation services respectively.

18
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.007
You need to populate all of the data

19
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.009
from that room reservation object

20
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.007
from all of the services for a given date.

21
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.008
And in order to use that given date,

22
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.001
you're going to need to modify

23
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.006
the underlying reservation service

24
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.001
to take a date and make the data call

25
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.002
to accept data as well.

26
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.004
And then you're going to need to use a date format

27
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.004
of year, year, year, year,

28
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.004
dash, month, month, dash, DD.

29
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.003
That way you can accept that date from the web service

30
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.006
translated into a Java Date or a SQL Date

31
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.005
and then pass it down to the database to get data back.

32
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.000
That's your challenge and I'll be back with a solution.
