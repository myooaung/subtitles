(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:06.008
- [Instructor] So now it's time for you

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.003
to have your first challenge.

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.008
And that is to go ahead and build your own data service

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.008
based on the data that I've provided.

6
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:16.004
So let's talk a little bit about what that's going to be.

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.002
I'm going to ask you to implement one of the two data services

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.006
or you can pick both if you want to.

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.002
But you're going to use the data payloads

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:26.003
that I've already provided in the DB data folder.

11
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:28.001
The two services that we need to provide

12
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:29.005
is one for reservations,

13
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:31.008
and that's going to be called the reservation service,

14
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.005
and the other one is the room services.

15
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.009
Both of which are going to be basically identical

16
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.006
to our guest services.

17
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.007
Obviously the entities are going to be different,

18
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.009
but that's all we need to do,

19
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.006
is go ahead and do the same web service methods,

20
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.004
same interface and use the appropriate data payload.

21
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:49.005
So take a little bit of time.

22
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.000
Get this done, and I'll be back to you

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with a solution of my own.
