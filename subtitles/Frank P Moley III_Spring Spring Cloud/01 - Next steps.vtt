00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] We have only scratched the surface

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.002
of Spring Cloud, and you have a great opportunity

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.009
for looking at what is next.

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.005
But before we look ahead, let's take a moment

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:13.003
and look back a bit.

6
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.000
We started by talking about Spring Cloud and microservices

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then built a couple.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.007
We then brought in externalized configuration

9
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.008
and hooked it up to our microservices.

10
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:28.001
We then investigated the need for service discovery

11
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.000
and tied it all together.

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.004
We then leveraged that service discovery

13
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.009
to consume our services, and that's really

14
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.001
where the power starts to come in

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.004
of Spring Cloud in a cloud-native

16
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.006
microservices-based architecture.

17
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.003
So where might you go next?

18
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.002
First and foremost, I encourage you to explore

19
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.000
the rich open-source additions Netflix and others

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.007
have brought to the plate, including Hystrix,

21
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.002
which is a powerful circuit breaker.

22
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.009
I also invite you to look at various abstractions

23
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.003
on common cloud offerings

24
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.007
for various cloud providers.

25
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:08.002
And finally, I invite you to look at building microservices

26
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:11.003
yourself for containerized infrastructures

27
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.008
like Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry

28
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.001
using the rich integrations provided by

29
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.007
Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

30
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.000
And at end, I really want to say thank you.

31
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.005
I know that your time is valuable

32
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.006
and I do appreciate feedback,

33
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.005
both in the LinkedIn learning platform

34
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.008
as well as on social media.

35
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.006
You often will find me getting requests for help

36
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.008
via the Q&A section here on LinkedIn Learning,

37
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:37.004
so please, if you have a request

38
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.007
that is going to take me looking at your code

39
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.000
to come up with an answer, I ask you

40
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.006
to go ahead and submit that GitHub

41
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.006
and put it on the question.

42
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.000
It'll just save us a little bit of back and forth.

43
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.007
But I am more than happy to take a look

44
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:51.008
at what you're dealing with,

45
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:54.003
and if I can help out, I will.

46
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.008
I hope you found this course valuable,

47
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.002
and again, always keep learning,

48
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:00.009
because if you keep learning

49
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.002
and you start teaching what you learn,

50
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.000
you never know what will be next.
