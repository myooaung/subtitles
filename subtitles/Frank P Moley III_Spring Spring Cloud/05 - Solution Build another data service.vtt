00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.002
(futuristic music)

2
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.008
- So now it's time to take a look at a Solution

3
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.009
to Building the Data Services.

4
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.008
(mumbling) here I've created two new modules.

5
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:15.003
One for the reservation services

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.000
and one for the room services

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.004
and both of them are exactly identical,

8
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.005
with of course the data being different,

9
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.002
but I've created a couple of classes here.

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.000
So one for the enevy which I've annotated

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.005
correctly based on the schema data.

12
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.009
I have a repository interface

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.002
that has no details other than the repository.

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.002
And I have a web service that is marked

15
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.005
with a res controller the appropriate request

16
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.003
mapping and then a

17
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.005
get operation and a get by idea operation.

18
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.006
Now right now if we try to start up all three

19
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.006
of our web services,

20
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.003
they would fail because they're all going to run

21
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.001
on the default port.

22
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.004
We could go in and modify that in the application

23
00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:58.003
on properties files,

24
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.004
but we're going to configure that a little bit later.

25
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:02.004
So what I'm going to to here is,

26
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.005
I'm just going to jump in and we will start up

27
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.004
an application such as our room web services.

28
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.007
This is a nice little window

29
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.000
that I get with IntelliJay,

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that allows me to run multiple

31
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.002
spring boot applications at once.

32
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.001
It's the same as running the main method

33
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.000
that you would do in your IDE or running

34
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.001
it from the command lines.

35
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.009
So I'm just going to start the application.

36
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.008
Once it's up, jump into my web browser,

37
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:33.008
make sure that it responds,

38
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.003
and indeed I get room data.

39
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:38.002
And then make sure that it's responding by IDE,

40
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.007
and I get single room data.

41
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:44.000
So now we go back to the IDE and I'll stop

42
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.006
that application,

43
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.009
and I will start up my reservations application.

44
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.003
And once that's up and running,

45
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.004
we'll go back to the web browser

46
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:59.007
and go to the closed ADE/reservations

47
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:03.003
and I have one reservation in the system.

48
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.005
And we can go to one and still see that reservation.

49
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.003
Again all of this data came from the data

50
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.001
that sequel file and all of this schema

51
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.009
came from the schema.dot sequel files

52
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.005
as part of spring data,

53
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.006
but all and all we've got the application

54
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:18.007
running the way we expect.

55
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.007
So we are good to proceed to the next step

56
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.006
and that's in the next chapter

57
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:26.000
where we'll start bringing in external configuration.
