00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] In order to be successful in this course,

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:07.001
there are a few prerequisites in both knowledge and software

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.000
that you need to be prepared for.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.007
First and foremost on the list of requirements

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:15.003
for this course is the Java programming language.

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:19.000
While Spring does indeed support using Kotlin and Groovy,

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.007
we will focus on using Java.

8
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.004
I expect you to have at least an intermediate knowledge

9
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.005
of the Java programming language.

10
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.008
We won't be going into any deep or complex data structures

11
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:33.000
or programming constructs, but you will need to be able

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.002
to hold your own from a development perspective.

13
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.007
We will be building applications

14
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:39.009
using the Spring Cloud projects,

15
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:44.000
so our focus on Java will be quick and mostly ignored,

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.005
so you will need to keep up on your own.

17
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:47.004
For this course,

18
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.008
we will be using the Java Development Kit version 11.

19
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.002
You need to ensure that you have a JDK installed

20
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.009
on your machine and not just a JRE,

21
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.007
installing this from either OpenJDK or Oracle.

22
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:01.005
Either one has detailed instructions

23
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.003
for your operating system.

24
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:07.004
And if you need to install a JDK, follow those instructions.

25
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:08.009
Finally, on the Java front,

26
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.000
I ask that you have experience running Java applications

27
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.005
either from the command line or via your IDE.

28
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.008
I will for the most part be using my IDE

29
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:19.006
to run the applications

30
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.004
because the IDE that I use has a nice dashboard

31
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.001
for running multiple applications at once.

32
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.004
However, that isn't a requirement.

33
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.003
As long as you can open a terminal

34
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.005
and execute the run commands for a Java application,

35
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.004
package it as a JAR, you will be fine.

36
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.005
This course is a Spring course,

37
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.004
so there is an expectation of knowledge

38
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.007
of the Spring Framework.

39
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:46.000
Basic knowledge is sufficient for this course.

40
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.009
While we will be focusing on Spring Cloud,

41
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.006
we will rely heavily on other parts of the Spring Framework

42
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:56.006
to build our applications to show how Spring Cloud works.

43
00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.008
If you feel that you want a quick refresher on Spring,

44
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.002
I have a course here on LinkedIn Learning

45
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.007
called Learning Spring with Spring Boot,

46
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.002
as well as Spring Boot 2 Essential Training.

47
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.008
The basics of understanding should be enough

48
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.002
to move through this course, but I will move rather fast

49
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.005
through the basic Spring constructs.

50
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.003
If you are not super comfortable with Spring,

51
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:20.008
I would encourage you to run

52
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:25.000
through some of my other courses on the framework.

53
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.002
On the same note, I expect you to know

54
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:30.001
how Spring Boot itself functions.

55
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.003
Tasks like configuration and auto-configuration

56
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.008
will be mostly ran through quickly

57
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.002
for basic Spring constructs.

58
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.007
Again, if you need a refresher,

59
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:44.003
check out the other courses that I have on Spring.

60
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:47.000
Some of the other Spring packages that we will look at

61
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.007
in this course are Spring Data, Spring MVC,

62
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:54.003
and the using of RestTemplate to make web service calls.

63
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.001
Most of the use of these constructs

64
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:57.007
will be pretty straightforward,

65
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:00.004
and we will give it a pretty cursory look.

66
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:04.002
But any previous knowledge will be very helpful.

67
00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:06.004
Again, we touch on most of this

68
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:09.007
in my other courses that I previously mentioned.

69
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:13.000
Microservices are a way of building applications such

70
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.002
that they can be decomposed into smaller units of work.

71
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:21.003
Spring Cloud thrives in a microservices architecture.

72
00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:23.005
And as such, there is a need for us

73
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:26.007
to look at microservices in more depth.

74
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:29.004
Most of these topics are covered in depth

75
00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:32.008
in my course Microservices Foundations here

76
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:35.001
on the LinkedIn Learning catalog.

77
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.009
One of the first basic things you should understand

78
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:42.000
is the concept of domains and domain-driven development.

79
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.002
We will be building microservices-based applications

80
00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:47.004
using domain constructs.

81
00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:49.008
As such, an understanding of them

82
00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:52.008
will help you move forward in this course.

83
00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:54.009
Part of that understanding will help accept

84
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.000
why Spring Cloud can be so needed

85
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.009
in a microservices-based architecture.

86
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:04.001
You should understand why microservices are so powerful

87
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.008
in a cloud made of architecture as well.

88
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:09.003
And as such, this knowledge will help you understand

89
00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:11.000
why we are building applications

90
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.002
in this way for this course.

91
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.008
Furthermore, I ask that you understand scaling

92
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:21.006
in systems as a whole, specifically horizontal scaling.

93
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:24.006
12-factor application methodologies are designed

94
00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:26.009
for cloud native applications.

95
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.000
I have a course on LinkedIn Learning specifically

96
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.008
on understanding 12-factor application development.

97
00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:35.002
I encourage you to check it out.

98
00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:36.007
I would like you to know the basics

99
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.009
of 12-factor applications from the perspective

100
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.007
of what they mean for application development

101
00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:45.002
of cloud native applications.

102
00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:49.004
The details of each factor are not critical for this course,

103
00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:51.002
but they will be critical for you

104
00:04:51.002 --> 00:04:55.006
in building cloud native applications after this course.

105
00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:57.001
For the purposes of this course,

106
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.005
you should understand the drive

107
00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:01.006
behind using externalized configuration.

108
00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:04.008
This knowledge will be integral to understanding the reasons

109
00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:07.000
behind the framework we will set up

110
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.005
from Netflix in our runtime.

111
00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:11.009
You should also understand the benefits

112
00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.008
of service discovery in a microservices architecture.

113
00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:19.000
We will be leveraging constructs again from Netflix

114
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.003
to build this out.

115
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.009
The last of the requirements from the this course comes

116
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.002
from the software that you will need

117
00:05:24.002 --> 00:05:26.008
to have installed on your machine.

118
00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:30.008
As we have already discussed, you will need a JDK installed.

119
00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:33.004
You will also need to have Apache Maven.

120
00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:36.008
You can get instructions for installing Apache Maven

121
00:05:36.008 --> 00:05:39.002
directly from the Apache website.

122
00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:42.001
You should also have an IDE installed.

123
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:43.009
Now, you can obviously write all of your code

124
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.003
with a text editor, but I wouldn't advise it.

125
00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:50.009
Understand your IDE and how to use it effectively.

126
00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.004
I will be using IntelliJ Ultimate Edition for development,

127
00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:56.000
and it may have some features

128
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.009
that you need to find in your own IDE,

129
00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.004
but most of them available

130
00:06:00.004 --> 00:06:04.005
on the market have the same feature set via plugins.

131
00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:07.001
I will also be using Google Chrome as a browser

132
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:09.002
to show various service calls.

133
00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:12.000
And to make the JSON a little bit more clean,

134
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.005
I use a plugin for JSON viewing.

135
00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:19.003
I also use a tool called HTTPie as a replacement for cURL

136
00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:22.000
to execute web calls from the terminal,

137
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.003
but this tool is completely optional,

138
00:06:24.003 --> 00:06:27.007
and cURL will work just fine if you're comfortable with it.

139
00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:31.000
So now let's get going with Spring Cloud.
