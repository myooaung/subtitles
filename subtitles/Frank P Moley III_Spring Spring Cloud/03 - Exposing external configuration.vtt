00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] So now we're going to go through the process

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:07.001
of turning on a configuration server, using Spring Boot.

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.004
Back in your IDE, let's create a new module once again,

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.003
and again, you can do this through start.spring.io,

5
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.001
or with the plugins built in to your IDE.

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.001
I'm just going to use the built in plugin,

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:27.009
select Java 11, set this to com.frankmoley.lil,

8
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.004
and we're going to call this project config-server,

9
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.009
make sure we choose 11 here as well.

10
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:39.005
Now, I'm going to select down in the Spring Cloud Config,

11
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:47.004
the Config Server, select next, and select finish.

12
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.008
Now allow Maven to do it's importing here,

13
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.007
let me go ahead and open up this module.

14
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.009
The first place that I'm going to go is to source, main,

15
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:59.009
resources, and I'm going to open up the application.properties.

16
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.004
Now I want to specify where my server is going to run,

17
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:07.003
so we're going to run our server on port 9000,

18
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.003
we're also going to add a couple other properties

19
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.004
related to Spring Cloud,

20
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:17.004
so spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri,

21
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:21.005
and this is the URI where we're going to load our config from.

22
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.000
Now I'm on a POSIC system,

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.005
so I'm going to do it from ${HOME}/Desktop/config,

24
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.004
case sensitive of course.

25
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.003
Now, if you're on a Windows machine,

26
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:40.003
you're going to want to do that to

27
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:50.005
${user.home}\\Desktop\\config,

28
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.009
and that's going to give you the same value.

29
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.003
Now we're going to add one more in here,

30
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:55.002
and that's going to be

31
00:01:55.002 --> 00:02:00.008
spring.cloud.config.server.git.force-pull,

32
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.003
and we're going to set this equal to true,

33
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:06.003
that way we can make sure that we refresh our config server,

34
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.001
anytime we make a change.

35
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.001
Now we've got one more thing to add,

36
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.002
and that's going to be up in source, main, java,

37
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:16.001
in our base package, in our application.

38
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:21.006
We are going to add @EnableConfigServer,

39
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.003
and that's it, we're ready to go.

40
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:27.005
I'm going to bring up my run window here,

41
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:33.006
for my services, and I will start my config server.

42
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.005
Again, this is the same as running MAID,

43
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.005
or running it from the command line,

44
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:41.005
this is just how I'm choosing to do this right now.

45
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:45.002
Allow it to do all of it's compilation and downloading.

46
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:48.001
Now our service is up and running on port 9000,

47
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.005
so let's jump over to a web browser,

48
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:51.004
and where we're going to go is

49
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:56.004
we're going to go to localhost:9000,

50
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.001
and here's where the configuration starts to go.

51
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:05.003
So, we're going to go to guestservices/default,

52
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:08.002
and what you'll see is that the guest services properties

53
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:12.000
file gets loaded at guestservices/default

54
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.008
because we haven't specified our profile,

55
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:17.000
we just used raw properties so everything is default,

56
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and you'll see that we have a server port here on line 16,

57
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.006
of 8800, and what that's saying is

58
00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:26.001
that we've now loaded our configuration

59
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.003
and exposed it through a rest web service

60
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:33.005
so that anyone who reads this will get a server.port of 8800

61
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:37.005
as the configuration for the guestservices application,

62
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.003
and now we're going to get ready to use this,

63
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.000
in our next video.
