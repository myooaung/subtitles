00:00:01,434  -->  00:00:03,606
<v Jonas>So, as I said in the last lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,606  -->  00:00:05,386
the next step in our project
3

3

00:00:05,386  -->  00:00:07,292
is to build amazing navigation
4

4

00:00:07,292  -->  00:00:10,092
that I showed you earlier.
5

5

00:00:10,092  -->  00:00:11,470
And now that you thought that I was running
6

6

00:00:11,470  -->  00:00:13,395
out of new stuff to teach you,
7

7

00:00:13,395  -->  00:00:17,265
well I have a bunch more to show you right now.
8

8

00:00:17,265  -->  00:00:19,726
So this is what you're gonna learn in this section.
9

9

00:00:19,726  -->  00:00:21,076
So first of all,
10

10

00:00:21,076  -->  00:00:22,697
the so called checkbox hack
11

11

00:00:22,697  -->  00:00:24,821
is how this navigation works.
12

12

00:00:24,821  -->  00:00:27,713
And so, you learn how that works of course.
13

13

00:00:27,713  -->  00:00:29,853
Then you'll learn how to create custom
14

14

00:00:29,853  -->  00:00:34,074
animation timing functions using cubic bezier curves.
15

15

00:00:34,074  -->  00:00:36,599
Then, how to animate the solid-color gradients
16

16

00:00:36,599  -->  00:00:38,570
that we talked about before
17

17

00:00:38,570  -->  00:00:40,270
to create a nice hover effect.
18

18

00:00:40,270  -->  00:00:42,852
And finally, how and why to use
19

19

00:00:42,852  -->  00:00:45,042
the transform-origin property.
20

20

00:00:45,042  -->  00:00:46,676
So that's also new.
21

21

00:00:46,676  -->  00:00:48,024
Overall, you're just gonna learn
22

22

00:00:48,024  -->  00:00:50,747
how to create a creative effect in CSS
23

23

00:00:50,747  -->  00:00:53,518
with about 150 lines of code.
24

24

00:00:53,518  -->  00:00:57,126
So that's what this navigation needs.
25

25

00:00:57,126  -->  00:00:58,976
All right, so let's take a detailed look
26

26

00:00:58,976  -->  00:01:01,038
at how this navigation works.
27

27

00:01:01,038  -->  00:01:03,041
So first of all, it stays at the same place
28

28

00:01:03,041  -->  00:01:05,946
no matter where we scroll to on our page.
29

29

00:01:05,946  -->  00:01:08,153
So this button always stays here.
30

30

00:01:08,153  -->  00:01:09,268
Then when we hover it,
31

31

00:01:09,268  -->  00:01:11,226
we have this effect where the lines open
32

32

00:01:11,226  -->  00:01:12,235
a bit like this.
33

33

00:01:12,235  -->  00:01:15,311
And then when you click it becomes an X.
34

34

00:01:15,311  -->  00:01:16,472
You see?
35

35

00:01:16,472  -->  00:01:19,929
But then of course, you have this huge background here
36

36

00:01:19,929  -->  00:01:22,196
coming basically from behind this button,
37

37

00:01:22,196  -->  00:01:24,291
expanding all over the page,
38

38

00:01:24,291  -->  00:01:26,325
and revealing this navigation here
39

39

00:01:26,325  -->  00:01:29,568
coming in from the left side, right.
40

40

00:01:29,568  -->  00:01:30,913
So and then you have, of course,
41

41

00:01:30,913  -->  00:01:32,522
the navigation with these five links.
42

42

00:01:32,522  -->  00:01:33,758
And when you hover them,
43

43

00:01:33,758  -->  00:01:36,841
you have this nice effect here, okay.
44

44

00:01:38,779  -->  00:01:40,781
And when you close it,
45

45

00:01:40,781  -->  00:01:43,151
of course the navigation is going to go away,
46

46

00:01:43,151  -->  00:01:47,526
and the circle will come back here to this place.
47

47

00:01:47,526  -->  00:01:51,154
All right, let's take a look at that again.
48

48

00:01:51,154  -->  00:01:54,256
Okay, so what are the main parts of this navigation?
49

49

00:01:54,256  -->  00:01:56,213
First off here, this button of course,
50

50

00:01:56,213  -->  00:01:57,773
containing here this icon,
51

51

00:01:57,773  -->  00:01:59,716
but we'll worry about that later.
52

52

00:01:59,716  -->  00:02:01,335
Then we have this background here
53

53

00:02:01,335  -->  00:02:03,295
which comes from here and expands.
54

54

00:02:03,295  -->  00:02:04,994
So this one.
55

55

00:02:04,994  -->  00:02:07,411
Then we have an overall container
56

56

00:02:07,411  -->  00:02:09,200
which occupies the entire page
57

57

00:02:09,200  -->  00:02:11,819
and which contains then this element,
58

58

00:02:11,819  -->  00:02:13,477
this unordered list,
59

59

00:02:13,477  -->  00:02:15,965
which contains this navigation.
60

60

00:02:15,965  -->  00:02:18,164
And then in there you have the li elements
61

61

00:02:18,164  -->  00:02:19,769
and a link in each of them.
62

62

00:02:19,769  -->  00:02:22,648
So just a structure of a usual navigation, okay.
63

63

00:02:22,648  -->  00:02:24,388
Now, as I was saying earlier,
64

64

00:02:24,388  -->  00:02:26,256
what makes this entire navigation work,
65

65

00:02:26,256  -->  00:02:27,526
especially the clicks.
66

66

00:02:27,526  -->  00:02:29,643
So when we click and the navigation opens,
67

67

00:02:29,643  -->  00:02:33,326
what makes that work is the so called checkbox hack.
68

68

00:02:33,326  -->  00:02:34,992
So how does that work?
69

69

00:02:34,992  -->  00:02:36,260
Well do you remember,
70

70

00:02:36,260  -->  00:02:39,138
in the other lecture about the form.
71

71

00:02:39,138  -->  00:02:40,942
So down here
72

72

00:02:40,942  -->  00:02:42,949
with the radio buttons.
73

73

00:02:42,949  -->  00:02:44,720
Remember this one here?
74

74

00:02:44,720  -->  00:02:46,691
So what we had here was a radio button
75

75

00:02:46,691  -->  00:02:48,346
connected to a label.
76

76

00:02:48,346  -->  00:02:49,833
And when we clicked on a label,
77

77

00:02:49,833  -->  00:02:52,918
then the radio button would become selected, okay.
78

78

00:02:52,918  -->  00:02:55,687
And that's the same thing that we're gonna do right now
79

79

00:02:55,687  -->  00:02:56,942
but except the radio button,
80

80

00:02:56,942  -->  00:02:58,994
we're gonna use a checkbox.
81

81

00:02:58,994  -->  00:03:01,578
So basically, the three steps for this to work
82

82

00:03:01,578  -->  00:03:03,595
is to first have a checkbox,
83

83

00:03:03,595  -->  00:03:05,217
which will be hidden later,
84

84

00:03:05,217  -->  00:03:06,312
then second,
85

85

00:03:06,312  -->  00:03:08,414
have a label connected to that checkbox,
86

86

00:03:08,414  -->  00:03:09,743
which is where we click.
87

87

00:03:09,743  -->  00:03:12,208
And as you can guess, that will be the button here.
88

88

00:03:12,208  -->  00:03:13,861
And then the third step is to reveal
89

89

00:03:13,861  -->  00:03:15,845
the entire navigation here in the background
90

90

00:03:15,845  -->  00:03:18,162
as soon as the checkbox becomes checked.
91

91

00:03:18,162  -->  00:03:20,911
And we can use the checked pseudo class in CSS
92

92

00:03:20,911  -->  00:03:22,102
to style this.
93

93

00:03:22,102  -->  00:03:23,819
Okay, so that's how it will work.
94

94

00:03:23,819  -->  00:03:25,244
But let's do it by steps.
95

95

00:03:25,244  -->  00:03:27,115
So we first start by styling
96

96

00:03:27,115  -->  00:03:29,892
some of the stuff here, okay.
97

97

00:03:29,892  -->  00:03:32,419
So, of course first in the HTML.
98

98

00:03:32,419  -->  00:03:34,974
And what we're gonna do is likely put the navigation here
99

99

00:03:34,974  -->  00:03:36,455
on top of everything else.
100

100

00:03:36,455  -->  00:03:38,319
So this will be the first element
101

101

00:03:38,319  -->  00:03:40,541
in our entire web document.
102

102

00:03:40,541  -->  00:03:44,424
And let's use a div here called navigation.
103

103

00:03:44,424  -->  00:03:47,559
Then in here, we have the checkbox, okay.
104

104

00:03:47,559  -->  00:03:48,539
So input,
105

105

00:03:48,539  -->  00:03:52,706
and I'm gonna call this one the navigation checkbox.
106

106

00:03:54,432  -->  00:03:57,432
Okay, and the type will be checkbox.
107

107

00:03:59,569  -->  00:04:02,335
And the id which we need to connect with the label,
108

108

00:04:02,335  -->  00:04:05,002
remember, is called navi-toggle.
109

109

00:04:07,325  -->  00:04:09,057
Okay, so that's the first ingredient
110

110

00:04:09,057  -->  00:04:11,588
for the checkbox hack.
111

111

00:04:11,588  -->  00:04:13,808
Then we need a label.
112

112

00:04:13,808  -->  00:04:17,308
This one will be called navigation button.
113

113

00:04:20,385  -->  00:04:22,885
And it is for the navi-toggle.
114

114

00:04:25,510  -->  00:04:27,880
And in here we will later have that icon.
115

115

00:04:27,880  -->  00:04:31,258
But for now, let's just say menu.
116

116

00:04:31,258  -->  00:04:34,502
Then we need a div which will be our background.
117

117

00:04:34,502  -->  00:04:37,752
So let's call it navigation_background.
118

118

00:04:40,301  -->  00:04:42,520
Very simple, and this one will be empty.
119

119

00:04:42,520  -->  00:04:45,087
So let's just put nbsp here,
120

120

00:04:45,087  -->  00:04:47,936
which stands for white space basically in HTML.
121

121

00:04:47,936  -->  00:04:49,814
And we used that before, right.
122

122

00:04:49,814  -->  00:04:52,340
So this background will be empty
123

123

00:04:52,340  -->  00:04:54,126
so that we can then, on top of that,
124

124

00:04:54,126  -->  00:04:56,332
put the navigation itself.
125

125

00:04:56,332  -->  00:04:59,712
Okay, and so for that we can actually use
126

126

00:04:59,712  -->  00:05:01,962
the HTML nav element, okay.
127

127

00:05:05,358  -->  00:05:09,407
And I'll call it navigation_nav, very simple.
128

128

00:05:09,407  -->  00:05:12,024
And so this one will be the huge container,
129

129

00:05:12,024  -->  00:05:14,627
spanning the entire page, which I mentioned,
130

130

00:05:14,627  -->  00:05:16,203
so that we can then in there
131

131

00:05:16,203  -->  00:05:17,975
vertically and horizontally center
132

132

00:05:17,975  -->  00:05:20,058
the unordered list, okay.
133

133

00:05:21,512  -->  00:05:23,095
So navigation_list.
134

134

00:05:27,049  -->  00:05:28,930
And then in there,
135

135

00:05:28,930  -->  00:05:31,763
I'm gonna put the navigation item.
136

136

00:05:36,593  -->  00:05:40,041
And the navigation link inside of that.
137

137

00:05:40,041  -->  00:05:42,458
And going nowhere once again.
138

138

00:05:44,462  -->  00:05:46,399
So about Natous is the first one.
139

139

00:05:46,399  -->  00:05:47,303
And that's now just
140

140

00:05:47,303  -->  00:05:49,386
copy this a couple times.
141

141

00:05:58,760  -->  00:05:59,927
Popular tours,
142

142

00:06:04,896  -->  00:06:05,729
stories,
143

143

00:06:06,799  -->  00:06:08,549
and finally book now.
144

144

00:06:10,806  -->  00:06:13,951
So that is our entire markup for the navigation.
145

145

00:06:13,951  -->  00:06:18,167
Okay, so let's now start by styling the background.
146

146

00:06:18,167  -->  00:06:20,267
Okay, that's where I'm gonna start.
147

147

00:06:20,267  -->  00:06:23,082
So the navigation is part of the layout,
148

148

00:06:23,082  -->  00:06:24,184
for me at least,
149

149

00:06:24,184  -->  00:06:26,601
and so I'm gonna put it here.
150

150

00:06:28,727  -->  00:06:30,310
So navigation scss.
151

151

00:06:32,875  -->  00:06:34,967
Navigation here as well.
152

152

00:06:34,967  -->  00:06:37,194
Let me just copy this word here.
153

153

00:06:37,194  -->  00:06:40,944
Because now, need to include it here as well.
154

154

00:06:43,703  -->  00:06:46,453
Well, there goes the copied word.
155

155

00:06:49,684  -->  00:06:51,121
But not a problem, okay.
156

156

00:06:51,121  -->  00:06:52,371
So, navigation.
157

157

00:06:53,240  -->  00:06:55,221
So let's first of all create all the selectors.
158

158

00:06:55,221  -->  00:06:58,304
So, checkbox, button, and background.
159

159

00:07:10,545  -->  00:07:12,242
And then, what else do we have?
160

160

00:07:12,242  -->  00:07:13,680
We have the nav, list,
161

161

00:07:13,680  -->  00:07:14,930
item, and link.
162

162

00:07:33,812  -->  00:07:37,940
So a lot of stuff to style here as you can see.
163

163

00:07:37,940  -->  00:07:39,486
Okay, but as I was saying,
164

164

00:07:39,486  -->  00:07:42,482
let's start actually with the background.
165

165

00:07:42,482  -->  00:07:45,803
So you saw that his background is basically just a circle
166

166

00:07:45,803  -->  00:07:48,053
expanding from here, right?
167

167

00:07:49,413  -->  00:07:51,083
So if you see it very slowly,
168

168

00:07:51,083  -->  00:07:52,532
you see that it's a circle,
169

169

00:07:52,532  -->  00:07:53,818
and now it comes back.
170

170

00:07:53,818  -->  00:07:55,516
And so what we need here is this circle
171

171

00:07:55,516  -->  00:07:57,933
actually behind this whiter circle.
172

172

00:07:57,933  -->  00:07:59,881
Okay, that's actually why we're doing this first.
173

173

00:07:59,881  -->  00:08:02,538
So first we do the one behind this white circle,
174

174

00:08:02,538  -->  00:08:04,538
and then the one on top.
175

175

00:08:05,384  -->  00:08:06,671
So let's start with style.
176

176

00:08:06,671  -->  00:08:08,276
So height,
177

177

00:08:08,276  -->  00:08:09,109
6rem,
178

178

00:08:11,273  -->  00:08:13,568
width of 6rem because it's a circle.
179

179

00:08:13,568  -->  00:08:15,710
So, same height and width.
180

180

00:08:15,710  -->  00:08:18,043
And border-radius, 50%.
181

181

00:08:19,917  -->  00:08:20,878
So let's just take a look
182

182

00:08:20,878  -->  00:08:23,312
so that we can see what we need to do next.
183

183

00:08:23,312  -->  00:08:27,289
So all of the stuff is now right here.
184

184

00:08:27,289  -->  00:08:29,812
Okay, so we see the navigation here.
185

185

00:08:29,812  -->  00:08:30,947
We see the menu,
186

186

00:08:30,947  -->  00:08:32,796
and we see that actually when we click this here,
187

187

00:08:32,796  -->  00:08:35,302
the checkbox gets selected.
188

188

00:08:35,302  -->  00:08:38,915
Now our div, it's still here and invisible, okay.
189

189

00:08:38,915  -->  00:08:40,506
So we need to give it that green color
190

190

00:08:40,506  -->  00:08:43,105
and then put it up here, right?
191

191

00:08:43,105  -->  00:08:46,013
So in fact we want all of this here to be fixed right
192

192

00:08:46,013  -->  00:08:48,598
and to appear in the top right corner.
193

193

00:08:48,598  -->  00:08:51,763
So let's start by doing that with the button here, okay.
194

194

00:08:51,763  -->  00:08:53,568
So, how do we do that?
195

195

00:08:53,568  -->  00:08:56,431
Well, we use something called position fixed.
196

196

00:08:56,431  -->  00:08:59,122
And that's very similar to position absolute
197

197

00:08:59,122  -->  00:09:01,277
with the difference that with fixed,
198

198

00:09:01,277  -->  00:09:03,987
it doesn't change position as we scroll the page.
199

199

00:09:03,987  -->  00:09:06,250
But it also takes the element out of the flow
200

200

00:09:06,250  -->  00:09:08,668
and allows us to specify it in relation
201

201

00:09:08,668  -->  00:09:10,487
to a positioned element
202

202

00:09:10,487  -->  00:09:11,971
with the top, left, right,
203

203

00:09:11,971  -->  00:09:13,915
and bottom properties.
204

204

00:09:13,915  -->  00:09:14,960
So let's do that.
205

205

00:09:14,960  -->  00:09:16,460
And let's say top.
206

206

00:09:17,586  -->  00:09:18,419
6.5rem.
207

207

00:09:19,589  -->  00:09:22,543
And you'll see where that .5 comes from in a second
208

208

00:09:22,543  -->  00:09:24,437
when we do the button, okay.
209

209

00:09:24,437  -->  00:09:25,954
So from the top 6.5,
210

210

00:09:25,954  -->  00:09:29,072
and from the right also 6.5.
211

211

00:09:29,072  -->  00:09:31,461
So that is nicely in the corner there.
212

212

00:09:31,461  -->  00:09:34,211
Now we want that background image
213

213

00:09:35,122  -->  00:09:37,294
with that nice gradient, right.
214

214

00:09:37,294  -->  00:09:39,912
Now, this time we're going to do a different gradient,
215

215

00:09:39,912  -->  00:09:42,162
the new one that we didn't talk about before.
216

216

00:09:42,162  -->  00:09:45,372
So we always use linear gradients, right.
217

217

00:09:45,372  -->  00:09:48,420
But now we'll use a radial gradient.
218

218

00:09:48,420  -->  00:09:50,208
And what's the difference?
219

219

00:09:50,208  -->  00:09:52,427
Well, the linear gradient goes from one side
220

220

00:09:52,427  -->  00:09:53,529
to the other one
221

221

00:09:53,529  -->  00:09:56,251
while the radial gradient starts in the middle of an element
222

222

00:09:56,251  -->  00:09:59,872
and goes from there in all the outside directions basically.
223

223

00:09:59,872  -->  00:10:02,092
So you will see that in a second.
224

224

00:10:02,092  -->  00:10:04,768
So we start from the lighter color.
225

225

00:10:04,768  -->  00:10:05,601
So color,
226

226

00:10:06,711  -->  00:10:08,044
primary lighter.
227

227

00:10:09,281  -->  00:10:12,096
Or light, I think it's called.
228

228

00:10:12,096  -->  00:10:13,839
And then color...
229

229

00:10:13,839  -->  00:10:14,672
Primary...
230

230

00:10:16,226  -->  00:10:17,818
dark, okay.
231

231

00:10:17,818  -->  00:10:21,700
So, we're ready to take a look at that I think.
232

232

00:10:21,700  -->  00:10:23,151
And yeah, so here it is.
233

233

00:10:23,151  -->  00:10:27,303
But actually it's not really in the correct position, right.
234

234

00:10:27,303  -->  00:10:28,784
While it's already fixed,
235

235

00:10:28,784  -->  00:10:30,099
you see it's fixed,
236

236

00:10:30,099  -->  00:10:32,378
but not quite where we want it.
237

237

00:10:32,378  -->  00:10:33,747
So why is that?
238

238

00:10:33,747  -->  00:10:35,750
Okay, I forgot the rem here.
239

239

00:10:35,750  -->  00:10:37,373
Sorry about that one.
240

240

00:10:37,373  -->  00:10:39,573
And so let's check it out again.
241

241

00:10:39,573  -->  00:10:41,227
And yeah, so now here it goes.
242

242

00:10:41,227  -->  00:10:43,625
And you see that radial gradient now.
243

243

00:10:43,625  -->  00:10:45,967
Right, because you're outside it's a lot darker
244

244

00:10:45,967  -->  00:10:47,240
than here in the middle.
245

245

00:10:47,240  -->  00:10:48,249
So that's the lighter green,
246

246

00:10:48,249  -->  00:10:51,323
and that's the darker green here on the outside.
247

247

00:10:51,323  -->  00:10:53,372
Okay, now one thing I'm noticing here
248

248

00:10:53,372  -->  00:10:55,577
is that there's probably some mistake in the HTML
249

249

00:10:55,577  -->  00:10:57,532
because these should be links
250

250

00:10:57,532  -->  00:10:59,369
which they are not.
251

251

00:10:59,369  -->  00:11:01,250
And that is because oh yeah, I see.
252

252

00:11:01,250  -->  00:11:03,714
So I should have put this here of course
253

253

00:11:03,714  -->  00:11:05,631
after this text, right.
254

254

00:11:06,957  -->  00:11:10,244
So that's a stupid mistake once again.
255

255

00:11:10,244  -->  00:11:12,266
But as I was saying earlier,
256

256

00:11:12,266  -->  00:11:13,123
it's no problem.
257

257

00:11:13,123  -->  00:11:16,516
It's completely normal that this happens.
258

258

00:11:16,516  -->  00:11:18,720
It happens to everyone.
259

259

00:11:18,720  -->  00:11:20,784
So, again, okay.
260

260

00:11:20,784  -->  00:11:21,951
Now it's good.
261

261

00:11:23,231  -->  00:11:24,257
Now as we scroll,
262

262

00:11:24,257  -->  00:11:26,415
you see that this gets hidden here
263

263

00:11:26,415  -->  00:11:27,747
behind that element.
264

264

00:11:27,747  -->  00:11:31,747
And so let's just quickly add a z-index as well.
265

265

00:11:33,145  -->  00:11:34,599
Let's give it a really high one.
266

266

00:11:34,599  -->  00:11:37,238
So let's say even 1,000 okay.
267

267

00:11:37,238  -->  00:11:40,083
And so this only works on an element
268

268

00:11:40,083  -->  00:11:41,751
which has its position defined.
269

269

00:11:41,751  -->  00:11:44,978
But it already has that and so we're good to go.
270

270

00:11:44,978  -->  00:11:47,702
And now you see that it stays on top
271

271

00:11:47,702  -->  00:11:50,162
of everything all the time.
272

272

00:11:50,162  -->  00:11:52,869
Okay, and now about the button.
273

273

00:11:52,869  -->  00:11:56,997
Now this one will have a white background color, okay.
274

274

00:11:56,997  -->  00:11:58,247
So color white.
275

275

00:12:01,287  -->  00:12:03,567
It will be slightly higher.
276

276

00:12:03,567  -->  00:12:06,228
We will make this one 7rem.
277

277

00:12:06,228  -->  00:12:07,988
And of course in width as well,
278

278

00:12:07,988  -->  00:12:09,623
because it's also a circle.
279

279

00:12:09,623  -->  00:12:12,346
And we're doing that in order to really cover
280

280

00:12:12,346  -->  00:12:15,178
the background here in the beginning, okay.
281

281

00:12:15,178  -->  00:12:16,328
So if it was the same size,
282

282

00:12:16,328  -->  00:12:19,281
than maybe we would see some green of this background
283

283

00:12:19,281  -->  00:12:20,396
here behind it.
284

284

00:12:20,396  -->  00:12:21,725
But we don't want that, okay.
285

285

00:12:21,725  -->  00:12:24,570
So just to make sure, let's completely cover it.
286

286

00:12:24,570  -->  00:12:26,787
So height, width 7rem here.
287

287

00:12:26,787  -->  00:12:30,245
Once again, we want it to be at a fixed position.
288

288

00:12:30,245  -->  00:12:33,136
Okay, and then from the top,
289

289

00:12:33,136  -->  00:12:34,719
it will be at 7rem,
290

290

00:12:35,846  -->  00:12:37,896
and from the right, the same thing.
291

291

00:12:37,896  -->  00:12:39,313
So, 7rem as well.
292

292

00:12:40,158  -->  00:12:44,337
Actually, what I want is not seven but six.
293

293

00:12:44,337  -->  00:12:45,775
Okay, so in order to cover it.
294

294

00:12:45,775  -->  00:12:48,179
Because this one here is 6.5,
295

295

00:12:48,179  -->  00:12:49,600
and this one is six.
296

296

00:12:49,600  -->  00:12:52,153
Okay, and that's because the button is 1rem wider
297

297

00:12:52,153  -->  00:12:55,212
and higher than the background here.
298

298

00:12:55,212  -->  00:12:57,600
And that's why it's then half a rem
299

299

00:12:57,600  -->  00:12:59,465
further to the top and to the right.
300

300

00:12:59,465  -->  00:13:02,021
Okay, because this half here is half
301

301

00:13:02,021  -->  00:13:03,459
of the one difference
302

302

00:13:03,459  -->  00:13:07,709
between the size of the background and the button.
303

303

00:13:07,709  -->  00:13:10,499
So they're now really on top of each other.
304

304

00:13:10,499  -->  00:13:13,166
And the border-radius of course,
305

305

00:13:14,446  -->  00:13:15,613
also 50%.
306

306

00:13:17,179  -->  00:13:19,429
So take a look at that now.
307

307

00:13:20,406  -->  00:13:22,473
And well, I would say that here it is.
308

308

00:13:22,473  -->  00:13:24,196
What we have to do, of course,
309

309

00:13:24,196  -->  00:13:26,416
is to also give it a z-index.
310

310

00:13:26,416  -->  00:13:27,699
And this one should be really high.
311

311

00:13:27,699  -->  00:13:28,582
So even higher.
312

312

00:13:28,582  -->  00:13:30,332
Let's say 2,000 here.
313

313

00:13:31,591  -->  00:13:32,745
And now here we go.
314

314

00:13:32,745  -->  00:13:33,682
Now since it's wide,
315

315

00:13:33,682  -->  00:13:34,742
you cannot really see it
316

316

00:13:34,742  -->  00:13:36,877
because we still have this stuff here going on,
317

317

00:13:36,877  -->  00:13:38,667
sitting before our header here in the DOM.
318

318

00:13:38,667  -->  00:13:40,465
And so it makes everything white,
319

319

00:13:40,465  -->  00:13:43,126
and we can see the white circle over there.
320

320

00:13:43,126  -->  00:13:46,123
So let's now actually take care of that, okay.
321

321

00:13:46,123  -->  00:13:49,951
But first of all, let's actually hide the checkbox already.
322

322

00:13:49,951  -->  00:13:51,284
So display none.
323

323

00:13:52,818  -->  00:13:56,660
Because of course we never want to see this one.
324

324

00:13:56,660  -->  00:13:59,091
All right, and now the navigation element.
325

325

00:13:59,091  -->  00:14:01,430
Let me show it in the markup here for you.
326

326

00:14:01,430  -->  00:14:03,144
So it's this nav element
327

327

00:14:03,144  -->  00:14:05,194
with the navigation_nav class.
328

328

00:14:05,194  -->  00:14:07,825
So remember that I said that this would be a huge element
329

329

00:14:07,825  -->  00:14:09,736
occupying the entire viewport
330

330

00:14:09,736  -->  00:14:12,032
so that we can then center the navigation list
331

331

00:14:12,032  -->  00:14:15,977
inside of that, both horizontally and vertically, right.
332

332

00:14:15,977  -->  00:14:19,174
So let's now do these two steps.
333

333

00:14:19,174  -->  00:14:20,585
So first off, the nav.
334

334

00:14:20,585  -->  00:14:24,470
It should have a height of 100 viewport height units.
335

335

00:14:24,470  -->  00:14:26,963
Basically, so 100% of the viewport height
336

336

00:14:26,963  -->  00:14:29,591
and a width of 100%.
337

337

00:14:29,591  -->  00:14:31,763
But I don't really need to specify that.
338

338

00:14:31,763  -->  00:14:33,763
Well, but I can for now.
339

339

00:14:35,206  -->  00:14:37,056
Because it's a block level element and so,
340

340

00:14:37,056  -->  00:14:40,851
it automatically occupies 100% of its width.
341

341

00:14:40,851  -->  00:14:44,095
Now, the position should also be fixed.
342

342

00:14:44,095  -->  00:14:46,680
Because remember that with the navigation open,
343

343

00:14:46,680  -->  00:14:47,721
even if you scroll,
344

344

00:14:47,721  -->  00:14:51,454
the navigation will stay at the same place, okay.
345

345

00:14:51,454  -->  00:14:54,253
And so you want it at a zero top,
346

346

00:14:54,253  -->  00:14:55,670
and a zero right.
347

347

00:14:57,157  -->  00:14:59,530
So it starts right in the top right corner
348

348

00:14:59,530  -->  00:15:00,693
of the viewport,
349

349

00:15:00,693  -->  00:15:03,966
spanning over the entire viewport because of this.
350

350

00:15:03,966  -->  00:15:08,133
And now finally, we also need to think about its z-index.
351

351

00:15:09,549  -->  00:15:13,885
So this button here should always be on top, right.
352

352

00:15:13,885  -->  00:15:16,978
But the nav here should be on top of the background.
353

353

00:15:16,978  -->  00:15:18,702
And so we have 1,000 here,
354

354

00:15:18,702  -->  00:15:20,020
2,000 here.
355

355

00:15:20,020  -->  00:15:21,718
And these numbers, they don't really matter
356

356

00:15:21,718  -->  00:15:24,580
as long as this one is higher as this one.
357

357

00:15:24,580  -->  00:15:27,192
And so here we can just say 15 hundred for example.
358

358

00:15:27,192  -->  00:15:29,627
But we could really do like 10, 20, 30,
359

359

00:15:29,627  -->  00:15:30,896
it doesn't really matter.
360

360

00:15:30,896  -->  00:15:32,015
Or 1,000,
361

361

00:15:32,015  -->  00:15:34,630
2,000, 3,000, for this one.
362

362

00:15:34,630  -->  00:15:36,448
But for now, what matters here,
363

363

00:15:36,448  -->  00:15:38,619
is that this one here is in the middle.
364

364

00:15:38,619  -->  00:15:41,435
So let's just take a look at that.
365

365

00:15:41,435  -->  00:15:43,521
All right, and so right now we already see
366

366

00:15:43,521  -->  00:15:46,719
our white circle here, sitting nicely at this place.
367

367

00:15:46,719  -->  00:15:47,587
Now all we have to do
368

368

00:15:47,587  -->  00:15:50,482
is to actually center this entire thing here in the middle.
369

369

00:15:50,482  -->  00:15:51,363
And then later on,
370

370

00:15:51,363  -->  00:15:52,687
we're gonna of course hide it.
371

371

00:15:52,687  -->  00:15:54,186
But for now, as for styling it,
372

372

00:15:54,186  -->  00:15:56,537
we need to keep it visible.
373

373

00:15:56,537  -->  00:15:59,002
This UL element, so this navigation list,
374

374

00:15:59,002  -->  00:16:01,357
this is what we're gonna center inside
375

375

00:16:01,357  -->  00:16:03,624
of this nav container.
376

376

00:16:03,624  -->  00:16:06,957
So position absolute as we already know.
377

377

00:16:08,641  -->  00:16:09,808
Top, 50%,
378

378

00:16:12,157  -->  00:16:13,407
left, 50%,
379

379

00:16:15,284  -->  00:16:17,647
and then our transform,
380

380

00:16:17,647  -->  00:16:21,230
translate minus 50 and minus 50, of course.
381

381

00:16:23,390  -->  00:16:26,082
We could actually write a mixin for this part here
382

382

00:16:26,082  -->  00:16:27,884
because we've been using it so many times
383

383

00:16:27,884  -->  00:16:29,364
and it's always the same code.
384

384

00:16:29,364  -->  00:16:32,048
And so a mixin would be a good thing to do here.
385

385

00:16:32,048  -->  00:16:33,473
So if you want to try it out,
386

386

00:16:33,473  -->  00:16:35,397
go to the mixins file here,
387

387

00:16:35,397  -->  00:16:39,052
create a mixin like center horizontal vertical,
388

388

00:16:39,052  -->  00:16:40,371
something like that,
389

389

00:16:40,371  -->  00:16:42,709
and then just copy these lines,
390

390

00:16:42,709  -->  00:16:44,818
or actually these four lines here,
391

391

00:16:44,818  -->  00:16:46,246
and then you don't always have to write
392

392

00:16:46,246  -->  00:16:48,163
this entire code, okay.
393

393

00:16:49,183  -->  00:16:52,365
Now in here, we could actually have used left for this one.
394

394

00:16:52,365  -->  00:16:54,137
But it's really the same since it's already
395

395

00:16:54,137  -->  00:16:56,936
the entire width anyway.
396

396

00:16:56,936  -->  00:16:59,520
So it doesn't really matter.
397

397

00:16:59,520  -->  00:17:01,802
Now, what we also want is
398

398

00:17:01,802  -->  00:17:04,525
to get rid of the bullets.
399

399

00:17:04,525  -->  00:17:07,525
And the text-align should be center.
400

400

00:17:10,338  -->  00:17:11,453
All right.
401

401

00:17:11,453  -->  00:17:13,136
Now, as we're styling this,
402

402

00:17:13,136  -->  00:17:17,177
let's actually increase the background to a huge size
403

403

00:17:17,177  -->  00:17:19,121
so that we can see how it will look like
404

404

00:17:19,121  -->  00:17:21,038
later in the real live.
405

405

00:17:21,904  -->  00:17:23,907
So the background, where is it?
406

406

00:17:23,907  -->  00:17:25,240
Okay, it's here.
407

407

00:17:26,339  -->  00:17:28,175
So what we're gonna do later,
408

408

00:17:28,175  -->  00:17:29,947
as soon as the navigation is open,
409

409

00:17:29,947  -->  00:17:32,762
we will scale this entire background, okay.
410

410

00:17:32,762  -->  00:17:34,079
Like by a huge number.
411

411

00:17:34,079  -->  00:17:36,187
Let's say it's something like 50 even.
412

412

00:17:36,187  -->  00:17:37,427
And so this entire circle
413

413

00:17:37,427  -->  00:17:39,099
will become huge, and it will grow,
414

414

00:17:39,099  -->  00:17:43,026
and this animation is what will create the effect, okay.
415

415

00:17:43,026  -->  00:17:44,938
And so for now, we just put it here
416

416

00:17:44,938  -->  00:17:46,458
for development purposes.
417

417

00:17:46,458  -->  00:17:49,550
We will then move it to another part of our code later on.
418

418

00:17:49,550  -->  00:17:52,217
Okay, just to take a look at it.
419

419

00:17:53,158  -->  00:17:54,902
All right, so this is how it will look like.
420

420

00:17:54,902  -->  00:17:56,431
Actually, even bigger.
421

421

00:17:56,431  -->  00:17:59,919
So maybe it will have to be even like 80
422

422

00:17:59,919  -->  00:18:01,329
or something like that
423

423

00:18:01,329  -->  00:18:04,569
to also cover bigger screens, okay.
424

424

00:18:04,569  -->  00:18:06,879
And so that's what it will look like.
425

425

00:18:06,879  -->  00:18:09,757
And you see that it already stays at the same place, right.
426

426

00:18:09,757  -->  00:18:10,645
So we're scrolling here,
427

427

00:18:10,645  -->  00:18:12,280
you see the scroll bar on the right side.
428

428

00:18:12,280  -->  00:18:15,142
I'm scrolling and this stays at the same place.
429

429

00:18:15,142  -->  00:18:16,609
So that's great.
430

430

00:18:16,609  -->  00:18:18,872
Okay, but let's now style these links
431

431

00:18:18,872  -->  00:18:21,734
in order to make them look like this.
432

432

00:18:21,734  -->  00:18:23,475
So that's a huge difference, right?
433

433

00:18:23,475  -->  00:18:25,225
So let's now do that.
434

434

00:18:27,855  -->  00:18:32,008
And actually, it's not as hard as it may look like.
435

435

00:18:32,008  -->  00:18:33,587
Let's start with the simple stuff.
436

436

00:18:33,587  -->  00:18:35,087
Font-size of 3rem.
437

437

00:18:37,341  -->  00:18:39,847
Font-weight of only 300.
438

438

00:18:39,847  -->  00:18:42,153
So a nice, thin text.
439

439

00:18:42,153  -->  00:18:44,788
Then the color is white if you remember.
440

440

00:18:44,788  -->  00:18:46,121
So color, white.
441

441

00:18:48,413  -->  00:18:51,580
Of course, there's no text-decoration.
442

442

00:18:54,824  -->  00:18:58,491
And a text-transform is again to upper case.
443

443

00:19:00,025  -->  00:19:03,190
Okay, taking a look at that.
444

444

00:19:03,190  -->  00:19:04,732
So, here we go.
445

445

00:19:04,732  -->  00:19:07,400
Maybe let's give these some padding here.
446

446

00:19:07,400  -->  00:19:11,880
And we can actually do that here in the item.
447

447

00:19:11,880  -->  00:19:13,943
Or better, some margin actually.
448

448

00:19:13,943  -->  00:19:16,360
So 1rem between the elements.
449

449

00:19:17,363  -->  00:19:19,956
So something like this here.
450

450

00:19:19,956  -->  00:19:22,495
So we're getting closer to what we have here.
451

451

00:19:22,495  -->  00:19:24,532
Now what's really different here of course
452

452

00:19:24,532  -->  00:19:27,483
is this white background coming in like that.
453

453

00:19:27,483  -->  00:19:29,334
So take a look at that again.
454

454

00:19:29,334  -->  00:19:32,561
So it's this slightly rotated edge again that we have
455

455

00:19:32,561  -->  00:19:34,305
in other places on our page.
456

456

00:19:34,305  -->  00:19:37,795
And so, let's try to implement that here as well.
457

457

00:19:37,795  -->  00:19:40,914
And what do you think is the best way of creating this?
458

458

00:19:40,914  -->  00:19:42,252
So, take a look at it again.
459

459

00:19:42,252  -->  00:19:44,772
So here you have the edge, okay.
460

460

00:19:44,772  -->  00:19:48,147
So what do you think is the best way of creating this?
461

461

00:19:48,147  -->  00:19:51,029
Well, I think it's a solid color gradient,
462

462

00:19:51,029  -->  00:19:54,177
such as we have used before, okay.
463

463

00:19:54,177  -->  00:19:57,094
So, do you remember how we do that?
464

464

00:19:58,065  -->  00:19:59,732
So background-image,
465

465

00:20:00,742  -->  00:20:02,578
linear-gradient,
466

466

00:20:02,578  -->  00:20:04,644
and we use a degree here.
467

467

00:20:04,644  -->  00:20:08,727
And once again, we're outside of the parenthesis.
468

468

00:20:09,569  -->  00:20:12,766
Okay, and now we can use these percentages again
469

469

00:20:12,766  -->  00:20:16,042
like we did on the booking section, right.
470

470

00:20:16,042  -->  00:20:19,285
So let's start with transparent.
471

471

00:20:19,285  -->  00:20:21,194
And actually to make it visible,
472

472

00:20:21,194  -->  00:20:24,361
let's get out our favorite orange-red,
473

473

00:20:25,940  -->  00:20:29,459
which at 0% it is orange-red, okay.
474

474

00:20:29,459  -->  00:20:31,705
Then at 50%,
475

475

00:20:31,705  -->  00:20:33,538
it's orange-red again,
476

476

00:20:34,973  -->  00:20:39,140
only to say that at 50%, we start our color white.
477

477

00:20:42,545  -->  00:20:43,795
50%, okay.
478

478

00:20:44,930  -->  00:20:46,385
Now without any animation,
479

479

00:20:46,385  -->  00:20:47,730
and anything like that,
480

480

00:20:47,730  -->  00:20:50,452
let's just take a look at what we have here.
481

481

00:20:50,452  -->  00:20:51,493
And okay.
482

482

00:20:51,493  -->  00:20:54,032
So that's the starting point really.
483

483

00:20:54,032  -->  00:20:55,881
And so before we move on,
484

484

00:20:55,881  -->  00:20:58,835
let's give this here some padding, okay.
485

485

00:20:58,835  -->  00:21:00,752
So padding, once again,
486

486

00:21:02,322  -->  00:21:03,453
on the top we have one,
487

487

00:21:03,453  -->  00:21:05,397
and on the sides then a bit more.
488

488

00:21:05,397  -->  00:21:07,002
Okay, that always looks good.
489

489

00:21:07,002  -->  00:21:09,052
And now I'm gonna show you another property
490

490

00:21:09,052  -->  00:21:10,476
that's not exactly new,
491

491

00:21:10,476  -->  00:21:12,341
but I'm not sure if you're aware of it.
492

492

00:21:12,341  -->  00:21:14,865
And that's called background size.
493

493

00:21:14,865  -->  00:21:16,448
So background size.
494

494

00:21:18,326  -->  00:21:20,546
And yes of course you're aware of it
495

495

00:21:20,546  -->  00:21:22,029
because we've used it before.
496

496

00:21:22,029  -->  00:21:23,450
Actually I showed it to you
497

497

00:21:23,450  -->  00:21:25,914
with background-size 100% right?
498

498

00:21:25,914  -->  00:21:28,973
So 100%, that's the starting point here.
499

499

00:21:28,973  -->  00:21:30,888
So let me show it to you
500

500

00:21:30,888  -->  00:21:35,204
what happens if we increase that value in this case.
501

501

00:21:35,204  -->  00:21:36,954
So we start with 100.
502

502

00:21:39,086  -->  00:21:41,043
And if we increase this,
503

503

00:21:41,043  -->  00:21:42,806
you see that the entire thing
504

504

00:21:42,806  -->  00:21:44,822
basically moves to the right side.
505

505

00:21:44,822  -->  00:21:46,990
And that's because we're basically increasing
506

506

00:21:46,990  -->  00:21:48,020
the entire thing.
507

507

00:21:48,020  -->  00:21:50,523
But it's not visible because the box ends here.
508

508

00:21:50,523  -->  00:21:52,455
But you can imagine that now this entire background
509

509

00:21:52,455  -->  00:21:55,694
goes like around this entire thing here, okay.
510

510

00:21:55,694  -->  00:21:58,405
And if we set this all the way to 200,
511

511

00:21:58,405  -->  00:21:59,905
which is double...
512

512

00:22:01,434  -->  00:22:02,517
Okay, so 200.
513

513

00:22:04,816  -->  00:22:07,812
Now it will go all the way until in here, okay.
514

514

00:22:07,812  -->  00:22:09,204
So basically like here.
515

515

00:22:09,204  -->  00:22:12,247
So now this entire thing here is the gradient,
516

516

00:22:12,247  -->  00:22:15,584
but we only see the red side, right?
517

517

00:22:15,584  -->  00:22:18,322
So only the red part of this gradient is visible.
518

518

00:22:18,322  -->  00:22:20,937
But we know that the white part is still here
519

519

00:22:20,937  -->  00:22:22,440
on the right side, right.
520

520

00:22:22,440  -->  00:22:24,855
And the same thing of course applies to all of these.
521

521

00:22:24,855  -->  00:22:27,258
So all of these have this wide part now here
522

522

00:22:27,258  -->  00:22:29,756
going on, on that right side.
523

523

00:22:29,756  -->  00:22:31,491
And maybe now you can start to see
524

524

00:22:31,491  -->  00:22:34,080
how this effect is gonna work, right?
525

525

00:22:34,080  -->  00:22:36,037
Because now, all we have to do
526

526

00:22:36,037  -->  00:22:40,031
is to move this entire gradient here to the left side
527

527

00:22:40,031  -->  00:22:42,801
and then the white part will be here.
528

528

00:22:42,801  -->  00:22:45,312
And the red part, which later will be transparent
529

529

00:22:45,312  -->  00:22:48,567
will be here on the left side, okay.
530

530

00:22:48,567  -->  00:22:53,353
So if you basically shift the entire thing 100% to the side,
531

531

00:22:53,353  -->  00:22:56,584
then we end up with the effect that we're looking for.
532

532

00:22:56,584  -->  00:22:59,182
Right, so let's now implement that.
533

533

00:22:59,182  -->  00:23:01,554
And actually in here, this is not correct.
534

534

00:23:01,554  -->  00:23:05,814
Because this should be for the link pseudo class, right.
535

535

00:23:05,814  -->  00:23:07,257
And also for the visited,
536

536

00:23:07,257  -->  00:23:08,924
since we're at that.
537

537

00:23:12,991  -->  00:23:15,741
So, this is for the normal state.
538

538

00:23:18,336  -->  00:23:21,419
And then the hover, and active state.
539

539

00:23:26,752  -->  00:23:28,773
So, remember what I was saying?
540

540

00:23:28,773  -->  00:23:31,663
If we shift the background completely to the left side,
541

541

00:23:31,663  -->  00:23:34,032
then we end up with the effect that we want.
542

542

00:23:34,032  -->  00:23:37,699
And we can do that with background-position.
543

543

00:23:38,916  -->  00:23:42,622
Okay, and so the entire thing as we were saying
544

544

00:23:42,622  -->  00:23:45,588
usually means 100%, all right.
545

545

00:23:45,588  -->  00:23:47,098
And just so that we can see it,
546

546

00:23:47,098  -->  00:23:48,770
let's actually animate it.
547

547

00:23:48,770  -->  00:23:49,937
So transition,
548

548

00:23:52,072  -->  00:23:53,322
all .4 seconds.
549

549

00:23:55,483  -->  00:23:57,440
So let's take a look now.
550

550

00:23:57,440  -->  00:23:58,697
Well, what's going on here.
551

551

00:23:58,697  -->  00:24:01,144
Oh, okay, I didn't change it in the code.
552

552

00:24:01,144  -->  00:24:02,918
Here it's still 100.
553

553

00:24:02,918  -->  00:24:04,249
I changed it only in the dev tools,
554

554

00:24:04,249  -->  00:24:07,401
but of course that doesn't reflect in the code.
555

555

00:24:07,401  -->  00:24:09,068
And so now it works.
556

556

00:24:09,938  -->  00:24:11,789
And you see, as we're hovering it,
557

557

00:24:11,789  -->  00:24:14,618
the background basically shifts to the left side
558

558

00:24:14,618  -->  00:24:17,832
because the position is now at 100%.
559

559

00:24:17,832  -->  00:24:21,043
And let me show that to you here in the inspector as well.
560

560

00:24:21,043  -->  00:24:22,865
So I can say hover.
561

561

00:24:22,865  -->  00:24:27,032
And then we can take the number and play a bit with it,
562

562

00:24:28,111  -->  00:24:29,243
so you see.
563

563

00:24:29,243  -->  00:24:31,326
When I decrease it,
564

564

00:24:31,326  -->  00:24:32,549
it goes back to where it was.
565

565

00:24:32,549  -->  00:24:34,901
So zero was the initial state basically.
566

566

00:24:34,901  -->  00:24:36,417
And so now, as I increase it,
567

567

00:24:36,417  -->  00:24:38,210
it goes in this direction.
568

568

00:24:38,210  -->  00:24:39,720
And as I increase it even more,
569

569

00:24:39,720  -->  00:24:41,100
it goes around like this.
570

570

00:24:41,100  -->  00:24:43,026
But that doesn't matter, okay.
571

571

00:24:43,026  -->  00:24:46,276
So 100% here basically is the end.
572

572

00:24:48,766  -->  00:24:52,435
But anyway, zero is what we actually wanted.
573

573

00:24:52,435  -->  00:24:54,023
So let's take that away
574

574

00:24:54,023  -->  00:24:55,106
and hover it.
575

575

00:24:56,533  -->  00:24:58,700
Well, what's going on now?
576

576

00:25:01,475  -->  00:25:03,317
Ah, yeah, right.
577

577

00:25:03,317  -->  00:25:06,172
Now you see that it's not quite right.
578

578

00:25:06,172  -->  00:25:09,863
Okay, and that's because of these 100%,
579

579

00:25:09,863  -->  00:25:13,159
sorry but because of this 120 degrees here.
580

580

00:25:13,159  -->  00:25:15,340
So we rotated this thing a bit.
581

581

00:25:15,340  -->  00:25:19,179
And so it doesn't quite cover here the entire thing.
582

582

00:25:19,179  -->  00:25:20,906
And so what we want to do
583

583

00:25:20,906  -->  00:25:23,705
is to just increase this a bit here, okay.
584

584

00:25:23,705  -->  00:25:26,781
So just set it to 220%,
585

585

00:25:26,781  -->  00:25:28,698
and that should fix it.
586

586

00:25:30,959  -->  00:25:31,906
So you see,
587

587

00:25:31,906  -->  00:25:33,656
now it's much better.
588

588

00:25:35,028  -->  00:25:36,218
All right,
589

589

00:25:36,218  -->  00:25:39,635
and of course we now want to replace that
590

590

00:25:40,669  -->  00:25:42,086
with transparent.
591

591

00:25:43,548  -->  00:25:46,942
Because orange-red is always just our testing color.
592

592

00:25:46,942  -->  00:25:49,109
All right, so transparent.
593

593

00:25:50,525  -->  00:25:51,775
And here we go.
594

594

00:25:53,093  -->  00:25:55,785
Now of course, we also need to make our text dark
595

595

00:25:55,785  -->  00:25:59,338
so we can actually see what's written in there.
596

596

00:25:59,338  -->  00:26:00,171
So...
597

597

00:26:01,329  -->  00:26:02,893
color...
598

598

00:26:02,893  -->  00:26:04,810
and then color-primary.
599

599

00:26:07,404  -->  00:26:08,443
All right.
600

600

00:26:08,443  -->  00:26:10,953
Now another thing that we had going on here actually,
601

601

00:26:10,953  -->  00:26:13,120
let's take a look at that.
602

602

00:26:14,230  -->  00:26:17,397
Okay, so anyway this works now, right.
603

603

00:26:21,361  -->  00:26:22,749
Now another thing that we have going on here
604

604

00:26:22,749  -->  00:26:26,255
is you see that it slightly moves a bit to the right side.
605

605

00:26:26,255  -->  00:26:30,415
Okay, and that looks even better this way.
606

606

00:26:30,415  -->  00:26:33,582
Right, so let's do that as well.
607

607

00:26:33,582  -->  00:26:35,476
And that's pretty easy of course.
608

608

00:26:35,476  -->  00:26:36,885
You know that already.
609

609

00:26:36,885  -->  00:26:38,052
So translateX,
610

610

00:26:40,312  -->  00:26:42,635
and let's say just 1rem.
611

611

00:26:42,635  -->  00:26:43,468
All right.
612

612

00:26:45,637  -->  00:26:46,796
So that's the original.
613

613

00:26:46,796  -->  00:26:48,546
And that's ours here.
614

614

00:26:50,378  -->  00:26:52,763
Well, it doesn't really work.
615

615

00:26:52,763  -->  00:26:53,763
Why is that?
616

616

00:26:56,710  -->  00:27:01,513
Maybe there's an error again here in my terminal.
617

617

00:27:01,513  -->  00:27:02,362
But actually no,
618

618

00:27:02,362  -->  00:27:06,227
it seems to just be working just fine.
619

619

00:27:06,227  -->  00:27:07,894
So what's happening?
620

620

00:27:09,957  -->  00:27:12,544
Well this animation actually works just fine.
621

621

00:27:12,544  -->  00:27:17,191
But for some reason, the transition is not working out.
622

622

00:27:17,191  -->  00:27:20,803
So let's put this to hover here again.
623

623

00:27:20,803  -->  00:27:23,756
And yeah, actually it is here.
624

624

00:27:23,756  -->  00:27:24,826
But it's not doing anything.
625

625

00:27:24,826  -->  00:27:27,558
And I think I know why this is happening.
626

626

00:27:27,558  -->  00:27:29,157
And actually, I was wondering why the padding
627

627

00:27:29,157  -->  00:27:31,402
was also not being applied just right.
628

628

00:27:31,402  -->  00:27:34,371
And that's because we still have to define this here
629

629

00:27:34,371  -->  00:27:36,786
as inline blocks, okay.
630

630

00:27:36,786  -->  00:27:39,536
So, the link should be of course,
631

631

00:27:40,474  -->  00:27:42,016
let me put it at the beginning.
632

632

00:27:42,016  -->  00:27:43,743
I like to put it at the beginning always.
633

633

00:27:43,743  -->  00:27:47,741
So display, it should be an inline-block
634

634

00:27:47,741  -->  00:27:50,247
so that the padding is actually really applied
635

635

00:27:50,247  -->  00:27:51,596
the way it should.
636

636

00:27:51,596  -->  00:27:54,045
Ah, yeah, now it looks much better.
637

637

00:27:54,045  -->  00:27:57,795
And also, it works the way we intended it to.
638

638

00:27:59,612  -->  00:28:01,339
So here we go.
639

639

00:28:01,339  -->  00:28:03,296
Much better now.
640

640

00:28:03,296  -->  00:28:06,355
All right, well this one here also has these numbers.
641

641

00:28:06,355  -->  00:28:08,957
So let's just add a span
642

642

00:28:08,957  -->  00:28:11,389
because we also have the spacing here.
643

643

00:28:11,389  -->  00:28:14,972
So this is just a simple span that I added.
644

644

00:28:16,092  -->  00:28:17,582
It's nothing really important.
645

645

00:28:17,582  -->  00:28:21,349
But nevertheless, let's do that, okay.
646

646

00:28:21,349  -->  00:28:24,849
So it's just a span element saying oh one.
647

647

00:28:26,931  -->  00:28:28,721
And now I'm breaking the rule here of
648

648

00:28:28,721  -->  00:28:32,043
every element having to have a class.
649

649

00:28:32,043  -->  00:28:35,912
But well, I would say that rules are meant
650

650

00:28:35,912  -->  00:28:37,671
to be broken sometimes okay.
651

651

00:28:37,671  -->  00:28:39,981
So as long as you have a good reason, then that's okay.
652

652

00:28:39,981  -->  00:28:41,754
And in this case, that's because
653

653

00:28:41,754  -->  00:28:43,912
I think it would be really kind of an overkill
654

654

00:28:43,912  -->  00:28:47,856
to now add even another class to that chain.
655

655

00:28:47,856  -->  00:28:50,349
Okay, and so in here,
656

656

00:28:50,349  -->  00:28:53,473
all we have to do is to say span.
657

657

00:28:53,473  -->  00:28:56,777
'Cause it's inside of these link elements here, right.
658

658

00:28:56,777  -->  00:28:58,444
And so margin-right,
659

659

00:28:59,873  -->  00:29:00,706
1rem.
660

660

00:29:01,711  -->  00:29:02,711
And display,
661

661

00:29:04,094  -->  00:29:05,177
inline-block.
662

662

00:29:06,813  -->  00:29:09,105
So that should do it.
663

663

00:29:09,105  -->  00:29:11,079
And yep, here we go.
664

664

00:29:11,079  -->  00:29:14,329
Could even make it a bit more like 1.5.
665

665

00:29:16,325  -->  00:29:18,010
Yeah, that looks really good.
666

666

00:29:18,010  -->  00:29:19,645
All right, now the problem is that of course
667

667

00:29:19,645  -->  00:29:21,112
nothing of this works.
668

668

00:29:21,112  -->  00:29:22,440
We don't have the icon here.
669

669

00:29:22,440  -->  00:29:25,796
And so we have to take care of all of that,
670

670

00:29:25,796  -->  00:29:28,194
making a checkbox hack actually work.
671

671

00:29:28,194  -->  00:29:30,368
And we're gonna do that in the next lecture.
672

672

00:29:30,368  -->  00:29:34,118
So don't wait, and come with me right there.
