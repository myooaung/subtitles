<v Instructor>To finish this section, lets put</v>
2

2

00:00:03.548  -->  00:00:06.372
something we learned in the last lecture into practice
3

3

00:00:06.372  -->  00:00:08.688
right now, and that's to convert the HTML we've
4

4

00:00:08.688  -->  00:00:12.032
been writing so far into the BEM system so
5

5

00:00:12.032  -->  00:00:15.337
that we can start using BEM from now on.
6

6

00:00:15.337  -->  00:00:17.361
So in this lecture, you're just gonna learn how to
7

7

00:00:17.361  -->  00:00:20.433
use the BEM method in practice.
8

8

00:00:20.433  -->  00:00:22.785
There's not actually a whole lot to do here already
9

9

00:00:22.785  -->  00:00:25.716
because we haven't written so much HTML
10

10

00:00:25.716  -->  00:00:27.387
up until this point.
11

11

00:00:27.387  -->  00:00:29.307
One thing that we have to do though, is to
12

12

00:00:29.307  -->  00:00:31.458
Identify our first block here.
13

13

00:00:31.458  -->  00:00:34.554
That's the header here, so the header is obviously
14

14

00:00:34.554  -->  00:00:37.556
a block in the BEM system because it is a
15

15

00:00:37.556  -->  00:00:39.884
stand-alone component that is meaningful on
16

16

00:00:39.884  -->  00:00:42.659
its own, and so is the block so all the elements
17

17

00:00:42.659  -->  00:00:45.991
that are inside it should also have the header
18

18

00:00:45.991  -->  00:00:48.111
attached to them right?
19

19

00:00:48.111  -->  00:00:51.102
So this logo box here, it can only really exist
20

20

00:00:51.102  -->  00:00:53.922
here in this header, so it's and element right?
21

21

00:00:53.922  -->  00:00:56.518
Because it's a part of a block but it
22

22

00:00:56.518  -->  00:00:58.556
has no standalone meaning.
23

23

00:00:58.556  -->  00:01:02.140
So now we should start adding the header to the element.
24

24

00:01:02.140  -->  00:01:05.555
So, header and now remember, it's double underscore
25

25

00:01:05.555  -->  00:01:08.154
to separate the block from the element.
26

26

00:01:08.154  -->  00:01:11.025
So header is the block and logo-box is the element.
27

27

00:01:11.025  -->  00:01:12.990
And the same thing here for our logo,
28

28

00:01:12.990  -->  00:01:15.523
so we call it header_logo.
29

29

00:01:15.523  -->  00:01:17.454
Because this logo with this exact size,
30

30

00:01:17.454  -->  00:01:19.410
and this exact image, it only just
31

31

00:01:19.410  -->  00:01:21.639
exists here in the header.
32

32

00:01:21.639  -->  00:01:24.363
The same goes, of course, for this text box.
33

33

00:01:24.363  -->  00:01:27.575
So header_textbox, simply because this text box
34

34

00:01:27.575  -->  00:01:30.635
is a part of the header and it doesn't make
35

35

00:01:30.635  -->  00:01:33.670
much sense to use it anywhere else.
36

36

00:01:33.670  -->  00:01:35.659
Now as for this heading-primer here,
37

37

00:01:35.659  -->  00:01:38.394
things are a bit different actually, because we
38

38

00:01:38.394  -->  00:01:41.592
could treat this as a block on its own.
39

39

00:01:41.592  -->  00:01:44.088
Imagine that we wanted to use this H1 element
40

40

00:01:44.088  -->  00:01:45.996
somewhere else, imagine we had another page but
41

41

00:01:45.996  -->  00:01:48.322
without a header like this one, and we wanted
42

42

00:01:48.322  -->  00:01:50.617
to use this primary heading, we could, of course,
43

43

00:01:50.617  -->  00:01:53.813
do so and so this one here is a stand-alone block.
44

44

00:01:53.813  -->  00:01:57.821
Now as to these two here, what do you think about them?
45

45

00:01:57.821  -->  00:01:59.739
They are called heading-main and
46

46

00:01:59.739  -->  00:02:01.374
heading-primary-sub.
47

47

00:02:01.374  -->  00:02:02.896
So what these two are, is they are
48

48

00:02:02.896  -->  00:02:05.758
actually modifiers of the heading-primary right?
49

49

00:02:05.758  -->  00:02:08.357
Because they simply create a slightly different
50

50

00:02:08.357  -->  00:02:10.795
version of this heading-primary class of the
51

51

00:02:10.795  -->  00:02:14.628
block so what we do is we put two dashes here.
52

52

00:02:15.856  -->  00:02:19.605
So remember, block and then if we have a modifier,
53

53

00:02:19.605  -->  00:02:23.725
we do dash dash and then the name of the modifier.
54

54

00:02:23.725  -->  00:02:25.666
If it's an element, then we use underscore
55

55

00:02:25.666  -->  00:02:29.260
underscore and then the name of the element after that.
56

56

00:02:29.260  -->  00:02:32.158
Same thing down here, a button is, of course, a
57

57

00:02:32.158  -->  00:02:35.461
stand-alone component so we can consider it a
58

58

00:02:35.461  -->  00:02:38.570
block in the BEM notation, because we're gonna
59

59

00:02:38.570  -->  00:02:42.021
use this button throughout this entire page.
60

60

00:02:42.021  -->  00:02:45.351
Now here, these two can be considered flags as well
61

61

00:02:45.351  -->  00:02:48.193
such as we had before and so we use double dash
62

62

00:02:48.193  -->  00:02:51.276
on both of them, cause this is still a button, a button
63

63

00:02:51.276  -->  00:02:55.281
but they do simply create different versions,
64

64

00:02:55.281  -->  00:02:57.564
different modifications, and that's why they're
65

65

00:02:57.564  -->  00:03:00.682
called modifiers, and that's actually all
66

66

00:03:00.682  -->  00:03:03.515
we have to do here in this markup.
67

67

00:03:05.277  -->  00:03:08.703
So we now have this converted to the BEM notation,
68

68

00:03:08.703  -->  00:03:10.976
so let's just go back to the style and
69

69

00:03:10.976  -->  00:03:12.844
change it here as well.
70

70

00:03:12.844  -->  00:03:15.927
So header, and let me just, actually,
71

71

00:03:17.507  -->  00:03:21.007
copy this part, so header, and here we had
72

72

00:03:21.936  -->  00:03:24.519
header_logo and header_text-box
73

73

00:03:26.776  -->  00:03:31.078
and heading primary, so here just a dash missing
74

74

00:03:31.078  -->  00:03:35.569
another dash, here everything stays the same
75

75

00:03:35.569  -->  00:03:37.737
button, everything is good, so here another
76

76

00:03:37.737  -->  00:03:40.487
dash to create this is different,
77

77

00:03:43.315  -->  00:03:46.315
and here the btn-animated all right?
78

78

00:03:48.512  -->  00:03:50.305
So that's actually it, so our code
79

79

00:03:50.305  -->  00:03:51.655
is now converted to BEM.
80

80

00:03:51.655  -->  00:03:53.397
Let's just check if everything's the same
81

81

00:03:53.397  -->  00:03:54.837
here, which, of course, it should, and
82

82

00:03:54.837  -->  00:03:56.459
well something happened, so something is
83

83

00:03:56.459  -->  00:03:58.320
clearly wrong, so let's go back to check
84

84

00:03:58.320  -->  00:04:01.070
if our CSS is completely correct,
85

85

00:04:02.664  -->  00:04:06.739
so let me see if I forgot something here,
86

86

00:04:06.739  -->  00:04:10.906
primary--sub and main okay so here the 't' is missing
87

87

00:04:14.766  -->  00:04:19.474
so I guess that was the problem, it probably was.
88

88

00:04:19.474  -->  00:04:23.141
Well there's another box somewhere, I guess.
89

89

00:04:24.195  -->  00:04:26.846
Ah! Okay that's because I put the 't' in there
90

90

00:04:26.846  -->  00:04:29.643
accidentally, alright but now it should work.
91

91

00:04:29.643  -->  00:04:31.854
And here we go, so everything's back to the same,
92

92

00:04:31.854  -->  00:04:34.809
our code is now converted to BEM,
93

93

00:04:34.809  -->  00:04:37.060
and we're good to go.
94

94

00:04:37.060  -->  00:04:39.377
That actually wraps up this theoretical section.
95

95

00:04:39.377  -->  00:04:43.193
I believe that it was rather intense and sometimes
96

96

00:04:43.193  -->  00:04:45.747
hard to grasp but as I said so many times already,
97

97

00:04:45.747  -->  00:04:48.597
I know that it's really important to go through
98

98

00:04:48.597  -->  00:04:52.386
these theoretical and fundamental aspects of the CSS
99

99

00:04:52.386  -->  00:04:55.496
language, if you really want to grasp it and become
100

100

00:04:55.496  -->  00:04:58.309
more professional in it.
101

101

00:04:58.309  -->  00:04:59.828
So great job! Great Progress!
102

102

00:04:59.828  -->  00:05:01.913
It's amazing that you're still with me and
103

103

00:05:01.913  -->  00:05:04.963
you deserve some break or some rest if you need,
104

104

00:05:04.963  -->  00:05:07.272
and if you don't then just continue to the next
105

105

00:05:07.272  -->  00:05:10.772
lecture and I'll be waiting there for you.
