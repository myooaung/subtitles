00:00:01.021  -->  00:00:02.807
<v ->To finish this section of the course,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.807  -->  00:00:06.723
let's now take care of the functionality of the popup
3

3

00:00:06.723  -->  00:00:08.628
that we just built.
4

4

00:00:08.628  -->  00:00:10.417
Now the way that we're going to make this work
5

5

00:00:10.417  -->  00:00:14.224
is by taking advantage of something that exists in HTML
6

6

00:00:14.224  -->  00:00:16.192
which is called anchors.
7

7

00:00:16.192  -->  00:00:18.977
Now let me start by first showing you that somewhere else
8

8

00:00:18.977  -->  00:00:20.628
on our page, okay.
9

9

00:00:20.628  -->  00:00:23.211
So, let's see how anchors work.
10

10

00:00:24.207  -->  00:00:27.707
So, imagine that here on our Tours section
11

11

00:00:30.063  -->  00:00:34.230
I would place an ID, okay and also call it section Tours.
12

12

00:00:36.454  -->  00:00:37.788
So, it doesn't really matter here,
13

13

00:00:37.788  -->  00:00:39.735
it can be the same as the class.
14

14

00:00:39.735  -->  00:00:43.335
So, I called this one here, section tours, with this ID.
15

15

00:00:43.335  -->  00:00:46.529
And so remember ID's are unique, and so this here will
16

16

00:00:46.529  -->  00:00:49.081
be the only section called section tours, of course.
17

17

00:00:49.081  -->  00:00:51.131
And so HTML knows that.
18

18

00:00:51.131  -->  00:00:54.374
Now, if I go up here and go to this button here,
19

19

00:00:54.374  -->  00:00:56.556
which we have, well where is it?
20

20

00:00:56.556  -->  00:00:57.781
Ah, here.
21

21

00:00:57.781  -->  00:00:59.966
So, discover our tours, okay and so now
22

22

00:00:59.966  -->  00:01:02.460
I can put that ID name in here.
23

23

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:04.377
So, hash section tours.
24

24

00:01:05.643  -->  00:01:08.424
And let me show you what happens then.
25

25

00:01:08.424  -->  00:01:11.576
Well, first we have to actually
26

26

00:01:11.576  -->  00:01:13.826
hide this popup here, okay.
27

27

00:01:14.797  -->  00:01:18.095
So, let's very quickly do that
28

28

00:01:18.095  -->  00:01:20.654
just with display none,
29

29

00:01:20.654  -->  00:01:24.068
and we're going to come back later to this.
30

30

00:01:24.068  -->  00:01:25.960
Okay, so now it's gone.
31

31

00:01:25.960  -->  00:01:28.222
And now when I hit this button,
32

32

00:01:28.222  -->  00:01:30.384
it goes to this section here, okay.
33

33

00:01:30.384  -->  00:01:32.611
And you actually see it here in the URL.
34

34

00:01:32.611  -->  00:01:35.782
So, section tours, and this is what's called an anchor.
35

35

00:01:35.782  -->  00:01:38.355
To here, is basically the anchor,
36

36

00:01:38.355  -->  00:01:41.910
and we can also say in other words that this is the target.
37

37

00:01:41.910  -->  00:01:43.299
So basically, this element here
38

38

00:01:43.299  -->  00:01:45.196
was the target of that, okay?
39

39

00:01:45.196  -->  00:01:47.343
Now I'm just showing you that so that we can later make use
40

40

00:01:47.343  -->  00:01:49.093
of that target, okay.
41

41

00:01:50.020  -->  00:01:52.238
So remember this and we're going to come back to it
42

42

00:01:52.238  -->  00:01:53.238
in a second.
43

43

00:01:54.720  -->  00:01:57.215
Now before we can actually start with the functionality
44

44

00:01:57.215  -->  00:02:00.733
we need to first hide this popup, but display none
45

45

00:02:00.733  -->  00:02:03.042
as we have here is not the best way
46

46

00:02:03.042  -->  00:02:06.881
because if we have display none, we can then not animate it.
47

47

00:02:06.881  -->  00:02:10.000
Okay, so display is either none or something else.
48

48

00:02:10.000  -->  00:02:13.396
There's no numbers and so we cannot animate it over time.
49

49

00:02:13.396  -->  00:02:15.284
So, let's do it in a different way,
50

50

00:02:15.284  -->  00:02:17.724
and we did it already before a couple of times.
51

51

00:02:17.724  -->  00:02:21.474
So, opacity zero, and also visibility hidden.
52

52

00:02:23.564  -->  00:02:26.240
Because remember if we just set opacity to zero,
53

53

00:02:26.240  -->  00:02:28.959
then basically the text, the content will still be there
54

54

00:02:28.959  -->  00:02:30.606
just not visible.
55

55

00:02:30.606  -->  00:02:32.840
And so now with visibility hidden it's also
56

56

00:02:32.840  -->  00:02:34.625
at the same time hidden.
57

57

00:02:34.625  -->  00:02:37.454
And now how do we actually make the popup visible.
58

58

00:02:37.454  -->  00:02:40.618
Well, we just use what we talked a minute before,
59

59

00:02:40.618  -->  00:02:43.332
and that is the anchor and the target, okay.
60

60

00:02:43.332  -->  00:02:47.901
So, what I'm going to do is first in the HTML
61

61

00:02:47.901  -->  00:02:51.244
here in this tour, where is it?
62

62

00:02:51.244  -->  00:02:52.820
Yeah here.
63

63

00:02:52.820  -->  00:02:55.987
So, I will set this one here to popup.
64

64

00:02:57.558  -->  00:02:59.918
So this is the button that should show,
65

65

00:02:59.918  -->  00:03:02.912
or popup when we click it, right?
66

66

00:03:02.912  -->  00:03:06.162
So this button, this one, and this one,
67

67

00:03:08.088  -->  00:03:12.255
and then we need to specify the ID down here at the popup.
68

68

00:03:14.215  -->  00:03:15.215
So ID popup.
69

69

00:03:17.303  -->  00:03:19.525
So when we click that button
70

70

00:03:19.525  -->  00:03:22.697
then the anchor will basically become this popup.
71

71

00:03:22.697  -->  00:03:26.192
So the target, remember I called it the target, okay.
72

72

00:03:26.192  -->  00:03:28.954
So this popup here will become the target.
73

73

00:03:28.954  -->  00:03:32.787
And so what we can we do here is to simply say
74

74

00:03:36.251  -->  00:03:37.094
and that's actually it.
75

75

00:03:37.094  -->  00:03:40.083
So we have the pseudo class called target,
76

76

00:03:40.083  -->  00:03:43.378
which applies to the element which is the target
77

77

00:03:43.378  -->  00:03:46.930
when we click on a button, or basically when the URL changes
78

78

00:03:46.930  -->  00:03:49.254
to having target in it.
79

79

00:03:49.254  -->  00:03:51.685
Because let me show you that to you.
80

80

00:03:51.685  -->  00:03:53.020
If we now hit this here,
81

81

00:03:53.020  -->  00:03:55.888
you will see that now we have popup here.
82

82

00:03:55.888  -->  00:03:59.424
Okay, so in URL now we have popup,
83

83

00:03:59.424  -->  00:04:01.458
and so that is target.
84

84

00:04:01.458  -->  00:04:04.358
And the target is on this popup here
85

85

00:04:04.358  -->  00:04:07.031
and so we can do it like this.
86

86

00:04:07.031  -->  00:04:09.874
Now all I have to do is say opacity one,
87

87

00:04:09.874  -->  00:04:11.791
and visibility visible.
88

88

00:04:13.373  -->  00:04:14.563
And that's it.
89

89

00:04:14.563  -->  00:04:17.042
Now we also need to animate it here a bit.
90

90

00:04:17.042  -->  00:04:21.209
So let's say a transition, all in .3 seconds, okay?
91

91

00:04:23.620  -->  00:04:26.307
So, let's take a look at that.
92

92

00:04:26.307  -->  00:04:29.592
Well we need to delete this here.
93

93

00:04:29.592  -->  00:04:32.509
And now take a look and here we go.
94

94

00:04:33.756  -->  00:04:37.207
So the popup is now visible, great right?
95

95

00:04:37.207  -->  00:04:39.213
So it actually worked.
96

96

00:04:39.213  -->  00:04:41.285
Well we have no way of closing it right now
97

97

00:04:41.285  -->  00:04:44.508
but we will take care of that later.
98

98

00:04:44.508  -->  00:04:45.795
Let me show it again to you,
99

99

00:04:45.795  -->  00:04:49.727
I think the animation wasn't working quite well.
100

100

00:04:49.727  -->  00:04:52.922
But the functionality at least that is on point already.
101

101

00:04:52.922  -->  00:04:56.308
So it's working already right now.
102

102

00:04:56.308  -->  00:04:58.917
Okay, and the animation was not working because
103

103

00:04:58.917  -->  00:05:02.822
of this .3 I was missing this second here.
104

104

00:05:02.822  -->  00:05:04.375
But again, the functionality was just fine.
105

105

00:05:04.375  -->  00:05:06.291
So let me recap what happens here.
106

106

00:05:06.291  -->  00:05:08.442
So that we're 100% on the same page.
107

107

00:05:08.442  -->  00:05:11.215
So we have this button here, right
108

108

00:05:11.215  -->  00:05:13.388
and so this one here.
109

109

00:05:13.388  -->  00:05:16.467
So we click this one here, and then soon as we click
110

110

00:05:16.467  -->  00:05:20.828
this here it gets added to the URL of the page, okay.
111

111

00:05:20.828  -->  00:05:23.911
And so hash popup becomes the target.
112

112

00:05:26.833  -->  00:05:30.726
Okay, but since this one here has the ID of popup
113

113

00:05:30.726  -->  00:05:33.902
the target is basically this entire element, okay.
114

114

00:05:33.902  -->  00:05:36.502
And so as soon as this element becomes the target
115

115

00:05:36.502  -->  00:05:39.697
the pseudo class called target is available on it,
116

116

00:05:39.697  -->  00:05:42.325
and so we can then select that element using
117

117

00:05:42.325  -->  00:05:44.608
that pseudo class as we did here,
118

118

00:05:44.608  -->  00:05:47.591
and then specify our styles on it.
119

119

00:05:47.591  -->  00:05:50.186
And that's all we did, and as you see it's working
120

120

00:05:50.186  -->  00:05:51.733
quite well.
121

121

00:05:51.733  -->  00:05:54.310
Now what we need next is a way of closing this popup.
122

122

00:05:54.310  -->  00:05:57.356
So let's actually put that here in the HTML.
123

123

00:05:57.356  -->  00:05:59.766
So we need like a small button.
124

124

00:05:59.766  -->  00:06:01.687
And so let's put that in here actually.
125

125

00:06:01.687  -->  00:06:04.520
So an anchor tag, and popup close.
126

126

00:06:06.546  -->  00:06:10.713
Now the href here, it will be actually called section tours.
127

127

00:06:13.487  -->  00:06:15.017
Okay, and why is that?
128

128

00:06:15.017  -->  00:06:18.657
Well, because when we hit this link here it will move
129

129

00:06:18.657  -->  00:06:21.270
to the section tours, okay, just as we did
130

130

00:06:21.270  -->  00:06:23.594
with the other button and then this will
131

131

00:06:23.594  -->  00:06:25.327
become the target, right?
132

132

00:06:25.327  -->  00:06:27.708
And if the section tours becomes the target then the popup
133

133

00:06:27.708  -->  00:06:31.558
is no longer the target, meaning that the pseudo class
134

134

00:06:31.558  -->  00:06:34.672
no longer applies and then that means of course
135

135

00:06:34.672  -->  00:06:36.788
that these styles disappear and the popup
136

136

00:06:36.788  -->  00:06:38.615
will be hidden again.
137

137

00:06:38.615  -->  00:06:41.068
So, back to the initial state, alright.
138

138

00:06:41.068  -->  00:06:42.224
Did that make sense?
139

139

00:06:42.224  -->  00:06:45.549
So basically, what this closing button will do
140

140

00:06:45.549  -->  00:06:47.839
is to remove the target from the popup
141

141

00:06:47.839  -->  00:06:50.788
so that it simply loses these styles and then its back
142

142

00:06:50.788  -->  00:06:53.412
to its initial closed state, okay.
143

143

00:06:53.412  -->  00:06:56.745
So that's now style that closing element
144

144

00:06:57.972  -->  00:07:00.071
and actually we should put some text here,
145

145

00:07:00.071  -->  00:07:01.753
we just left it empty.
146

146

00:07:01.753  -->  00:07:04.049
Instead of putting a real icon here or something
147

147

00:07:04.049  -->  00:07:08.216
I will just use another HTML entity and it's called times.
148

148

00:07:09.235  -->  00:07:11.658
And that's basically like an x, okay.
149

149

00:07:11.658  -->  00:07:12.991
So, popup close.
150

150

00:07:14.629  -->  00:07:17.302
And here it is, so if I now hit this one,
151

151

00:07:17.302  -->  00:07:19.977
and I think this H2 is now on top of it,
152

152

00:07:19.977  -->  00:07:23.135
let's try it... no it's not working because this is on top.
153

153

00:07:23.135  -->  00:07:26.832
So we first need to actually style it and position it.
154

154

00:07:26.832  -->  00:07:30.181
So popup close, and it's here already
155

155

00:07:30.181  -->  00:07:34.014
and so let's do some positioning of this link.
156

156

00:07:35.335  -->  00:07:39.335
So we want the link state and the visited state.
157

157

00:07:43.435  -->  00:07:47.621
The color should be, well, the color of the text.
158

158

00:07:47.621  -->  00:07:51.160
I think we have a variable for that,
159

159

00:07:51.160  -->  00:07:53.222
or actually not I think.
160

160

00:07:53.222  -->  00:07:57.139
But it's here, I think this, simply this color.
161

161

00:07:58.054  -->  00:08:00.387
Alright, so color grey-dark.
162

162

00:08:02.834  -->  00:08:05.834
And the position should be absolute,
163

163

00:08:07.099  -->  00:08:11.266
we'll want it 2.5 rem from the top and from the right.
164

164

00:08:14.035  -->  00:08:17.434
So basically in the top right corner.
165

165

00:08:17.434  -->  00:08:20.434
Let's increase it, and so three rem.
166

166

00:08:21.397  -->  00:08:24.730
And of course we want no text decoration
167

167

00:08:26.444  -->  00:08:30.611
in it, so it also be displayed as an inline block.
168

168

00:08:31.637  -->  00:08:34.804
Okay, and then as soon as we hover it,
169

169

00:08:35.679  -->  00:08:39.512
it should just become green, so color primary.
170

170

00:08:47.488  -->  00:08:49.291
So let's take a look at that now.
171

171

00:08:49.291  -->  00:08:51.400
Well, we set the position here to absolute
172

172

00:08:51.400  -->  00:08:55.024
and so it will be positioned to its first positioned parent.
173

173

00:08:55.024  -->  00:08:56.457
So which one is that?
174

174

00:08:56.457  -->  00:09:00.336
Well, it is actually the... yeah the popup itself.
175

175

00:09:00.336  -->  00:09:01.593
Or isn't it?
176

176

00:09:01.593  -->  00:09:04.886
No, I think it's not, because the parent of this one here
177

177

00:09:04.886  -->  00:09:08.745
is the popup right which doesn't have a defined position
178

178

00:09:08.745  -->  00:09:10.601
but then the popup content has.
179

179

00:09:10.601  -->  00:09:14.100
And so it will be positioned relative to the popup content,
180

180

00:09:14.100  -->  00:09:15.394
which is fine.
181

181

00:09:15.394  -->  00:09:18.381
So we don't need to specify the position property on
182

182

00:09:18.381  -->  00:09:20.714
on its parent element, okay.
183

183

00:09:21.701  -->  00:09:24.201
So, let's just check this out.
184

184

00:09:26.080  -->  00:09:29.875
And here we go, and it actually worked already, right?
185

185

00:09:29.875  -->  00:09:32.505
So now here the target is section tours
186

186

00:09:32.505  -->  00:09:36.654
and that means that the popup gets closed because of course
187

187

00:09:36.654  -->  00:09:39.456
the target is no longer the popup.
188

188

00:09:39.456  -->  00:09:41.276
Alright, now it's not already positioned
189

189

00:09:41.276  -->  00:09:43.720
the way we want it to be and it's not becoming green
190

190

00:09:43.720  -->  00:09:47.390
but that's a minor problem that we can fix now.
191

191

00:09:47.390  -->  00:09:50.898
So the color of course, the problem is this one
192

192

00:09:50.898  -->  00:09:52.671
and now as for the position,
193

193

00:09:52.671  -->  00:09:55.060
let's take a look at that again.
194

194

00:09:55.060  -->  00:09:59.227
So, turning green now, but let's inspect it and yeah
195

195

00:10:03.442  -->  00:10:05.120
I see why that's happening.
196

196

00:10:05.120  -->  00:10:07.262
It's because you see it's really high, this element,
197

197

00:10:07.262  -->  00:10:10.724
it's much higher than actually the X symbol itself is.
198

198

00:10:10.724  -->  00:10:13.595
And that's because this is text and so it has
199

199

00:10:13.595  -->  00:10:16.253
this pre-defined line height that we defined.
200

200

00:10:16.253  -->  00:10:19.920
So we should just set the line height to one
201

201

00:10:21.956  -->  00:10:24.834
and then it will actually be exactly here in the place
202

202

00:10:24.834  -->  00:10:27.501
where we want it to be, alright.
203

203

00:10:28.498  -->  00:10:31.581
So it now opens and closes just fine.
204

204

00:10:34.290  -->  00:10:35.778
But there is still one minor difference here,
205

205

00:10:35.778  -->  00:10:37.524
and that's this one.
206

206

00:10:37.524  -->  00:10:41.261
Take a look at the box now, so you see it basically it's
207

207

00:10:41.261  -->  00:10:43.885
coming in toward the user from the back of the page
208

208

00:10:43.885  -->  00:10:46.036
zooming in towards us.
209

209

00:10:46.036  -->  00:10:47.388
So, how do we do that?
210

210

00:10:47.388  -->  00:10:50.619
Well, that's actually very easy.
211

211

00:10:50.619  -->  00:10:53.119
Let's just go back here and...
212

212

00:10:55.202  -->  00:10:58.338
well let me that this code and put it a bit more down
213

213

00:10:58.338  -->  00:11:01.921
where its more logical to be, so down here.
214

214

00:11:03.014  -->  00:11:06.764
So, we want to style the content here, right.
215

215

00:11:11.020  -->  00:11:14.462
At the moment where the popup is open.
216

216

00:11:14.462  -->  00:11:16.470
Well, and when does it happen?
217

217

00:11:16.470  -->  00:11:20.637
Well, of course, when the popup becomes the target.
218

218

00:11:25.988  -->  00:11:27.905
Of course not that one.
219

219

00:11:29.762  -->  00:11:31.141
So, makes sense?
220

220

00:11:31.141  -->  00:11:33.966
Again the popup here becomes the target and then we
221

221

00:11:33.966  -->  00:11:36.654
simply style the child element of the popup
222

222

00:11:36.654  -->  00:11:39.978
which is called popup content, okay.
223

223

00:11:39.978  -->  00:11:43.705
So, what should the initial state of this content be?
224

224

00:11:43.705  -->  00:11:45.429
Well, it's basically scaled down
225

225

00:11:45.429  -->  00:11:48.100
and it's also invisible, right?
226

226

00:11:48.100  -->  00:11:52.267
And so let's start by putting the opacity to zero,
227

227

00:11:53.362  -->  00:11:54.328
and we scale it.
228

228

00:11:54.328  -->  00:11:57.814
Now I'm going to put a transform here and scale
229

229

00:11:57.814  -->  00:12:00.824
but it's not going to work and I'm going to show you why.
230

230

00:12:00.824  -->  00:12:02.572
But I hope you can already
231

231

00:12:02.572  -->  00:12:04.508
imagine why it's not going to work.
232

232

00:12:04.508  -->  00:12:07.801
Okay, because we actually ran into this problem before.
233

233

00:12:07.801  -->  00:12:10.301
So let me just show it to you.
234

234

00:12:12.250  -->  00:12:16.417
Well, that's the original of course, that was stupid.
235

235

00:12:17.513  -->  00:12:22.020
So, adjust we can see it, let me show it to you.
236

236

00:12:22.020  -->  00:12:24.161
And so it's here, it's actually scaled down,
237

237

00:12:24.161  -->  00:12:27.625
but it's down here where it should not really be, right?
238

238

00:12:27.625  -->  00:12:30.533
So, let me inspect it and show it to you
239

239

00:12:30.533  -->  00:12:33.063
why it's happening this way.
240

240

00:12:33.063  -->  00:12:37.984
So the content here, reload it, and yeah alright, so.
241

241

00:12:37.984  -->  00:12:39.421
You see why it's happening?
242

242

00:12:39.421  -->  00:12:41.524
Because we have defined to transform here,
243

243

00:12:41.524  -->  00:12:44.811
but we already had one transform, and you can only have
244

244

00:12:44.811  -->  00:12:46.816
one transform or one property
245

245

00:12:46.816  -->  00:12:48.818
in each declaration block, of course.
246

246

00:12:48.818  -->  00:12:50.700
And so this one here appears less and therefore,
247

247

00:12:50.700  -->  00:12:52.651
it overrides this one.
248

248

00:12:52.651  -->  00:12:55.630
Okay, so let's fix that, and we know that this transform
249

249

00:12:55.630  -->  00:12:58.301
actually comes from this absolute center.
250

250

00:12:58.301  -->  00:13:01.100
So, what do we do when we want two transforms
251

251

00:13:01.100  -->  00:13:01.933
at the same time?
252

252

00:13:01.933  -->  00:13:03.896
Well, we have to put them in the same.
253

253

00:13:03.896  -->  00:13:06.979
And so we're basically repeating the one that we have
254

254

00:13:06.979  -->  00:13:09.769
coming from our mix in, but that's the only way that we
255

255

00:13:09.769  -->  00:13:12.602
have here to do it this way, okay.
256

256

00:13:14.568  -->  00:13:17.401
And so now it should look alright.
257

257

00:13:18.921  -->  00:13:21.900
Okay, and now all we have to do is to then scale it
258

258

00:13:21.900  -->  00:13:26.180
back to 100% as soon as the pop up opens, okay.
259

259

00:13:26.180  -->  00:13:30.347
So let's do that, so the opacity is zero, so it's invisible
260

260

00:13:31.929  -->  00:13:36.096
and then we put it back to one, and scale it back to one.
261

261

00:13:38.267  -->  00:13:39.293
Okay?
262

262

00:13:39.293  -->  00:13:42.960
So these here are basically the open states.
263

263

00:13:45.203  -->  00:13:47.954
So these two is when the popup is open,
264

264

00:13:47.954  -->  00:13:50.675
and that's when its exact position with the perfect size,
265

265

00:13:50.675  -->  00:13:53.830
the perfect opacity, and of course the same thing here
266

266

00:13:53.830  -->  00:13:56.354
for the popup container, basically.
267

267

00:13:56.354  -->  00:14:00.155
Alright, and with that we're almost good to go I believe.
268

268

00:14:00.155  -->  00:14:04.322
We just have to add the animation here, so transition
269

269

00:14:06.481  -->  00:14:08.564
all .4 seconds let's say.
270

270

00:14:11.546  -->  00:14:14.296
So let's take a look at that now.
271

271

00:14:16.325  -->  00:14:19.956
Alright, I just want to add something here to show you
272

272

00:14:19.956  -->  00:14:22.039
and that's a small delay.
273

273

00:14:23.282  -->  00:14:25.889
So remember a transition is just to shorten for a bunch
274

274

00:14:25.889  -->  00:14:28.399
of transition related properties and one of them
275

275

00:14:28.399  -->  00:14:29.767
is transition delay.
276

276

00:14:29.767  -->  00:14:33.270
And so we can just delay this transition here by .2 seconds.
277

277

00:14:33.270  -->  00:14:35.988
So basically with this, we first allow the black background
278

278

00:14:35.988  -->  00:14:40.474
to come in and then after that we fade in our popup box.
279

279

00:14:40.474  -->  00:14:42.991
Okay, so a popup content here.
280

280

00:14:42.991  -->  00:14:46.384
Well it's actually not exactly after the popup fades in
281

281

00:14:46.384  -->  00:14:49.752
because that takes .3 seconds, but doing .2
282

282

00:14:49.752  -->  00:14:51.262
is absolutely fine here.
283

283

00:14:51.262  -->  00:14:52.643
So we don't have to wait all the way
284

284

00:14:52.643  -->  00:14:55.143
until it's completely fade in.
285

285

00:14:56.126  -->  00:14:59.014
So let's try that now, and yeah so I think
286

286

00:14:59.014  -->  00:15:01.540
that actually looks better.
287

287

00:15:01.540  -->  00:15:03.911
Now maybe we can even start from something smaller here
288

288

00:15:03.911  -->  00:15:08.394
than .5, let's see how it looks like with point...
289

289

00:15:08.394  -->  00:15:12.144
with zero and fading it in for half a second.
290

290

00:15:13.473  -->  00:15:15.088
So again we can experiment with this,
291

291

00:15:15.088  -->  00:15:19.255
make it look like we want and yeah I like that one as well.
292

292

00:15:20.531  -->  00:15:22.531
Let's take a look again.
293

293

00:15:23.884  -->  00:15:26.303
Alright, I think that works as well too.
294

294

00:15:26.303  -->  00:15:29.426
Maybe it's a bit too much so let's put .25,
295

295

00:15:29.426  -->  00:15:31.750
but with that we should be good to go.
296

296

00:15:31.750  -->  00:15:34.731
Then again you can change these values for yourself
297

297

00:15:34.731  -->  00:15:38.564
if you want to, but I really like it this way.
298

298

00:15:39.404  -->  00:15:42.343
Alright, and with that we finished this huge part
299

299

00:15:42.343  -->  00:15:43.964
of the project.
300

300

00:15:43.964  -->  00:15:47.916
So almost 25 lectures I believe is this section.
301

301

00:15:47.916  -->  00:15:50.281
And so I'm really glad that you're still sticking
302

302

00:15:50.281  -->  00:15:52.535
with me here at this point.
303

303

00:15:52.535  -->  00:15:55.728
It's really good that you coded this entire webpage here.
304

304

00:15:55.728  -->  00:15:57.489
And so I hope that you really feel
305

305

00:15:57.489  -->  00:15:59.723
the sense of accomplishment after creating
306

306

00:15:59.723  -->  00:16:01.194
such a huge project.
307

307

00:16:01.194  -->  00:16:03.143
Okay, so really great.
308

308

00:16:03.143  -->  00:16:06.423
Great job and congratulations for that.
309

309

00:16:06.423  -->  00:16:10.094
However, we are not really done with this project, okay?
310

310

00:16:10.094  -->  00:16:13.520
Because right now it works on a big screen like this one.
311

311

00:16:13.520  -->  00:16:17.557
But what happens if we would see this on a mobile device?
312

312

00:16:17.557  -->  00:16:20.700
So what happens if we have a smaller screen like this.
313

313

00:16:20.700  -->  00:16:23.733
Well, then this is really a disaster, right.
314

314

00:16:23.733  -->  00:16:27.097
It doesn't look good at all, it's terribly really.
315

315

00:16:27.097  -->  00:16:29.755
And so since this course is on advanced CSS
316

316

00:16:29.755  -->  00:16:32.314
and responsive design, I'm going to teach you
317

317

00:16:32.314  -->  00:16:35.589
how to make this design responsive over the next section,
318

318

00:16:35.589  -->  00:16:38.060
including a topic called responsive images.
319

319

00:16:38.060  -->  00:16:41.068
Which is actually a pretty advanced topic.
320

320

00:16:41.068  -->  00:16:44.309
And so there's a lot more coming up in the next section,
321

321

00:16:44.309  -->  00:16:46.311
really great content again.
322

322

00:16:46.311  -->  00:16:48.363
And so yeah, hope to see you there,
323

323

00:16:48.363  -->  00:16:50.863
and I'm waiting for you there.
