00:00:00.971  -->  00:00:02.441
<v Instructor>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.441  -->  00:00:04.476
It's time to build the last remaining section
3

3

00:00:04.476  -->  00:00:07.104
in this project, which is the footer.
4

4

00:00:07.104  -->  00:00:09.410
Now this is just a very simple section,
5

5

00:00:09.410  -->  00:00:12.173
so there is not so much to learn here anymore.
6

6

00:00:12.173  -->  00:00:13.250
But we are going to put some
7

7

00:00:13.250  -->  00:00:15.992
of the stuff we did before to practice.
8

8

00:00:15.992  -->  00:00:16.825
And don't worry.
9

9

00:00:16.825  -->  00:00:21.150
There's still a ton more to learn in the next lectures.
10

10

00:00:21.150  -->  00:00:22.698
Okay, and that is the footer.
11

11

00:00:22.698  -->  00:00:24.428
So as I said, really simple.
12

12

00:00:24.428  -->  00:00:26.532
Only this dark gray background here.
13

13

00:00:26.532  -->  00:00:28.757
Then this big logo going on here.
14

14

00:00:28.757  -->  00:00:30.616
And then a small navigation on the left side,
15

15

00:00:30.616  -->  00:00:33.913
in this column here, with this hover effect here.
16

16

00:00:33.913  -->  00:00:37.196
And then on the right side, a simple copyright text.
17

17

00:00:37.196  -->  00:00:39.053
And that's really it.
18

18

00:00:39.053  -->  00:00:41.877
So let's start with the mark up again.
19

19

00:00:41.877  -->  00:00:43.747
And now we're actually done here
20

20

00:00:43.747  -->  00:00:46.205
with the main element of our page,
21

21

00:00:46.205  -->  00:00:48.356
because what we're doing now is not
22

22

00:00:48.356  -->  00:00:50.298
anymore the main content of the site,
23

23

00:00:50.298  -->  00:00:53.268
but it's really only the footer.
24

24

00:00:53.268  -->  00:00:54.843
So it's the element footer,
25

25

00:00:54.843  -->  00:00:57.504
and I'm still going to give it a class called footer,
26

26

00:00:57.504  -->  00:00:59.975
because we're still using the BEM notation here,
27

27

00:00:59.975  -->  00:01:04.844
and in that notation, each element should get a class.
28

28

00:01:04.844  -->  00:01:07.309
And so that's what we're doing here as well.
29

29

00:01:07.309  -->  00:01:09.690
Now next up, there is that logo that I showed you.
30

30

00:01:09.690  -->  00:01:12.008
And I wanna put that in a box as well.
31

31

00:01:12.008  -->  00:01:15.758
So let's create a dif called footer logo box,
32

32

00:01:18.220  -->  00:01:21.018
just like we have in the header as well.
33

33

00:01:21.018  -->  00:01:23.552
And then in here goes the logo,
34

34

00:01:23.552  -->  00:01:26.219
with the source of IMG
35

35

00:01:29.009  -->  00:01:30.899
and logo green, two times,
36

36

00:01:30.899  -->  00:01:32.617
so it's the bigger version.
37

37

00:01:32.617  -->  00:01:35.096
But more on that later.
38

38

00:01:35.096  -->  00:01:38.172
Then here the alternative text, just a full logo,
39

39

00:01:38.172  -->  00:01:40.877
and let's add a class to this one as well,
40

40

00:01:40.877  -->  00:01:44.566
and it's a footer logo.
41

41

00:01:44.566  -->  00:01:48.917
So that's the logo, and then down here we have a row.
42

42

00:01:48.917  -->  00:01:53.084
So row, and then cal 1
43

43

00:01:54.353  -->  00:01:57.156
of 2, and this two times,
44

44

00:01:57.156  -->  00:02:00.506
so remember this emmet notation, and so here we go.
45

45

00:02:00.506  -->  00:02:03.890
So in the first column, we want that navigation,
46

46

00:02:03.890  -->  00:02:08.057
so let's call it footer, navigation,
47

47

00:02:08.951  -->  00:02:12.368
and actually we need to put the dot here,
48

48

00:02:13.313  -->  00:02:16.522
and then usually navigation is an ordered list,
49

49

00:02:16.522  -->  00:02:19.639
with a couple of LI, so list items in there,
50

50

00:02:19.639  -->  00:02:21.053
so let's do that as well.
51

51

00:02:21.053  -->  00:02:24.386
So UL, this one is simply a footer list,
52

52

00:02:26.868  -->  00:02:28.849
with a list item in it,
53

53

00:02:28.849  -->  00:02:33.016
so footer item with a link in it.
54

54

00:02:34.319  -->  00:02:38.708
And so this one is going footer link.
55

55

00:02:38.708  -->  00:02:41.348
All right, now the H ref goes to nothing,
56

56

00:02:41.348  -->  00:02:45.384
and the text here is company.
57

57

00:02:45.384  -->  00:02:48.423
So we are just building this navigation.
58

58

00:02:48.423  -->  00:02:52.590
So company, contact us, careers, privacy policy, and terms.
59

59

00:02:57.496  -->  00:03:00.163
So, five times.
60

60

00:03:02.190  -->  00:03:03.925
Actually not correct.
61

61

00:03:03.925  -->  00:03:08.092
So, company, contact us, careers,
62

62

00:03:11.264  -->  00:03:12.675
and I think that's not correct,
63

63

00:03:12.675  -->  00:03:15.592
so careers, privacy,
64

64

00:03:18.039  -->  00:03:19.706
and terms.
65

65

00:03:19.706  -->  00:03:21.990
So just that we have some items in there.
66

66

00:03:21.990  -->  00:03:26.060
So that is the first column and the second column.
67

67

00:03:26.060  -->  00:03:29.693
Let's just put a paragraph in there.
68

68

00:03:29.693  -->  00:03:32.970
Footer, and here we will have the copyright text.
69

69

00:03:32.970  -->  00:03:36.053
So copyright.
70

70

00:03:38.195  -->  00:03:42.362
Okay, so let's say build by, and then a link,
71

71

00:03:46.769  -->  00:03:49.465
a footer link, so we're basically reusing
72

72

00:03:49.465  -->  00:03:52.298
the ones here from the navigation,
73

73

00:03:54.329  -->  00:03:55.803
so going to nowhere,
74

74

00:03:55.803  -->  00:03:57.695
and then I just wanna put my name here,
75

75

00:03:57.695  -->  00:04:01.952
just to put some text here
76

76

00:04:01.952  -->  00:04:03.334
for his online course.
77

77

00:04:03.334  -->  00:04:05.333
Of course you can do something different here.
78

78

00:04:05.333  -->  00:04:06.552
I just wanna put some links here
79

79

00:04:06.552  -->  00:04:09.408
to show you what an effect, that I came up with,
80

80

00:04:09.408  -->  00:04:10.778
which is really cool I think.
81

81

00:04:10.778  -->  00:04:13.611
So I'm putting some links in here.
82

82

00:04:18.793  -->  00:04:22.960
For his online course, advanced CSS, and Sass.
83

83

00:04:26.426  -->  00:04:28.870
And now I'm gonna put some copyright information in here,
84

84

00:04:28.870  -->  00:04:31.749
because I get this question all the time from students,
85

85

00:04:31.749  -->  00:04:35.302
and so this time I thought I'll make it very clear
86

86

00:04:35.302  -->  00:04:36.746
what you can do with this page.
87

87

00:04:36.746  -->  00:04:39.926
So copyright, and now I'm using a special entity,
88

88

00:04:39.926  -->  00:04:42.259
so it's copied
89

89

00:04:44.366  -->  00:04:47.577
by Jonas Schmedtmann, that's me.
90

90

00:04:47.577  -->  00:04:50.358
And now here's what you can do with this website.
91

91

00:04:50.358  -->  00:04:54.525
So you are 100% allowed to use this webpage
92

92

00:04:57.218  -->  00:05:01.385
for both personal and commercial use,
93

93

00:05:04.047  -->  00:05:08.214
but not to claim it as your own design.
94

94

00:05:11.744  -->  00:05:14.327
A credit to the original author
95

95

00:05:18.670  -->  00:05:22.874
is of course highly appreciated.
96

96

00:05:22.874  -->  00:05:25.220
So I think that's pretty self-explanatory.
97

97

00:05:25.220  -->  00:05:28.959
So please go ahead and put this webpage on your portfolio,
98

98

00:05:28.959  -->  00:05:30.798
or whatever page you want to put it
99

99

00:05:30.798  -->  00:05:34.112
to show to some potential clients or something.
100

100

00:05:34.112  -->  00:05:35.382
So that's no problem with me.
101

101

00:05:35.382  -->  00:05:38.349
Just don't say that you designed this webpage on your own.
102

102

00:05:38.349  -->  00:05:42.211
Okay, so that's pretty much it, I would say.
103

103

00:05:42.211  -->  00:05:44.263
So that's it for the HTML.
104

104

00:05:44.263  -->  00:05:46.855
Let's now go ahead and actually format this.
105

105

00:05:46.855  -->  00:05:49.188
So there's layout this time,
106

106

00:05:53.043  -->  00:05:57.210
so the footer, then of course we need to include it here.
107

107

00:06:06.279  -->  00:06:09.904
And that's not correct, so footer.
108

108

00:06:09.904  -->  00:06:14.071
Now to start, let's give it some background color.
109

109

00:06:16.208  -->  00:06:17.802
And we want something really dark here,
110

110

00:06:17.802  -->  00:06:19.378
so let's see what we have here.
111

111

00:06:19.378  -->  00:06:21.597
And this is actually not dark enough.
112

112

00:06:21.597  -->  00:06:25.467
So let's create a third one, in a three, three, three.
113

113

00:06:25.467  -->  00:06:27.470
So this is pretty dark,
114

114

00:06:27.470  -->  00:06:30.137
and let's get the name of it so.
115

115

00:06:32.244  -->  00:06:33.443
So I'm padding of course.
116

116

00:06:33.443  -->  00:06:34.764
Not as much as the other sections,
117

117

00:06:34.764  -->  00:06:36.532
because this one is not as important,
118

118

00:06:36.532  -->  00:06:39.205
so we don't wanna give it that much space.
119

119

00:06:39.205  -->  00:06:41.611
And the font size can also be a bit smaller,
120

120

00:06:41.611  -->  00:06:44.884
so we don't need this one to be as big.
121

121

00:06:44.884  -->  00:06:47.051
Then we have the logo box.
122

122

00:06:50.914  -->  00:06:54.353
So we have the logo box, we have the logo,
123

123

00:06:54.353  -->  00:06:55.856
so let's prepare.
124

124

00:06:55.856  -->  00:06:58.486
All of these selectors there for ourselves,
125

125

00:06:58.486  -->  00:07:00.403
we have the navigation,
126

126

00:07:03.773  -->  00:07:05.641
so navigation,
127

127

00:07:05.641  -->  00:07:08.141
we have the list, and in there
128

128

00:07:11.525  -->  00:07:13.025
we have the items,
129

129

00:07:16.091  -->  00:07:17.605
and we have the links.
130

130

00:07:17.605  -->  00:07:19.855
So a lot of selectors here.
131

131

00:07:22.241  -->  00:07:24.723
I think it's actually link.
132

132

00:07:24.723  -->  00:07:27.840
So what do we want the logo to look like?
133

133

00:07:27.840  -->  00:07:30.432
Let's specify a width very simply.
134

134

00:07:30.432  -->  00:07:31.314
Oh, 15 rm.
135

135

00:07:31.314  -->  00:07:34.858
And then the height can adjust automatically.
136

136

00:07:34.858  -->  00:07:38.909
Okay, so let's just take a look at that.
137

137

00:07:38.909  -->  00:07:40.587
And here we are.
138

138

00:07:40.587  -->  00:07:43.974
Well, that doesn't quite look exactly as we specified,
139

139

00:07:43.974  -->  00:07:47.148
so let's see what's going on here.
140

140

00:07:47.148  -->  00:07:48.795
Well maybe we didn't quite
141

141

00:07:48.795  -->  00:07:50.542
include it right here in the main.
142

142

00:07:50.542  -->  00:07:53.143
Let's take a look at layout, footer.
143

143

00:07:53.143  -->  00:07:54.658
So that should be okay.
144

144

00:07:54.658  -->  00:07:59.630
Maybe I have this error going on again in the terminal.
145

145

00:07:59.630  -->  00:08:02.109
No, okay, so color, gray dark,
146

146

00:08:02.109  -->  00:08:03.749
and define variable.
147

147

00:08:03.749  -->  00:08:06.916
Okay, I see, there's some error there.
148

148

00:08:08.245  -->  00:08:09.850
So I didn't copy the three.
149

149

00:08:09.850  -->  00:08:11.379
So that was the problem.
150

150

00:08:11.379  -->  00:08:12.424
Let's check it out now.
151

151

00:08:12.424  -->  00:08:13.457
And here we go.
152

152

00:08:13.457  -->  00:08:15.830
Okay, much better now.
153

153

00:08:15.830  -->  00:08:17.562
Okay, now we want this logo here
154

154

00:08:17.562  -->  00:08:19.198
to be centered of course in all of this,
155

155

00:08:19.198  -->  00:08:21.162
and then some space here.
156

156

00:08:21.162  -->  00:08:23.308
Right, so how can we do that?
157

157

00:08:23.308  -->  00:08:24.453
What do you think?
158

158

00:08:24.453  -->  00:08:26.466
Well, I think it's actually pretty easy,
159

159

00:08:26.466  -->  00:08:28.904
because the image is in inline elemented,
160

160

00:08:28.904  -->  00:08:33.597
so all we have to do here is to say text align center,
161

161

00:08:33.597  -->  00:08:35.577
and then that will center the image,
162

162

00:08:35.577  -->  00:08:37.641
because an inline element behaves just like text,
163

163

00:08:37.641  -->  00:08:40.891
and then adjust the margin bottom here.
164

164

00:08:42.494  -->  00:08:44.523
Eight rem, okay.
165

165

00:08:44.523  -->  00:08:47.012
So that should look fine now.
166

166

00:08:47.012  -->  00:08:48.316
Exactly.
167

167

00:08:48.316  -->  00:08:51.649
Okay, now let's do this navigation here.
168

168

00:08:52.622  -->  00:08:56.246
First the list, we don't want any lists down here.
169

169

00:08:56.246  -->  00:08:58.614
So list style, none.
170

170

00:08:58.614  -->  00:09:01.182
Okay, so that's enough for this.
171

171

00:09:01.182  -->  00:09:04.535
And then the items, you want them side by side, right?
172

172

00:09:04.535  -->  00:09:06.140
But not as floated elements.
173

173

00:09:06.140  -->  00:09:09.057
It's way easier to make this as inlined elements.
174

174

00:09:09.057  -->  00:09:12.307
So display inline block.
175

175

00:09:13.705  -->  00:09:15.495
And then just give them some spacing.
176

176

00:09:15.495  -->  00:09:17.851
Just some right margin on all of them
177

177

00:09:17.851  -->  00:09:20.362
except the last one, as always.
178

178

00:09:20.362  -->  00:09:23.409
So that's nothing new for you at this point.
179

179

00:09:23.409  -->  00:09:25.826
So not last child.
180

180

00:09:28.157  -->  00:09:31.448
That came in that second column there, but no problem.
181

181

00:09:31.448  -->  00:09:33.859
So margin right.
182

182

00:09:33.859  -->  00:09:36.700
Let's say 1.5 rem.
183

183

00:09:36.700  -->  00:09:38.964
And now finally, as for the links,
184

184

00:09:38.964  -->  00:09:42.881
we want to state 40 link state,
185

185

00:09:44.688  -->  00:09:47.938
and for the visited one.
186

186

00:09:49.030  -->  00:09:51.697
So visited, of course.
187

187

00:09:53.790  -->  00:09:58.738
And so color, we want this nice gray,
188

188

00:09:58.738  -->  00:10:01.037
so this very light gray,
189

189

00:10:01.037  -->  00:10:02.381
so this one here.
190

190

00:10:02.381  -->  00:10:04.214
So color, gray, light.
191

191

00:10:06.239  -->  00:10:10.637
'Cause white on dark always looks a bit weird,
192

192

00:10:10.637  -->  00:10:12.824
and so I try to avoid that.
193

193

00:10:12.824  -->  00:10:16.991
So the color, then the text decorations should go away.
194

194

00:10:18.679  -->  00:10:21.840
Always do that usually on links.
195

195

00:10:21.840  -->  00:10:25.103
Text transform, uppercase once again,
196

196

00:10:25.103  -->  00:10:29.186
and then I want them to be inline blocks as well.
197

197

00:10:33.029  -->  00:10:37.196
All right, and now when they are hovered or clicked,
198

198

00:10:41.474  -->  00:10:45.282
so when they're active, I want them to be green,
199

199

00:10:45.282  -->  00:10:46.782
so color, primary,
200

200

00:10:49.148  -->  00:10:51.453
and they should have a bit of a shadow,
201

201

00:10:51.453  -->  00:10:55.943
so this crazy effect that I showed you before.
202

202

00:10:55.943  -->  00:10:59.110
So once again, zero, one rem, two rem,
203

203

00:11:01.469  -->  00:11:03.472
and if these colors seem a bit dull to you,
204

204

00:11:03.472  -->  00:11:04.608
then once again, please,
205

205

00:11:04.608  -->  00:11:09.328
I really encourage you to play around with these.
206

206

00:11:09.328  -->  00:11:11.807
And .4 here, so a bit darker,
207

207

00:11:11.807  -->  00:11:13.047
so that we can actually see it
208

208

00:11:13.047  -->  00:11:16.104
against that dark background.
209

209

00:11:16.104  -->  00:11:17.707
Okay, so let's just take a quick look,
210

210

00:11:17.707  -->  00:11:20.838
and that looks pretty good already.
211

211

00:11:20.838  -->  00:11:24.505
So what we had here was actually
212

212

00:11:25.933  -->  00:11:28.683
this here as well, so this style,
213

213

00:11:30.659  -->  00:11:33.922
so we need a transform here, right?
214

214

00:11:33.922  -->  00:11:35.153
So, how do we do that?
215

215

00:11:35.153  -->  00:11:36.523
Do you have a good idea?
216

216

00:11:36.523  -->  00:11:37.719
Well, it's very simple.
217

217

00:11:37.719  -->  00:11:41.254
We just rotate it like five degrees,
218

218

00:11:41.254  -->  00:11:45.529
and also scale it a bit, like 1.3.
219

219

00:11:45.529  -->  00:11:47.568
Okay, and so that should be enough.
220

220

00:11:47.568  -->  00:11:49.672
All right, so let's see.
221

221

00:11:49.672  -->  00:11:52.922
This is the original one, this is ours.
222

222

00:11:54.335  -->  00:11:55.813
So all right.
223

223

00:11:55.813  -->  00:11:57.223
Looks already pretty good.
224

224

00:11:57.223  -->  00:11:59.824
Well, you see that this like transparent,
225

225

00:11:59.824  -->  00:12:01.836
so it's here on top of the other text,
226

226

00:12:01.836  -->  00:12:03.178
so we should fix that.
227

227

00:12:03.178  -->  00:12:06.532
And then we want this, of course, the animation to happen,
228

228

00:12:06.532  -->  00:12:09.995
and you also saw that slide, this gray line here,
229

229

00:12:09.995  -->  00:12:13.745
so let's put that on ours as well.
230

230

00:12:15.068  -->  00:12:18.679
So of course the transition,
231

231

00:12:18.679  -->  00:12:22.083
all in 2.2 seconds,
232

232

00:12:22.083  -->  00:12:26.250
and then what we need here is also this background color.
233

233

00:12:28.112  -->  00:12:32.004
So background color, dark gray.
234

234

00:12:32.004  -->  00:12:34.454
So the same as the footer's background.
235

235

00:12:34.454  -->  00:12:37.827
Now about that line, that should also be pretty simple.
236

236

00:12:37.827  -->  00:12:41.167
So, it should be here on navigation, all right?
237

237

00:12:41.167  -->  00:12:45.974
So border top, one pixel, solid,
238

238

00:12:45.974  -->  00:12:48.807
and then let's see what kind of color we can use,
239

239

00:12:48.807  -->  00:12:53.149
so let's use this light gray color here again.
240

240

00:12:53.149  -->  00:12:56.816
Okay, you can do some petting there as well.
241

241

00:12:58.107  -->  00:12:59.756
Like two rem.
242

242

00:12:59.756  -->  00:13:03.598
Actually petting top, so the space
243

243

00:13:03.598  -->  00:13:06.321
between the line and the navigation itself.
244

244

00:13:06.321  -->  00:13:07.427
So just like this.
245

245

00:13:07.427  -->  00:13:11.337
Now we only want this line to come here until this point.
246

246

00:13:11.337  -->  00:13:14.903
And it's also a bit too light, but that's not important.
247

247

00:13:14.903  -->  00:13:18.408
For now what I want is that this only comes to here.
248

248

00:13:18.408  -->  00:13:20.665
So again, do we have an idea how to do that?
249

249

00:13:20.665  -->  00:13:23.090
Well, it's actually pretty simple,
250

250

00:13:23.090  -->  00:13:26.178
so what do we have to do here?
251

251

00:13:26.178  -->  00:13:28.415
Display, inline block.
252

252

00:13:28.415  -->  00:13:29.846
And why does that work?
253

253

00:13:29.846  -->  00:13:31.165
Well, just because an inline block
254

254

00:13:31.165  -->  00:13:34.040
does not occupy 100% of its available width,
255

255

00:13:34.040  -->  00:13:36.156
only the one that the content needs.
256

256

00:13:36.156  -->  00:13:38.155
And so that will fix it.
257

257

00:13:38.155  -->  00:13:41.988
Now the color, let's put this darker one here.
258

258

00:13:45.154  -->  00:13:46.236
And so that's it.
259

259

00:13:46.236  -->  00:13:49.844
And so all we have to do now is to copyright here.
260

260

00:13:49.844  -->  00:13:52.880
So just the final copyright.
261

261

00:13:52.880  -->  00:13:54.401
And where is that?
262

262

00:13:54.401  -->  00:13:56.568
Yeah, here, on this level.
263

263

00:13:57.934  -->  00:13:59.101
So, copyright.
264

264

00:14:02.201  -->  00:14:05.677
We want it to have the same color as the link text,
265

265

00:14:05.677  -->  00:14:09.844
so color, gray light, okay.
266

266

00:14:11.519  -->  00:14:13.216
And we can actually put that here
267

267

00:14:13.216  -->  00:14:15.595
in the top, in the footer,
268

268

00:14:15.595  -->  00:14:19.762
because then this here will simply inherit that style,
269

269

00:14:21.237  -->  00:14:22.651
and then we also want this one
270

270

00:14:22.651  -->  00:14:26.734
to have this line here on top, so just like this.
271

271

00:14:32.718  -->  00:14:34.152
So let's check it out.
272

272

00:14:34.152  -->  00:14:37.321
Okay, now it doesn't look very symmetric here,
273

273

00:14:37.321  -->  00:14:41.163
so that's decrease the width here of this entire thing.
274

274

00:14:41.163  -->  00:14:44.771
So if we decrease this, then it will look better.
275

275

00:14:44.771  -->  00:14:47.188
It will not 100% fix it,
276

276

00:14:48.126  -->  00:14:50.085
but let's take a look at that later.
277

277

00:14:50.085  -->  00:14:52.168
So 80%, for example.
278

278

00:14:53.819  -->  00:14:56.465
It doesn't fix it because, well,
279

279

00:14:56.465  -->  00:15:00.002
now the empty space that we wanted is here on this side.
280

280

00:15:00.002  -->  00:15:03.085
And so finally, just say float right,
281

281

00:15:05.143  -->  00:15:06.708
and that is it.
282

282

00:15:06.708  -->  00:15:07.541
All right.
283

283

00:15:07.541  -->  00:15:09.389
So that looks better now.
284

284

00:15:09.389  -->  00:15:12.991
The animation is happening on this links here as well,
285

285

00:15:12.991  -->  00:15:16.312
and so yeah, that looks better.
286

286

00:15:16.312  -->  00:15:17.495
And that's it.
287

287

00:15:17.495  -->  00:15:19.430
So we designed a very simple footer,
288

288

00:15:19.430  -->  00:15:21.896
with the huge logo, to finish this page.
289

289

00:15:21.896  -->  00:15:24.647
So the page is now almost finished,
290

290

00:15:24.647  -->  00:15:26.872
but not exactly finished,
291

291

00:15:26.872  -->  00:15:29.533
because now there are two major things missing.
292

292

00:15:29.533  -->  00:15:32.346
The first one is this navigation here,
293

293

00:15:32.346  -->  00:15:34.674
so that's what we're gonna do next,
294

294

00:15:34.674  -->  00:15:37.367
so this really great effect here,
295

295

00:15:37.367  -->  00:15:40.412
and then finally, what's also missing,
296

296

00:15:40.412  -->  00:15:42.798
is this pop-up effect,
297

297

00:15:42.798  -->  00:15:46.200
so these are two things that I'll have to do,
298

298

00:15:46.200  -->  00:15:49.368
and we're gonna tackle these over the next lectures.
299

299

00:15:49.368  -->  00:15:52.035
So stay tuned and see you later.
