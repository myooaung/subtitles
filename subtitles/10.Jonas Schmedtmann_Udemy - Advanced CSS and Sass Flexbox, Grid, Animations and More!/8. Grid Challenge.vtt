00:00:01.291  -->  00:00:02.475
<v ->Hey there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.475  -->  00:00:06.266
So, after our very first, very small, grid demo,
3

3

00:00:06.266  -->  00:00:07.962
I now have a small challenge for you,
4

4

00:00:07.962  -->  00:00:10.365
so that you can immediately apply
5

5

00:00:10.365  -->  00:00:13.355
what you just learned in the last couple of lectures.
6

6

00:00:13.355  -->  00:00:14.997
And this is the challenge.
7

7

00:00:14.997  -->  00:00:17.267
So right here, I have a small layout
8

8

00:00:17.267  -->  00:00:20.472
with a medium complex structure.
9

9

00:00:20.472  -->  00:00:21.992
And what I want you to do is
10

10

00:00:21.992  -->  00:00:26.358
to simply recreate this entire layout using CSS grid.
11

11

00:00:26.358  -->  00:00:28.268
So that shouldn't be all too hard
12

12

00:00:28.268  -->  00:00:30.665
after what you just learned, right?
13

13

00:00:30.665  -->  00:00:33.213
So just a couple of notes here, for example,
14

14

00:00:33.213  -->  00:00:35.205
note that this column here
15

15

00:00:35.205  -->  00:00:36.876
on the right side with the sidebar,
16

16

00:00:36.876  -->  00:00:41.089
is slightly more narrow than these three columns here.
17

17

00:00:41.089  -->  00:00:44.359
So you can try to define the size of this column here,
18

18

00:00:44.359  -->  00:00:46.867
so the width of this track,
19

19

00:00:46.867  -->  00:00:49.270
and then divide the remaining space
20

20

00:00:49.270  -->  00:00:52.413
through the other columns, the other tracks.
21

21

00:00:52.413  -->  00:00:54.955
So I'm sure you already know how to do that.
22

22

00:00:54.955  -->  00:00:56.364
Then in these other elements here,
23

23

00:00:56.364  -->  00:00:58.578
like the header, and the footer, and the content,
24

24

00:00:58.578  -->  00:01:00.906
you'll also have some spanning going on,
25

25

00:01:00.906  -->  00:01:03.552
as you can probably already see.
26

26

00:01:03.552  -->  00:01:05.404
Then you also have this gutter here,
27

27

00:01:05.404  -->  00:01:07.575
and it's actually the same gutter for the rows,
28

28

00:01:07.575  -->  00:01:09.031
and for the columns.
29

29

00:01:09.031  -->  00:01:12.143
So that should be really simple as well, to you.
30

30

00:01:12.143  -->  00:01:13.699
Now this layout is...
31

31

00:01:13.699  -->  00:01:16.736
Is a layout that would've been extremely difficult
32

32

00:01:16.736  -->  00:01:20.497
to make it right using the old school CSS techniques.
33

33

00:01:20.497  -->  00:01:22.034
Like float layouts.
34

34

00:01:22.034  -->  00:01:25.130
But with CSS grid, you're gonna see how easy it is
35

35

00:01:25.130  -->  00:01:27.497
to implement this kind of layout.
36

36

00:01:27.497  -->  00:01:30.970
And this actually looks already like a real world layout.
37

37

00:01:30.970  -->  00:01:33.378
So this could perfectly be like a blog,
38

38

00:01:33.378  -->  00:01:35.294
or something like that.
39

39

00:01:35.294  -->  00:01:37.023
Imagine this is a blog with a header,
40

40

00:01:37.023  -->  00:01:40.263
then three featured posts, and here a main post,
41

41

00:01:40.263  -->  00:01:43.381
a footer down here with info about the site,
42

42

00:01:43.381  -->  00:01:45.491
and then here of course, a sidebar,
43

43

00:01:45.491  -->  00:01:48.875
with the usual stuff that you see in a blog.
44

44

00:01:48.875  -->  00:01:50.683
So I hope this isn't all too hard for you
45

45

00:01:50.683  -->  00:01:53.171
after these last couple of lectures.
46

46

00:01:53.171  -->  00:01:54.979
But if it is a bit too hard for you,
47

47

00:01:54.979  -->  00:01:57.548
then it's actually no problem at all, okay?
48

48

00:01:57.548  -->  00:02:00.192
What I really want you to do is to try it.
49

49

00:02:00.192  -->  00:02:03.465
It's not so important if you actually can do it or not.
50

50

00:02:03.465  -->  00:02:06.344
The most important part, believe me, is trying.
51

51

00:02:06.344  -->  00:02:08.074
And I made this challenge a bit complex,
52

52

00:02:08.074  -->  00:02:10.345
a bit difficult on purpose,
53

53

00:02:10.345  -->  00:02:12.237
so that you get really challenged.
54

54

00:02:12.237  -->  00:02:14.524
So I could've done something really simple like,
55

55

00:02:14.524  -->  00:02:16.839
just this part here of the layout.
56

56

00:02:16.839  -->  00:02:20.147
So just three boxes and then one spanning an element below.
57

57

00:02:20.147  -->  00:02:22.174
But I think that would've been too simple.
58

58

00:02:22.174  -->  00:02:23.387
You wouldn't have been challenged,
59

59

00:02:23.387  -->  00:02:24.909
and then you wouldn't progress.
60

60

00:02:24.909  -->  00:02:27.230
You wouldn't really learn anything new.
61

61

00:02:27.230  -->  00:02:29.215
And so like this, it's a bit more difficult.
62

62

00:02:29.215  -->  00:02:30.662
But then you really have to think,
63

63

00:02:30.662  -->  00:02:33.320
and that will move you forward.
64

64

00:02:33.320  -->  00:02:34.724
So I hope you manage to do it.
65

65

00:02:34.724  -->  00:02:35.959
But if you don't, no problem,
66

66

00:02:35.959  -->  00:02:37.698
just move on to the next lecture
67

67

00:02:37.698  -->  00:02:41.396
where I will then show you the solution of this.
68

68

00:02:41.396  -->  00:02:44.479
So good luck and see you in a minute.
