00:00:01.158  -->  00:00:02.273
<v Instructor>This is part three.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.273  -->  00:00:06.998
And hopefully, the last part of building the about section.
3

3

00:00:06.998  -->  00:00:08.794
So this is what we want to build.
4

4

00:00:08.794  -->  00:00:09.978
So we have these three images here
5

5

00:00:09.978  -->  00:00:13.061
and when hover one, it comes to the top
6

6

00:00:13.061  -->  00:00:17.655
and it will have this green-like border around it.
7

7

00:00:17.655  -->  00:00:21.236
And also, when we hover one, the other ones become smaller.
8

8

00:00:21.236  -->  00:00:22.726
So you see, this one grows,
9

9

00:00:22.726  -->  00:00:24.774
and the other ones become smaller.
10

10

00:00:24.774  -->  00:00:26.096
Right? You see that?
11

11

00:00:26.096  -->  00:00:28.346
Okay, so let's now do that.
12

12

00:00:30.723  -->  00:00:33.473
And we start with the HTML again.
13

13

00:00:34.541  -->  00:00:38.664
And so let me show you some more Emmet magic.
14

14

00:00:38.664  -->  00:00:42.184
So we're gonna start with a div, called composition.
15

15

00:00:42.184  -->  00:00:44.667
Because that's what our component is going to be called.
16

16

00:00:44.667  -->  00:00:46.000
So, composition.
17

17

00:00:47.927  -->  00:00:51.145
And now, right from this Emmet abbreviation
18

18

00:00:51.145  -->  00:00:54.545
I can actually continue writing it like this.
19

19

00:00:54.545  -->  00:00:58.736
So now, I am defining the children of this composition class
20

20

00:00:58.736  -->  00:01:02.974
So what I want right now is to have an image
21

21

00:01:02.974  -->  00:01:05.557
with a class composition photo.
22

22

00:01:08.909  -->  00:01:11.542
So remember the BEM methodology.
23

23

00:01:11.542  -->  00:01:12.991
So this is the block,
24

24

00:01:12.991  -->  00:01:14.732
and this is the element. And then we have to repeat
25

25

00:01:14.732  -->  00:01:18.519
the name of the block in the class name for the element.
26

26

00:01:18.519  -->  00:01:22.019
So again, this is the element inside of the block.
27

27

00:01:22.019  -->  00:01:24.317
Now these three images that we're gonna put here,
28

28

00:01:24.317  -->  00:01:25.989
they are completely different.
29

29

00:01:25.989  -->  00:01:26.822
Let me show you again.
30

30

00:01:26.822  -->  00:01:29.235
They are, for example, at different positions.
31

31

00:01:29.235  -->  00:01:32.286
And so, we need for each of them also, a modifier.
32

32

00:01:32.286  -->  00:01:33.119
Remember?
33

33

00:01:33.119  -->  00:01:36.074
So B-E-M stands for Block Element Modifier.
34

34

00:01:36.074  -->  00:01:37.412
So we have to block the element.
35

35

00:01:37.412  -->  00:01:39.663
And now let's also add a modifier.
36

36

00:01:39.663  -->  00:01:41.531
And so we add a second class.
37

37

00:01:41.531  -->  00:01:45.125
And in Emmet, in order to do that, we just use a second dot.
38

38

00:01:45.125  -->  00:01:47.458
So, composition photo again.
39

39

00:01:50.015  -->  00:01:50.848
And then remember
40

40

00:01:50.848  -->  00:01:54.376
for the modifier, just dash dash then p1,
41

41

00:01:54.376  -->  00:01:57.734
which stands for photo, or for picture, one.
42

42

00:01:57.734  -->  00:02:00.381
Alright, and now we want it three times.
43

43

00:02:00.381  -->  00:02:03.655
So we can just put parentheses around here.
44

44

00:02:03.655  -->  00:02:04.488
Times three.
45

45

00:02:04.488  -->  00:02:05.731
And now hit tab.
46

46

00:02:05.731  -->  00:02:07.820
Alright, and here we go.
47

47

00:02:07.820  -->  00:02:10.237
So, we have our div with the composition down
48

48

00:02:10.237  -->  00:02:13.355
to three images. With the composition photo class,
49

49

00:02:13.355  -->  00:02:16.674
the composition photo p1, and then we just have
50

50

00:02:16.674  -->  00:02:19.112
to change two and three here.
51

51

00:02:19.112  -->  00:02:21.982
But for now, let's just fill out these Emmet sources here.
52

52

00:02:21.982  -->  00:02:25.482
So img and then, this one is called nat-1.
53

53

00:02:28.265  -->  00:02:30.201
Actually, not that one.
54

54

00:02:30.201  -->  00:02:31.368
So, jpg, okay?
55

55

00:02:32.667  -->  00:02:35.886
So now the alt, let's simply call it Photo One.
56

56

00:02:35.886  -->  00:02:38.629
And not make a big deal out of this alt.
57

57

00:02:38.629  -->  00:02:40.525
And all I did now was to hit tab.
58

58

00:02:40.525  -->  00:02:43.897
And it went to this next source definition here.
59

59

00:02:43.897  -->  00:02:47.084
So img, nat, and as you can guess,
60

60

00:02:47.084  -->  00:02:50.890
this one is going to be called the number two.
61

61

00:02:50.890  -->  00:02:54.789
I hit tab again, and it goes right to the next place
62

62

00:02:54.789  -->  00:02:57.202
where I want to write some text.
63

63

00:02:57.202  -->  00:02:59.110
So this is really smart, really intelligent.
64

64

00:02:59.110  -->  00:03:00.866
It knows what I want to do.
65

65

00:03:00.866  -->  00:03:02.800
I hit tab again, and it's the next place
66

66

00:03:02.800  -->  00:03:05.510
where I want to write some code, of course.
67

67

00:03:05.510  -->  00:03:08.760
And now, the number three, and Photo 3.
68

68

00:03:11.710  -->  00:03:15.039
And now that we just changed this here, so two and three.
69

69

00:03:15.039  -->  00:03:16.433
And that's all markup.
70

70

00:03:16.433  -->  00:03:18.465
So three images with three alt texts.
71

71

00:03:18.465  -->  00:03:21.669
They all share the same element class.
72

72

00:03:21.669  -->  00:03:23.593
Then each of them will have a different
73

73

00:03:23.593  -->  00:03:27.048
modifier because each of them is a bit different.
74

74

00:03:27.048  -->  00:03:30.015
Okay, now let's create a new file in here
75

75

00:03:30.015  -->  00:03:33.932
in the components and call it composition.scss.
76

76

00:03:36.636  -->  00:03:38.300
And then don't forget to edit here in the main
77

77

00:03:38.300  -->  00:03:42.896
file, otherwise you may forget it a bit later.
78

78

00:03:42.896  -->  00:03:47.063
So, import components/composition, and here we go.
79

79

00:03:53.583  -->  00:03:56.416
So, save and close and here we go.
80

80

00:03:59.616  -->  00:04:02.109
So what styles do we want for the composition?
81

81

00:04:02.109  -->  00:04:05.063
Well, actually not much, at least not for now.
82

82

00:04:05.063  -->  00:04:09.230
So let's continue with nesting further down, so photo.
83

83

00:04:12.907  -->  00:04:14.061
So these are our elements.
84

84

00:04:14.061  -->  00:04:16.153
So composition photo.
85

85

00:04:16.153  -->  00:04:17.106
And actually, let's now take a look at how
86

86

00:04:17.106  -->  00:04:20.023
they look like without any styling.
87

87

00:04:21.104  -->  00:04:24.100
You see that it puts them one after the other
88

88

00:04:24.100  -->  00:04:25.137
down here and down here.
89

89

00:04:25.137  -->  00:04:26.402
Well, actually, I see that these are
90

90

00:04:26.402  -->  00:04:28.551
very low-quality pictures and that's
91

91

00:04:28.551  -->  00:04:30.780
not the one I want to use right now, so
92

92

00:04:30.780  -->  00:04:33.483
let's charge this here to large; I think
93

93

00:04:33.483  -->  00:04:35.933
I remember there was, like, a large version
94

94

00:04:35.933  -->  00:04:39.516
of these, let me check it, large and large.
95

95

00:04:43.026  -->  00:04:44.559
Yeah, that's much better.
96

96

00:04:44.559  -->  00:04:46.734
So these are the high-quality images that we want.
97

97

00:04:46.734  -->  00:04:48.125
And we're going to talk about responsive images
98

98

00:04:48.125  -->  00:04:50.376
a bit later, where we can then change this
99

99

00:04:50.376  -->  00:04:52.568
according to screen size and resolution
100

100

00:04:52.568  -->  00:04:54.933
but let's leave that for later.
101

101

00:04:54.933  -->  00:04:56.312
So anyway, what we want to do now is
102

102

00:04:56.312  -->  00:04:58.754
to actually style these photos, and so let's
103

103

00:04:58.754  -->  00:05:02.421
start with the width and set it to 55%.
104

104

00:05:04.291  -->  00:05:05.716
And then we want them to have
105

105

00:05:05.716  -->  00:05:09.968
box-shadow as well, zero next, and usually
106

106

00:05:09.968  -->  00:05:12.319
this is always zero, at least almost
107

107

00:05:12.319  -->  00:05:14.395
always, I would say.
108

108

00:05:14.395  -->  00:05:17.123
Then 15 pixels here and also some
109

109

00:05:17.123  -->  00:05:20.123
nice big blur of 40 pixels, so 4rem.
110

110

00:05:23.088  -->  00:05:27.255
And the color black with, let's say, 40% opacity.
111

111

00:05:33.609  -->  00:05:38.210
Okay, we want to give them a little border-radius as well.
112

112

00:05:38.210  -->  00:05:41.228
That will look nice and clean and modern.
113

113

00:05:41.228  -->  00:05:43.293
And, so, let's take a look at how
114

114

00:05:43.293  -->  00:05:45.335
they are looking right now.
115

115

00:05:45.335  -->  00:05:46.661
So, already looking close to what we
116

116

00:05:46.661  -->  00:05:49.442
have in our original, but we want
117

117

00:05:49.442  -->  00:05:51.967
them to be on top of one another.
118

118

00:05:51.967  -->  00:05:53.985
And so, how do we actually do that?
119

119

00:05:53.985  -->  00:05:55.752
Do you have an idea?
120

120

00:05:55.752  -->  00:05:57.714
I would say that the best way to do it
121

121

00:05:57.714  -->  00:05:59.615
is to use absolute positioning.
122

122

00:05:59.615  -->  00:06:00.448
Okay?
123

123

00:06:00.448  -->  00:06:02.489
So, let's do that.
124

124

00:06:02.489  -->  00:06:06.156
So, position: absolute, and remember when we
125

125

00:06:08.192  -->  00:06:11.124
set the position to absolute on an element,
126

126

00:06:11.124  -->  00:06:13.430
these elements will be placed according
127

127

00:06:13.430  -->  00:06:15.231
to a reference and the reference is the
128

128

00:06:15.231  -->  00:06:18.133
first parent it encounters, which has its
129

129

00:06:18.133  -->  00:06:20.366
position set to something.
130

130

00:06:20.366  -->  00:06:21.950
Now, since we want this reference to be
131

131

00:06:21.950  -->  00:06:24.622
the composition, so we want it to be
132

132

00:06:24.622  -->  00:06:27.902
positioned according to the composition element, of course.
133

133

00:06:27.902  -->  00:06:31.069
We set this one to position; relative.
134

134

00:06:32.604  -->  00:06:35.187
Okay, and so now this says position; relative
135

135

00:06:35.187  -->  00:06:38.455
and so the reference 0,0 coordinate will be
136

136

00:06:38.455  -->  00:06:42.678
on the top left corner of the composition element, right?
137

137

00:06:42.678  -->  00:06:45.319
So, let's now place these images
138

138

00:06:45.319  -->  00:06:47.816
in different places, and the way we can do that
139

139

00:06:47.816  -->  00:06:49.743
is to select them one by one.
140

140

00:06:49.743  -->  00:06:52.605
And that's why we have these modifier classes, right?
141

141

00:06:52.605  -->  00:06:55.522
So, p1 and the same for the others.
142

142

00:06:59.161  -->  00:07:00.993
Well, let's copy it later, actually.
143

143

00:07:00.993  -->  00:07:04.519
So, we just have to define left and the top left now.
144

144

00:07:04.519  -->  00:07:08.423
So let's say left of zero and the top
145

145

00:07:08.423  -->  00:07:12.769
of, well, I could do zero, but let's actually
146

146

00:07:12.769  -->  00:07:16.352
<v ->2rem, and this will move it upwards, okay?</v>
147

147

00:07:17.700  -->  00:07:21.473
Let me just show you how it's going to look like.
148

148

00:07:21.473  -->  00:07:23.316
So this is the one, and I did it so that
149

149

00:07:23.316  -->  00:07:25.565
this image here is actually a bit on top
150

150

00:07:25.565  -->  00:07:27.698
of this text so it's not in the same line.
151

151

00:07:27.698  -->  00:07:29.774
This would maybe look a bit strange.
152

152

00:07:29.774  -->  00:07:33.097
So now it's a bit up higher than this line of text.
153

153

00:07:33.097  -->  00:07:35.860
So this one is at zero, minus two and the other
154

154

00:07:35.860  -->  00:07:39.038
ones are at 0,0, which remember is this top
155

155

00:07:39.038  -->  00:07:41.622
left corner of the composition element, which is
156

156

00:07:41.622  -->  00:07:44.248
this one here behind all of this.
157

157

00:07:44.248  -->  00:07:48.593
Okay, let's now take a look at how we have it here.
158

158

00:07:48.593  -->  00:07:52.176
So this one and this one and then this one.
159

159

00:07:53.696  -->  00:07:57.279
So, let me copy this, and you know why this
160

160

00:07:58.543  -->  00:08:00.343
actually works, right?
161

161

00:08:00.343  -->  00:08:04.093
Composition, then photo, then p1, p2, and p3.
162

162

00:08:08.092  -->  00:08:11.154
So this helps us basically compose these class
163

163

00:08:11.154  -->  00:08:13.622
names that we have here, like composition,
164

164

00:08:13.622  -->  00:08:15.122
photo, p1, p2, p3.
165

165

00:08:17.711  -->  00:08:21.515
So, let's put this one here to the right side
166

166

00:08:21.515  -->  00:08:25.365
zero and what this will do is it will start
167

167

00:08:25.365  -->  00:08:28.282
at the right side, so moving zero pixels from the
168

168

00:08:28.282  -->  00:08:31.823
right side of the container, and then top,
169

169

00:08:31.823  -->  00:08:34.624
let's put it 20 pixels from the top.
170

170

00:08:34.624  -->  00:08:37.134
Okay, let's check it out again.
171

171

00:08:37.134  -->  00:08:40.705
And alright, so that the second one, so let's now
172

172

00:08:40.705  -->  00:08:43.532
change to the third one as well.
173

173

00:08:43.532  -->  00:08:46.585
And I will put it even further down, so
174

174

00:08:46.585  -->  00:08:49.154
10rem, and then from the left, let's put it
175

175

00:08:49.154  -->  00:08:52.564
actually in a percentage value here, so why not
176

176

00:08:52.564  -->  00:08:54.814
twenty% from the left.
177

177

00:08:57.932  -->  00:08:59.312
And so here we are.
178

178

00:08:59.312  -->  00:09:01.895
This is how it looks like.
179

179

00:09:01.895  -->  00:09:03.027
Of course, once again, I encourage you
180

180

00:09:03.027  -->  00:09:05.640
to play around with these numbers.
181

181

00:09:05.640  -->  00:09:06.989
I already knew the way that I wanted
182

182

00:09:06.989  -->  00:09:09.558
to place this, and so I knew how I wanted
183

183

00:09:09.558  -->  00:09:11.909
the numbers to look like.
184

184

00:09:11.909  -->  00:09:13.561
But you, of course, can experiment
185

185

00:09:13.561  -->  00:09:15.624
with them and change them, right?
186

186

00:09:15.624  -->  00:09:17.772
And now we're ready to implement
187

187

00:09:17.772  -->  00:09:21.369
the hover effect that we saw here on the page.
188

188

00:09:21.369  -->  00:09:23.432
So, again, it creates this green border
189

189

00:09:23.432  -->  00:09:26.564
and it zooms in on this image and zooms
190

190

00:09:26.564  -->  00:09:29.063
out on the remaining images as soon
191

191

00:09:29.063  -->  00:09:32.255
as we hover over one of them, okay?
192

192

00:09:32.255  -->  00:09:34.621
So let's now implement that.
193

193

00:09:34.621  -->  00:09:37.102
Now, just one word about why we use all
194

194

00:09:37.102  -->  00:09:38.989
these percentages here, okay?
195

195

00:09:38.989  -->  00:09:40.150
It's because of something I talked
196

196

00:09:40.150  -->  00:09:41.848
about a couple of lectures ago,
197

197

00:09:41.848  -->  00:09:43.764
which are one of these ingredients
198

198

00:09:43.764  -->  00:09:45.665
of responsive web design.
199

199

00:09:45.665  -->  00:09:47.668
One of them is flexible images.
200

200

00:09:47.668  -->  00:09:49.438
You always have to define the width
201

201

00:09:49.438  -->  00:09:52.584
of images in percentages if possible.
202

202

00:09:52.584  -->  00:09:55.635
This way, it will nicely scale with the view port.
203

203

00:09:55.635  -->  00:09:58.407
The same thing applies with the left distance
204

204

00:09:58.407  -->  00:10:00.778
that I wanted here in percentages.
205

205

00:10:00.778  -->  00:10:03.095
Very quickly show it to you.
206

206

00:10:03.095  -->  00:10:05.056
Without any media queries here already,
207

207

00:10:05.056  -->  00:10:08.639
we see that this adapts nicely to the page.
208

208

00:10:10.381  -->  00:10:12.805
Well, actually, this is not..
209

209

00:10:12.805  -->  00:10:16.447
Sorry, this is the original version, of course.
210

210

00:10:16.447  -->  00:10:19.114
So, please see that it decreases
211

211

00:10:21.328  -->  00:10:22.808
and is not overlapping the text.
212

212

00:10:22.808  -->  00:10:24.099
Of course, it's missing the media queries
213

213

00:10:24.099  -->  00:10:26.813
to make it better on other screen sizes,
214

214

00:10:26.813  -->  00:10:29.646
but it's more than enough for now.
215

215

00:10:31.173  -->  00:10:32.546
What matters is that we already defined
216

216

00:10:32.546  -->  00:10:35.056
it in percentages to start with.
217

217

00:10:35.056  -->  00:10:39.221
Okay, but let's now implement the hover effect.
218

218

00:10:39.221  -->  00:10:42.221
So, hover and what we want to happen
219

219

00:10:45.288  -->  00:10:47.508
is, of course, the zooming.
220

220

00:10:47.508  -->  00:10:50.841
So transform, scale, and double scale it
221

221

00:10:51.876  -->  00:10:55.011
to 1.05, so not a big difference,
222

222

00:10:55.011  -->  00:10:59.191
just like a subtle difference, but still clearly visible.
223

223

00:10:59.191  -->  00:11:01.426
Then the box-shadow is also going to change.
224

224

00:11:01.426  -->  00:11:03.748
Because if it's now bigger, it will give
225

225

00:11:03.748  -->  00:11:05.218
the impression that it's closer up to the
226

226

00:11:05.218  -->  00:11:08.388
user, so it should cast a bigger shadow.
227

227

00:11:08.388  -->  00:11:10.888
So let's increase that shadow.
228

228

00:11:12.661  -->  00:11:15.375
So bigger shadow, and also a bit darker.
229

229

00:11:15.375  -->  00:11:18.205
And now the third thing was that it
230

230

00:11:18.205  -->  00:11:20.251
overlaps all the other images.
231

231

00:11:20.251  -->  00:11:21.746
So how do we do that?
232

232

00:11:21.746  -->  00:11:23.229
How do we say that, if we have three
233

233

00:11:23.229  -->  00:11:27.189
images, we want one of them on top of all the others?
234

234

00:11:27.189  -->  00:11:29.993
Well, we use the z-index, right?
235

235

00:11:29.993  -->  00:11:34.739
So let's set a z-index on all of the regular images.
236

236

00:11:34.739  -->  00:11:38.309
Let's simply put something like 10,
237

237

00:11:38.309  -->  00:11:39.556
it's not really important.
238

238

00:11:39.556  -->  00:11:41.980
Then here, we set one that is higher.
239

239

00:11:41.980  -->  00:11:44.313
So, z-index 20, for example.
240

240

00:11:45.901  -->  00:11:47.395
So now, this one will always have a
241

241

00:11:47.395  -->  00:11:49.109
higher z-index, and therefore, it should
242

242

00:11:49.109  -->  00:11:50.776
be displayed on top.
243

243

00:11:52.577  -->  00:11:56.957
Now, for the animation effect, a transition
244

244

00:11:56.957  -->  00:11:59.957
of all the properties in .2 seconds.
245

245

00:12:02.039  -->  00:12:05.122
Alright, let's take a look and, yeah.
246

246

00:12:06.582  -->  00:12:10.486
What we just implemented actually works just fine.
247

247

00:12:10.486  -->  00:12:13.328
Now let's take care of that green border stuff.
248

248

00:12:13.328  -->  00:12:16.275
Now, you see that there's a space between
249

249

00:12:16.275  -->  00:12:18.888
the border and the images.
250

250

00:12:18.888  -->  00:12:21.164
It's not just a border, and that's
251

251

00:12:21.164  -->  00:12:22.890
actually not so easy to implement.
252

252

00:12:22.890  -->  00:12:24.656
At least, not with the CSS properties
253

253

00:12:24.656  -->  00:12:26.679
that everyone knows.
254

254

00:12:26.679  -->  00:12:28.900
That's what I'm going to show you:
255

255

00:12:28.900  -->  00:12:29.931
some lesser known CSS properties.
256

256

00:12:29.931  -->  00:12:32.784
So first up, we set the outline
257

257

00:12:32.784  -->  00:12:35.534
property here in the hover state.
258

258

00:12:36.433  -->  00:12:37.944
So outline, and let's say
259

259

00:12:37.944  -->  00:12:41.556
that we want 15 pixels, so 1.5rem,
260

260

00:12:41.556  -->  00:12:44.639
then we say solid and then the color.
261

261

00:12:46.506  -->  00:12:48.119
So our green color.
262

262

00:12:48.119  -->  00:12:51.215
And this is similar to setting it to a border.
263

263

00:12:51.215  -->  00:12:54.096
So, if we had border, then it would look,
264

264

00:12:54.096  -->  00:12:56.443
for now, it would look the same.
265

265

00:12:56.443  -->  00:12:59.660
So, this is it, it would look like this.
266

266

00:12:59.660  -->  00:13:01.607
But with the outline, we can do something
267

267

00:13:01.607  -->  00:13:03.584
that we cannot with the border.
268

268

00:13:03.584  -->  00:13:06.251
And that is, the outline offset.
269

269

00:13:07.086  -->  00:13:08.669
So, outline offset.
270

270

00:13:09.606  -->  00:13:12.806
We can say that we want 20 pixels here,
271

271

00:13:12.806  -->  00:13:14.979
so 2rem and then it will give us
272

272

00:13:14.979  -->  00:13:17.983
the space between the border or,
273

273

00:13:17.983  -->  00:13:19.990
we should actually call it the outline.
274

274

00:13:19.990  -->  00:13:23.550
And the element on which the outline is applied.
275

275

00:13:23.550  -->  00:13:25.226
And then this is it.
276

276

00:13:25.226  -->  00:13:29.143
It actually also zooms in a bit like the image.
277

277

00:13:30.299  -->  00:13:32.228
So this is the effect that we have.
278

278

00:13:32.228  -->  00:13:33.438
Well, not exactly.
279

279

00:13:33.438  -->  00:13:35.309
Because what is missing here now is
280

280

00:13:35.309  -->  00:13:38.190
that the outer images decrease in size.
281

281

00:13:38.190  -->  00:13:41.226
So let's do that final thing as well.
282

282

00:13:41.226  -->  00:13:42.780
Do you have any idea how we could
283

283

00:13:42.780  -->  00:13:44.648
actually pull this off?
284

284

00:13:44.648  -->  00:13:46.927
How we could implement this thing?
285

285

00:13:46.927  -->  00:13:48.628
It's not really easy, but it's actually
286

286

00:13:48.628  -->  00:13:51.259
just a one-line selector.
287

287

00:13:51.259  -->  00:13:53.025 line:15% 
So what should the selector look like?
288

288

00:13:53.025  -->  00:13:54.828 line:15% 
Maybe take a second and try to think about
289

289

00:13:54.828  -->  00:13:56.978 line:15% 
what happens and how we could write down
290

290

00:13:56.978  -->  00:13:58.817 line:15% 
the selector for this, okay?
291

291

00:13:58.817  -->  00:14:01.340 line:15% 
So, I want you to pause the video and think about it.
292

292

00:14:01.340  -->  00:14:02.849 line:15% 
And if you don't come up with a good solution,
293

293

00:14:02.849  -->  00:14:03.891 line:15% 
it's no problem at all.
294

294

00:14:03.891  -->  00:14:05.868 line:15% 
But what I want you to do here is to think.
295

295

00:14:05.868  -->  00:14:07.762 line:15% 
Thinking is really important,
296

296

00:14:07.762  -->  00:14:12.228 line:15% 
because CSS is not just some stupid or dull language.
297

297

00:14:12.228  -->  00:14:14.550 line:15% 
You also have to think and come up with solutions
298

298

00:14:14.550  -->  00:14:17.450 line:15% 
for these different stuff that you want to do.
299

299

00:14:17.450  -->  00:14:18.950 line:15% 
So let's try that.
300

300

00:14:20.772  -->  00:14:22.595
Alright, did you manage to do it?
301

301

00:14:22.595  -->  00:14:25.949
Again, if not, no worries, it's absolutely no problem.
302

302

00:14:25.949  -->  00:14:27.896
It's not really expected at this point,
303

303

00:14:27.896  -->  00:14:30.658
because again, this is rather complex.
304

304

00:14:30.658  -->  00:14:32.825
Now, this is how we do it.
305

305

00:14:33.767  -->  00:14:36.934
So, hover on the composition actually.
306

306

00:14:39.366  -->  00:14:42.121
We start with the hover state on the entire
307

307

00:14:42.121  -->  00:14:45.268
composition, so as soon as we hover the composition
308

308

00:14:45.268  -->  00:14:49.435
element, then select a photo that is nested inside
309

309

00:14:51.592  -->  00:14:55.675
of this, and then select one that is not hovered.
310

310

00:14:56.576  -->  00:14:58.909
And it is as simple as that.
311

311

00:15:01.662  -->  00:15:03.141
Does that make sense?
312

312

00:15:03.141  -->  00:15:05.260
Let me actually write this out for you
313

313

00:15:05.260  -->  00:15:07.427
here outside as a comment.
314

314

00:15:08.516  -->  00:15:11.489
Just to make it a bit more visible.
315

315

00:15:11.489  -->  00:15:12.822
So, composition.
316

316

00:15:16.878  -->  00:15:19.471
So, this is what this looks like.
317

317

00:15:19.471  -->  00:15:21.899
When we hover the composition, we then
318

318

00:15:21.899  -->  00:15:26.718
select the composition photo which is not hovered.
319

319

00:15:26.718  -->  00:15:29.661
This may look a bit crazy, but it works.
320

320

00:15:29.661  -->  00:15:31.956
And let me show it and prove it to you.
321

321

00:15:31.956  -->  00:15:36.123
Transform, scale, and then scale it down a little bit.
322

322

00:15:37.857  -->  00:15:40.857
Or maybe .9 so we can see it better.
323

323

00:15:43.107  -->  00:15:44.857
And yep, so it works.
324

324

00:15:45.750  -->  00:15:46.583
Notice that it happens
325

325

00:15:46.583  -->  00:15:50.520
as soon as we enter any of these elements.
326

326

00:15:50.520  -->  00:15:52.480
So the other ones are not hovered,
327

327

00:15:52.480  -->  00:15:56.424
and so they shrink exactly like we determined.
328

328

00:15:56.424  -->  00:15:58.699
And nine is actually a bit too much,
329

329

00:15:58.699  -->  00:16:01.807
so let's set it to 95 again.
330

330

00:16:01.807  -->  00:16:03.982
Reload, and that's the effect we were
331

331

00:16:03.982  -->  00:16:05.627
looking for, right?
332

332

00:16:05.627  -->  00:16:07.241
Let's compare it.
333

333

00:16:07.241  -->  00:16:11.453
Yep, actually, this one is a bit more complete.
334

334

00:16:11.453  -->  00:16:12.580
And that's because we just left
335

335

00:16:12.580  -->  00:16:15.175
off one simple small thing.
336

336

00:16:15.175  -->  00:16:17.052
Because in here, we don't only scale it,
337

337

00:16:17.052  -->  00:16:20.897
but we can also translate it a bit in the y direction.
338

338

00:16:20.897  -->  00:16:23.480
We can move it up a little bit.
339

339

00:16:24.890  -->  00:16:27.202
So just move it up by about five pixels
340

340

00:16:27.202  -->  00:16:28.530
and it will make the animation look
341

341

00:16:28.530  -->  00:16:30.530
even a bit cooler, okay?
342

342

00:16:33.511  -->  00:16:35.137
You see how it gets bigger and it
343

343

00:16:35.137  -->  00:16:36.804
also comes up a bit?
344

344

00:16:38.069  -->  00:16:39.940
That's it, alright.
345

345

00:16:39.940  -->  00:16:41.133
Really cool.
346

346

00:16:41.133  -->  00:16:43.440
And again, you could do all kinds of crazy stuff here.
347

347

00:16:43.440  -->  00:16:44.412
You could rotate the elements
348

348

00:16:44.412  -->  00:16:46.253
and do whatever you want, of course.
349

349

00:16:46.253  -->  00:16:48.215
Transform all of the stuff, but that's
350

350

00:16:48.215  -->  00:16:49.846
not what we're looking for here.
351

351

00:16:49.846  -->  00:16:52.696
What we wanted to do is to section and
352

352

00:16:52.696  -->  00:16:53.941
it's now done, it looks like the one
353

353

00:16:53.941  -->  00:16:56.698
in our original version, a slightly different
354

354

00:16:56.698  -->  00:16:59.520
text, but that's not a problem.
355

355

00:16:59.520  -->  00:17:03.270
We hit our goal for these couple of lectures.
356

356

00:17:04.153  -->  00:17:05.618
So I hope that you're enjoying the course.
357

357

00:17:05.618  -->  00:17:07.890
If you are, I would appreciate some feedback,
358

358

00:17:07.890  -->  00:17:11.353
of course, that's always 100% welcomed.
359

359

00:17:11.353  -->  00:17:13.795
No matter if it's good feedback or not so good
360

360

00:17:13.795  -->  00:17:15.790
maybe, maybe you have something to improve
361

361

00:17:15.790  -->  00:17:16.847
in the course.
362

362

00:17:16.847  -->  00:17:17.680
Just let me know.
363

363

00:17:17.680  -->  00:17:19.488
Write me a message, an email, anything.
364

364

00:17:19.488  -->  00:17:22.235
Just let me know what you think of the course.
365

365

00:17:22.235  -->  00:17:25.652
Anyway, see you soon in the next lecture.
