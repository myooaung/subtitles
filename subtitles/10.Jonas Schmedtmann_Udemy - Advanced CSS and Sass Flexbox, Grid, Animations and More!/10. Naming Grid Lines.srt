00:00:01,271  -->  00:00:03,879
<v Jonas>Let's now learn how we can position grid items</v>
2

2

00:00:03,879  -->  00:00:07,180
on the grid by naming our grid lines.
3

3

00:00:07,180  -->  00:00:09,543
So what I showed you in the last lecture
4

4

00:00:09,543  -->  00:00:12,039
and the ones before that is how to position
5

5

00:00:12,039  -->  00:00:14,748
grid items on the grid by using
6

6

00:00:14,748  -->  00:00:18,235
the automatically generated grid line numbers, right?
7

7

00:00:18,235  -->  00:00:20,474
But we can actually make our lives a bit easier
8

8

00:00:20,474  -->  00:00:22,606
by naming these grid lines,
9

9

00:00:22,606  -->  00:00:24,738
so let me show you how to do that.
10

10

00:00:24,738  -->  00:00:28,655
But first, let's add a couple of comments here.
11

11

00:00:31,086  -->  00:00:33,503
So, "METHOD 1: LINE NUMBERS."
12

12

00:00:36,667  -->  00:00:39,360
And now I'm gonna actually comment out
13

13

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:43,527
all of this code here, and then start from scratch.
14

14

00:00:44,663  -->  00:00:46,852
Well actually, not really from scratch,
15

15

00:00:46,852  -->  00:00:49,924
because I'm gonna copy all of this,
16

16

00:00:49,924  -->  00:00:52,758
but I want to keep the code that we had before,
17

17

00:00:52,758  -->  00:00:56,925
so that you can then keep this code for yourself, okay?
18

18

00:00:58,606  -->  00:01:01,939
So this is "METHOD 2" with "LINE NAMES."
19

19

00:01:03,820  -->  00:01:07,616
So how do we actually name our grid lines?
20

20

00:01:07,616  -->  00:01:09,356
And actually, it's really simple.
21

21

00:01:09,356  -->  00:01:13,367
All we have to do is to use the squared brackets like this,
22

22

00:01:13,367  -->  00:01:16,385
and then in here, put the name of the line.
23

23

00:01:16,385  -->  00:01:21,104
So what we want to do here is to write header-start.
24

24

00:01:21,104  -->  00:01:23,805
and the best practice is to basically describe
25

25

00:01:23,805  -->  00:01:26,598
the content that will be in the track,
26

26

00:01:26,598  -->  00:01:29,168
so in this case between lines number 1 and 2,
27

27

00:01:29,168  -->  00:01:32,590
and then say whether it's the start or the end.
28

28

00:01:32,590  -->  00:01:36,274
Okay, so we have header-start, and then in here,
29

29

00:01:36,274  -->  00:01:40,441
we will have header-end, okay, and that's actually it.
30

30

00:01:41,654  -->  00:01:43,974
And so now, this line number 1
31

31

00:01:43,974  -->  00:01:45,813
is no longer just called line 1,
32

32

00:01:45,813  -->  00:01:47,818
but it's also called header-start,
33

33

00:01:47,818  -->  00:01:50,149
and this one here is called header-end.
34

34

00:01:50,149  -->  00:01:53,199
But what about these boxes here now?
35

35

00:01:53,199  -->  00:01:55,712
It doesn't make much sense that this line here
36

36

00:01:55,712  -->  00:01:57,956
is called header-end, because it's not just
37

37

00:01:57,956  -->  00:01:59,583
the end of the header, but also
38

38

00:01:59,583  -->  00:02:01,763
the start of these boxes here, right?
39

39

00:02:01,763  -->  00:02:04,298
And so for that reason, we can actually give
40

40

00:02:04,298  -->  00:02:06,419
a line more than one name.
41

41

00:02:06,419  -->  00:02:09,828
So let's call this one here also, let's say,
42

42

00:02:09,828  -->  00:02:13,995
boxes-start, well, let's call call it just box-start,
43

43

00:02:16,055  -->  00:02:19,222
and then the next one we call box-end.
44

44

00:02:21,461  -->  00:02:24,995
Okay, so these are arbitrary names that we come up with,
45

45

00:02:24,995  -->  00:02:28,864
at least the first part here, so in this case here, box,
46

46

00:02:28,864  -->  00:02:30,196
and then we just call the one
47

47

00:02:30,196  -->  00:02:32,520
before the boxes here the start,
48

48

00:02:32,520  -->  00:02:34,854
and the one after, the end, right?
49

49

00:02:34,854  -->  00:02:38,720
So this row line here is now called header-end,
50

50

00:02:38,720  -->  00:02:41,118
and also, at the same time, box-start,
51

51

00:02:41,118  -->  00:02:44,550
while this one here is called box-end.
52

52

00:02:44,550  -->  00:02:46,848
Okay, and so now you can probably guess
53

53

00:02:46,848  -->  00:02:51,205
that we're also gonna call this one here main-start,
54

54

00:02:51,205  -->  00:02:55,038
and then the next one, let's call it main-end,
55

55

00:02:58,924  -->  00:03:01,860
and then after that comes the footer.
56

56

00:03:01,860  -->  00:03:04,360
So let's call it footer-start,
57

57

00:03:05,922  -->  00:03:10,089
and then the last line is the footer-end, and that's it.
58

58

00:03:12,024  -->  00:03:15,481
Let's give it some more space here, actually.
59

59

00:03:15,481  -->  00:03:16,898
No, doesn't work.
60

60

00:03:17,785  -->  00:03:19,618
Okay, it's no problem.
61

61

00:03:21,799  -->  00:03:25,700
So we now have all our row lines here named,
62

62

00:03:25,700  -->  00:03:30,097
and actually, it's a good practice doing so, okay?
63

63

00:03:30,097  -->  00:03:31,800
So in a professional layout, usually,
64

64

00:03:31,800  -->  00:03:34,335
we always name our grid lines like this,
65

65

00:03:34,335  -->  00:03:38,558
and then use these names to position the items in it.
66

66

00:03:38,558  -->  00:03:40,700
Okay, and we're gonna do the same thing
67

67

00:03:40,700  -->  00:03:41,890
for the column tracks in a second,
68

68

00:03:41,890  -->  00:03:43,834
but first, let me show you how
69

69

00:03:43,834  -->  00:03:45,698
we can actually use these names.
70

70

00:03:45,698  -->  00:03:50,359
And, in fact, it's just the same as using the rows, okay?
71

71

00:03:50,359  -->  00:03:54,579
But instead of using the number here, we just use the names.
72

72

00:03:54,579  -->  00:03:57,215
And so remember that this one here starts
73

73

00:03:57,215  -->  00:04:00,394
at this row, which is called boxes-start,
74

74

00:04:00,394  -->  00:04:04,311
or box-start, actually, and it goes all the way
75

75

00:04:06,857  -->  00:04:10,357
until content, or main, I think, main-end.
76

76

00:04:11,379  -->  00:04:15,546
So let's take a look, so yeah, this one is called main-end.
77

77

00:04:17,913  -->  00:04:20,589
Of course, we could still write span 2,
78

78

00:04:20,589  -->  00:04:23,689
but just for the fun of it, let's now make it like this.
79

79

00:04:23,689  -->  00:04:27,856
So main-end, and let's see what happens, and yeah.
80

80

00:04:28,989  -->  00:04:31,728
So it's working, right?
81

81

00:04:31,728  -->  00:04:34,910
So it starts here, from this grid line,
82

82

00:04:34,910  -->  00:04:37,309
which is called box-start, and goes all the way,
83

83

00:04:37,309  -->  00:04:40,070
just as it did before, until the main-end,
84

84

00:04:40,070  -->  00:04:42,831
so this row line, right?
85

85

00:04:42,831  -->  00:04:45,549
And the other ones actually don't really need
86

86

00:04:45,549  -->  00:04:48,312
the grid-row declaration, so in fact
87

87

00:04:48,312  -->  00:04:51,773
we wouldn't maybe really have needed all of these names,
88

88

00:04:51,773  -->  00:04:55,812
okay, but I still wanted to show you how we do it, okay?
89

89

00:04:55,812  -->  00:04:58,193
Because again, in the future,
90

90

00:04:58,193  -->  00:05:00,312
and when we start building our real project,
91

91

00:05:00,312  -->  00:05:02,104
we're gonna do it the same way,
92

92

00:05:02,104  -->  00:05:03,468
and then you will see that it becomes
93

93

00:05:03,468  -->  00:05:05,645
really handy doing it like this.
94

94

00:05:05,645  -->  00:05:08,385
We did it for the row tracks; let's now also
95

95

00:05:08,385  -->  00:05:10,649
do it for the column tracks.
96

96

00:05:10,649  -->  00:05:13,405
But in here, we have kind of a different situation, right?
97

97

00:05:13,405  -->  00:05:15,802
Because we have this repeat function here,
98

98

00:05:15,802  -->  00:05:18,044
which is gonna create three column tracks here
99

99

00:05:18,044  -->  00:05:20,923
with this definition here alone, right?
100

100

00:05:20,923  -->  00:05:23,065
So it wouldn't make much sense
101

101

00:05:23,065  -->  00:05:25,684
to put the line name here before this one
102

102

00:05:25,684  -->  00:05:28,447
and then after it, because then only the line
103

103

00:05:28,447  -->  00:05:32,644
before the 3 and after the 3 would get a name,
104

104

00:05:32,644  -->  00:05:35,564
but we want all of them to have a name, so what can we do?
105

105

00:05:35,564  -->  00:05:39,379
Well, we simply put it here, right into the repeat,
106

106

00:05:39,379  -->  00:05:41,624
and so we do it like this.
107

107

00:05:41,624  -->  00:05:45,324
And in this case, I'm simply gonna call them col,
108

108

00:05:45,324  -->  00:05:49,491
which stands for column, and then start, and then col-end.
109

109

00:05:53,989  -->  00:05:56,729
Okay, and what this will do is that
110

110

00:05:56,729  -->  00:05:59,904
it will create a so-called named set of grid lines.
111

111

00:05:59,904  -->  00:06:02,087
So with this, we create three columns,
112

112

00:06:02,087  -->  00:06:05,943
and each of them starts with a line called col-start
113

113

00:06:05,943  -->  00:06:08,466
and one with col-end, and that would mean
114

114

00:06:08,466  -->  00:06:12,065
that we would have conflicting line names, right?
115

115

00:06:12,065  -->  00:06:14,360
And so what happens is that for the first column,
116

116

00:06:14,360  -->  00:06:18,747
it's gonna be called col-start 1 and col-end 1,
117

117

00:06:18,747  -->  00:06:20,448
then for the second column track,
118

118

00:06:20,448  -->  00:06:24,403
it's gonna be called col-start 2 and col-end 2,
119

119

00:06:24,403  -->  00:06:26,624
and then, of course, for the third track,
120

120

00:06:26,624  -->  00:06:30,799
it's gonna be called col-start 3 and col-end 3, all right?
121

121

00:06:30,799  -->  00:06:33,526
And I'm gonna show that to you in a second.
122

122

00:06:33,526  -->  00:06:36,859
For now, let's just finish this one here
123

123

00:06:38,704  -->  00:06:40,585
and call it grid-end.
124

124

00:06:40,585  -->  00:06:42,408
Okay, and that's actually it.
125

125

00:06:42,408  -->  00:06:44,248
So again, remember that this is
126

126

00:06:44,248  -->  00:06:46,646
a named set of grid lines here, okay?
127

127

00:06:46,646  -->  00:06:49,982
So when we have these names here, these lines names
128

128

00:06:49,982  -->  00:06:52,166
in the repeat, then it's gonna create
129

129

00:06:52,166  -->  00:06:53,867
a named set of grid lines.
130

130

00:06:53,867  -->  00:06:56,445
And to show you how to use this in practice,
131

131

00:06:56,445  -->  00:06:58,244
let me show it to you.
132

132

00:06:58,244  -->  00:07:01,661
And so here is the header, and so it goes
133

133

00:07:03,225  -->  00:07:05,227
all the way from the beginning to the end.
134

134

00:07:05,227  -->  00:07:09,407
So what's the first column grid line gonna be called?
135

135

00:07:09,407  -->  00:07:12,786
It's col-start, and then remember that
136

136

00:07:12,786  -->  00:07:15,286
the first one has the 1, okay?
137

137

00:07:17,083  -->  00:07:18,846
Remember that I just explained that?
138

138

00:07:18,846  -->  00:07:21,748
So this line here is called col-start 1,
139

139

00:07:21,748  -->  00:07:25,766
then this one here is called col-end 1, right,
140

140

00:07:25,766  -->  00:07:28,920
and at the same time it's also called col-start 2,
141

141

00:07:28,920  -->  00:07:32,528
and this one here, col-end 2, and so on and so forth,
142

142

00:07:32,528  -->  00:07:34,643
all the way here until the end, okay?
143

143

00:07:34,643  -->  00:07:37,706
So this one is col-start 1, here at the beginning,
144

144

00:07:37,706  -->  00:07:40,324
then we want all the way until the one
145

145

00:07:40,324  -->  00:07:42,919
which is called grid-end, I think.
146

146

00:07:42,919  -->  00:07:44,419
Yeah, so grid-end.
147

147

00:07:47,528  -->  00:07:49,211
And let's see if that works.
148

148

00:07:49,211  -->  00:07:53,490
And yeah, here we go, so it works just as before.
149

149

00:07:53,490  -->  00:07:56,270
Now we could still use the -1 trick here
150

150

00:07:56,270  -->  00:07:58,610
like we had before, but of course,
151

151

00:07:58,610  -->  00:08:00,729
I wanted to show you how to use
152

152

00:08:00,729  -->  00:08:03,347
these column line names, right?
153

153

00:08:03,347  -->  00:08:07,983
Then here, with the sidebar, let's do the same.
154

154

00:08:07,983  -->  00:08:11,344
So remember the named set of grid lines works like this.
155

155

00:08:11,344  -->  00:08:14,594
So this is the col-end number 3, right,
156

156

00:08:16,265  -->  00:08:18,265
so this line here, okay?
157

157

00:08:19,865  -->  00:08:24,032
So col-end 3, and then once more, it goes to grid-end.
158

158

00:08:26,337  -->  00:08:29,817
And that's it, and now the main content.
159

159

00:08:29,817  -->  00:08:32,038
So this one here, and this one
160

160

00:08:32,038  -->  00:08:35,067
shouldn't be all too hard as well,
161

161

00:08:35,067  -->  00:08:37,484
so col-start 1, to col-end 3.
162

162

00:08:45,102  -->  00:08:47,103
And let's check that one out,
163

163

00:08:47,103  -->  00:08:50,059
and here you see that it still works the same,
164

164

00:08:50,059  -->  00:08:52,167
so everything is correct.
165

165

00:08:52,167  -->  00:08:56,334
And here, again, we wanna go from col-start 1 to end,
166

166

00:08:58,924  -->  00:09:01,257
or actually, grid-end, okay,
167

167

00:09:04,404  -->  00:09:07,365
and yeah, so that works as well.
168

168

00:09:07,365  -->  00:09:09,826
All right, and that's actually it.
169

169

00:09:09,826  -->  00:09:12,984
So this is how naming the grid lines works.
170

170

00:09:12,984  -->  00:09:15,080
And again, in more professional layouts,
171

171

00:09:15,080  -->  00:09:17,584
you will usually see it working like this.
172

172

00:09:17,584  -->  00:09:19,784
So we just name all our tracks,
173

173

00:09:19,784  -->  00:09:22,063
both the row tracks and the column tracks,
174

174

00:09:22,063  -->  00:09:24,425
and then use these names to position
175

175

00:09:24,425  -->  00:09:27,647
our grid items to build our designs, our layouts.
176

176

00:09:27,647  -->  00:09:30,565
All right, so I hope this made a lot of sense to you,
177

177

00:09:30,565  -->  00:09:33,842
and in the next video, we're going to see the third method
178

178

00:09:33,842  -->  00:09:36,842
of how to position these grid items.
