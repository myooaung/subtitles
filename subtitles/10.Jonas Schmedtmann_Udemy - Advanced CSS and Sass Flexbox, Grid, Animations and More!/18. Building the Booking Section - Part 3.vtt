00:00:01.684  -->  00:00:04.154
<v Instructor>In the third part of the booking section,</v>
2

2

00:00:04.154  -->  00:00:08.840
let's now finally build our custom radio buttons.
3

3

00:00:08.840  -->  00:00:10.786
But before we do that, let's just add
4

4

00:00:10.786  -->  00:00:12.451
something that we were missing here,
5

5

00:00:12.451  -->  00:00:15.001
which is the animation as soon as we click here
6

6

00:00:15.001  -->  00:00:17.000
or as the color changes, okay?
7

7

00:00:17.000  -->  00:00:20.516
So this bar here, this underlying color.
8

8

00:00:20.516  -->  00:00:21.986
So this has no animation right now.
9

9

00:00:21.986  -->  00:00:24.914
So we should very quickly just add that,
10

10

00:00:24.914  -->  00:00:27.081
so the transition property
11

11

00:00:28.246  -->  00:00:30.829
and all, let's say 0.3 seconds.
12

12

00:00:32.205  -->  00:00:35.204
And so that should be different now.
13

13

00:00:35.204  -->  00:00:37.397
And yeah, you saw that.
14

14

00:00:37.397  -->  00:00:39.314
So it's much nicer now.
15

15

00:00:40.737  -->  00:00:43.492
Okay, so what do we have here
16

16

00:00:43.492  -->  00:00:45.548
on these radio buttons?
17

17

00:00:45.548  -->  00:00:48.039
Well, you see that we have two elements here.
18

18

00:00:48.039  -->  00:00:50.239
So basically this one here and this one,
19

19

00:00:50.239  -->  00:00:52.620
and then when you click,
20

20

00:00:52.620  -->  00:00:55.392
of course, the button becomes active
21

21

00:00:55.392  -->  00:00:59.579
and we choose the option that we click on.
22

22

00:00:59.579  -->  00:01:02.958
So let's start with the HTML here.
23

23

00:01:02.958  -->  00:01:06.375
And so once again, let's do a form group.
24

24

00:01:10.374  -->  00:01:12.707
And I forgot to put the dot.
25

25

00:01:13.682  -->  00:01:17.265
Now, for each of them, we actually want a container here.
26

26

00:01:17.265  -->  00:01:18.265
So let's say
27

27

00:01:20.374  -->  00:01:21.791
form_radio-group.
28

28

00:01:25.773  -->  00:01:27.510
Okay, and then in here,
29

29

00:01:27.510  -->  00:01:31.648
so just before, we will have an input and a label.
30

30

00:01:31.648  -->  00:01:34.398
So input, I'm gonna call this one
31

31

00:01:35.624  -->  00:01:38.494
form_radio-input this time, okay?
32

32

00:01:38.494  -->  00:01:40.535
So before it was called form_input.
33

33

00:01:40.535  -->  00:01:42.237
Now it's form_radio-input.
34

34

00:01:42.237  -->  00:01:44.375
And the type is a radio button.
35

35

00:01:44.375  -->  00:01:47.141
And then we need an ID to connect it to the label.
36

36

00:01:47.141  -->  00:01:48.538
We're gonna put there next,
37

37

00:01:48.538  -->  00:01:51.045
and so the first one is for small tours.
38

38

00:01:51.045  -->  00:01:54.538
So I'm gonna call it just small, okay?
39

39

00:01:54.538  -->  00:01:56.038
And now the label.
40

40

00:01:57.545  -->  00:02:01.410
And so following the same logic, form_radio-label,
41

41

00:02:01.410  -->  00:02:05.577
and then form is the ID of the input we specified,
42

42

00:02:06.642  -->  00:02:09.166
and so it's small, of course.
43

43

00:02:09.166  -->  00:02:10.166
And in here,
44

44

00:02:12.022  -->  00:02:13.439
small tour group.
45

45

00:02:14.834  -->  00:02:18.334
And let's just go ahead and copy this one.
46

46

00:02:22.073  -->  00:02:24.156
It's large now, and again
47

47

00:02:25.120  -->  00:02:28.203
down here and here, large tour group.
48

48

00:02:29.592  -->  00:02:32.761
And so we're good to go to check this out.
49

49

00:02:32.761  -->  00:02:33.967
And so here we go.
50

50

00:02:33.967  -->  00:02:35.192
So now if we click this text,
51

51

00:02:35.192  -->  00:02:37.909
then the radio button here gets selected.
52

52

00:02:37.909  -->  00:02:39.073
And if we click on this one,
53

53

00:02:39.073  -->  00:02:40.311
then this one gets selected.
54

54

00:02:40.311  -->  00:02:42.120
But the problem is that the other one
55

55

00:02:42.120  -->  00:02:45.146
still stays selected here, of course.
56

56

00:02:45.146  -->  00:02:46.914
And that's because we forgot one attribute
57

57

00:02:46.914  -->  00:02:48.467
in the HTML, okay?
58

58

00:02:48.467  -->  00:02:51.439
So in order for the HTML to consider them as a group,
59

59

00:02:51.439  -->  00:02:54.356
we need to give them the same name.
60

60

00:02:55.700  -->  00:02:57.118
So it doesn't really matter here,
61

61

00:02:57.118  -->  00:02:59.447
just call it size because if it's for
62

62

00:02:59.447  -->  00:03:01.355
our small or large tours,
63

63

00:03:01.355  -->  00:03:04.766
so it's basically for the size of the tour.
64

64

00:03:04.766  -->  00:03:08.598
Okay, and so they need to have the same name attribute here.
65

65

00:03:08.598  -->  00:03:11.335
Okay, and so now either one of them can be selected
66

66

00:03:11.335  -->  00:03:14.406
because all of the inputs with the same name,
67

67

00:03:14.406  -->  00:03:16.150
only one of them can be selected.
68

68

00:03:16.150  -->  00:03:18.428
And that's the logic behind that.
69

69

00:03:18.428  -->  00:03:19.846
And so now when you hit this one,
70

70

00:03:19.846  -->  00:03:21.976
this gets selected, and then this one.
71

71

00:03:21.976  -->  00:03:24.405
Of course you can click on the button, as well.
72

72

00:03:24.405  -->  00:03:26.655
And okay, so that's the functionality.
73

73

00:03:26.655  -->  00:03:30.740
Now, in CSS, we cannot style these buttons, okay?
74

74

00:03:30.740  -->  00:03:31.573
So these radio buttons, we have no way
75

75

00:03:31.573  -->  00:03:34.140
of styling them in CSS.
76

76

00:03:34.140  -->  00:03:36.510
And so what we have to do is to basically build
77

77

00:03:36.510  -->  00:03:37.956
our own buttons.
78

78

00:03:37.956  -->  00:03:39.663
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
79

79

00:03:39.663  -->  00:03:42.938
And we'll do that inside of these labels here, okay?
80

80

00:03:42.938  -->  00:03:44.355
So let's do that.
81

81

00:03:45.933  -->  00:03:48.688
So right here inside of the label,
82

82

00:03:48.688  -->  00:03:51.822
I will simply add a span element
83

83

00:03:51.822  -->  00:03:54.322
and call it form_radio-button.
84

84

00:03:57.103  -->  00:04:00.736
And I saw that I misspelled this here again.
85

85

00:04:00.736  -->  00:04:02.596
So form_radio-button now.
86

86

00:04:02.596  -->  00:04:04.198
And I'm gonna leave it empty, okay?
87

87

00:04:04.198  -->  00:04:05.172
So this is just for style.
88

88

00:04:05.172  -->  00:04:08.172
There's not really content in there.
89

89

00:04:11.933  -->  00:04:13.356
And, okay.
90

90

00:04:13.356  -->  00:04:15.905
So this is what the button will be, all right?
91

91

00:04:15.905  -->  00:04:19.077
And we'll then hide simply this input element here.
92

92

00:04:19.077  -->  00:04:22.574
So this new element here will become our button,
93

93

00:04:22.574  -->  00:04:24.733
and we will hide this input.
94

94

00:04:24.733  -->  00:04:26.300
And that is the trick.
95

95

00:04:26.300  -->  00:04:28.477
Now, since we connected the label with the input,
96

96

00:04:28.477  -->  00:04:30.194
then even if this is hidden,
97

97

00:04:30.194  -->  00:04:32.444
it will still become selected, okay?
98

98

00:04:32.444  -->  00:04:34.063
And that's the trick here.
99

99

00:04:34.063  -->  00:04:36.530
So when we click on this text here, on this label,
100

100

00:04:36.530  -->  00:04:38.827
what gets selected is the input.
101

101

00:04:38.827  -->  00:04:40.870
But with our HTML, we will make it look
102

102

00:04:40.870  -->  00:04:43.754
as if this button here will become selected,
103

103

00:04:43.754  -->  00:04:46.273
while the original button is hidden.
104

104

00:04:46.273  -->  00:04:48.174
And so that's the logic behind
105

105

00:04:48.174  -->  00:04:49.502
what we're gonna do here.
106

106

00:04:49.502  -->  00:04:51.308
And so let's implement that.
107

107

00:04:51.308  -->  00:04:54.746
So first of all, let's style these ones here,
108

108

00:04:54.746  -->  00:04:58.663
so the radio groups, to make them side by side.
109

109

00:04:59.836  -->  00:05:01.503
So form_radio-group,
110

110

00:05:06.482  -->  00:05:08.982
give them a width of 50%,
111

111

00:05:10.503  -->  00:05:11.847
and then put them side by side.
112

112

00:05:11.847  -->  00:05:13.872
We could use floats now, but what I'm gonna do here
113

113

00:05:13.872  -->  00:05:16.301
is to simply set their display property
114

114

00:05:16.301  -->  00:05:18.481
to inline blocks, and then therefore
115

115

00:05:18.481  -->  00:05:20.653
they will not create the line breaks
116

116

00:05:20.653  -->  00:05:23.713
and will be displayed side by side, hopefully.
117

117

00:05:23.713  -->  00:05:26.380
All right, now, about the label.
118

118

00:05:27.864  -->  00:05:29.114
So radio-label,
119

119

00:05:32.420  -->  00:05:35.598
let's give it a font size of 1.6.
120

120

00:05:35.598  -->  00:05:37.729
And that's actually our standard font size,
121

121

00:05:37.729  -->  00:05:38.654
if you remember.
122

122

00:05:38.654  -->  00:05:41.571
So just want here default font size
123

123

00:05:43.916  -->  00:05:45.916
and a cursor of pointer.
124

124

00:05:47.027  -->  00:05:48.192
So basically what this will do
125

125

00:05:48.192  -->  00:05:50.738
is to make it look like a link or something.
126

126

00:05:50.738  -->  00:05:52.238
So with this hand,
127

127

00:05:54.982  -->  00:05:56.821
so this is what I mean, okay?
128

128

00:05:56.821  -->  00:05:58.846
So this hand here showing up.
129

129

00:05:58.846  -->  00:06:00.191
Now, they're not really side by side.
130

130

00:06:00.191  -->  00:06:01.024
Let me
131

131

00:06:02.004  -->  00:06:05.178
check out what's going on here.
132

132

00:06:05.178  -->  00:06:07.394
So they are actually 50%.
133

133

00:06:07.394  -->  00:06:09.278
But for some reason they're not really showing up.
134

134

00:06:09.278  -->  00:06:11.143
Let me try to decrease that.
135

135

00:06:11.143  -->  00:06:13.685
All right, so that just put it to 49.
136

136

00:06:13.685  -->  00:06:15.913
It's really the same, okay?
137

137

00:06:15.913  -->  00:06:17.185
It doesn't really matter.
138

138

00:06:17.185  -->  00:06:19.768
So let's just make it 49%.
139

139

00:06:20.775  -->  00:06:24.080
So I prefer this to using floats instead.
140

140

00:06:24.080  -->  00:06:26.236
All right, so we have the radio-group,
141

141

00:06:26.236  -->  00:06:27.361
the radio-label.
142

142

00:06:27.361  -->  00:06:28.611
Now we have the
143

143

00:06:30.325  -->  00:06:32.620
radio-button here itself.
144

144

00:06:32.620  -->  00:06:34.793
So this one here, as I was saying,
145

145

00:06:34.793  -->  00:06:37.566
we're gonna hide it, but let's leave that for later.
146

146

00:06:37.566  -->  00:06:39.047
We'll just do that in the end.
147

147

00:06:39.047  -->  00:06:42.200
For now, let's style this radio-button here.
148

148

00:06:42.200  -->  00:06:44.867
So our custom button, basically.
149

149

00:06:45.999  -->  00:06:47.082
Radio-button.
150

150

00:06:48.725  -->  00:06:51.302
And this one is actually composed of two parts.
151

151

00:06:51.302  -->  00:06:53.722
And let me show that to you.
152

152

00:06:53.722  -->  00:06:57.035
So we have this green thing here outside this circle here.
153

153

00:06:57.035  -->  00:07:00.539
And then the inside, which is this green dot,
154

154

00:07:00.539  -->  00:07:01.995
it's a different element.
155

155

00:07:01.995  -->  00:07:04.415
And that way, we can either have the empty radio button
156

156

00:07:04.415  -->  00:07:05.702
like this one here
157

157

00:07:05.702  -->  00:07:08.634
or the selected button, where we then simply display
158

158

00:07:08.634  -->  00:07:12.530
this green part in the middle, so this dot.
159

159

00:07:12.530  -->  00:07:13.942
So it's the radio button.
160

160

00:07:13.942  -->  00:07:16.062
And then inside, for the dot,
161

161

00:07:16.062  -->  00:07:18.221
we're gonna create another element.
162

162

00:07:18.221  -->  00:07:19.731
But instead of doing it in the HTML,
163

163

00:07:19.731  -->  00:07:23.314
we're going to make a pseudo-element, okay?
164

164

00:07:24.218  -->  00:07:28.410
So we're gonna use the after pseudo-element.
165

165

00:07:28.410  -->  00:07:32.493
So first off, let's give it a height and a width,
166

166

00:07:35.438  -->  00:07:36.905
so a 2D button.
167

167

00:07:36.905  -->  00:07:38.107
And since we want it to be a circle,
168

168

00:07:38.107  -->  00:07:40.852
it will have the same height and the same width,
169

169

00:07:40.852  -->  00:07:43.092
so both 30 pixels.
170

170

00:07:43.092  -->  00:07:45.972
Then we give it that border, that green border.
171

171

00:07:45.972  -->  00:07:49.472
So five pixel solid and our primary color.
172

172

00:07:54.458  -->  00:07:57.505
And then we give it a border radius of 50%
173

173

00:07:57.505  -->  00:08:01.116
in order to make it completely round.
174

174

00:08:01.116  -->  00:08:04.207
And now take a look at that.
175

175

00:08:04.207  -->  00:08:06.243
Well, it isn't quite working yet, okay?
176

176

00:08:06.243  -->  00:08:10.410
And that is because we should make it a block element.
177

177

00:08:11.386  -->  00:08:13.887
Okay, so once again, these properties,
178

178

00:08:13.887  -->  00:08:15.054
they only work
179

179

00:08:16.077  -->  00:08:18.556
if we give it a block or an inline block element here.
180

180

00:08:18.556  -->  00:08:20.806
For now, block should work.
181

181

00:08:21.713  -->  00:08:23.161
All right, but now what's happening
182

182

00:08:23.161  -->  00:08:27.500
is that they actually occupy this line on themselves.
183

183

00:08:27.500  -->  00:08:31.667
So yeah, inline block is probably a better option.
184

184

00:08:34.469  -->  00:08:35.834
So inline block.
185

185

00:08:35.834  -->  00:08:37.387
But still, it's now a bit difficult
186

186

00:08:37.387  -->  00:08:39.760
to actually position this element
187

187

00:08:39.760  -->  00:08:42.991
inside of the radio-label element.
188

188

00:08:42.991  -->  00:08:44.925
So let's use absolute positioning
189

189

00:08:44.925  -->  00:08:48.875
in order to put it exactly where we want it to be.
190

190

00:08:48.875  -->  00:08:51.130
So position absolute.
191

191

00:08:51.130  -->  00:08:52.906
And remember, in order for that to work,
192

192

00:08:52.906  -->  00:08:55.299
we have to make the parent relative.
193

193

00:08:55.299  -->  00:08:58.012
So that is radio-label.
194

194

00:08:58.012  -->  00:08:59.762
So position relative.
195

195

00:09:02.529  -->  00:09:05.659
And now we should here be able to position it.
196

196

00:09:05.659  -->  00:09:08.758
So at the left, we want it to be zero,
197

197

00:09:08.758  -->  00:09:11.023
and then from the top, I'm not really sure.
198

198

00:09:11.023  -->  00:09:13.523
Let's start with zero as well.
199

199

00:09:14.531  -->  00:09:16.491
And then we can adjust as we go.
200

200

00:09:16.491  -->  00:09:18.212
Well, that looks a bit weird.
201

201

00:09:18.212  -->  00:09:20.045
So let's inspect that.
202

202

00:09:22.121  -->  00:09:24.709
And so the problem is now that they overlap each other
203

203

00:09:24.709  -->  00:09:27.161
because of course the text starts
204

204

00:09:27.161  -->  00:09:28.464
at the beginning of the element,
205

205

00:09:28.464  -->  00:09:30.727
and so does the new button.
206

206

00:09:30.727  -->  00:09:33.236
And so let's just give it some padding on the left side,
207

207

00:09:33.236  -->  00:09:36.083
and then we'll put the text where we want it to be.
208

208

00:09:36.083  -->  00:09:38.916
So radio-label, and we're gonna do
209

209

00:09:40.691  -->  00:09:42.788
five rem here, okay?
210

210

00:09:42.788  -->  00:09:45.909
And maybe on the top we should give it something negative
211

211

00:09:45.909  -->  00:09:47.935
to move it up a bit
212

212

00:09:47.935  -->  00:09:51.611
cause I thought it was not really well aligned.
213

213

00:09:51.611  -->  00:09:53.747
And well, that wasn't quite what I wanted.
214

214

00:09:53.747  -->  00:09:57.580
So let's check out what's going on here again.
215

215

00:09:58.546  -->  00:09:59.819
And yeah, okay, no.
216

216

00:09:59.819  -->  00:10:02.759
I put the padding at the entire element
217

217

00:10:02.759  -->  00:10:05.457
and not just on the left side.
218

218

00:10:05.457  -->  00:10:07.774
So big mistake here.
219

219

00:10:07.774  -->  00:10:10.076
And now it will work.
220

220

00:10:10.076  -->  00:10:11.764
Okay, now that was maybe a bit too much,
221

221

00:10:11.764  -->  00:10:13.325
but I can decrease that.
222

222

00:10:13.325  -->  00:10:15.537
Now let's take care of that inner side
223

223

00:10:15.537  -->  00:10:16.893
that we have to put here.
224

224

00:10:16.893  -->  00:10:19.615
And so we specified this after pseudo-element
225

225

00:10:19.615  -->  00:10:21.282
in order to do that.
226

226

00:10:22.194  -->  00:10:23.961
Just increasing the padding here,
227

227

00:10:23.961  -->  00:10:28.128
and maybe this one here was actually well at zero.
228

228

00:10:29.722  -->  00:10:31.884
We can change that later, once again.
229

229

00:10:31.884  -->  00:10:33.978
So the inner element now,
230

230

00:10:33.978  -->  00:10:35.352
how do we want to do this?
231

231

00:10:35.352  -->  00:10:38.064
Again, it's a circle, right?
232

232

00:10:38.064  -->  00:10:41.805
So let's specify its height and its width.
233

233

00:10:41.805  -->  00:10:43.356
Starting with one rem, but we can adjust it
234

234

00:10:43.356  -->  00:10:45.544
on the go if it's not perfect.
235

235

00:10:45.544  -->  00:10:47.657
So width, one rem.
236

236

00:10:47.657  -->  00:10:50.617
And remember, each time that we use a pseudo-element,
237

237

00:10:50.617  -->  00:10:54.505
we have to actually specify its content property.
238

238

00:10:54.505  -->  00:10:56.709
And as always, I set it to empty.
239

239

00:10:56.709  -->  00:11:00.876
And also the display property, and I set it to block here.
240

240

00:11:04.252  -->  00:11:07.568
And as I was saying, we want it to be a circle.
241

241

00:11:07.568  -->  00:11:10.604
So for the radius, 50%.
242

242

00:11:10.604  -->  00:11:12.149
Now, we want it to be positioned
243

243

00:11:12.149  -->  00:11:15.671
exactly in the center of the outer circle, right?
244

244

00:11:15.671  -->  00:11:17.781
And so we're gonna use our old trick for that
245

245

00:11:17.781  -->  00:11:19.484
with absolute positioning.
246

246

00:11:19.484  -->  00:11:21.234
So position absolute.
247

247

00:11:23.308  -->  00:11:26.197
And for that, we need to set the position on the parent.
248

248

00:11:26.197  -->  00:11:27.534
But it's actually already set.
249

249

00:11:27.534  -->  00:11:30.031
And it doesn't really have to be relative, okay?
250

250

00:11:30.031  -->  00:11:31.462
It can be absolute as well.
251

251

00:11:31.462  -->  00:11:33.795
It just has to be specified.
252

252

00:11:35.459  -->  00:11:37.542
And so now, top 50%,
253

253

00:11:39.302  -->  00:11:41.715
left 50% as well,
254

254

00:11:41.715  -->  00:11:45.040
and then the old transform trick.
255

255

00:11:45.040  -->  00:11:48.623
I will translate everything minus 50%.
256

256

00:11:50.567  -->  00:11:52.621
Okay, one thing that we forgot, of course,
257

257

00:11:52.621  -->  00:11:54.151
is the background color.
258

258

00:11:54.151  -->  00:11:56.984
That should color primary as well.
259

259

00:11:59.445  -->  00:12:00.923
And so, yeah.
260

260

00:12:00.923  -->  00:12:03.392
Let's take a look now at that.
261

261

00:12:03.392  -->  00:12:04.619
And so yeah, here we go.
262

262

00:12:04.619  -->  00:12:06.846
It's a bit too small, I think.
263

263

00:12:06.846  -->  00:12:10.179
And so let's increase that to maybe 1.3.
264

264

00:12:12.311  -->  00:12:13.144
Okay.
265

265

00:12:15.681  -->  00:12:18.009
And yeah, that looks much better.
266

266

00:12:18.009  -->  00:12:19.037
And now we're almost there.
267

267

00:12:19.037  -->  00:12:21.814
So now we have to hide these,
268

268

00:12:21.814  -->  00:12:23.006
these little dots here,
269

269

00:12:23.006  -->  00:12:24.145
so that they are empty in the beginning
270

270

00:12:24.145  -->  00:12:26.124
just like these, right?
271

271

00:12:26.124  -->  00:12:27.807
So they have to be empty.
272

272

00:12:27.807  -->  00:12:29.046
And remember, we're gonna hide them,
273

273

00:12:29.046  -->  00:12:30.601
these ones here, in the end.
274

274

00:12:30.601  -->  00:12:32.586
But for now, let's keep them there.
275

275

00:12:32.586  -->  00:12:35.372
So they have to be empty, so we simply have to
276

276

00:12:35.372  -->  00:12:37.838
make these circles here invisible.
277

277

00:12:37.838  -->  00:12:39.558
And we can then move up this entire thing here
278

278

00:12:39.558  -->  00:12:41.854
a bit to the top, actually.
279

279

00:12:41.854  -->  00:12:44.021
So opacity should be zero.
280

280

00:12:47.408  -->  00:12:49.059
And here, we need this one after all, okay?
281

281

00:12:49.059  -->  00:12:51.392
So maybe should be minus two
282

282

00:12:53.249  -->  00:12:55.166
or something like that.
283

283

00:12:58.460  -->  00:12:59.473
Or maybe even more.
284

284

00:12:59.473  -->  00:13:03.745
Let's check out how much we need, actually.
285

285

00:13:03.745  -->  00:13:05.791
Minus three, minus four,
286

286

00:13:05.791  -->  00:13:08.127
yeah, minus four looks good to me.
287

287

00:13:08.127  -->  00:13:09.294
So minus four.
288

288

00:13:11.539  -->  00:13:13.643
All right, now it's time that we have to make
289

289

00:13:13.643  -->  00:13:15.164
our magic happen.
290

290

00:13:15.164  -->  00:13:16.614
So what is that magic?
291

291

00:13:16.614  -->  00:13:18.458
Well, the magic is that each time
292

292

00:13:18.458  -->  00:13:21.306
we hit this element here,
293

293

00:13:21.306  -->  00:13:22.908
so like this or like this,
294

294

00:13:22.908  -->  00:13:24.455
we have to make this circle here,
295

295

00:13:24.455  -->  00:13:28.182
the green one, appear in the center, right?
296

296

00:13:28.182  -->  00:13:29.795
So basically put the opacity
297

297

00:13:29.795  -->  00:13:32.738
of the after pseudo-element to one.
298

298

00:13:32.738  -->  00:13:35.187
So how do we do that?
299

299

00:13:35.187  -->  00:13:38.191
Well, what we can do is to use another pseudo-class,
300

300

00:13:38.191  -->  00:13:39.896
which is called checked.
301

301

00:13:39.896  -->  00:13:41.254
And that pseudo-class is available
302

302

00:13:41.254  -->  00:13:43.592
on all the radio buttons which are,
303

303

00:13:43.592  -->  00:13:45.320
as you can see here, checked.
304

304

00:13:45.320  -->  00:13:47.611
So right now, this radio button here,
305

305

00:13:47.611  -->  00:13:49.991
it has the checked pseudo-class.
306

306

00:13:49.991  -->  00:13:53.147
And so we can use that to our advantage, okay?
307

307

00:13:53.147  -->  00:13:55.230
So let's do exactly that.
308

308

00:13:56.317  -->  00:13:57.150
So
309

309

00:13:59.802  -->  00:14:00.719
radio-input
310

310

00:14:04.545  -->  00:14:05.378
checked.
311

311

00:14:05.378  -->  00:14:08.057
So right now, we have all the radio-input elements
312

312

00:14:08.057  -->  00:14:10.956
selected which are checked, all right?
313

313

00:14:10.956  -->  00:14:12.513
Now what we want to manipulate
314

314

00:14:12.513  -->  00:14:15.346
is not the radio-input but instead
315

315

00:14:16.444  -->  00:14:18.861
the radio-button here, right?
316

316

00:14:20.504  -->  00:14:22.437
So how do we do that?
317

317

00:14:22.437  -->  00:14:25.172
Well, right now this one here is selected,
318

318

00:14:25.172  -->  00:14:27.779
but we want to select this one here.
319

319

00:14:27.779  -->  00:14:29.880
Now, the thing is that this span element
320

320

00:14:29.880  -->  00:14:32.730
is not a direct child of this one,
321

321

00:14:32.730  -->  00:14:34.158
of the radio-input, right?
322

322

00:14:34.158  -->  00:14:35.902
And so what do we do?
323

323

00:14:35.902  -->  00:14:37.957
Well, once again, we use the sibling selector
324

324

00:14:37.957  -->  00:14:40.076
to first select the label,
325

325

00:14:40.076  -->  00:14:43.129
and then from there we can select this child,
326

326

00:14:43.129  -->  00:14:45.076
so this radio-button here, right?
327

327

00:14:45.076  -->  00:14:46.521
So let's do that.
328

328

00:14:46.521  -->  00:14:48.604
So we select the sibling,
329

329

00:14:49.578  -->  00:14:51.695
and we can use the adjacent sibling selector again
330

330

00:14:51.695  -->  00:14:54.018
because it is a direct sibling.
331

331

00:14:54.018  -->  00:14:55.830
But this time, just to make it a bit different,
332

332

00:14:55.830  -->  00:14:57.212
let's actually use this one.
333

333

00:14:57.212  -->  00:14:59.270
It will work just the same way.
334

334

00:14:59.270  -->  00:15:03.023
And so now we select the radio-label.
335

335

00:15:03.023  -->  00:15:04.260
So that is the sibling.
336

336

00:15:04.260  -->  00:15:06.822
And then we want the child element of this one.
337

337

00:15:06.822  -->  00:15:09.239
And that is the radio-button.
338

338

00:15:13.617  -->  00:15:17.244
And what we really want is the after pseudo-element,
339

339

00:15:17.244  -->  00:15:19.336
so this one here, right?
340

340

00:15:19.336  -->  00:15:21.126
So that is a huge selector.
341

341

00:15:21.126  -->  00:15:23.907
And I know that it's quite a complicated one, right?
342

342

00:15:23.907  -->  00:15:25.548
But it's all actually pretty logical.
343

343

00:15:25.548  -->  00:15:27.883
You just have to wrap your head around the logic
344

344

00:15:27.883  -->  00:15:29.864
that's going on here, okay?
345

345

00:15:29.864  -->  00:15:32.047
So let me try to explain it one more time.
346

346

00:15:32.047  -->  00:15:34.283
So as soon as we hit the label element,
347

347

00:15:34.283  -->  00:15:36.718
the radio-input becomes checked.
348

348

00:15:36.718  -->  00:15:39.984
So we have this checked pseudo-class available to us.
349

349

00:15:39.984  -->  00:15:41.768
And what we do then is to simply select
350

350

00:15:41.768  -->  00:15:45.316
the sibling of that one, and then the child
351

351

00:15:45.316  -->  00:15:47.471
because that's the one that we want to change
352

352

00:15:47.471  -->  00:15:50.210
each time that the radio input is selected.
353

353

00:15:50.210  -->  00:15:53.329
And what we want to do, we want to give it
354

354

00:15:53.329  -->  00:15:54.829
an opacity of one.
355

355

00:15:55.679  -->  00:15:59.394
So it was zero, and now it will be one.
356

356

00:15:59.394  -->  00:16:01.527
That just adds the transition here, of course.
357

357

00:16:01.527  -->  00:16:02.444
Transition.
358

358

00:16:03.592  -->  00:16:05.219
And the only one that we're really gonna manipulate
359

359

00:16:05.219  -->  00:16:09.201
is opacity, and so let's actually write that out here,
360

360

00:16:09.201  -->  00:16:11.782
in 0.2 seconds, okay?
361

361

00:16:11.782  -->  00:16:13.949
So let's now check it out.
362

362

00:16:15.338  -->  00:16:16.883
And so here we go.
363

363

00:16:16.883  -->  00:16:17.752
You saw that?
364

364

00:16:17.752  -->  00:16:20.910
It actually selected the correct element.
365

365

00:16:20.910  -->  00:16:23.002
All right, and so basically now this button
366

366

00:16:23.002  -->  00:16:24.372
replaces this one.
367

367

00:16:24.372  -->  00:16:26.864
It has the exact same functionality, okay?
368

368

00:16:26.864  -->  00:16:28.901
And this is how you style radio buttons.
369

369

00:16:28.901  -->  00:16:32.198
The same thing actually works for check boxes, okay?
370

370

00:16:32.198  -->  00:16:33.316
So it's the same logic.
371

371

00:16:33.316  -->  00:16:36.429
We also have the checked pseudo-class available to us,
372

372

00:16:36.429  -->  00:16:40.230
and we can then go on and do the exact same manipulation.
373

373

00:16:40.230  -->  00:16:42.605
And so the last step is to actually hide
374

374

00:16:42.605  -->  00:16:45.958
the radio-input element, right?
375

375

00:16:45.958  -->  00:16:48.493
So this one here, cause of course
376

376

00:16:48.493  -->  00:16:50.363
we don't want to see it.
377

377

00:16:50.363  -->  00:16:52.530
So let's do it right here.
378

378

00:16:53.945  -->  00:16:54.945
Radio-input.
379

379

00:16:59.791  -->  00:17:00.874
Display none.
380

380

00:17:02.554  -->  00:17:03.956
That's it.
381

381

00:17:03.956  -->  00:17:05.580
That's how it works.
382

382

00:17:05.580  -->  00:17:07.913
All right, and now there's just one last thing,
383

383

00:17:07.913  -->  00:17:09.811
which is to actually add this button.
384

384

00:17:09.811  -->  00:17:13.032
But that should be pretty easy, right?
385

385

00:17:13.032  -->  00:17:14.503
Because we already have the button.
386

386

00:17:14.503  -->  00:17:17.428
Now, the difference here is that we
387

387

00:17:17.428  -->  00:17:20.511
cannot use an anchor element in here.
388

388

00:17:21.801  -->  00:17:23.831
But let's see that in a second.
389

389

00:17:23.831  -->  00:17:27.248
So for now, let's add another group here.
390

390

00:17:28.313  -->  00:17:30.471
And then the button.
391

391

00:17:30.471  -->  00:17:34.638
And so we already have the button, as I was saying.
392

392

00:17:35.817  -->  00:17:39.067
And also the green style of the button.
393

393

00:17:40.024  -->  00:17:41.530
Next step.
394

394

00:17:41.530  -->  00:17:43.707
Okay, so as I was saying, in a form,
395

395

00:17:43.707  -->  00:17:45.713
we really need a real button element,
396

396

00:17:45.713  -->  00:17:47.046
not just an anchor link,
397

397

00:17:47.046  -->  00:17:49.003
because this button here will allow us
398

398

00:17:49.003  -->  00:17:51.119
to submit the form, okay?
399

399

00:17:51.119  -->  00:17:53.254
And so the form understands that if there's a button,
400

400

00:17:53.254  -->  00:17:54.662
then when we click that button,
401

401

00:17:54.662  -->  00:17:57.004
that should be the submit button, okay?
402

402

00:17:57.004  -->  00:17:59.083
And we can actually also go ahead
403

403

00:17:59.083  -->  00:18:01.271
and use our right arrow here,
404

404

00:18:01.271  -->  00:18:03.330
like there is in the original version.
405

405

00:18:03.330  -->  00:18:04.163
And so
406

406

00:18:05.181  -->  00:18:06.724
let's check that out.
407

407

00:18:06.724  -->  00:18:09.165
And well, that doesn't really look like
408

408

00:18:09.165  -->  00:18:11.016
the one that we specified, right?
409

409

00:18:11.016  -->  00:18:13.398
And that's because this one is a button element.
410

410

00:18:13.398  -->  00:18:16.092
And so we have to actually go ahead
411

411

00:18:16.092  -->  00:18:19.332
and make some change to our original button.
412

412

00:18:19.332  -->  00:18:21.736
But nothing really too difficult.
413

413

00:18:21.736  -->  00:18:23.527
So the first thing is that buttons,
414

414

00:18:23.527  -->  00:18:25.398
they by default come with a border.
415

415

00:18:25.398  -->  00:18:27.595
And so we should change that.
416

416

00:18:27.595  -->  00:18:30.428
So let me just add a comment here.
417

417

00:18:35.910  -->  00:18:38.577
So let's just remove that border
418

418

00:18:41.980  -->  00:18:43.037
to none.
419

419

00:18:43.037  -->  00:18:46.704
Then also we want a cursor of pointer again.
420

420

00:18:48.357  -->  00:18:51.339
So that little hand cursor.
421

421

00:18:51.339  -->  00:18:53.590
So let's see if that changed a thing.
422

422

00:18:53.590  -->  00:18:54.648
Well, actually not.
423

423

00:18:54.648  -->  00:18:55.481
Well,
424

424

00:18:57.000  -->  00:18:59.229
let me check out what's going on here.
425

425

00:18:59.229  -->  00:19:03.179
So what I'm seeing here is that the button class
426

426

00:19:03.179  -->  00:19:06.807
is actually not really getting applied here, okay?
427

427

00:19:06.807  -->  00:19:08.807
So let's check that out.
428

428

00:19:09.772  -->  00:19:12.349
And now I see why that is, actually.
429

429

00:19:12.349  -->  00:19:15.152
So these styles here, you see?
430

430

00:19:15.152  -->  00:19:18.354
These only get applied to the button with the link
431

431

00:19:18.354  -->  00:19:21.223
and the visited pseudo-classes, right?
432

432

00:19:21.223  -->  00:19:24.233
Now, our button doesn't have any of these pseudo-classes.
433

433

00:19:24.233  -->  00:19:27.397
And so therefore nothing of this actually gets applied.
434

434

00:19:27.397  -->  00:19:29.752
And so this is great for me to show you actually,
435

435

00:19:29.752  -->  00:19:31.731
the difference between a button element
436

436

00:19:31.731  -->  00:19:33.555
or an anchor tag.
437

437

00:19:33.555  -->  00:19:36.943
So the button doesn't have the link and the visited.
438

438

00:19:36.943  -->  00:19:38.776
So what we can do here
439

439

00:19:39.661  -->  00:19:41.509
is to simply do it like this, right?
440

440

00:19:41.509  -->  00:19:44.841
Because this will translate into button.
441

441

00:19:44.841  -->  00:19:47.314
So just button, so that all of these get applied
442

442

00:19:47.314  -->  00:19:49.814
to our button element as well.
443

443

00:19:51.373  -->  00:19:52.746
So that, yeah.
444

444

00:19:52.746  -->  00:19:56.062
Okay, so that actually already worked here.
445

445

00:19:56.062  -->  00:19:56.895
Right?
446

446

00:19:59.521  -->  00:20:02.238
Oh, and you see this blue border here around it?
447

447

00:20:02.238  -->  00:20:04.436
That is the focus, okay?
448

448

00:20:04.436  -->  00:20:06.886
So the same focus as this one.
449

449

00:20:06.886  -->  00:20:08.997
Now, once before, as I told you in the beginning,
450

450

00:20:08.997  -->  00:20:12.449
we should not really remove simply the focus here.
451

451

00:20:12.449  -->  00:20:15.528
We could go in and say focus outline none,
452

452

00:20:15.528  -->  00:20:19.168
but for accessibility reasons, we should not do that.
453

453

00:20:19.168  -->  00:20:21.751
So let's just do something else
454

454

00:20:23.367  -->  00:20:25.634
and say that the focus should look
455

455

00:20:25.634  -->  00:20:29.398
the exact same way as the hover does.
456

456

00:20:29.398  -->  00:20:30.231
Okay?
457

457

00:20:31.998  -->  00:20:35.275
Or maybe even the active, okay,
458

458

00:20:35.275  -->  00:20:40.248
because this actually happens when we hit the button,
459

459

00:20:40.248  -->  00:20:42.025
not when we just hover it.
460

460

00:20:42.025  -->  00:20:43.025
So not here.
461

461

00:20:43.970  -->  00:20:45.631
Let's take that out,
462

462

00:20:45.631  -->  00:20:48.631
but instead it should be here, okay?
463

463

00:20:53.006  -->  00:20:54.239
So we say outline none,
464

464

00:20:54.239  -->  00:20:56.845
but then instead, this here happens.
465

465

00:20:56.845  -->  00:20:59.836
And so we didn't completely remove that focus.
466

466

00:20:59.836  -->  00:21:02.307
And so now it's gone,
467

467

00:21:02.307  -->  00:21:03.506
and everything looks great.
468

468

00:21:03.506  -->  00:21:05.046
Now, just one small change here.
469

469

00:21:05.046  -->  00:21:06.546
We should add some
470

470

00:21:07.684  -->  00:21:10.434
margin to the button of that one.
471

471

00:21:11.590  -->  00:21:15.139
And we can simply do that in here,
472

472

00:21:15.139  -->  00:21:17.841
or actually in here, with one of the helper classes.
473

473

00:21:17.841  -->  00:21:19.174
So in utilities,
474

474

00:21:22.062  -->  00:21:24.669
and let's just use this one here,
475

475

00:21:24.669  -->  00:21:27.336
so just a medium space in there.
476

476

00:21:30.119  -->  00:21:33.072
So that should do the trick.
477

477

00:21:33.072  -->  00:21:35.877
Well, not really, actually.
478

478

00:21:35.877  -->  00:21:37.505
Let me check.
479

479

00:21:37.505  -->  00:21:39.644
And so you see now what's going on here.
480

480

00:21:39.644  -->  00:21:41.104
And that's why I wanted to show you it
481

481

00:21:41.104  -->  00:21:43.008
in the inspector.
482

482

00:21:43.008  -->  00:21:45.088
So we have this two rem here that we specified
483

483

00:21:45.088  -->  00:21:48.677
for all the form groups, and so that one takes precedence.
484

484

00:21:48.677  -->  00:21:51.269
It's more specific, this selector's more specific.
485

485

00:21:51.269  -->  00:21:52.865
So what can we do here?
486

486

00:21:52.865  -->  00:21:56.886
Well, I'm doing something that I said we should not do.
487

487

00:21:56.886  -->  00:22:00.061
But in utilities classes, it is different.
488

488

00:22:00.061  -->  00:22:01.703
So when we add a utility class,
489

489

00:22:01.703  -->  00:22:04.475
we really want to happen whatever we say
490

490

00:22:04.475  -->  00:22:06.622
in one of these classes, right?
491

491

00:22:06.622  -->  00:22:10.368
And so we actually want this to override everything else.
492

492

00:22:10.368  -->  00:22:14.535
And so what we do is to use the important keyword.
493

493

00:22:18.545  -->  00:22:20.359
So this is a normal practice,
494

494

00:22:20.359  -->  00:22:23.819
to do it like this in the utility classes, okay?
495

495

00:22:23.819  -->  00:22:26.346
And so yeah, now you see that it looks okay.
496

496

00:22:26.346  -->  00:22:27.498
And actually, it looks great.
497

497

00:22:27.498  -->  00:22:29.101
So let's test it again.
498

498

00:22:29.101  -->  00:22:31.268
So everything looks great.
499

499

00:22:34.617  -->  00:22:37.950
And so yeah, these buttons work as well.
500

500

00:22:38.844  -->  00:22:40.301
So it's perfect.
501

501

00:22:40.301  -->  00:22:41.993
And you saw it actually performed the action
502

502

00:22:41.993  -->  00:22:42.826
that we specified.
503

503

00:22:42.826  -->  00:22:45.881
So it went basically to this direction here,
504

504

00:22:45.881  -->  00:22:48.844
which is just to go to the top of the page.
505

505

00:22:48.844  -->  00:22:51.195
And it also reloaded it, okay?
506

506

00:22:51.195  -->  00:22:53.571
So we successfully submitted a form.
507

507

00:22:53.571  -->  00:22:54.995
Nothing happened, of course.
508

508

00:22:54.995  -->  00:22:56.972
But that's not the point of this form.
509

509

00:22:56.972  -->  00:22:58.659
The point was to style it.
510

510

00:22:58.659  -->  00:23:01.160
And that's done, and it looks really great.
511

511

00:23:01.160  -->  00:23:03.150
So let's now move on to the next lecture,
512

512

00:23:03.150  -->  00:23:07.317
where we're gonna code up the footer of this website.
