00:00:01,617  -->  00:00:02,947
<v Instructor>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,947  -->  00:00:04,929
I hope that the last command line lecture
3

3

00:00:04,929  -->  00:00:06,936
was not all too bad for you
4

4

00:00:06,936  -->  00:00:09,055
because in this lecture we're actually
5

5

00:00:09,055  -->  00:00:11,803
going to put it to use for the first time.
6

6

00:00:11,803  -->  00:00:14,079
So in this lecture, we're gonna install SASS
7

7

00:00:14,079  -->  00:00:16,176
on our local computer.
8

8

00:00:16,176  -->  00:00:18,195
Now there are several ways to do this,
9

9

00:00:18,195  -->  00:00:21,190
but I found that the easiest one is to just use
10

10

00:00:21,190  -->  00:00:24,501
an NMP package called Node SASS.
11

11

00:00:24,501  -->  00:00:26,900
So now you're probably wondering,
12

12

00:00:26,900  -->  00:00:31,362
what is NMP and what the hell is an NMP package, right?
13

13

00:00:31,362  -->  00:00:32,850
And that's great.
14

14

00:00:32,850  -->  00:00:35,725
So let me know introduce you to a whole new world
15

15

00:00:35,725  -->  00:00:38,855
of front end web development in case you haven't used it
16

16

00:00:38,855  -->  00:00:41,070
up until this point.
17

17

00:00:41,070  -->  00:00:43,878
And what I'm talking about is the huge Node JS
18

18

00:00:43,878  -->  00:00:46,138
and NMP package ecosystem
19

19

00:00:46,138  -->  00:00:48,781
where you can find all kinds of open source tools
20

20

00:00:48,781  -->  00:00:51,054
and libraries and frame works needed
21

21

00:00:51,054  -->  00:00:52,966
for modern web development.
22

22

00:00:52,966  -->  00:00:55,549
In one of these packages is a package to compile SASS
23

23

00:00:55,549  -->  00:00:57,632
which we're about to use.
24

24

00:00:58,630  -->  00:01:01,670
So it all starts with Node JS which is an open source
25

25

00:01:01,670  -->  00:01:04,073
JavaScript run time that allows developers
26

26

00:01:04,073  -->  00:01:08,223
to write and run JavaScript application on the server.
27

27

00:01:08,223  -->  00:01:10,428
Now after some time, developers started using Node
28

28

00:01:10,428  -->  00:01:13,675
to also write tools like for task automations,
29

29

00:01:13,675  -->  00:01:16,955
or again to compile SASS to help them
30

30

00:01:16,955  -->  00:01:19,259
with local web development.
31

31

00:01:19,259  -->  00:01:21,392
And that's what we're focusing on in this course.
32

32

00:01:21,392  -->  00:01:22,922
Not the part about writing JavaScript
33

33

00:01:22,922  -->  00:01:24,734
on the server of course.
34

34

00:01:24,734  -->  00:01:27,215
Now in order to use and share these packages
35

35

00:01:27,215  -->  00:01:29,929
we need some kind of tool to install and to manage them.
36

36

00:01:29,929  -->  00:01:34,096
And that's where the Node package manager, or NMP comes in.
37

37

00:01:35,024  -->  00:01:38,331
So NMP is basically just a very simple command line
38

38

00:01:38,331  -->  00:01:41,089
program that allows us to do exactly that.
39

39

00:01:41,089  -->  00:01:44,891
Plus NMP also allows us to do some automations
40

40

00:01:44,891  -->  00:01:46,385
of boring tasks.
41

41

00:01:46,385  -->  00:01:47,990
But more about that later.
42

42

00:01:47,990  -->  00:01:50,524
Let me just tell you that today every serious
43

43

00:01:50,524  -->  00:01:53,582
front end web developer in the world uses some kind
44

44

00:01:53,582  -->  00:01:56,728
of package manager like NMP which is the most popular one
45

45

00:01:56,728  -->  00:01:59,611
since it comes directly with Node.
46

46

00:01:59,611  -->  00:02:02,076
So let me teach you the very fundamentals of NMP
47

47

00:02:02,076  -->  00:02:05,012
throughout this lecture always with the goal of
48

48

00:02:05,012  -->  00:02:09,409
in this case, installing SASS on a local computer.
49

49

00:02:09,409  -->  00:02:12,192
All right so the first step to actually get started
50

50

00:02:12,192  -->  00:02:15,162
with this is to install Node on your computer.
51

51

00:02:15,162  -->  00:02:19,731
So let's head over to nodejs.org and grab the installer.
52

52

00:02:19,731  -->  00:02:21,926
So this is nodejs.org
53

53

00:02:21,926  -->  00:02:25,124
and from here you can grab the installer for Node JS.
54

54

00:02:25,124  -->  00:02:27,011
So you can just install version six.
55

55

00:02:27,011  -->  00:02:29,363
It's more than enough for what we're gonna
56

56

00:02:29,363  -->  00:02:30,912
do in this lecture.
57

57

00:02:30,912  -->  00:02:32,466
And if you're not finding the right installer
58

58

00:02:32,466  -->  00:02:34,353
for your platform, you can just go here to downloads
59

59

00:02:34,353  -->  00:02:38,023
and I'm sure it will be somewhere here.
60

60

00:02:38,023  -->  00:02:39,794
Now I of course already have it installed
61

61

00:02:39,794  -->  00:02:41,016
and so I'm not gonna do that.
62

62

00:02:41,016  -->  00:02:43,379
And so you should probably just pause the video
63

63

00:02:43,379  -->  00:02:45,956
and wait until you have everything installed.
64

64

00:02:45,956  -->  00:02:48,592
All right, so I hope your installation was successful.
65

65

00:02:48,592  -->  00:02:52,092
And so let's now open up the command line.
66

66

00:02:53,110  -->  00:02:54,027
So terminal
67

67

00:02:56,557  -->  00:02:58,645
on the Mac and if you're Windows,
68

68

00:02:58,645  -->  00:03:01,836
remember just open the command prompt by right-clicking
69

69

00:03:01,836  -->  00:03:04,791
on your start button on Windows.
70

70

00:03:04,791  -->  00:03:06,281
All right and so the first thing we should here
71

71

00:03:06,281  -->  00:03:08,132
is to test if it you actually have
72

72

00:03:08,132  -->  00:03:10,198
Node installed successfully.
73

73

00:03:10,198  -->  00:03:14,498
And let me just increase the window here slightly.
74

74

00:03:14,498  -->  00:03:17,911
So that you can see what's going on here on my screen.
75

75

00:03:17,911  -->  00:03:18,807
All right.
76

76

00:03:18,807  -->  00:03:21,568
So in order to test if you have Node successfully installed,
77

77

00:03:21,568  -->  00:03:25,934
you just write the command Node and then dash V.
78

78

00:03:25,934  -->  00:03:28,295
Which will check for your version basically.
79

79

00:03:28,295  -->  00:03:29,587
And so if you see anything here,
80

80

00:03:29,587  -->  00:03:31,107
no matter what version it is,
81

81

00:03:31,107  -->  00:03:33,285
it doesn't have to be the same as mine.
82

82

00:03:33,285  -->  00:03:34,908
As long as you see any output here, it means
83

83

00:03:34,908  -->  00:03:38,627
that Node is successfully installed on your computer.
84

84

00:03:38,627  -->  00:03:40,669
Now if you're using Visual Studio Code like me,
85

85

00:03:40,669  -->  00:03:44,419
you can also use the integrated terminal here
86

86

00:03:45,703  -->  00:03:47,484
so there's a terminal already built
87

87

00:03:47,484  -->  00:03:49,923
in to Visual Studio Code, okay.
88

88

00:03:49,923  -->  00:03:51,918
And you can totally do that but in order
89

89

00:03:51,918  -->  00:03:53,533
to make things more clear and more easier
90

90

00:03:53,533  -->  00:03:54,860
for you to understand,
91

91

00:03:54,860  -->  00:03:57,012
I'm not going to use this one, which I used usually,
92

92

00:03:57,012  -->  00:04:00,626
but I'm gonna stick with the normal terminal here.
93

93

00:04:00,626  -->  00:04:05,626
So that being said, let's now navigate to our project folder
94

94

00:04:05,626  -->  00:04:07,113
and remember how we do that.
95

95

00:04:07,113  -->  00:04:08,961
First let's check where we actually are,
96

96

00:04:08,961  -->  00:04:11,044
what LS or DIR on Windows
97

97

00:04:12,018  -->  00:04:15,031
and then I just change directories with CD.
98

98

00:04:15,031  -->  00:04:16,156
Remember?
99

99

00:04:16,156  -->  00:04:18,497
So desktop and then from here, I know that the folder
100

100

00:04:18,497  -->  00:04:20,414
is called one natours.
101

101

00:04:20,414  -->  00:04:23,934
and so I just write one and then tab, return,
102

102

00:04:23,934  -->  00:04:25,356
and that's it.
103

103

00:04:25,356  -->  00:04:26,509
Let's check if everything's there.
104

104

00:04:26,509  -->  00:04:30,147
And yeah, index, IMG, and CSS.
105

105

00:04:30,147  -->  00:04:32,397
So it just navigates to your own project folder
106

106

00:04:32,397  -->  00:04:35,698
so that we can start using NMP right now.
107

107

00:04:35,698  -->  00:04:37,403
Before installing our first package,
108

108

00:04:37,403  -->  00:04:40,585
usually the first thing that we always do in a new project
109

109

00:04:40,585  -->  00:04:43,519
is to create a package.json file.
110

110

00:04:43,519  -->  00:04:45,408
Which basically will contain the definitions
111

111

00:04:45,408  -->  00:04:49,016
of our project and where NMP will write the packages
112

112

00:04:49,016  -->  00:04:50,216
that we use.
113

113

00:04:50,216  -->  00:04:52,724
And in order to do that, we use the NMP command
114

114

00:04:52,724  -->  00:04:55,768
so since the program that we installed is called NMP
115

115

00:04:55,768  -->  00:04:58,931
we simply need to run NMP on the command lines.
116

116

00:04:58,931  -->  00:05:02,563
NMP and then what we want to do here is init.
117

117

00:05:02,563  -->  00:05:06,372
So NMP init will open this program here.
118

118

00:05:06,372  -->  00:05:08,797
And so you see, this utility will walk you through
119

119

00:05:08,797  -->  00:05:10,933
creating a json.package file.
120

120

00:05:10,933  -->  00:05:13,321
And so this is basically just a simple helper
121

121

00:05:13,321  -->  00:05:16,763
which will create the package.json file for us.
122

122

00:05:16,763  -->  00:05:19,882
So again this is usually the first step that we take
123

123

00:05:19,882  -->  00:05:22,204
when we start using NMP on a new project.
124

124

00:05:22,204  -->  00:05:24,786
So we start with the name here.
125

125

00:05:24,786  -->  00:05:27,225
If we just hit return now it will take this name here
126

126

00:05:27,225  -->  00:05:31,674
as a default but let's just call it natours.
127

127

00:05:31,674  -->  00:05:34,842
The version is one, that's absolutely okay.
128

128

00:05:34,842  -->  00:05:37,397
The description, let's just say
129

129

00:05:37,397  -->  00:05:39,480
landing page for natours.
130

130

00:05:40,924  -->  00:05:43,195
You could even leave it empty, it doesn't really matter.
131

131

00:05:43,195  -->  00:05:45,445
This also is not important.
132

132

00:05:47,104  -->  00:05:48,416
So we can leave all of this empty.
133

133

00:05:48,416  -->  00:05:52,332
Here you can put your name if you want, the license.
134

134

00:05:52,332  -->  00:05:54,423
And now it just asks if this is okay.
135

135

00:05:54,423  -->  00:05:57,762
And it looks absolutely okay to me so okay.
136

136

00:05:57,762  -->  00:06:00,830
All right and so here is the package.json file.
137

137

00:06:00,830  -->  00:06:04,407
So we can just open it and here we go.
138

138

00:06:04,407  -->  00:06:06,063
So it contains the name that we specify,
139

139

00:06:06,063  -->  00:06:08,375
the version, description, main, scripts
140

140

00:06:08,375  -->  00:06:10,413
which we're gonna take a look at later,
141

141

00:06:10,413  -->  00:06:12,178
author and license.
142

142

00:06:12,178  -->  00:06:13,534
So nothing really exciting here for now
143

143

00:06:13,534  -->  00:06:15,658
and so let's move on now.
144

144

00:06:15,658  -->  00:06:19,115
So what we really wanna do is to now finally install
145

145

00:06:19,115  -->  00:06:21,654
our SASS compile, right?
146

146

00:06:21,654  -->  00:06:22,740
So let's do that.
147

147

00:06:22,740  -->  00:06:23,827
And it's very simple again.
148

148

00:06:23,827  -->  00:06:26,622
So we use the NMP program then install
149

149

00:06:26,622  -->  00:06:29,263
and now the name of the package.
150

150

00:06:29,263  -->  00:06:32,013
And the name is called Node SASS.
151

151

00:06:32,856  -->  00:06:34,901
So the name of the package that we want to install.
152

152

00:06:34,901  -->  00:06:37,468
And now we need to specify it one last thing.
153

153

00:06:37,468  -->  00:06:40,480
And this will make it so that the package.json file
154

154

00:06:40,480  -->  00:06:43,526
is updated and lists this package as one
155

155

00:06:43,526  -->  00:06:45,574
of our developer dependencies.
156

156

00:06:45,574  -->  00:06:46,896
So what does that mean?
157

157

00:06:46,896  -->  00:06:49,388
It means basically that Node SASS is a tool
158

158

00:06:49,388  -->  00:06:51,546
that we use to develop our project.
159

159

00:06:51,546  -->  00:06:53,879
So what we do is to say save
160

160

00:06:55,089  -->  00:06:57,280
dev, okay, and that's it.
161

161

00:06:57,280  -->  00:07:01,439
So hit return, and it should now download this package
162

162

00:07:01,439  -->  00:07:03,181
and install it.
163

163

00:07:03,181  -->  00:07:05,794
So it's normal that it takes some time.
164

164

00:07:05,794  -->  00:07:07,877
All right and here we go.
165

165

00:07:08,741  -->  00:07:11,687
So let's now take a look at the package.json file.
166

166

00:07:11,687  -->  00:07:12,866
And here we see it.
167

167

00:07:12,866  -->  00:07:15,743
So this is now listed as a dev dependencies here.
168

168

00:07:15,743  -->  00:07:18,159
So Node SASS is the one that we just installed
169

169

00:07:18,159  -->  00:07:21,997
and on version 4.5.3.
170

170

00:07:21,997  -->  00:07:24,250
And it's listed as a dev dependency.
171

171

00:07:24,250  -->  00:07:28,250
That's because we specified as I was telling you
172

172

00:07:29,989  -->  00:07:31,989
where do we have it now?
173

173

00:07:35,066  -->  00:07:35,950
Here it is.
174

174

00:07:35,950  -->  00:07:38,429
So here, this save dev option.
175

175

00:07:38,429  -->  00:07:40,788
So this is like an option that we specify.
176

176

00:07:40,788  -->  00:07:44,442
And we said save dev and so it's now installed
177

177

00:07:44,442  -->  00:07:46,613
as a dev dependency.
178

178

00:07:46,613  -->  00:07:50,147
Now there are all kinds of packages on NMP.
179

179

00:07:50,147  -->  00:07:52,438
For example imagine that we wanted to use J query
180

180

00:07:52,438  -->  00:07:53,724
here on this project.
181

181

00:07:53,724  -->  00:07:55,630
We could just come here
182

182

00:07:55,630  -->  00:07:58,130
and write NMP install J query.
183

183

00:08:00,413  -->  00:08:04,050
And now in this case we're not going to put a save dev
184

184

00:08:04,050  -->  00:08:06,009
option in here because J query
185

185

00:08:06,009  -->  00:08:07,890
is not a tool for development.
186

186

00:08:07,890  -->  00:08:10,760
It's a JavaScript file that we want to include
187

187

00:08:10,760  -->  00:08:12,563
in the project.
188

188

00:08:12,563  -->  00:08:13,700
Well not in this project of course,
189

189

00:08:13,700  -->  00:08:16,785
this is just to show you how we could install
190

190

00:08:16,785  -->  00:08:18,628
other NMP packages.
191

191

00:08:18,628  -->  00:08:20,967
And if you just hit return it will also install J query
192

192

00:08:20,967  -->  00:08:24,515
and that's it so let's now take a look.
193

193

00:08:24,515  -->  00:08:26,729
And now you see that it's nowhere to be found here
194

194

00:08:26,729  -->  00:08:27,917
in this file.
195

195

00:08:27,917  -->  00:08:31,075
Now if you wanted it to be here we could also say
196

196

00:08:31,075  -->  00:08:33,136
NMP install J query.
197

197

00:08:33,136  -->  00:08:35,290
So just a trick that I didn't tell you,
198

198

00:08:35,290  -->  00:08:37,454
if you wanna see the commands that you wrote before
199

199

00:08:37,454  -->  00:08:40,059
you can just hit the up arrow on your keyboard
200

200

00:08:40,059  -->  00:08:43,049
and it will show you all the commands that you wrote before.
201

201

00:08:43,049  -->  00:08:45,766
So right now if I move up and it will show me
202

202

00:08:45,766  -->  00:08:48,075
the last command that I run here.
203

203

00:08:48,075  -->  00:08:52,397
So if I type now save instead of save dev.
204

204

00:08:52,397  -->  00:08:54,858
Let me show you what happens then.
205

205

00:08:54,858  -->  00:08:58,500
It then creates here a field for dependencies.
206

206

00:08:58,500  -->  00:09:01,705
Not dev dependencies because dependencies are the ones
207

207

00:09:01,705  -->  00:09:04,418
that we actually need for a project.
208

208

00:09:04,418  -->  00:09:06,273
So in case of J query in our project
209

209

00:09:06,273  -->  00:09:08,152
we want to use the functions that it offers us
210

210

00:09:08,152  -->  00:09:11,236
while in Node SASS it's just a helper,
211

211

00:09:11,236  -->  00:09:15,366
just a tool for us to be able to use SASS in the project.
212

212

00:09:15,366  -->  00:09:17,682
Now maybe you've noticed that there's a new folder
213

213

00:09:17,682  -->  00:09:19,172
in our project right now.
214

214

00:09:19,172  -->  00:09:21,441
It's this Node modules folder.
215

215

00:09:21,441  -->  00:09:24,866
Let's open it up and wow there's a lot of folders in here
216

216

00:09:24,866  -->  00:09:27,987
and they're all because of the packages that we installed.
217

217

00:09:27,987  -->  00:09:29,673
So here we see the Node SASS package
218

218

00:09:29,673  -->  00:09:32,613
and this is the code that actually makes it run
219

219

00:09:32,613  -->  00:09:36,566
but this package here, it needs all of the other packages
220

220

00:09:36,566  -->  00:09:38,282
in order to work just fine.
221

221

00:09:38,282  -->  00:09:39,972
And that's why NMP installed all of these
222

222

00:09:39,972  -->  00:09:41,696
packages here as well.
223

223

00:09:41,696  -->  00:09:44,564
But we shouldn't really worry about this.
224

224

00:09:44,564  -->  00:09:47,909
So it just leave all of this in the Node modules folder
225

225

00:09:47,909  -->  00:09:51,155
and there's no need to ever touch it.
226

226

00:09:51,155  -->  00:09:54,236
Now maybe you're wondering, well why do we need
227

227

00:09:54,236  -->  00:09:55,704
this package json file?
228

228

00:09:55,704  -->  00:09:57,789
Why do we have to worry about writing
229

229

00:09:57,789  -->  00:10:00,302
these dependencies here and these dev dependencies
230

230

00:10:00,302  -->  00:10:01,585
here as well?
231

231

00:10:01,585  -->  00:10:03,058
So imagine that you want to upload your code
232

232

00:10:03,058  -->  00:10:05,076
so that I can take a look at it if someone
233

233

00:10:05,076  -->  00:10:06,180
is not working right.
234

234

00:10:06,180  -->  00:10:07,874
So if you have some kind of bug there.
235

235

00:10:07,874  -->  00:10:10,594
Then you're not going to share this node modules
236

236

00:10:10,594  -->  00:10:12,575
package with me because it probably contains
237

237

00:10:12,575  -->  00:10:14,003
thousands of files.
238

238

00:10:14,003  -->  00:10:15,894
There's really no need to share these with me.
239

239

00:10:15,894  -->  00:10:17,391
So if you wanted to share your project,
240

240

00:10:17,391  -->  00:10:19,419
you will only share everything else,
241

241

00:10:19,419  -->  00:10:20,756
but not the node modules.
242

242

00:10:20,756  -->  00:10:24,994
What you will share though is the package.json file
243

243

00:10:24,994  -->  00:10:26,969
because from that one I can then reproduce,
244

244

00:10:26,969  -->  00:10:30,443
I can recreate this node modules folder.
245

245

00:10:30,443  -->  00:10:32,984
So that's just imagine that we don't have it anymore,
246

246

00:10:32,984  -->  00:10:35,413
we just delete it in fact.
247

247

00:10:35,413  -->  00:10:38,671
So let's delete it, you should delete it as well.
248

248

00:10:38,671  -->  00:10:40,916
So this code is now gone so if you wanted to use J query
249

249

00:10:40,916  -->  00:10:43,586
or Node SASS right now, we couldn't do it anymore
250

250

00:10:43,586  -->  00:10:45,559
because the packages are gone, the code is gone.
251

251

00:10:45,559  -->  00:10:48,948
So imagine that we receive this now, this project
252

252

00:10:48,948  -->  00:10:51,536
and we wanna reinstall these packages.
253

253

00:10:51,536  -->  00:10:55,284
So we can easily do that because the package.json file
254

254

00:10:55,284  -->  00:10:58,664
knows which dependencies, so which packages we used.
255

255

00:10:58,664  -->  00:11:02,247
So all we have to do is to say NMP install.
256

256

00:11:03,956  -->  00:11:07,678
And it will now take a look at our packages.json file
257

257

00:11:07,678  -->  00:11:11,733
and download exactly the packages that we specified there.
258

258

00:11:11,733  -->  00:11:14,665
So you see that now indeed the node modules folder is back
259

259

00:11:14,665  -->  00:11:17,424
and in here we have all of these folders
260

260

00:11:17,424  -->  00:11:20,591
and one of them is of course Node SASS
261

261

00:11:22,189  -->  00:11:26,235
and also J query should be here, yup here exactly.
262

262

00:11:26,235  -->  00:11:29,402
So this one that we have here as well.
263

263

00:11:30,509  -->  00:11:32,676
Now in our project we don't really need J query
264

264

00:11:32,676  -->  00:11:35,815
so we can just uninstall it.
265

265

00:11:35,815  -->  00:11:38,398
So we say NMP uninstall J query
266

266

00:11:41,592  -->  00:11:45,570
and then we have to again specify the save fleck.
267

267

00:11:45,570  -->  00:11:47,794
So the save option so that it removes it also
268

268

00:11:47,794  -->  00:11:50,044
from the package.json file.
269

269

00:11:51,738  -->  00:11:53,311
And it's gone.
270

270

00:11:53,311  -->  00:11:55,284
So you see that it's no longer here.
271

271

00:11:55,284  -->  00:11:57,398
Well this piece of code here stayed here
272

272

00:11:57,398  -->  00:11:59,243
but it doesn't matter, it's not important.
273

273

00:11:59,243  -->  00:12:02,385
You can actually get rid of this right now.
274

274

00:12:02,385  -->  00:12:03,256
Okay.
275

275

00:12:03,256  -->  00:12:06,686
So our only dependency, so our only package that we need
276

276

00:12:06,686  -->  00:12:09,366
for our project is Node SASS.
277

277

00:12:09,366  -->  00:12:11,093
All right and with that we actually have
278

278

00:12:11,093  -->  00:12:14,601
everything we need in order to write and compile SASS
279

279

00:12:14,601  -->  00:12:16,494
in the next lecture.
280

280

00:12:16,494  -->  00:12:19,254
So let's just quickly recap what we did in this lecture.
281

281

00:12:19,254  -->  00:12:23,171
So we started by created our package.json file.
282

282

00:12:24,596  -->  00:12:26,446
So I write clear here.
283

283

00:12:26,446  -->  00:12:29,637
So we started by writing NMP init
284

284

00:12:29,637  -->  00:12:32,075
in order to create the package.json file.
285

285

00:12:32,075  -->  00:12:36,242
Then we installed Node SASS by writing NMP install
286

286

00:12:38,950  -->  00:12:42,688
Node SASS and then we used save dev
287

287

00:12:42,688  -->  00:12:45,406
in order to save it as a development dependency
288

288

00:12:45,406  -->  00:12:48,354
here in our package.json file.
289

289

00:12:48,354  -->  00:12:49,964
Which means that it's a development tool
290

290

00:12:49,964  -->  00:12:53,091
that will just help us building our project.
291

291

00:12:53,091  -->  00:12:55,030
Now the reason we wanted to save this here
292

292

00:12:55,030  -->  00:12:58,509
in the package.json file is because this was we can share
293

293

00:12:58,509  -->  00:13:00,940
our project without sharing the entire
294

294

00:13:00,940  -->  00:13:02,964
Node modules folder here
295

295

00:13:02,964  -->  00:13:04,985
which doesn't make any sense at all.
296

296

00:13:04,985  -->  00:13:06,742
And so if someone else receives our project,
297

297

00:13:06,742  -->  00:13:09,900
they can just do NMP install just like this
298

298

00:13:09,900  -->  00:13:11,505
and then all of the dependencies
299

299

00:13:11,505  -->  00:13:14,024
will be automatically installed.
300

300

00:13:14,024  -->  00:13:15,659
And the same of course applies to yourself.
301

301

00:13:15,659  -->  00:13:18,363
So imagine you are a building this project on one computer
302

302

00:13:18,363  -->  00:13:20,454
and then you're continuing it on the next one.
303

303

00:13:20,454  -->  00:13:22,975
You're also not gonna take the Node modules folder
304

304

00:13:22,975  -->  00:13:24,444
with you to the other computer, no.
305

305

00:13:24,444  -->  00:13:27,382
You just do NMP install and that's it.
306

306

00:13:27,382  -->  00:13:29,914
So this package.json file is really useful
307

307

00:13:29,914  -->  00:13:32,651
in each project where we have NMP modules
308

308

00:13:32,651  -->  00:13:34,578
should really have one.
309

309

00:13:34,578  -->  00:13:37,136
Okay and now with SASS installed on our computer,
310

310

00:13:37,136  -->  00:13:40,007
let's quickly move to the next lecture where we're actually
311

311

00:13:40,007  -->  00:13:44,090
gonna use it to compile our very first SASS code.
