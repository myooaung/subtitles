00:00:01.191  -->  00:00:03.272
<v Instructor>Let's now learn how to span grid items</v>
2

2

00:00:03.272  -->  00:00:05.598
across multiple grid cells
3

3

00:00:05.598  -->  00:00:08.265
in order to occupy entire areas.
4

4

00:00:09.305  -->  00:00:11.912
So suppose you wanted this violet element here
5

5

00:00:11.912  -->  00:00:15.028
not only to occupy this single cell here,
6

6

00:00:15.028  -->  00:00:18.076
but to span across these two cells here,
7

7

00:00:18.076  -->  00:00:20.539
so occupying this entire area.
8

8

00:00:20.539  -->  00:00:23.026
How we're to go about doing that.
9

9

00:00:23.026  -->  00:00:25.323
And actually, it's really not hard.
10

10

00:00:25.323  -->  00:00:26.951
So remember that we learned how
11

11

00:00:26.951  -->  00:00:29.308
to use grid row and grid column.
12

12

00:00:29.308  -->  00:00:30.566
Right?
13

13

00:00:30.566  -->  00:00:34.053
So far we only placed grid items into single cells,
14

14

00:00:34.053  -->  00:00:37.372
and so the end is always the beginning plus one.
15

15

00:00:37.372  -->  00:00:38.205
Right?
16

16

00:00:38.205  -->  00:00:41.073
So two and three in the columns also
17

17

00:00:41.073  -->  00:00:42.657
from two to number three.
18

18

00:00:42.657  -->  00:00:46.227
So only one column and here only one row.
19

19

00:00:46.227  -->  00:00:48.588
But what if we put a higher number here
20

20

00:00:48.588  -->  00:00:50.800
like a number four here?
21

21

00:00:50.800  -->  00:00:52.122
Well, if we did that,
22

22

00:00:52.122  -->  00:00:55.392
then the element would simply occupy more space.
23

23

00:00:55.392  -->  00:00:57.533
So let's actually do that here with the number one,
24

24

00:00:57.533  -->  00:00:59.849
which is this orange here.
25

25

00:00:59.849  -->  00:01:01.613
And so let's say that we wanted to start
26

26

00:01:01.613  -->  00:01:06.163
at column number two and end at column number four.
27

27

00:01:06.163  -->  00:01:08.580
So what happens then is this.
28

28

00:01:10.052  -->  00:01:11.532
So here we go.
29

29

00:01:11.532  -->  00:01:14.531
Now it occupies both of these cells spanning
30

30

00:01:14.531  -->  00:01:18.392
all the way from line number two to line number four.
31

31

00:01:18.392  -->  00:01:21.790
Now what about this grid item that was here before?
32

32

00:01:21.790  -->  00:01:24.184
Well, it simply moved down here,
33

33

00:01:24.184  -->  00:01:26.981
because that's what the CSS grid algorithm does.
34

34

00:01:26.981  -->  00:01:30.250
So if we have more items than we actually define cells here,
35

35

00:01:30.250  -->  00:01:32.049
then CSS grid will automatically
36

36

00:01:32.049  -->  00:01:34.285
add a new row or a new column,
37

37

00:01:34.285  -->  00:01:36.444
but in this case, just a new row.
38

38

00:01:36.444  -->  00:01:40.010
And this part here is then called an implicit grid.
39

39

00:01:40.010  -->  00:01:40.843
Okay?
40

40

00:01:40.843  -->  00:01:42.999
But that's something to talk about later,
41

41

00:01:42.999  -->  00:01:44.315
because I don't wanna confuse you.
42

42

00:01:44.315  -->  00:01:45.148
Okay?
43

43

00:01:45.148  -->  00:01:48.525
So for now just note that if we span these items here,
44

44

00:01:48.525  -->  00:01:51.143
and we end up with more items than we have space,
45

45

00:01:51.143  -->  00:01:53.898
then we will simply be created a new line.
46

46

00:01:53.898  -->  00:01:55.561
Okay?
47

47

00:01:55.561  -->  00:01:59.690
But let's put this back to three as we had it before,
48

48

00:01:59.690  -->  00:02:02.157
and then do this with the violet one
49

49

00:02:02.157  -->  00:02:04.557
as we were saying in the beginning.
50

50

00:02:04.557  -->  00:02:08.224
So, all we have to do is to say grid column.
51

51

00:02:11.263  -->  00:02:13.940
And remember we wanted to go from here
52

52

00:02:13.940  -->  00:02:15.721
spanning these two cells.
53

53

00:02:15.721  -->  00:02:17.638
So very easy one three.
54

54

00:02:19.447  -->  00:02:21.640
And where did it go?
55

55

00:02:21.640  -->  00:02:24.319
Well actually it moved down here.
56

56

00:02:24.319  -->  00:02:26.061
And can you guess why?
57

57

00:02:26.061  -->  00:02:28.972
Well it's because we also placed this element
58

58

00:02:28.972  -->  00:02:31.541
explicitly here in this cell.
59

59

00:02:31.541  -->  00:02:32.458
Right?
60

60

00:02:32.458  -->  00:02:34.736
So the item number one, the orange here,
61

61

00:02:34.736  -->  00:02:36.852
is placed exactly here.
62

62

00:02:36.852  -->  00:02:39.900
And so if we want to put this one here in the same place,
63

63

00:02:39.900  -->  00:02:43.488
then this item here will try to find a new place.
64

64

00:02:43.488  -->  00:02:44.321
Okay?
65

65

00:02:45.398  -->  00:02:49.611
Unless we explicitly tell it to stay in this exact row
66

66

00:02:49.611  -->  00:02:51.592
where we wanted it to be.
67

67

00:02:51.592  -->  00:02:55.342
So let's also say grid row and say two three.
68

68

00:02:58.751  -->  00:03:02.732
And so now, you see that it moved here where it was before.
69

69

00:03:02.732  -->  00:03:05.521
And what happened now to the orange one?
70

70

00:03:05.521  -->  00:03:09.262
Well, it simply got hidden behind this one here.
71

71

00:03:09.262  -->  00:03:11.189
So what this means is that we can actually
72

72

00:03:11.189  -->  00:03:14.962
have multiple grid items in the same cell.
73

73

00:03:14.962  -->  00:03:18.093
So right now we have the orange one here in this cell,
74

74

00:03:18.093  -->  00:03:19.989
so here behind the violet one.
75

75

00:03:19.989  -->  00:03:23.486
And then we have the violet one on top of all of this,
76

76

00:03:23.486  -->  00:03:25.653
occupying these two cells.
77

77

00:03:26.811  -->  00:03:27.644
Okay?
78

78

00:03:27.644  -->  00:03:29.817
And this is something really important to remember.
79

79

00:03:29.817  -->  00:03:30.650
Okay?
80

80

00:03:30.650  -->  00:03:35.361
So we can always have multiple grid items in the same cell.
81

81

00:03:35.361  -->  00:03:37.934
Now if you wanted this orange one here
82

82

00:03:37.934  -->  00:03:40.231
to be on top and to be visible,
83

83

00:03:40.231  -->  00:03:45.048
all we have to do is to set its Z index to some value,
84

84

00:03:45.048  -->  00:03:46.548
like let's say 10.
85

85

00:03:47.477  -->  00:03:49.288
And then you will see it move on top.
86

86

00:03:49.288  -->  00:03:50.632
Okay?
87

87

00:03:50.632  -->  00:03:52.216
So very simple.
88

88

00:03:52.216  -->  00:03:53.870
And this is actually a technique that
89

89

00:03:53.870  -->  00:03:56.177
is used quite a lot with CSS grids,
90

90

00:03:56.177  -->  00:03:58.940
like for image galleries or stuff like that
91

91

00:03:58.940  -->  00:04:01.489
where we can have elements overlying each other
92

92

00:04:01.489  -->  00:04:04.175
to create some great effects like this.
93

93

00:04:04.175  -->  00:04:05.008
Okay?
94

94

00:04:05.008  -->  00:04:08.161
Now of course, we can do the same with rows.
95

95

00:04:08.161  -->  00:04:11.575
So let's come here to element number five.
96

96

00:04:11.575  -->  00:04:15.463
And instead of ending here at row line number two,
97

97

00:04:15.463  -->  00:04:18.681
let's make it end on row line number three,
98

98

00:04:18.681  -->  00:04:19.848
so right here.
99

99

00:04:21.588  -->  00:04:22.497
And alright.
100

100

00:04:22.497  -->  00:04:26.218
So you see here now that it spans these two grid cells here.
101

101

00:04:26.218  -->  00:04:27.855
Right?
102

102

00:04:27.855  -->  00:04:29.923
So that's one way of spanning elements
103

103

00:04:29.923  -->  00:04:31.438
across multiple cells,
104

104

00:04:31.438  -->  00:04:33.791
but there's actually another way.
105

105

00:04:33.791  -->  00:04:37.677
And so let me demonstrate that one to you as well.
106

106

00:04:37.677  -->  00:04:39.733
And I'm gonna do that with this one here,
107

107

00:04:39.733  -->  00:04:40.974
with the green one.
108

108

00:04:40.974  -->  00:04:42.858
So number two.
109

109

00:04:42.858  -->  00:04:45.488
And actually, this is not even positioned at all.
110

110

00:04:45.488  -->  00:04:48.878
So that's perfect to show you how it works.
111

111

00:04:48.878  -->  00:04:52.128
So we can simply say grid column again.
112

112

00:04:54.116  -->  00:04:58.214
And so suppose that we wanted to be from here to here.
113

113

00:04:58.214  -->  00:05:01.890
So we could say of course one and three like we did before,
114

114

00:05:01.890  -->  00:05:04.057
and that would do the job.
115

115

00:05:04.948  -->  00:05:06.938
(mumbles)
116

116

00:05:06.938  -->  00:05:08.850
So it moved down here now again
117

117

00:05:08.850  -->  00:05:10.818
because of the same reason that we had before,
118

118

00:05:10.818  -->  00:05:12.785
because this one here is placed
119

119

00:05:12.785  -->  00:05:15.933
explicitly here at this point.
120

120

00:05:15.933  -->  00:05:16.766
Right?
121

121

00:05:17.631  -->  00:05:20.193
So you see here we placed it right here,
122

122

00:05:20.193  -->  00:05:23.160
and so this element then moved down here.
123

123

00:05:23.160  -->  00:05:23.993
But right now,
124

124

00:05:23.993  -->  00:05:27.503
that's not a problem just to explain it to you.
125

125

00:05:27.503  -->  00:05:29.907
So instead of writing one and three here,
126

126

00:05:29.907  -->  00:05:34.774
we can simply say that we want it to span across two.
127

127

00:05:34.774  -->  00:05:36.931
And that will do the exact same thing.
128

128

00:05:36.931  -->  00:05:38.740
And we can say three, of course.
129

129

00:05:38.740  -->  00:05:40.499
And then what happens is that it's gonna
130

130

00:05:40.499  -->  00:05:42.841
span across three grid cells,
131

131

00:05:42.841  -->  00:05:44.721
so one, two, and three.
132

132

00:05:44.721  -->  00:05:46.222
And that's what this three here means.
133

133

00:05:46.222  -->  00:05:47.055
Okay?
134

134

00:05:48.472  -->  00:05:51.983
Of course, we could also start to see where number two
135

135

00:05:51.983  -->  00:05:55.652
and then span all the way until number two,
136

136

00:05:55.652  -->  00:05:58.164
or actually all across two grid cells.
137

137

00:05:58.164  -->  00:06:02.460
So starting from number two here across two grid cells.
138

138

00:06:02.460  -->  00:06:03.823
Now maybe you noticed before when we
139

139

00:06:03.823  -->  00:06:05.366
had the number three here,
140

140

00:06:05.366  -->  00:06:07.876
you saw what happened.
141

141

00:06:07.876  -->  00:06:10.635
So basically it created a new column here,
142

142

00:06:10.635  -->  00:06:12.686
a column that is completely empty,
143

143

00:06:12.686  -->  00:06:14.968
because we didn't define any width for it,
144

144

00:06:14.968  -->  00:06:18.509
but it still tried to kind of create a new column there.
145

145

00:06:18.509  -->  00:06:20.068
So that's not a good idea.
146

146

00:06:20.068  -->  00:06:22.292
And so if we're not really sure what to put here,
147

147

00:06:22.292  -->  00:06:24.476
there's actually still another way.
148

148

00:06:24.476  -->  00:06:27.559
So number two here is what we wanted.
149

149

00:06:28.511  -->  00:06:30.644
So to span across two,
150

150

00:06:30.644  -->  00:06:34.394
but let's actually do it even in another way.
151

151

00:06:36.855  -->  00:06:40.188
So grid column starting from number two.
152

152

00:06:41.470  -->  00:06:43.239
Now let's pretend that we don't remember
153

153

00:06:43.239  -->  00:06:45.050
how many columns we have.
154

154

00:06:45.050  -->  00:06:48.033
All we know is that we want it to be all until the end.
155

155

00:06:48.033  -->  00:06:49.928
And in order to represent the end,
156

156

00:06:49.928  -->  00:06:53.489
all we have to do is to say minus one.
157

157

00:06:53.489  -->  00:06:55.978
Okay, and that's it.
158

158

00:06:55.978  -->  00:06:58.165
Now it goes from column line number two
159

159

00:06:58.165  -->  00:06:59.555
all the way until the end.
160

160

00:06:59.555  -->  00:07:03.472
And that's what this minus one here represents.
161

161

00:07:04.919  -->  00:07:06.075
Okay?
162

162

00:07:06.075  -->  00:07:07.571
So instead of hard coding here
163

163

00:07:07.571  -->  00:07:09.844
how many cells we want to occupy,
164

164

00:07:09.844  -->  00:07:11.128
we simply put minus one
165

165

00:07:11.128  -->  00:07:13.429
and then goes all the way until the end.
166

166

00:07:13.429  -->  00:07:18.004
Because suppose that we wanted to start it in number one.
167

167

00:07:18.004  -->  00:07:21.309
And if we had span two here before.
168

168

00:07:21.309  -->  00:07:25.949
So if we had this, then now we have to change it to three.
169

169

00:07:25.949  -->  00:07:27.286
Right?
170

170

00:07:27.286  -->  00:07:28.634
And if we changed our mind again
171

171

00:07:28.634  -->  00:07:31.967
and wanted to be from two until the end,
172

172

00:07:32.941  -->  00:07:35.116
then we would have to change both again.
173

173

00:07:35.116  -->  00:07:37.120
But with minus one, that doesn't happen.
174

174

00:07:37.120  -->  00:07:38.068
Okay?
175

175

00:07:38.068  -->  00:07:40.755
So no matter what we put here,
176

176

00:07:40.755  -->  00:07:43.583
we can put one and it goes until the end.
177

177

00:07:43.583  -->  00:07:46.981
We can put two and it goes all the way until the end,
178

178

00:07:46.981  -->  00:07:48.830
and even three.
179

179

00:07:48.830  -->  00:07:50.458
So from three to four here.
180

180

00:07:50.458  -->  00:07:51.360
Right?
181

181

00:07:51.360  -->  00:07:55.103
So that is another very handy trick here with the minus one.
182

182

00:07:55.103  -->  00:07:56.518
Okay?
183

183

00:07:56.518  -->  00:08:00.467
So spanning, we used basically three different ways.
184

184

00:08:00.467  -->  00:08:03.393
First, we simply defined the end number
185

185

00:08:03.393  -->  00:08:06.047
of the row or the column line.
186

186

00:08:06.047  -->  00:08:09.128
Then as a second way, we used the span keyword,
187

187

00:08:09.128  -->  00:08:11.045
which is actually better.
188

188

00:08:11.045  -->  00:08:12.991
And then finally as a third method,
189

189

00:08:12.991  -->  00:08:14.678
whenever we want to span all the way
190

190

00:08:14.678  -->  00:08:16.715
until the end of our grid,
191

191

00:08:16.715  -->  00:08:18.636
we can simply use minus one.
192

192

00:08:18.636  -->  00:08:19.469
And of course,
193

193

00:08:19.469  -->  00:08:21.525
this not only works for columns but also for rows.
194

194

00:08:21.525  -->  00:08:22.502
Alright?
195

195

00:08:22.502  -->  00:08:26.502
Now right now here, this looks like a huge mess.
196

196

00:08:27.396  -->  00:08:28.746
But don't worry about that.
197

197

00:08:28.746  -->  00:08:29.579
Okay?
198

198

00:08:29.579  -->  00:08:32.546
All I wanted to do here is to simply show you
199

199

00:08:32.546  -->  00:08:35.809
is how we can span or grid items across multiple cells
200

200

00:08:35.809  -->  00:08:39.185
in order to occupy entire areas like this.
201

201

00:08:39.185  -->  00:08:40.018
Okay?
202

202

00:08:40.018  -->  00:08:42.139
And I hope that came across to you
203

203

00:08:42.139  -->  00:08:44.938
so that you really understood how all of this works,
204

204

00:08:44.938  -->  00:08:48.060
the different tools that we have at our disposal.
205

205

00:08:48.060  -->  00:08:50.744
So like using grid row start, row end,
206

206

00:08:50.744  -->  00:08:53.077
column start, or column end,
207

207

00:08:54.005  -->  00:08:55.873
or by using grid row and the grid column,
208

208

00:08:55.873  -->  00:08:58.557
or even by using a grid area,
209

209

00:08:58.557  -->  00:09:00.641
like we have somewhere down here.
210

210

00:09:00.641  -->  00:09:02.287
Yeah, so here.
211

211

00:09:02.287  -->  00:09:04.321
So that's all that matters here in this lecture,
212

212

00:09:04.321  -->  00:09:05.854
that you really understood how we
213

213

00:09:05.854  -->  00:09:08.999
use all of these properties to come up with the layouts
214

214

00:09:08.999  -->  00:09:10.559
and the designs that we want.
215

215

00:09:10.559  -->  00:09:11.707
Okay?
216

216

00:09:11.707  -->  00:09:13.636
So don't worry about how it looks.
217

217

00:09:13.636  -->  00:09:15.950
Just worry about what you just learned
218

218

00:09:15.950  -->  00:09:17.585
hopefully in this lecture.
219

219

00:09:17.585  -->  00:09:19.294
So again, I really encourage you to play around
220

220

00:09:19.294  -->  00:09:21.605
with all of these properties that I just showed you,
221

221

00:09:21.605  -->  00:09:25.498
maybe build your own small grid and some more items in it,
222

222

00:09:25.498  -->  00:09:28.497
and try to come up with some creative ways of using spanning
223

223

00:09:28.497  -->  00:09:31.513
like I just showed you here in this video.
224

224

00:09:31.513  -->  00:09:34.228
Okay, and that's it actually for this example.
225

225

00:09:34.228  -->  00:09:36.121
These were the very basics,
226

226

00:09:36.121  -->  00:09:37.663
but of course once more,
227

227

00:09:37.663  -->  00:09:39.603
there's a lot more to learn.
228

228

00:09:39.603  -->  00:09:42.232
And so we will continue with this intersection
229

229

00:09:42.232  -->  00:09:43.732
in the next video.
