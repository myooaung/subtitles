00:00:00.949  -->  00:00:03.591
<v Jonas>Hi there, this video is about building</v>
2

2

00:00:03.591  -->  00:00:07.598
the realtors section, which is the last part of our project.
3

3

00:00:07.598  -->  00:00:10.115
And so, once more, in this video,
4

4

00:00:10.115  -->  00:00:12.225
we are going to apply what we already learned
5

5

00:00:12.225  -->  00:00:14.476
in all the previous lectures.
6

6

00:00:14.476  -->  00:00:16.854
And so this video will actually gonna be
7

7

00:00:16.854  -->  00:00:19.048
pretty straightforward, so all we have to do
8

8

00:00:19.048  -->  00:00:22.621
is to put these items here on a grid,
9

9

00:00:22.621  -->  00:00:26.085
and then, of course, add this small title here.
10

10

00:00:26.085  -->  00:00:27.726
That'll be pretty simple, right?
11

11

00:00:27.726  -->  00:00:30.643
So we will lay out these items here
12

12

00:00:31.628  -->  00:00:34.690
in a two-by-three grid, okay?
13

13

00:00:34.690  -->  00:00:37.804
So each line for each of these realtors.
14

14

00:00:37.804  -->  00:00:41.388
Now, the difference between this section and this one here
15

15

00:00:41.388  -->  00:00:44.554
is that here, in the header, we actually declared
16

16

00:00:44.554  -->  00:00:47.539
the entire header element as the grid container,
17

17

00:00:47.539  -->  00:00:50.191
while here, in this section, we'll have the grid
18

18

00:00:50.191  -->  00:00:52.871
inside of this container as a child element,
19

19

00:00:52.871  -->  00:00:55.175
and that's because we don't want this here
20

20

00:00:55.175  -->  00:00:57.476
as being a part of the grid.
21

21

00:00:57.476  -->  00:01:01.643
Okay, so let's move on here to our realtors element.
22

22

00:01:03.849  -->  00:01:06.182
So we start with our h3 with
23

23

00:01:08.879  -->  00:01:12.379
the heading-3 class, and "Top 3 Realtors."
24

24

00:01:14.701  -->  00:01:18.624
So that's the first part, and then we have that element,
25

25

00:01:18.624  -->  00:01:20.824
which will be our grid container,
26

26

00:01:20.824  -->  00:01:24.991
and where we're gonna have these two columns and three rows.
27

27

00:01:26.650  -->  00:01:29.202
So I'm calling this one the realtors__list,
28

28

00:01:29.202  -->  00:01:33.369
and in here let's put an image, so img.realtors__image.
29

29

00:01:45.078  -->  00:01:48.620
All right, so pretty straightforward.
30

30

00:01:48.620  -->  00:01:52.537
Next up, we have a div element in which we have
31

31

00:01:53.659  -->  00:01:56.703
the name and also the number of houses sold.
32

32

00:01:56.703  -->  00:02:00.161
Okay, so this here is one grid item,
33

33

00:02:00.161  -->  00:02:03.425
and the other grid item will be all of this here,
34

34

00:02:03.425  -->  00:02:05.749
so this element containing these two.
35

35

00:02:05.749  -->  00:02:08.138
And then the next grid item will be this, and then this one,
36

36

00:02:08.138  -->  00:02:10.928
and then this image, and then this container.
37

37

00:02:10.928  -->  00:02:14.928
Okay, so this is a div called realtors__details.
38

38

00:02:19.452  -->  00:02:22.952
And for the name, we use our h4.heading-4,
39

39

00:02:24.656  -->  00:02:28.904
and remember that we created a light class here, right,
40

40

00:02:28.904  -->  00:02:30.993
so if we're using white text color.
41

41

00:02:30.993  -->  00:02:34.910
And so let's do that as well, heading-4--light.
42

42

00:02:37.864  -->  00:02:42.031
So, Erik Feiman, and a paragraph for the number of houses.
43

43

00:02:49.238  -->  00:02:50.821
So 245 houses sold.
44

44

00:02:55.157  -->  00:02:58.792
Okay, now just copy this two times,
45

45

00:02:58.792  -->  00:03:01.209
number two, and number three.
46

46

00:03:04.642  -->  00:03:07.142
This lady is called Kim Brown,
47

47

00:03:09.768  -->  00:03:13.518
and she sold 212, and then the last gentleman
48

48

00:03:14.935  -->  00:03:18.602
is called Toby Ramsey, with 198 houses sold.
49

49

00:03:27.103  -->  00:03:28.977
Okay, and that's it.
50

50

00:03:28.977  -->  00:03:31.836
That's actually all the markup that we need.
51

51

00:03:31.836  -->  00:03:34.419
So let's open up this file now,
52

52

00:03:36.231  -->  00:03:39.000
and as always, add our selectors.
53

53

00:03:39.000  -->  00:03:43.167
So we have the list, of course the image, and the sold.
54

54

00:03:49.116  -->  00:03:53.529
So let's take a look at that now, and yeah,
55

55

00:03:53.529  -->  00:03:55.703
of course, as always, these huge images
56

56

00:03:55.703  -->  00:03:58.226
look just crazy as always.
57

57

00:03:58.226  -->  00:04:02.393
So let's start by changing this, so width: 100%.
58

58

00:04:06.697  -->  00:04:11.269
Also, we want them to be round, so border-radius: 50%.
59

59

00:04:11.269  -->  00:04:14.330
And it's always best to display images
60

60

00:04:14.330  -->  00:04:16.362
as a block, as we already know.
61

61

00:04:16.362  -->  00:04:19.195
So let's check that out, and yeah,
62

62

00:04:20.898  -->  00:04:24.661
so it's still really huge because we defined 100%.
63

63

00:04:24.661  -->  00:04:28.831
And actually, let's put something else here.
64

64

00:04:28.831  -->  00:04:32.414
So let's put 7 rem, so basically 70 pixels.
65

65

00:04:34.969  -->  00:04:37.832
And yeah, now that looks much better.
66

66

00:04:37.832  -->  00:04:39.974
Okay, and so now all we have to do
67

67

00:04:39.974  -->  00:04:42.529
is to put these in our grid.
68

68

00:04:42.529  -->  00:04:45.612
And this time, the grid is this list.
69

69

00:04:48.648  -->  00:04:52.815
So display: grid, and then let's define our columns.
70

70

00:04:58.741  -->  00:05:00.868
So the first column is for the images,
71

71

00:05:00.868  -->  00:05:03.099
and the second column is for the text.
72

72

00:05:03.099  -->  00:05:04.953
And so the image, we already know, is 7 rem,
73

73

00:05:04.953  -->  00:05:06.824
and so all we have to do here
74

74

00:05:06.824  -->  00:05:09.657
is to set it to min-content, okay,
75

75

00:05:11.068  -->  00:05:13.898
so that it fits the image nicely,
76

76

00:05:13.898  -->  00:05:17.457
and then, as for the text, let's use max-content,
77

77

00:05:17.457  -->  00:05:21.595
so that doesn't create any line breaks in our text.
78

78

00:05:21.595  -->  00:05:26.276
Check that out, and all right, it's side by side
79

79

00:05:26.276  -->  00:05:28.183
and laid out in this grid now.
80

80

00:05:28.183  -->  00:05:31.600
Let's take a look at that, and all right,
81

81

00:05:35.023  -->  00:05:37.505
so you see, it's actually a grid.
82

82

00:05:37.505  -->  00:05:40.366
Now all we need to do is to define some spacing here,
83

83

00:05:40.366  -->  00:05:44.533
so let's add a spacing to the columns and to the rows.
84

84

00:05:49.098  -->  00:05:51.600
So the columns, let's add 20 pixels,
85

85

00:05:51.600  -->  00:05:53.767
and now, between the rows,
86

86

00:05:56.321  -->  00:05:58.339
let's add something different here.
87

87

00:05:58.339  -->  00:06:00.627
This time, we're going to use the vh unit again.
88

88

00:06:00.627  -->  00:06:04.794
So I'm going with 5 vh, so 5% of the viewport height.
89

89

00:06:05.972  -->  00:06:07.377
And why did I do it this way?
90

90

00:06:07.377  -->  00:06:10.695
Well, of course, because I wanted this margin, this spacing,
91

91

00:06:10.695  -->  00:06:14.900
to change whenever we change the height of the viewport.
92

92

00:06:14.900  -->  00:06:17.220
And that's because, on a really large screen,
93

93

00:06:17.220  -->  00:06:20.204
this starts to look really ridiculous.
94

94

00:06:20.204  -->  00:06:23.683
So on a very large screen with a huge viewport height,
95

95

00:06:23.683  -->  00:06:25.678
we would have this very small component
96

96

00:06:25.678  -->  00:06:29.299
sitting here in the middle with a lot of space around it,
97

97

00:06:29.299  -->  00:06:31.566
and that looks kind of weird, and so I decided
98

98

00:06:31.566  -->  00:06:34.246
to go with the viewport height unit.
99

99

00:06:34.246  -->  00:06:36.859
And so you see, as we change this,
100

100

00:06:36.859  -->  00:06:40.960
we also decrease the spacing between the rows.
101

101

00:06:40.960  -->  00:06:45.212
Okay, now as for this text, let's format this one here
102

102

00:06:45.212  -->  00:06:47.545
and move it up a little bit.
103

103

00:06:49.396  -->  00:06:53.563
So it's this sold text here, and I want it in uppercase,
104

104

00:06:57.595  -->  00:07:00.678
the color should be the grey-light-2,
105

105

00:07:01.710  -->  00:07:04.319
so let's get that from here.
106

106

00:07:04.319  -->  00:07:06.902
It's actually already selected.
107

107

00:07:09.254  -->  00:07:12.846
And let's move up a little bit, so just three pixels.
108

108

00:07:12.846  -->  00:07:15.192
So a negative margin to the top
109

109

00:07:15.192  -->  00:07:16.862
does the job quite well here.
110

110

00:07:16.862  -->  00:07:18.060
We could have used a transform,
111

111

00:07:18.060  -->  00:07:20.146
but this here works just as well.
112

112

00:07:20.146  -->  00:07:23.422
Okay, so that looks nice, and now all we have to do
113

113

00:07:23.422  -->  00:07:25.864
is to vertically center this here in the middle.
114

114

00:07:25.864  -->  00:07:30.031
Okay, and we can actually do that here on the container,
115

115

00:07:31.283  -->  00:07:33.522
and of course, that's this one,
116

116

00:07:33.522  -->  00:07:36.689
so let's here say align-items: center.
117

117

00:07:38.278  -->  00:07:42.945
So centering the items inside the cells vertically.
118

118

00:07:42.945  -->  00:07:45.703
And, all right, that's it.
119

119

00:07:45.703  -->  00:07:49.351
Let's just give this entire realtors component here
120

120

00:07:49.351  -->  00:07:51.934
a padding, so padding of 3 rem,
121

121

00:07:54.844  -->  00:07:59.096
and yeah, okay, and now all that's left to do
122

122

00:07:59.096  -->  00:08:01.652
is to actually center all of this here
123

123

00:08:01.652  -->  00:08:05.003
in this parent element, both horizontally and vertically.
124

124

00:08:05.003  -->  00:08:07.403
So let's think about how we can do that.
125

125

00:08:07.403  -->  00:08:09.105
The first option that comes to mind
126

126

00:08:09.105  -->  00:08:12.212
is to use Flexbox, because we've done that a lot of times,
127

127

00:08:12.212  -->  00:08:14.711
but again, I'm going to use Grid here.
128

128

00:08:14.711  -->  00:08:17.596
So since this is a grid project,
129

129

00:08:17.596  -->  00:08:21.208
let's then actually use CSS Grid in order to center it.
130

130

00:08:21.208  -->  00:08:24.575
And that's really easy, right, all we have to do
131

131

00:08:24.575  -->  00:08:27.201
is to say that this element here should be
132

132

00:08:27.201  -->  00:08:29.274
a grid container, and then align the tracks
133

133

00:08:29.274  -->  00:08:33.803
to the center both horizontally and vertically.
134

134

00:08:33.803  -->  00:08:37.136
So display: grid; align-content: center;
135

135

00:08:40.810  -->  00:08:44.393
and justify-content: center; and that's it.
136

136

00:08:45.804  -->  00:08:50.111
So, just like that, we centered all of this.
137

137

00:08:50.111  -->  00:08:54.220
So let's check out that grid, and so you see,
138

138

00:08:54.220  -->  00:08:57.178
we have a grid with one column and with two rows,
139

139

00:08:57.178  -->  00:08:59.217
because we have these two elements,
140

140

00:08:59.217  -->  00:09:01.377
so this heading and this part.
141

141

00:09:01.377  -->  00:09:04.270
Now we just need some space here after this "realtors,"
142

142

00:09:04.270  -->  00:09:08.786
and we also need to center it here inside of the grid, okay?
143

143

00:09:08.786  -->  00:09:10.514
So how can we do that?
144

144

00:09:10.514  -->  00:09:12.162
Well, we could just add some spacing
145

145

00:09:12.162  -->  00:09:14.954
directly to this element, so this h3 element,
146

146

00:09:14.954  -->  00:09:16.769
but for that, we would have to use
147

147

00:09:16.769  -->  00:09:18.600
the helper classes that I created earlier.
148

148

00:09:18.600  -->  00:09:20.265
But instead, what we can do is to just
149

149

00:09:20.265  -->  00:09:23.374
define a gap between the rows of the small grid,
150

150

00:09:23.374  -->  00:09:25.183
and then that is going to create
151

151

00:09:25.183  -->  00:09:28.350
the spacing that we want just as fine.
152

152

00:09:29.419  -->  00:09:32.169
So grid-row-gap, let's say 2 rem.
153

153

00:09:36.272  -->  00:09:38.567
And there's our spacing.
154

154

00:09:38.567  -->  00:09:40.952
And now, if we say justify-items set to center,
155

155

00:09:40.952  -->  00:09:43.245
then that will center this element.
156

156

00:09:43.245  -->  00:09:47.078
So let's put that here, justify-items: center.
157

157

00:09:50.242  -->  00:09:52.409
Okay, and yeah, that's it.
158

158

00:09:53.404  -->  00:09:55.515
Now, why did this last property only affect
159

159

00:09:55.515  -->  00:09:58.715
the title and did nothing with this part here?
160

160

00:09:58.715  -->  00:10:00.009
So, it didn't do anything here
161

161

00:10:00.009  -->  00:10:03.027
because this content here is actually what defines
162

162

00:10:03.027  -->  00:10:05.985
the width of the grid, and so centering this here
163

163

00:10:05.985  -->  00:10:09.161
does nothing because this grid cell
164

164

00:10:09.161  -->  00:10:11.642
is already the size of the entire track,
165

165

00:10:11.642  -->  00:10:13.809
and the entire grid container.
166

166

00:10:13.809  -->  00:10:17.976
And so centering does nothing to it here in this case.
167

167

00:10:19.704  -->  00:10:21.627
Okay, and that's it.
168

168

00:10:21.627  -->  00:10:25.606
So, nicely centered also as we decrease.
169

169

00:10:25.606  -->  00:10:27.496
Now, we actually have some issues here
170

170

00:10:27.496  -->  00:10:30.970
in this header part, but we're going to fix that
171

171

00:10:30.970  -->  00:10:33.692
together with all of the other things
172

172

00:10:33.692  -->  00:10:37.075
that are not working 100% for the responsive layout
173

173

00:10:37.075  -->  00:10:39.207
right in the next two lectures.
174

174

00:10:39.207  -->  00:10:43.323
So now that we have our page completely designed,
175

175

00:10:43.323  -->  00:10:46.931
okay, so we're really ready with all of this,
176

176

00:10:46.931  -->  00:10:48.615
and this is great progress.
177

177

00:10:48.615  -->  00:10:52.814
So we used a ton of grids here to build all of this,
178

178

00:10:52.814  -->  00:10:55.606
but if you want to make this truly responsive,
179

179

00:10:55.606  -->  00:10:58.549
then we have to add a couple of media queries still.
180

180

00:10:58.549  -->  00:11:02.098
So some of the parts are already responsive like this,
181

181

00:11:02.098  -->  00:11:06.537
but not everything is possible to do without media queries.
182

182

00:11:06.537  -->  00:11:08.148
And so, in the next two videos,
183

183

00:11:08.148  -->  00:11:10.593
we are going to write some media queries
184

184

00:11:10.593  -->  00:11:13.014
to make this page truly responsive.
185

185

00:11:13.014  -->  00:11:16.681
Okay, so stay tuned and see you in a minute.
