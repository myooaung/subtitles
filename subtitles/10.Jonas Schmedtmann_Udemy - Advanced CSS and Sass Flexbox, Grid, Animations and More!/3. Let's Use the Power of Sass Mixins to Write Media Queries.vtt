00:00:00.725  -->  00:00:03.486
<v Jonas>With our responsive breakpoints now defined,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.486  -->  00:00:06.508
let's start to implement them in media queries
3

3

00:00:06.508  -->  00:00:08.818
in our Sass code so that we can start
4

4

00:00:08.818  -->  00:00:10.953
making the page responsive.
5

5

00:00:10.953  -->  00:00:13.976
In this lecture, you're gonna learn how to use
6

6

00:00:13.976  -->  00:00:16.961
a powerful Sass mixing to write all our media queries
7

7

00:00:16.961  -->  00:00:20.040
with one single mixing, and in order to do that,
8

8

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:24.202
you'll learn how to use the content and if Sass directives.
9

9

00:00:24.202  -->  00:00:26.938
And finally, we're gonna take advantage
10

10

00:00:26.938  -->  00:00:29.626
of the Chrome DevTools to check out our media queries
11

11

00:00:29.626  -->  00:00:32.284
and responsive designs as we code.
12

12

00:00:32.284  -->  00:00:35.085
The traditional way that many people,
13

13

00:00:35.085  -->  00:00:37.166
and especially beginners I think,
14

14

00:00:37.166  -->  00:00:40.398
use the right media queries was to simply create another
15

15

00:00:40.398  -->  00:00:44.102
CSS file, and then in there, simply write a big media query.
16

16

00:00:44.102  -->  00:00:47.602
Something like this, media then max-width,
17

17

00:00:50.789  -->  00:00:53.789
600 pixels, for example, and then in here,
18

18

00:00:53.789  -->  00:00:57.456
we would write our styles like html and body
19

19

00:01:01.127  -->  00:01:05.189
and then all of these other components that we have here.
20

20

00:01:05.189  -->  00:01:07.264
All of these, for example, we would then copy them
21

21

00:01:07.264  -->  00:01:10.535
and put them here in our huge media query
22

22

00:01:10.535  -->  00:01:14.603
and we would have one media query per breakpoint basically.
23

23

00:01:14.603  -->  00:01:16.838
But what if there is a better way?
24

24

00:01:16.838  -->  00:01:18.937
What if we could simply add the media query
25

25

00:01:18.937  -->  00:01:20.848
into each of our selector?
26

26

00:01:20.848  -->  00:01:23.882
It would make our life a lot easier, right?
27

27

00:01:23.882  -->  00:01:25.675
For example, imagine that we want
28

28

00:01:25.675  -->  00:01:28.062
to make our story responsive.
29

29

00:01:28.062  -->  00:01:31.401
Imagine we want to make this one responsive.
30

30

00:01:31.401  -->  00:01:33.722
It would be really useful to simply add a media query,
31

31

00:01:33.722  -->  00:01:37.792
for example, in here, and then do it that way, right?
32

32

00:01:37.792  -->  00:01:41.959
For example, media query and then max-width 600, like this,
33

33

00:01:45.581  -->  00:01:48.721
and with Sass, we can actually do it this way.
34

34

00:01:48.721  -->  00:01:51.783
If you would now go ahead and write something in here,
35

35

00:01:51.783  -->  00:01:55.055
for example, with 50% or something like that,
36

36

00:01:55.055  -->  00:01:57.189
and this is just a test, okay?
37

37

00:01:57.189  -->  00:02:00.259
I'm just testing and showing you stuff for now.
38

38

00:02:00.259  -->  00:02:02.134
If you would write it like this
39

39

00:02:02.134  -->  00:02:04.590
and then open our compiled file here,
40

40

00:02:04.590  -->  00:02:08.075
which I think we haven't ever opened up until this point.
41

41

00:02:08.075  -->  00:02:10.544
This is our compiled CSS file.
42

42

00:02:10.544  -->  00:02:14.729
All of the CSS that we wrote in the last section is in here.
43

43

00:02:14.729  -->  00:02:18.478
So, you wrote an impressive, let's take a look.
44

44

00:02:18.478  -->  00:02:22.645
Well, all of the CSS code, so you wrote an impressive
45

45

00:02:23.855  -->  00:02:27.022
765 lines of this compressed CSS code.
46

46

00:02:28.630  -->  00:02:30.280
This is really a lot.
47

47

00:02:30.280  -->  00:02:33.202
But what I was actually looking for here
48

48

00:02:33.202  -->  00:02:36.191
was the code about the story, so let's take a look.
49

49

00:02:36.191  -->  00:02:37.297
Ah, here it is.
50

50

00:02:37.297  -->  00:02:39.905
Here's the code that I just wrote.
51

51

00:02:39.905  -->  00:02:42.629
This is similar to what I showed you
52

52

00:02:42.629  -->  00:02:45.106
in the beginning to this one here,
53

53

00:02:45.106  -->  00:02:48.692
where we have a media query and then in there our selector
54

54

00:02:48.692  -->  00:02:51.085
and then the declaration block.
55

55

00:02:51.085  -->  00:02:53.901
But of course, this here is much simpler
56

56

00:02:53.901  -->  00:02:56.153
because we're not repeating the selector.
57

57

00:02:56.153  -->  00:02:59.431
We just say that at this max-width here, for example,
58

58

00:02:59.431  -->  00:03:01.854
we want the width to change to 50%
59

59

00:03:01.854  -->  00:03:04.687
and so that makes it a lot easier.
60

60

00:03:06.663  -->  00:03:08.471
But again, I'm going to delete this now
61

61

00:03:08.471  -->  00:03:11.526
because this was just for testing purposes.
62

62

00:03:11.526  -->  00:03:13.738
So, to show you a better way,
63

63

00:03:13.738  -->  00:03:16.914
here we could actually do something similar,
64

64

00:03:16.914  -->  00:03:18.581
something like this.
65

65

00:03:20.173  -->  00:03:22.035
Now, instead of repeating the selector here,
66

66

00:03:22.035  -->  00:03:25.325
we could simply go ahead and write font-size,
67

67

00:03:25.325  -->  00:03:27.573
50% or something, okay?
68

68

00:03:27.573  -->  00:03:30.560
That will make our life a lot easier.
69

69

00:03:30.560  -->  00:03:33.782
Then go ahead, write the next one in here.
70

70

00:03:33.782  -->  00:03:35.985
In the end, we would end up with a lot
71

71

00:03:35.985  -->  00:03:39.223
of media queries like this, and that's not a problem at all.
72

72

00:03:39.223  -->  00:03:42.140
Having hundreds of these small media queries
73

73

00:03:42.140  -->  00:03:44.853
or one big one is not really a problem, okay?
74

74

00:03:44.853  -->  00:03:47.341
So, don't worry about that one.
75

75

00:03:47.341  -->  00:03:50.385
If you think about it, imagine you would have to write
76

76

00:03:50.385  -->  00:03:54.277
this here, all of this code here, in all of your selectors,
77

77

00:03:54.277  -->  00:03:56.998
in all of these files, in all of the elements
78

78

00:03:56.998  -->  00:03:59.150
that you selected and you want to change,
79

79

00:03:59.150  -->  00:04:01.791
you would always have to write this media query.
80

80

00:04:01.791  -->  00:04:03.463
That would be a lot of work.
81

81

00:04:03.463  -->  00:04:05.773
Even worse, imagine that someday you would decide
82

82

00:04:05.773  -->  00:04:09.771
to just change your breakpoints, then you would have
83

83

00:04:09.771  -->  00:04:12.350
to go back and change all of these numbers.
84

84

00:04:12.350  -->  00:04:15.875
So, there is an even better way than this.
85

85

00:04:15.875  -->  00:04:18.760
What we're going to do is to write a mixing,
86

86

00:04:18.760  -->  00:04:21.728
and basically the mixing will do this part here for us.
87

87

00:04:21.728  -->  00:04:24.450
So, we'll write a mixing, and that mixing will then paste,
88

88

00:04:24.450  -->  00:04:27.783
basically, will insert this code for us.
89

89

00:04:29.729  -->  00:04:31.134
Let's try to do that,
90

90

00:04:31.134  -->  00:04:34.998
because that will be the best solution of all.
91

91

00:04:34.998  -->  00:04:36.703
So, our mixings file.
92

92

00:04:36.703  -->  00:04:38.832
This is the clear fix and absolute centering
93

93

00:04:38.832  -->  00:04:42.812
that we already have, and we're now going to add
94

94

00:04:42.812  -->  00:04:45.895
something like a media query manager.
95

95

00:04:49.258  -->  00:04:51.683
That's how I like to call it.
96

96

00:04:51.683  -->  00:04:55.333
Just to recap our last lecture, let's write,
97

97

00:04:55.333  -->  00:04:58.035
actually, our breakpoint in here,
98

98

00:04:58.035  -->  00:05:00.618
so, opening some comments here.
99

99

00:05:03.069  -->  00:05:06.385
The range, as we just defined in the last lecture,
100

100

00:05:06.385  -->  00:05:10.218
were from zero to 600 pixel, we had the phone.
101

101

00:05:12.730  -->  00:05:16.897
Then, from 600 to 900, we had the tablet in portrait mode.
102

102

00:05:26.249  -->  00:05:29.320
And this is just so we don't forget it, okay?
103

103

00:05:29.320  -->  00:05:33.403
From 900 to 1200, we had our tablet in landscape.
104

104

00:05:37.618  -->  00:05:38.851
Align this all nicely.
105

105

00:05:38.851  -->  00:05:41.684
And then, from 1800 up, 1800 plus,
106

106

00:05:47.616  -->  00:05:51.699
we had something for big screens, so big desktop.
107

107

00:05:56.276  -->  00:05:59.041
Basically, everything that's in between here,
108

108

00:05:59.041  -->  00:06:03.208
from 1200 going to 1800, is where our normal styles apply.
109

109

00:06:10.554  -->  00:06:13.854
Remember that this is basically a desktop first approach,
110

110

00:06:13.854  -->  00:06:16.571
where our normal styles that we have written so far,
111

111

00:06:16.571  -->  00:06:19.749
outside of the media queries, are for the desktop.
112

112

00:06:19.749  -->  00:06:22.004
Basically, these are the styles that apply
113

113

00:06:22.004  -->  00:06:24.730
to this 1200 to 1800 pixel range.
114

114

00:06:24.730  -->  00:06:28.330
We're then going to write max-width media queries
115

115

00:06:28.330  -->  00:06:30.658
for these three ranges here,
116

116

00:06:30.658  -->  00:06:33.469
and the min-width media query for this range.
117

117

00:06:33.469  -->  00:06:35.873
You will see how in a second.
118

118

00:06:35.873  -->  00:06:38.040
Let's then write a mixing.
119

119

00:06:40.961  -->  00:06:42.986
I'm gonna call it respond,
120

120

00:06:42.986  -->  00:06:46.236
and let's say I want one for the phone.
121

121

00:06:48.729  -->  00:06:49.953
Then, what I'm going to do is
122

122

00:06:49.953  -->  00:06:52.925
to simply write the media query in here,
123

123

00:06:52.925  -->  00:06:54.925
so max-width 600 pixels,
124

124

00:06:58.864  -->  00:07:02.851
and then in here should go, of course, the content.
125

125

00:07:02.851  -->  00:07:05.293
Now, how do we actually do that?
126

126

00:07:05.293  -->  00:07:09.084
How do we know that, for example, that the code that
127

127

00:07:09.084  -->  00:07:13.189
we write here, so let's go back to what we had before.
128

128

00:07:13.189  -->  00:07:16.377
How do we actually parse this font-size,
129

129

00:07:16.377  -->  00:07:18.405
50%, into the mixing?
130

130

00:07:18.405  -->  00:07:22.572
Well, there's something called the content directive.
131

131

00:07:25.203  -->  00:07:26.721
So, it's this one.
132

132

00:07:26.721  -->  00:07:28.076
So, the content.
133

133

00:07:28.076  -->  00:07:30.389
This basically allows us to parse
134

134

00:07:30.389  -->  00:07:32.813
a block of code into a mixing.
135

135

00:07:32.813  -->  00:07:36.313
We can now use that mixing, respond phone.
136

136

00:07:41.199  -->  00:07:43.699
In here, we want respond-phone
137

137

00:07:48.997  -->  00:07:51.747
and then a font-size of 50%.
138

138

00:07:54.388  -->  00:07:56.649
This here is basically the content
139

139

00:07:56.649  -->  00:07:58.887
that I parsed into the mixing.
140

140

00:07:58.887  -->  00:08:01.887
Here, of course, I need the include.
141

141

00:08:05.819  -->  00:08:08.559
Remember that when we first talked about mixings,
142

142

00:08:08.559  -->  00:08:10.996
I sometimes used to parse arguments into it,
143

143

00:08:10.996  -->  00:08:14.262
and then I used the parenthesis in order to parse
144

144

00:08:14.262  -->  00:08:17.852
a value into a mixing, but this is different.
145

145

00:08:17.852  -->  00:08:20.320
Here, we can parse an entire block of code,
146

146

00:08:20.320  -->  00:08:21.933
basically, into the mixing.
147

147

00:08:21.933  -->  00:08:24.642
We can now go ahead and add more lines in here,
148

148

00:08:24.642  -->  00:08:27.119
if you wanted, and then all of that content
149

149

00:08:27.119  -->  00:08:29.875
would be called here @content, okay?
150

150

00:08:29.875  -->  00:08:32.761
So, the content we wrote there will then be put in here
151

151

00:08:32.761  -->  00:08:36.333
and then a mixing will paste, will include this entire
152

152

00:08:36.333  -->  00:08:40.500
code here, this media query already with the content inside.
153

153

00:08:42.578  -->  00:08:46.313
Let's compile this, and it actually is already compiled,
154

154

00:08:46.313  -->  00:08:50.341
so let's take a look if this here is the same than this,
155

155

00:08:50.341  -->  00:08:52.125
and it should be, right?
156

156

00:08:52.125  -->  00:08:54.292
Let's open this one again.
157

157

00:08:55.795  -->  00:08:59.117
It should be somewhere here near the top.
158

158

00:08:59.117  -->  00:09:00.367
And here we go.
159

159

00:09:01.649  -->  00:09:04.172
So, you see, the first media query is this one here,
160

160

00:09:04.172  -->  00:09:07.100
ending here, and then this one here,
161

161

00:09:07.100  -->  00:09:10.100
which is the exact same thing, okay?
162

162

00:09:11.697  -->  00:09:13.037
Does that make sense?
163

163

00:09:13.037  -->  00:09:15.529
We can do even better than this.
164

164

00:09:15.529  -->  00:09:19.684
I'm going in steps here and showing you the improvements
165

165

00:09:19.684  -->  00:09:23.345
that we do instead of just showing you the final solution.
166

166

00:09:23.345  -->  00:09:25.575
I think it's more logical for you and it's better
167

167

00:09:25.575  -->  00:09:28.969
if you really understand where these things come from.
168

168

00:09:28.969  -->  00:09:31.640
We have a mixing called respond-phone.
169

169

00:09:31.640  -->  00:09:33.347
Then, we would have to have a mixing called
170

170

00:09:33.347  -->  00:09:37.443
respond-tablet-portrait and one for respond-tablet-landscape
171

171

00:09:37.443  -->  00:09:40.326
and so on and so forth, but that's not what we want.
172

172

00:09:40.326  -->  00:09:42.242
We just want one huge mixing
173

173

00:09:42.242  -->  00:09:44.604
which covers all of these cases.
174

174

00:09:44.604  -->  00:09:46.354
How could we do that?
175

175

00:09:47.778  -->  00:09:50.644
Well, that's why I actually called it media query manager,
176

176

00:09:50.644  -->  00:09:53.250
because that's the mixing that we're gonna write.
177

177

00:09:53.250  -->  00:09:55.040
This is the first one, and I'm gonna leave it here for now
178

178

00:09:55.040  -->  00:09:58.936
just for testing purposes, and I'm gonna create a new one.
179

179

00:09:58.936  -->  00:10:02.747
So, mixing, and this one, I will just call it respond.
180

180

00:10:02.747  -->  00:10:05.578
The difference is that into this one,
181

181

00:10:05.578  -->  00:10:08.495
we are going to parse a breakpoint,
182

182

00:10:10.666  -->  00:10:13.136
a breakpoint in form of a name.
183

183

00:10:13.136  -->  00:10:16.976
The names of the breakpoints that I wanna parse into here,
184

184

00:10:16.976  -->  00:10:20.559
let's actually write them out here as well.
185

185

00:10:22.785  -->  00:10:25.728
Basically, documenting this mix point,
186

186

00:10:25.728  -->  00:10:27.210
and that's a good practice.
187

187

00:10:27.210  -->  00:10:29.877
So, breakpoint argument choices.
188

188

00:10:32.671  -->  00:10:36.504
The first one, I'm simply going to call phone.
189

189

00:10:38.470  -->  00:10:42.519
Then, we will have one breakpoint called tab-port.
190

190

00:10:42.519  -->  00:10:46.338
We could call it tablet portrait, but I don't wanna write
191

191

00:10:46.338  -->  00:10:49.582
all that text each time I'm using this mixing,
192

192

00:10:49.582  -->  00:10:53.293
and so I just use a small name, just tab-port.
193

193

00:10:53.293  -->  00:10:56.973
And then, tab-land for the tablet landscape.
194

194

00:10:56.973  -->  00:10:59.056
And finally, big-desktop.
195

195

00:11:02.248  -->  00:11:03.876
These are the names.
196

196

00:11:03.876  -->  00:11:06.656
Alright, and how do we do that now?
197

197

00:11:06.656  -->  00:11:10.250
Well, we already saw the content directive,
198

198

00:11:10.250  -->  00:11:12.979
but there's another directive in Sass
199

199

00:11:12.979  -->  00:11:16.847
that we didn't talk about yet, and that's the if directive.
200

200

00:11:16.847  -->  00:11:20.144
This is now similar to more advanced programming.
201

201

00:11:20.144  -->  00:11:22.631
I said that I wouldn't cover the if directive in the course,
202

202

00:11:22.631  -->  00:11:24.967
but actually, I need it right now.
203

203

00:11:24.967  -->  00:11:26.916
So, what is the if directive?
204

204

00:11:26.916  -->  00:11:29.618
If you're familiar with some programming language
205

205

00:11:29.618  -->  00:11:31.497
like JavaScript or something,
206

206

00:11:31.497  -->  00:11:34.058
then you already know what the if statement is.
207

207

00:11:34.058  -->  00:11:36.991
What an if does is basically, it makes a test,
208

208

00:11:36.991  -->  00:11:39.033
and if the result of this test
209

209

00:11:39.033  -->  00:11:41.395
is true then something happens.
210

210

00:11:41.395  -->  00:11:44.896
But it's easier to actually show it to you in practice.
211

211

00:11:44.896  -->  00:11:49.063
If the breakpoint is phone then we want something to happen.
212

212

00:11:53.487  -->  00:11:55.561
And what we want to happen comes here
213

213

00:11:55.561  -->  00:11:58.063
in these curly braces, in this block here.
214

214

00:11:58.063  -->  00:11:59.826
And that's actually it.
215

215

00:11:59.826  -->  00:12:01.162
Let me recap that.
216

216

00:12:01.162  -->  00:12:03.495
We are going to call this mixing here,
217

217

00:12:03.495  -->  00:12:06.780
we're going to include it, and we will parse a breakpoint.
218

218

00:12:06.780  -->  00:12:10.049
If that breakpoint that we parse in here is called phone,
219

219

00:12:10.049  -->  00:12:12.495
then what we want to happen is this.
220

220

00:12:12.495  -->  00:12:16.431
What we want to happen is this exact media query
221

221

00:12:16.431  -->  00:12:17.868
that we had before.
222

222

00:12:17.868  -->  00:12:21.650
For the phone, we have 600 pixels, so that's the media query
223

223

00:12:21.650  -->  00:12:24.286
that we want to include in that case.
224

224

00:12:24.286  -->  00:12:26.451
Let's not actually test this as well.
225

225

00:12:26.451  -->  00:12:28.549
Again, I'm gonna do it here.
226

226

00:12:28.549  -->  00:12:31.196
This time it looks a bit different.
227

227

00:12:31.196  -->  00:12:34.946
Include, respond, and now with this argument,
228

228

00:12:36.401  -->  00:12:40.568
I can say that I want the media query for the phone
229

229

00:12:42.214  -->  00:12:44.754
with a font-size of 50%.
230

230

00:12:44.754  -->  00:12:48.555
Let's save this and that will compile the code.
231

231

00:12:48.555  -->  00:12:50.472
So, let's check it out.
232

232

00:12:52.110  -->  00:12:53.767
And indeed, here it is.
233

233

00:12:53.767  -->  00:12:57.141
This is the first one, and this is the second one,
234

234

00:12:57.141  -->  00:13:00.559
and they are completely identical, exactly the same,
235

235

00:13:00.559  -->  00:13:03.314
meaning that this actually works.
236

236

00:13:03.314  -->  00:13:06.661
We now have this mixing which allows us
237

237

00:13:06.661  -->  00:13:09.612
to parse simply the word phone in there
238

238

00:13:09.612  -->  00:13:13.596
and then it will figure out which media query it will do.
239

239

00:13:13.596  -->  00:13:16.931
With that in mind, we can now extend this
240

240

00:13:16.931  -->  00:13:19.264
to all our four breakpoints.
241

241

00:13:22.438  -->  00:13:25.771
We have tab-port, we have tab-landscape,
242

242

00:13:29.000  -->  00:13:31.000
and we have big-desktop.
243

243

00:13:34.430  -->  00:13:36.996
Now, these breakpoints here, well,
244

244

00:13:36.996  -->  00:13:39.432
the first one is 600 as we know,
245

245

00:13:39.432  -->  00:13:43.034
so everything from zero to 600 is for the phone.
246

246

00:13:43.034  -->  00:13:46.941
Max-width, again, asks if the width is less than 600 pixels.
247

247

00:13:46.941  -->  00:13:49.884
Remember that from the last lecture?
248

248

00:13:49.884  -->  00:13:53.273
Okay, so for tab-port, we then have 900,
249

249

00:13:53.273  -->  00:13:57.440
so for all the width which are less than 900 pixels.
250

250

00:13:58.929  -->  00:14:02.787
Then for the tablet landscape, we have 1200 pixels,
251

251

00:14:02.787  -->  00:14:05.123
so this would apply to all the width
252

252

00:14:05.123  -->  00:14:09.181
that are smaller than 1200, smaller or equal to 1200.
253

253

00:14:09.181  -->  00:14:13.057
And then, we have a media query for the big desktop.
254

254

00:14:13.057  -->  00:14:14.981
When do we want this to happen?
255

255

00:14:14.981  -->  00:14:18.477
Well, we want 1800 plus, so we want this to happen
256

256

00:14:18.477  -->  00:14:21.070
when a width is larger than 1800.
257

257

00:14:21.070  -->  00:14:24.034
So, as we learned in the last lecture,
258

258

00:14:24.034  -->  00:14:26.609
this is a min-width media query,
259

259

00:14:26.609  -->  00:14:30.632
so the minimum width at which this will occur is 1800 pixels
260

260

00:14:30.632  -->  00:14:34.164
and if it's more, it will happen, and if it's less,
261

261

00:14:34.164  -->  00:14:36.298
then it's not going to happen.
262

262

00:14:36.298  -->  00:14:40.185
That is our media query manager, as I like to call it.
263

263

00:14:40.185  -->  00:14:44.126
Just to demonstrate to you that this actually works,
264

264

00:14:44.126  -->  00:14:47.709
let's now include a bunch of these in here.
265

265

00:14:50.284  -->  00:14:51.964
All of them, actually.
266

266

00:14:51.964  -->  00:14:55.214
We have the phone, we have tablet-port,
267

267

00:14:57.577  -->  00:15:01.077
we have tab-land, and we have big-desktop.
268

268

00:15:04.865  -->  00:15:06.394
Let's just change the numbers here.
269

269

00:15:06.394  -->  00:15:07.977
50, 60, 70, and 80.
270

270

00:15:14.284  -->  00:15:18.451
Let's check that out again, and indeed, here it is.
271

271

00:15:19.712  -->  00:15:21.433
It's a bit weird with all the spacing,
272

272

00:15:21.433  -->  00:15:24.463
so let's give it some spacing to see it better.
273

273

00:15:24.463  -->  00:15:27.009
But actually, that's what we wrote.
274

274

00:15:27.009  -->  00:15:30.153
We have the media query just for the HTML
275

275

00:15:30.153  -->  00:15:34.236
with font size 50% for max-width 600 pixels.
276

276

00:15:35.555  -->  00:15:38.360
Then we have for 900 pixels with 60%,
277

277

00:15:38.360  -->  00:15:42.527
1200 pixels, 70, and 1800 pixels min-width 80%.
278

278

00:15:44.229  -->  00:15:47.083
That's fantastic, that's a huge step forward
279

279

00:15:47.083  -->  00:15:50.515
over the old way of writing the media queries
280

280

00:15:50.515  -->  00:15:52.991
that I explained to you before.
281

281

00:15:52.991  -->  00:15:56.463
This is really much better than what we had.
282

282

00:15:56.463  -->  00:16:00.071
Just one other thing that I have to change here
283

283

00:16:00.071  -->  00:16:02.738
is actually the pixel unit here.
284

284

00:16:04.623  -->  00:16:07.630
We've been talking about pixels here all this time now,
285

285

00:16:07.630  -->  00:16:10.611
but such as in the rest of the page, we're actually not
286

286

00:16:10.611  -->  00:16:13.175
gonna use pixels in the media queries here.
287

287

00:16:13.175  -->  00:16:16.044
That's because if the user changes the default font size
288

288

00:16:16.044  -->  00:16:18.086
in the browser, then the media queries
289

289

00:16:18.086  -->  00:16:20.163
would not be affected by that.
290

290

00:16:20.163  -->  00:16:23.942
However, we want them to be affected, so just like before,
291

291

00:16:23.942  -->  00:16:27.075
we use pixels simply to understand what's going on here,
292

292

00:16:27.075  -->  00:16:28.924
but we then use a relative unit
293

293

00:16:28.924  -->  00:16:32.211
that is in the end going to convert to pixel.
294

294

00:16:32.211  -->  00:16:35.735
About rems and ems, there's an important particularity
295

295

00:16:35.735  -->  00:16:38.019
about them in media queries.
296

296

00:16:38.019  -->  00:16:41.447
That's because ems and rems in media queries,
297

297

00:16:41.447  -->  00:16:44.589
they are not affected by a root font size setting,
298

298

00:16:44.589  -->  00:16:46.339
by this setting here.
299

299

00:16:48.328  -->  00:16:51.683
They are simply not affected by what we do here
300

300

00:16:51.683  -->  00:16:53.815
in the root font size setting.
301

301

00:16:53.815  -->  00:16:56.850
What that means is that one rem or one em
302

302

00:16:56.850  -->  00:17:00.565
in a media query is always just equal to the font size
303

303

00:17:00.565  -->  00:17:02.136
which is coming from the browser,
304

304

00:17:02.136  -->  00:17:04.327
and that's by default 16 pixels,
305

305

00:17:04.327  -->  00:17:06.712
but if the user changes it to 20 pixels,
306

306

00:17:06.712  -->  00:17:09.730
then it will be 20 pixels no matter what we have
307

307

00:17:09.730  -->  00:17:11.967
in our base font definition.
308

308

00:17:11.967  -->  00:17:15.881
What we're going to use here is ems and not rems,
309

309

00:17:15.881  -->  00:17:18.427
because rems fail to work as intended
310

310

00:17:18.427  -->  00:17:20.365
in some of the browsers.
311

311

00:17:20.365  -->  00:17:23.936
There's been some experiments done by people who understand
312

312

00:17:23.936  -->  00:17:26.903
a lot of all of this, and the conclusion basically
313

313

00:17:26.903  -->  00:17:30.683
is that ems are the best option for media queries.
314

314

00:17:30.683  -->  00:17:33.438
That's what we're going to do here.
315

315

00:17:33.438  -->  00:17:36.842
Keeping in mind that one em is 16 pixels,
316

316

00:17:36.842  -->  00:17:39.842
let's now convert all of these here.
317

317

00:17:42.758  -->  00:17:45.758
Basically, we say 600 divided by 16.
318

318

00:17:47.449  -->  00:17:49.616
So, we end up with 37.5em.
319

319

00:17:51.356  -->  00:17:55.328
37.5em, but just so we know what it actually is,
320

320

00:17:55.328  -->  00:17:57.867
let's write it here in a comment.
321

321

00:17:57.867  -->  00:18:01.534
So, 600 pixels, and the same here of course,
322

322

00:18:03.761  -->  00:18:06.615
so that when we come here and wanna check it out,
323

323

00:18:06.615  -->  00:18:10.782
then we know what we're actually looking at, right?
324

324

00:18:17.759  -->  00:18:20.592
The same logic with 900, so 56.25.
325

325

00:18:24.006  -->  00:18:27.256
56.25em, then 1200 divided by 16 is 75.
326

326

00:18:33.832  -->  00:18:37.249
And finally, 1800 divided by 16 is 112.5.
327

327

00:18:42.541  -->  00:18:44.412
Alright, and that's it.
328

328

00:18:44.412  -->  00:18:48.365
This will be converted to pixels and will be adopted
329

329

00:18:48.365  -->  00:18:51.696
to the font size that the user set for the browser.
330

330

00:18:51.696  -->  00:18:54.547
So, it's a more accessible solution here like this
331

331

00:18:54.547  -->  00:18:56.729
instead of using the pixels.
332

332

00:18:56.729  -->  00:19:00.098
Our mixing or breakpoint manager here is now completed.
333

333

00:19:00.098  -->  00:19:04.166
We can go ahead and delete this one here and here.
334

334

00:19:04.166  -->  00:19:07.487
This as well, so just one huge comment here
335

335

00:19:07.487  -->  00:19:09.410
for this entire mixing.
336

336

00:19:09.410  -->  00:19:11.091
We can close it and we actually never again
337

337

00:19:11.091  -->  00:19:12.892
have to look at this.
338

338

00:19:12.892  -->  00:19:15.084
Now we're ready to just use it.
339

339

00:19:15.084  -->  00:19:16.996
Let's actually do that for the first time here
340

340

00:19:16.996  -->  00:19:21.043
for the default font size, which translates to one rem,
341

341

00:19:21.043  -->  00:19:23.352
and so basically, this font size here
342

342

00:19:23.352  -->  00:19:26.545
is what defines the size of our entire layout.
343

343

00:19:26.545  -->  00:19:30.640
Remember in the beginning when we first started using rem.
344

344

00:19:30.640  -->  00:19:33.892
I told you that by using rem, we will make the entire layout
345

345

00:19:33.892  -->  00:19:36.492
of the webpage dependent on the font size,
346

346

00:19:36.492  -->  00:19:39.587
and that's a good thing because now, in responsive design,
347

347

00:19:39.587  -->  00:19:41.878
we can simply change the font size here
348

348

00:19:41.878  -->  00:19:46.047
and then all of these measurements in rem, all of them
349

349

00:19:46.047  -->  00:19:50.119
will scale up or down according to this font size.
350

350

00:19:50.119  -->  00:19:53.656
That's a huge, huge advantage and time saver.
351

351

00:19:53.656  -->  00:19:55.861
Otherwise, if we had everything in pixels,
352

352

00:19:55.861  -->  00:19:58.990
we would now go ahead and change all of these pixels
353

353

00:19:58.990  -->  00:20:01.882
to smaller numbers, but with this trick,
354

354

00:20:01.882  -->  00:20:05.030
we simply need to increase or decrease the font size here,
355

355

00:20:05.030  -->  00:20:07.450
and then the design will basically shrink.
356

356

00:20:07.450  -->  00:20:09.437
That will, of course, not be enough to make
357

357

00:20:09.437  -->  00:20:11.354
the page responsive, so there's a lot of stuff
358

358

00:20:11.354  -->  00:20:12.875
we will have to adjust later on,
359

359

00:20:12.875  -->  00:20:16.204
but it's a huge step already and a huge time saver.
360

360

00:20:16.204  -->  00:20:19.779
Let's now define some font sizes for these
361

361

00:20:19.779  -->  00:20:23.552
four media queries, for these for breakpoints.
362

362

00:20:23.552  -->  00:20:25.886
At the default viewport width,
363

363

00:20:25.886  -->  00:20:28.636
one rem is, of course, 10 pixels.
364

364

00:20:31.271  -->  00:20:33.354
One rem equals 10 pixels.
365

365

00:20:35.034  -->  00:20:37.424
That's a calculation we've been doing right in the beginning
366

366

00:20:37.424  -->  00:20:39.756
where we said that the 10 pixels that we want
367

367

00:20:39.756  -->  00:20:43.923
divided by the default 16 pixels equals 62.5%.
368

368

00:20:46.328  -->  00:20:47.823
Remember that part?
369

369

00:20:47.823  -->  00:20:50.703
Let's now change all of that in the media queries.
370

370

00:20:50.703  -->  00:20:53.701
Imagine that for the landscape tablet,
371

371

00:20:53.701  -->  00:20:55.932
I want one rem to be eight.
372

372

00:20:55.932  -->  00:20:59.998
One rem should be eight pixels, meaning that I have to do
373

373

00:20:59.998  -->  00:21:02.581
eight by 16, which is 50%.
374

374

00:21:07.513  -->  00:21:11.680
I'm going from 65% to 50% and just like that,
375

375

00:21:13.253  -->  00:21:17.144
one rem is no longer 10 pixels, but eight pixels.
376

376

00:21:17.144  -->  00:21:19.589
If I then take a look at something here,
377

377

00:21:19.589  -->  00:21:21.322
like maybe this button here.
378

378

00:21:21.322  -->  00:21:22.691
We have a padding of four rem here,
379

379

00:21:22.691  -->  00:21:25.826
which used to be 40 pixels at our default size,
380

380

00:21:25.826  -->  00:21:29.668
but then at a tablet it will simply become four times eight.
381

381

00:21:29.668  -->  00:21:33.835
So, four times eight is 32 pixels and no longer 40.
382

382

00:21:35.634  -->  00:21:39.384
Everything will decrease as a result of this.
383

383

00:21:41.281  -->  00:21:45.448
Maybe here in the portrait I want one rem to be nine pixels.
384

384

00:21:48.834  -->  00:21:52.092
Well, actually, that doesn't make much sense
385

385

00:21:52.092  -->  00:21:54.649
because the landscape here is bigger
386

386

00:21:54.649  -->  00:21:57.632
and so this font size should be bigger here.
387

387

00:21:57.632  -->  00:22:00.382
Let's actually put this one here.
388

388

00:22:01.980  -->  00:22:05.257
This is where we want 50%, and here I want it
389

389

00:22:05.257  -->  00:22:08.590
to be nine pixels, so nine divided by 16,
390

390

00:22:08.590  -->  00:22:11.840
and that's 56.25%, so 56.25%.
391

391

00:22:17.597  -->  00:22:20.514
Then when we have a really big screen,
392

392

00:22:20.514  -->  00:22:24.162
maybe I want one rem to be equal to 12 pixels,
393

393

00:22:24.162  -->  00:22:26.419
so scaling the entire design up.
394

394

00:22:26.419  -->  00:22:30.586
Now, we do 12 by 16, so 12 by 16, and that's 75%.
395

395

00:22:35.446  -->  00:22:38.134
I'm now increasing my entire design.
396

396

00:22:38.134  -->  00:22:41.700
Here, about the phone, remember that this media query
397

397

00:22:41.700  -->  00:22:45.654
asks the question if the width is smaller than 600, right?
398

398

00:22:45.654  -->  00:22:49.478
But this next media query here asks the question
399

399

00:22:49.478  -->  00:22:51.809
if the width is lower than 900.
400

400

00:22:51.809  -->  00:22:54.024
Imagine that the width is 500,
401

401

00:22:54.024  -->  00:22:57.744
and so it will still be less than 900, right?
402

402

00:22:57.744  -->  00:23:00.328
500 is still less than 600, but of course,
403

403

00:23:00.328  -->  00:23:03.071
also less than 900, so both of these
404

404

00:23:03.071  -->  00:23:06.106
media queries would apply, and what that means
405

405

00:23:06.106  -->  00:23:09.526
is that I don't really need this one, right?
406

406

00:23:09.526  -->  00:23:12.199
If I have 50% in this one and in this one,
407

407

00:23:12.199  -->  00:23:14.375
if they're the same, I don't need this one
408

408

00:23:14.375  -->  00:23:18.390
because they will both apply, so one of them is unnecessary.
409

409

00:23:18.390  -->  00:23:21.257
Let's simply remove the first one,
410

410

00:23:21.257  -->  00:23:24.237
and that should now work as intended.
411

411

00:23:24.237  -->  00:23:28.259
Let's take a look again at the compiled code here,
412

412

00:23:28.259  -->  00:23:29.971
and yep, here we go.
413

413

00:23:29.971  -->  00:23:33.471
The portrait tablet, the landscape tablet,
414

414

00:23:35.209  -->  00:23:36.876
and the big desktop.
415

415

00:23:38.535  -->  00:23:40.842
Now, it's finally time to take a look
416

416

00:23:40.842  -->  00:23:43.259
at this in our final webpage.
417

417

00:23:45.287  -->  00:23:49.371
What we're going to do is to actually use the DevTools here
418

418

00:23:49.371  -->  00:23:51.714
instead of resizing the screen,
419

419

00:23:51.714  -->  00:23:54.081
which isn't the best practice, I would say.
420

420

00:23:54.081  -->  00:23:56.138
We have something here which is called
421

421

00:23:56.138  -->  00:23:57.835
the toggle device toolbar.
422

422

00:23:57.835  -->  00:24:00.368
If we click this, then we basically get
423

423

00:24:00.368  -->  00:24:02.436
this responsive screen here.
424

424

00:24:02.436  -->  00:24:04.692
We decrease this down here.
425

425

00:24:04.692  -->  00:24:07.942
Okay, so we can do it here right inside
426

426

00:24:09.087  -->  00:24:11.004
of these DevTools here.
427

427

00:24:14.328  -->  00:24:16.468
Let's now really decrease and take a look
428

428

00:24:16.468  -->  00:24:18.261
at what we have here.
429

429

00:24:18.261  -->  00:24:19.678
Oh, you saw that?
430

430

00:24:21.222  -->  00:24:22.600
Here, take a look.
431

431

00:24:22.600  -->  00:24:26.249
Here is the 1200 breakpoint, and as I'm decreasing it now,
432

432

00:24:26.249  -->  00:24:29.166
you see everything decreased a bit.
433

433

00:24:31.232  -->  00:24:33.830
That's great, it means it's working.
434

434

00:24:33.830  -->  00:24:37.997
Let's now get a bit closer to the next one, which is 900.
435

435

00:24:40.739  -->  00:24:43.219
Well, this time nothing happened.
436

436

00:24:43.219  -->  00:24:44.073
Why is that?
437

437

00:24:44.073  -->  00:24:45.990
Let's take a look here.
438

438

00:24:48.691  -->  00:24:52.255
I see that we have now two conflicting media queries here.
439

439

00:24:52.255  -->  00:24:56.436
The one that applies is the 75%, and so of course,
440

440

00:24:56.436  -->  00:24:57.936
I did it wrong here.
441

441

00:24:57.936  -->  00:25:00.495
It should be the other way around,
442

442

00:25:00.495  -->  00:25:03.107
because it's the same logic as I explained before.
443

443

00:25:03.107  -->  00:25:06.863
Each time that the tablet portrait media queries apply,
444

444

00:25:06.863  -->  00:25:08.995
the tablet landscape does as well.
445

445

00:25:08.995  -->  00:25:11.482
Both of them here apply, so these two,
446

446

00:25:11.482  -->  00:25:13.705
and then the last one will be used.
447

447

00:25:13.705  -->  00:25:15.955
But that's not what I want.
448

448

00:25:19.942  -->  00:25:23.268
I just need to put them the other way around.
449

449

00:25:23.268  -->  00:25:24.923
This one here now asks,
450

450

00:25:24.923  -->  00:25:26.590
width less than 900.
451

451

00:25:31.222  -->  00:25:35.305
Remember, this one here asks width less than 600.
452

452

00:25:38.385  -->  00:25:41.593
Imagine that we have a 500 pixel viewpoint width.
453

453

00:25:41.593  -->  00:25:44.558
The first one here would apply, and of course,
454

454

00:25:44.558  -->  00:25:46.559
the second one would apply as well,
455

455

00:25:46.559  -->  00:25:48.524
so they would still be conflicting,
456

456

00:25:48.524  -->  00:25:51.557
but the difference is that the smaller media query,
457

457

00:25:51.557  -->  00:25:55.590
the one for the tablet portrait is the one that is applying.
458

458

00:25:55.590  -->  00:25:57.338
That is exactly what I want
459

459

00:25:57.338  -->  00:25:59.733
when the screen is just 500 pixels.
460

460

00:25:59.733  -->  00:26:02.093
I don't want the larger media query to apply,
461

461

00:26:02.093  -->  00:26:04.957
but the smaller one, and so this is the order
462

462

00:26:04.957  -->  00:26:07.512
in which we have to put the media queries.
463

463

00:26:07.512  -->  00:26:11.359
Always the larger ones before the smaller ones.
464

464

00:26:11.359  -->  00:26:15.359
This will bring me the behavior that I expected.
465

465

00:26:16.998  -->  00:26:19.725
Now you see the change here, and here as well.
466

466

00:26:19.725  -->  00:26:23.203
So, 50% is now the current font size.
467

467

00:26:23.203  -->  00:26:27.462
You see that this is already working quite well, right?
468

468

00:26:27.462  -->  00:26:29.669
As we decrease the screen,
469

469

00:26:29.669  -->  00:26:32.569
this keeps decreasing here as well.
470

470

00:26:32.569  -->  00:26:35.402
You can actually put the other one here as well
471

471

00:26:35.402  -->  00:26:38.102
for the phone, just to show it to you.
472

472

00:26:38.102  -->  00:26:41.935
Let me just copy this one here, include phone.
473

473

00:26:45.253  -->  00:26:49.420
Let's put it really small, just 30%, which will equal to
474

474

00:26:51.081  -->  00:26:54.223
.3 times 16, so 4.8 pixels, basically.
475

475

00:26:54.223  -->  00:26:55.890
One rem will be 4.8.
476

476

00:26:57.424  -->  00:26:58.947
That's not what we want, of course,
477

477

00:26:58.947  -->  00:27:01.924
and so I'm gonna delete it in a second.
478

478

00:27:01.924  -->  00:27:06.091
But just to exemplify this here, I'll reload everything.
479

479

00:27:08.024  -->  00:27:09.905
Now, as we approach 600,
480

480

00:27:09.905  -->  00:27:13.818
you see that everything becomes really small now.
481

481

00:27:13.818  -->  00:27:17.985
You see, even the button of course will reduce its size.
482

482

00:27:22.708  -->  00:27:24.869
Okay, we made everything work.
483

483

00:27:24.869  -->  00:27:28.266
We made this very nice breakpoint manager,
484

484

00:27:28.266  -->  00:27:31.911
and we also used it for the first time, so that's great.
485

485

00:27:31.911  -->  00:27:34.212
Let's get rid of this one here.
486

486

00:27:34.212  -->  00:27:36.413
And here of course, this is not right.
487

487

00:27:36.413  -->  00:27:37.909
It's 900 and 1200.
488

488

00:27:37.909  -->  00:27:40.741
But that doesn't change the functionality, obviously.
489

489

00:27:40.741  -->  00:27:42.993
Now, after this lecture, I want you to think about
490

490

00:27:42.993  -->  00:27:46.845
this a little bit, to think about why we had to use this
491

491

00:27:46.845  -->  00:27:50.242
order of the media queries and not the other one around.
492

492

00:27:50.242  -->  00:27:53.536
I want you to really get a grasp for this material
493

493

00:27:53.536  -->  00:27:56.638
so that we can then move on and really use it here
494

494

00:27:56.638  -->  00:27:58.414
on the rest of the page.
495

495

00:27:58.414  -->  00:28:01.183
Please go ahead and do that right now,
496

496

00:28:01.183  -->  00:28:03.433
and I'll see you next time.
