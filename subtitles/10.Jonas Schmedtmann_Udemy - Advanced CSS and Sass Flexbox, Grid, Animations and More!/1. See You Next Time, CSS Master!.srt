<v ->Congratulations on finishing the most</v>
2

2

00:00:04,390  -->  00:00:07,254
advanced CSS course on the internet.
3

3

00:00:07,254  -->  00:00:09,552
It was a fun ride going through all these
4

4

00:00:09,552  -->  00:00:13,558
lectures and concepts and projects together with you.
5

5

00:00:13,558  -->  00:00:15,558
I hope it was real fun for you, as well,
6

6

00:00:15,558  -->  00:00:17,991
that you're proud of the projects that you've coded
7

7

00:00:17,991  -->  00:00:20,005
during the lectures, and, of course,
8

8

00:00:20,005  -->  00:00:21,446
that you've come out of the course
9

9

00:00:21,446  -->  00:00:23,926
with a lot more knowledge and tools
10

10

00:00:23,926  -->  00:00:27,640
in your CSS toolbox than you had before you started.
11

11

00:00:27,640  -->  00:00:29,744
And now, what's next for you?
12

12

00:00:29,744  -->  00:00:31,548
Well, I'm gonna tell you what I tell
13

13

00:00:31,548  -->  00:00:33,567
every single one of my students,
14

14

00:00:33,567  -->  00:00:36,946
which is that you have to practice, practice, practice.
15

15

00:00:36,946  -->  00:00:38,385
If you want to become better and better
16

16

00:00:38,385  -->  00:00:42,052
at CSS and web development in general, of course.
17

17

00:00:42,052  -->  00:00:43,576
A complete course, like the one
18

18

00:00:43,576  -->  00:00:46,893
that you just finished, can give an amazing foundation
19

19

00:00:46,893  -->  00:00:48,787
and a lot of knowledge, of course.
20

20

00:00:48,787  -->  00:00:51,343
But now it's really your turn to put in the work
21

21

00:00:51,343  -->  00:00:54,600
and to put that knowledge into practice.
22

22

00:00:54,600  -->  00:00:56,172
And for that, you just have to build
23

23

00:00:56,172  -->  00:00:58,913
a lot of projects by yourself.
24

24

00:00:58,913  -->  00:01:01,124
Now, please don't just copy the code
25

25

00:01:01,124  -->  00:01:03,119
and the projects that we've built in the course
26

26

00:01:03,119  -->  00:01:04,783
because that's a mistake I see
27

27

00:01:04,783  -->  00:01:07,387
a lot of students doing all the time.
28

28

00:01:07,387  -->  00:01:10,669
Instead, come up with your own ideas, your own layouts,
29

29

00:01:10,669  -->  00:01:13,496
and your own designs and then, code up everything
30

30

00:01:13,496  -->  00:01:16,436
using the tools that I gave you in the course.
31

31

00:01:16,436  -->  00:01:20,264
That is how you become a real CSS master, okay?
32

32

00:01:20,264  -->  00:01:22,247
And I can't wait to see what you're going to
33

33

00:01:22,247  -->  00:01:25,183
design and build using all these new tools.
34

34

00:01:25,183  -->  00:01:27,141
And definitely make sure to share your work
35

35

00:01:27,141  -->  00:01:29,443
here in the Q&amp;A section on Udemy.
36

36

00:01:29,443  -->  00:01:31,325
Now, another thing that's really important for you
37

37

00:01:31,325  -->  00:01:35,826
as a CSS NEF is to keep on top of the most important news
38

38

00:01:35,826  -->  00:01:38,478
in a fast-paced web development industry.
39

39

00:01:38,478  -->  00:01:40,949
And then, really know how hard it can be,
40

40

00:01:40,949  -->  00:01:42,967
with so much stuff going on all the time.
41

41

00:01:42,967  -->  00:01:45,038
And so in order to help you with that,
42

42

00:01:45,038  -->  00:01:46,897
I actually started a monthly newsletter
43

43

00:01:46,897  -->  00:01:49,606
a couple of months ago and my subscribers
44

44

00:01:49,606  -->  00:01:52,254
really appreciated that because it's been
45

45

00:01:52,254  -->  00:01:53,706
really helpful for them.
46

46

00:01:53,706  -->  00:01:55,360
So if you want to check that out,
47

47

00:01:55,360  -->  00:02:00,331
you can just subscribe to newsletter over at jonas.io.
48

48

00:02:00,331  -->  00:02:01,995
So to make a long story short,
49

49

00:02:01,995  -->  00:02:04,627
you should keep practicing all the time,
50

50

00:02:04,627  -->  00:02:07,040
you should keep on top of the web tech news,
51

51

00:02:07,040  -->  00:02:10,892
and you should, of course, never stop learning.
52

52

00:02:10,892  -->  00:02:12,686
All right and that's actually all
53

53

00:02:12,686  -->  00:02:14,697
I had to show you and to tell you.
54

54

00:02:14,697  -->  00:02:17,092
So good luck with your new skills,
55

55

00:02:17,092  -->  00:02:19,871
take care and see you next time.
56

56

00:02:19,871  -->  00:02:23,871
