00:00:01,117  -->  00:00:04,611
<v Jonas>Ready for another session on the Natours Project?</v>
2

2

00:00:04,611  -->  00:00:06,975
Then get ready to learn how to include
3

3

00:00:06,975  -->  00:00:09,773
and use an icon font in a project.
4

4

00:00:09,773  -->  00:00:11,102
You will also learn another way
5

5

00:00:11,102  -->  00:00:13,716
of creating this "skewed section" design
6

6

00:00:13,716  -->  00:00:15,342
that is all over our page,
7

7

00:00:15,342  -->  00:00:16,805
like in our header.
8

8

00:00:16,805  -->  00:00:19,667
So this non-rectangular design.
9

9

00:00:19,667  -->  00:00:21,123
And plus, you are gonna learn
10

10

00:00:21,123  -->  00:00:25,588
how and when to use the direct child selector.
11

11

00:00:25,588  -->  00:00:27,875
So we have these four columns here going on.
12

12

00:00:27,875  -->  00:00:30,748
And when we hover, we have this nice effect.
13

13

00:00:30,748  -->  00:00:32,699
And then in each of these boxes,
14

14

00:00:32,699  -->  00:00:35,652
we have the four features of this company,
15

15

00:00:35,652  -->  00:00:36,931
so of Natours.
16

16

00:00:36,931  -->  00:00:37,859
So Explore the World,
17

17

00:00:37,859  -->  00:00:39,252
Meet Nature, Find Your Way,
18

18

00:00:39,252  -->  00:00:41,219
and Live a Healthier Life.
19

19

00:00:41,219  -->  00:00:42,340
And then below that is the text,
20

20

00:00:42,340  -->  00:00:43,844
and here on top, an icon.
21

21

00:00:43,844  -->  00:00:46,102
And you see this grading going on here,
22

22

00:00:46,102  -->  00:00:48,308
just like we have in here.
23

23

00:00:48,308  -->  00:00:50,611
So we're gonna do it the same way.
24

24

00:00:50,611  -->  00:00:52,405
And you see this non-rectangular design here
25

25

00:00:52,405  -->  00:00:54,195
that I was talking about earlier.
26

26

00:00:54,195  -->  00:00:57,858
So it's here, and here, and so these lines.
27

27

00:00:57,858  -->  00:01:00,179
But we're gonna leave that for the end.
28

28

00:01:00,179  -->  00:01:02,833
Let's actually start by downloading and including
29

29

00:01:02,833  -->  00:01:05,148
this icon font that we have here,
30

30

00:01:05,148  -->  00:01:08,049
so that we can use some icons in our webpage.
31

31

00:01:08,049  -->  00:01:09,340
And the icon font I'm using here
32

32

00:01:09,340  -->  00:01:12,082
is called Linea Free Iconset.
33

33

00:01:12,082  -->  00:01:14,558
So just head over to Linea.io,
34

34

00:01:14,558  -->  00:01:18,725
and then in here you can simply download all sets.
35

35

00:01:19,608  -->  00:01:23,441
And then just wait for the download to finish.
36

36

00:01:25,916  -->  00:01:29,400
And so let's take a look at what we have here.
37

37

00:01:29,400  -->  00:01:31,584
So you can take a look at all of these icons,
38

38

00:01:31,584  -->  00:01:34,981
but what we want is actually here in this basics section.
39

39

00:01:34,981  -->  00:01:37,093
So this basics icon pack,
40

40

00:01:37,093  -->  00:01:39,283
and then we want a font.
41

41

00:01:39,283  -->  00:01:42,613
We could just use images like these .png images here,
42

42

00:01:42,613  -->  00:01:44,670
but that is not a good practice.
43

43

00:01:44,670  -->  00:01:47,972
Because images do not nicely scale up and down
44

44

00:01:47,972  -->  00:01:50,202
when we scale our webpage.
45

45

00:01:50,202  -->  00:01:51,700
But if we have an icon font,
46

46

00:01:51,700  -->  00:01:52,820
then these are vectors,
47

47

00:01:52,820  -->  00:01:55,366
and then no matter how much we would zoom in on the page,
48

48

00:01:55,366  -->  00:01:58,805
the icons will always remain nice and sharp and crisp.
49

49

00:01:58,805  -->  00:02:00,227
And so no problem there.
50

50

00:02:00,227  -->  00:02:02,501
We could also use this .svg format here.
51

51

00:02:02,501  -->  00:02:04,893
And actually we're gonna do that in the next project,
52

52

00:02:04,893  -->  00:02:07,774
but that's even more advanced than using an icon font.
53

53

00:02:07,774  -->  00:02:10,206
So we're leaving that for the next project.
54

54

00:02:10,206  -->  00:02:11,444
Okay?
55

55

00:02:11,444  -->  00:02:14,085
So let's use this icon font here.
56

56

00:02:14,085  -->  00:02:17,543
And so what we need is the style, so .css file,
57

57

00:02:17,543  -->  00:02:19,501
and this fonts folder.
58

58

00:02:19,501  -->  00:02:21,966
Because this is actually where the icons live.
59

59

00:02:21,966  -->  00:02:24,633
So in this, linea-basic-10 font.
60

60

00:02:26,001  -->  00:02:27,672
So let me just copy these two,
61

61

00:02:27,672  -->  00:02:29,234
go to our desktop,
62

62

00:02:29,234  -->  00:02:32,064
and then to our project folder.
63

63

00:02:32,064  -->  00:02:34,852
Now I wanna head into css.
64

64

00:02:34,852  -->  00:02:37,707
And this is where I am copying it.
65

65

00:02:37,707  -->  00:02:42,581
And now let's just rename this one here to icon-font,
66

66

00:02:42,581  -->  00:02:45,046
so that it's not too similar here to style.
67

67

00:02:45,046  -->  00:02:47,551
Okay, and so that's it actually.
68

68

00:02:47,551  -->  00:02:49,543
Now all we have to do is to, of course,
69

69

00:02:49,543  -->  00:02:52,381
include it in the XML and our markup.
70

70

00:02:52,381  -->  00:02:54,881
So let's do that very quickly.
71

71

00:02:55,846  -->  00:02:57,430
And we'll actually do it here
72

72

00:02:57,430  -->  00:03:00,057
before our custom CSS.
73

73

00:03:00,057  -->  00:03:03,046
So link, and then the power of Emmet,
74

74

00:03:03,046  -->  00:03:04,963
css, and icon-font.css.
75

75

00:03:06,386  -->  00:03:07,561
And that's it,
76

76

00:03:07,561  -->  00:03:09,969
our icon font is now included in the page.
77

77

00:03:09,969  -->  00:03:11,622
Let's just very quickly take a look
78

78

00:03:11,622  -->  00:03:13,091
at the CSS file,
79

79

00:03:13,091  -->  00:03:15,029
so that we understand a little bit about
80

80

00:03:15,029  -->  00:03:17,029
how this actually works.
81

81

00:03:18,389  -->  00:03:22,071
So this starts by including these fonts
82

82

00:03:22,071  -->  00:03:24,602
that are here in this fonts folder, right?
83

83

00:03:24,602  -->  00:03:25,734
So these four fonts,
84

84

00:03:25,734  -->  00:03:27,324
these are just different formats,
85

85

00:03:27,324  -->  00:03:30,426
because different browsers can read different font formats.
86

86

00:03:30,426  -->  00:03:32,498
And so we have to use all of these four,
87

87

00:03:32,498  -->  00:03:34,164
so that the icon font is gonna work
88

88

00:03:34,164  -->  00:03:35,801
on all of the browsers.
89

89

00:03:35,801  -->  00:03:37,251
So what this does is here,
90

90

00:03:37,251  -->  00:03:39,441
it includes all of these fonts.
91

91

00:03:39,441  -->  00:03:41,320
And then it defines the font family
92

92

00:03:41,320  -->  00:03:43,653
as calling "linea-basic-10".
93

93

00:03:44,660  -->  00:03:46,907
And then basically what happens down here
94

94

00:03:46,907  -->  00:03:50,812
is that this gives us one class for each of the icons,
95

95

00:03:50,812  -->  00:03:53,348
which are included in this icon pack.
96

96

00:03:53,348  -->  00:03:55,158
So it gives us all of these classes,
97

97

00:03:55,158  -->  00:03:57,035
like icon-basic-accelerator,
98

98

00:03:57,035  -->  00:03:58,316
icon-basic-alarm,
99

99

00:03:58,316  -->  00:03:59,404
icon-basic-anchor,
100

100

00:03:59,404  -->  00:04:03,245
and so on and so forth through all of these.
101

101

00:04:03,245  -->  00:04:06,596
Now, it's not really important to understand how this works,
102

102

00:04:06,596  -->  00:04:08,373
it doesn't really matter for us.
103

103

00:04:08,373  -->  00:04:10,239
We just want to use this, okay?
104

104

00:04:10,239  -->  00:04:12,268
I just wanted to very quickly give you an overview
105

105

00:04:12,268  -->  00:04:13,636
about how this works.
106

106

00:04:13,636  -->  00:04:15,466
So again, all of the fonts are included.
107

107

00:04:15,466  -->  00:04:17,533
And then based on that font,
108

108

00:04:17,533  -->  00:04:20,923
it will give us one class for each icon that we can use.
109

109

00:04:20,923  -->  00:04:23,012
So all we have to do is to include this class,
110

110

00:04:23,012  -->  00:04:25,501
and it will give us the icon.
111

111

00:04:25,501  -->  00:04:26,334
Alright?
112

112

00:04:26,334  -->  00:04:29,396
So let me show you how to do that.
113

113

00:04:29,396  -->  00:04:30,373
But before, of course,
114

114

00:04:30,373  -->  00:04:33,257
we need to start writing our section.
115

115

00:04:33,257  -->  00:04:34,721
So we have a section,
116

116

00:04:34,721  -->  00:04:37,971
and I'm gonna call it section-features.
117

117

00:04:40,490  -->  00:04:41,489
Okay, and now in this section,
118

118

00:04:41,489  -->  00:04:43,201
let me just demonstrate how we can use
119

119

00:04:43,201  -->  00:04:45,449
the icons that we just included.
120

120

00:04:45,449  -->  00:04:47,945
So we need to add one of the classes that I just showed you
121

121

00:04:47,945  -->  00:04:48,792
to an element.
122

122

00:04:48,792  -->  00:04:51,561
And it doesn't really matter what element it is.
123

123

00:04:51,561  -->  00:04:56,226
And so it's become a convention to use the i element, okay?
124

124

00:04:56,226  -->  00:04:58,682
And this doesn't stand for icon, okay?
125

125

00:04:58,682  -->  00:05:00,385
Some people, they confuse it.
126

126

00:05:00,385  -->  00:05:02,211
But this i doesn't stand for icon,
127

127

00:05:02,211  -->  00:05:04,431
it actually stands for italic.
128

128

00:05:04,431  -->  00:05:06,322
So in previous versions of HTML,
129

129

00:05:06,322  -->  00:05:09,915
this i was used to make text italic, okay?
130

130

00:05:09,915  -->  00:05:11,223
Now we no longer use it,
131

131

00:05:11,223  -->  00:05:14,390
and so we can use the i for our icons.
132

132

00:05:15,839  -->  00:05:18,793
So let's actually open the folder again
133

133

00:05:18,793  -->  00:05:22,148
that we downloaded, from the Downloads.
134

134

00:05:22,148  -->  00:05:24,812
Because in here we have an image,
135

135

00:05:24,812  -->  00:05:26,868
where we have all our icons.
136

136

00:05:26,868  -->  00:05:29,013
But well, they don't really have a name.
137

137

00:05:29,013  -->  00:05:30,727
So, okay, it's not really useful.
138

138

00:05:30,727  -->  00:05:33,173
But we can still open this icons reference.
139

139

00:05:33,173  -->  00:05:34,590
And then in here,
140

140

00:05:36,155  -->  00:05:37,412
it should then work.
141

141

00:05:37,412  -->  00:05:38,570
So which one do we want to use?
142

142

00:05:38,570  -->  00:05:39,618
We want to use, for example,
143

143

00:05:39,618  -->  00:05:41,368
this world icon here.
144

144

00:05:42,229  -->  00:05:44,708
And okay down here, here it is.
145

145

00:05:44,708  -->  00:05:45,958
So basic-world.
146

146

00:05:47,518  -->  00:05:49,557
So I just copy this name,
147

147

00:05:49,557  -->  00:05:51,557
which is the class name.
148

148

00:05:53,325  -->  00:05:55,343
And so class, basic-world,
149

149

00:05:55,343  -->  00:05:57,510
and now let's take a look.
150

150

00:05:58,556  -->  00:06:00,796
Well nothing really happened, okay.
151

151

00:06:00,796  -->  00:06:02,253
Reload it again.
152

152

00:06:02,253  -->  00:06:04,877
And let's go back, okay.
153

153

00:06:04,877  -->  00:06:06,298
I remember that all of these icons,
154

154

00:06:06,298  -->  00:06:08,772
they started with an icon prefix, right?
155

155

00:06:08,772  -->  00:06:09,642
So icon-basic,
156

156

00:06:09,642  -->  00:06:12,969
icon-basic-book, icon-basic-book-pencil.
157

157

00:06:12,969  -->  00:06:15,636
So let's add that here, as well.
158

158

00:06:17,561  -->  00:06:19,434
And on each icon font that you're gonna download,
159

159

00:06:19,434  -->  00:06:20,954
it's always gonna be a bit different.
160

160

00:06:20,954  -->  00:06:23,098
So you'll always have to experiment a bit with it.
161

161

00:06:23,098  -->  00:06:24,090
But now you see it works,
162

162

00:06:24,090  -->  00:06:27,911
so it's really small (chuckles) down here.
163

163

00:06:27,911  -->  00:06:28,744
Here in the corner,
164

164

00:06:28,744  -->  00:06:30,209
but I hope you see it.
165

165

00:06:30,209  -->  00:06:32,232
So it is actually working.
166

166

00:06:32,232  -->  00:06:33,221
Now all we have to do
167

167

00:06:33,221  -->  00:06:35,798
is to actually write all of that markup,
168

168

00:06:35,798  -->  00:06:38,835
so that it looks like this in the end.
169

169

00:06:38,835  -->  00:06:41,403
So let's start by actually doing that.
170

170

00:06:41,403  -->  00:06:43,011
Leave this here,
171

171

00:06:43,011  -->  00:06:44,629
and we'll come back to it later.
172

172

00:06:44,629  -->  00:06:46,917
So basically this is very simple, actually.
173

173

00:06:46,917  -->  00:06:49,522
All we need here is a row with four columns in it.
174

174

00:06:49,522  -->  00:06:50,880
And then each of these columns
175

175

00:06:50,880  -->  00:06:53,359
can have a feature box in them.
176

176

00:06:53,359  -->  00:06:54,839
So with Emmet again,
177

177

00:06:54,839  -->  00:06:56,140
we do it like this.
178

178

00:06:56,140  -->  00:06:57,973
.row, then col-1-of-4.
179

179

00:07:02,061  -->  00:07:03,951
And I could actually do this four times now
180

180

00:07:03,951  -->  00:07:05,949
to fill everything up at the same time.
181

181

00:07:05,949  -->  00:07:07,453
But let's just do it like this,
182

182

00:07:07,453  -->  00:07:09,837
only with one of the columns.
183

183

00:07:09,837  -->  00:07:12,748
And actually I forgot the dot to make it a class.
184

184

00:07:12,748  -->  00:07:14,206
And then in here,
185

185

00:07:14,206  -->  00:07:16,206
let's put a feature-box.
186

186

00:07:18,282  -->  00:07:19,563
Alright, and there it is.
187

187

00:07:19,563  -->  00:07:23,453
And so this feature box will be one of these boxes here.
188

188

00:07:23,453  -->  00:07:24,889
So remember that before,
189

189

00:07:24,889  -->  00:07:26,187
so in this section here,
190

190

00:07:26,187  -->  00:07:29,481
we wrote this content here directly into the column.
191

191

00:07:29,481  -->  00:07:31,147
Remember that?
192

192

00:07:31,147  -->  00:07:33,614
So here, we had this column in here.
193

193

00:07:33,614  -->  00:07:36,505
And then in here, we had directly put these elements.
194

194

00:07:36,505  -->  00:07:39,168
So the h3, the Ps, and so on.
195

195

00:07:39,168  -->  00:07:41,096
Now this time, we're not doing it like that.
196

196

00:07:41,096  -->  00:07:44,153
We're creating another box right in here.
197

197

00:07:44,153  -->  00:07:44,986
And we do that,
198

198

00:07:44,986  -->  00:07:46,907
first because we want to have more space
199

199

00:07:46,907  -->  00:07:49,356
between them than the gutter,
200

200

00:07:49,356  -->  00:07:52,326
but more importantly it's because we want this effect
201

201

00:07:52,326  -->  00:07:54,500
to happen like this.
202

202

00:07:54,500  -->  00:07:56,404
And so we want this entire feature box
203

203

00:07:56,404  -->  00:07:58,277
to scale up when we hover it.
204

204

00:07:58,277  -->  00:08:01,093
And it's better to then create a separate element for that,
205

205

00:08:01,093  -->  00:08:04,408
rather than manipulating this kind of stuff on our columns.
206

206

00:08:04,408  -->  00:08:07,901
So we never wanna touch these columns here, okay?
207

207

00:08:07,901  -->  00:08:10,229
The code for the grid should remain unchanged,
208

208

00:08:10,229  -->  00:08:11,581
no scaling on there,
209

209

00:08:11,581  -->  00:08:13,436
no adding additional padding.
210

210

00:08:13,436  -->  00:08:15,107
If you want anything like that,
211

211

00:08:15,107  -->  00:08:18,690
we just add another box in there.
212

212

00:08:18,690  -->  00:08:21,097
So what do we have in each of these boxes?
213

213

00:08:21,097  -->  00:08:22,265
We have an icon,
214

214

00:08:22,265  -->  00:08:25,015
and let's actually grab that one.
215

215

00:08:28,279  -->  00:08:30,908
What's going on here, okay.
216

216

00:08:30,908  -->  00:08:34,314
Then we have an h3, so a tertiary heading.
217

217

00:08:34,314  -->  00:08:37,938
And you see that this one is exactly the same as this.
218

218

00:08:37,938  -->  00:08:40,091
And so we can reuse this code, of course.
219

219

00:08:40,091  -->  00:08:42,008
So h3.heading-tertiary,
220

220

00:08:49,020  -->  00:08:49,999
Explore the world,
221

221

00:08:49,999  -->  00:08:51,582
it's the first one.
222

222

00:08:52,542  -->  00:08:53,934
And then after that,
223

223

00:08:53,934  -->  00:08:56,666
it's simply a paragraph
224

224

00:08:56,666  -->  00:08:58,749
called feature-box__text.
225

225

00:09:04,954  -->  00:09:05,787
Alright,
226

226

00:09:05,787  -->  00:09:07,942
and here we actually should add another class,
227

227

00:09:07,942  -->  00:09:11,214
because it's a feature-box icon.
228

228

00:09:11,214  -->  00:09:14,407
So feature-box is the name of the block here, okay.
229

229

00:09:14,407  -->  00:09:17,343
And then icon is the name of the element.
230

230

00:09:17,343  -->  00:09:18,756
As for this text,
231

231

00:09:18,756  -->  00:09:22,089
let's just copy a bit of this text here.
232

232

00:09:23,723  -->  00:09:26,818
And maybe that's enough already.
233

233

00:09:26,818  -->  00:09:29,318
And so let's paste it in here.
234

234

00:09:30,529  -->  00:09:31,362
Alright.
235

235

00:09:32,705  -->  00:09:35,459
And so this should be enough already.
236

236

00:09:35,459  -->  00:09:37,275
Now as you can already guess, probably,
237

237

00:09:37,275  -->  00:09:40,355
this feature-box here should be a component,
238

238

00:09:40,355  -->  00:09:43,762
so a building block that can be reused throughout our page.
239

239

00:09:43,762  -->  00:09:46,473
So let's create a new folder for that.
240

240

00:09:46,473  -->  00:09:48,300
I'm actually copying it,
241

241

00:09:48,300  -->  00:09:51,133
so I can now just do it like this.
242

242

00:09:53,497  -->  00:09:56,497
And then don't forget to include it.
243

243

00:09:59,694  -->  00:10:02,694
Import, components, and feature-box.
244

244

00:10:05,971  -->  00:10:07,011
Give it a save,
245

245

00:10:07,011  -->  00:10:09,582
and then we can already close it again.
246

246

00:10:09,582  -->  00:10:12,070
And here again, feature-box.
247

247

00:10:12,070  -->  00:10:13,720
And that's it.
248

248

00:10:13,720  -->  00:10:18,270
Now, the other selector is the feature-box __icon.
249

249

00:10:18,270  -->  00:10:22,437
And the other one is the feature-box __text, I believe.
250

250

00:10:24,576  -->  00:10:27,542
And so that should be enough.
251

251

00:10:27,542  -->  00:10:30,575
Let me just take a look at how this looks in here.
252

252

00:10:30,575  -->  00:10:31,408
And alright,
253

253

00:10:31,408  -->  00:10:34,534
so we have the h3, the paragraph, and the icon,
254

254

00:10:34,534  -->  00:10:36,191
which is still very small, of course.
255

255

00:10:36,191  -->  00:10:37,871
But they're already sitting here nicely
256

256

00:10:37,871  -->  00:10:40,350
in one of these columns.
257

257

00:10:40,350  -->  00:10:43,949
So let's go back and close what we no longer need here,
258

258

00:10:43,949  -->  00:10:45,342
typography.
259

259

00:10:45,342  -->  00:10:47,212
Variables, we can keep open.
260

260

00:10:47,212  -->  00:10:49,147
And now what I want you to do next,
261

261

00:10:49,147  -->  00:10:51,227
or what we can do together next,
262

262

00:10:51,227  -->  00:10:54,310
is to actually add this section here.
263

263

00:10:55,227  -->  00:10:58,373
So the section about the feature-box.
264

264

00:10:58,373  -->  00:11:00,373
So the section-features.
265

265

00:11:02,976  -->  00:11:05,367
And let's start by add some padding.
266

266

00:11:05,367  -->  00:11:08,034
So padding, let's say 20 pixels.
267

267

00:11:09,205  -->  00:11:12,288
So 20rem, and then 0, left and right.
268

268

00:11:13,454  -->  00:11:15,126
So it's really modern right now
269

269

00:11:15,126  -->  00:11:17,094
to have really spacey websites,
270

270

00:11:17,094  -->  00:11:19,002
with lots of wide space.
271

271

00:11:19,002  -->  00:11:20,929
That's really modern and trendy right now.
272

272

00:11:20,929  -->  00:11:22,879
And I think it looks great actually.
273

273

00:11:22,879  -->  00:11:24,736
So another thing we have in this section here,
274

274

00:11:24,736  -->  00:11:26,505
in case you haven't noticed yet,
275

275

00:11:26,505  -->  00:11:30,065
is, once again we have one of these background images
276

276

00:11:30,065  -->  00:11:31,464
with this grading going on.
277

277

00:11:31,464  -->  00:11:33,200
Just like here.
278

278

00:11:33,200  -->  00:11:35,625
And so instead of writing it all over again,
279

279

00:11:35,625  -->  00:11:37,304
I am actually just going to copy it.
280

280

00:11:37,304  -->  00:11:40,015
Because we already know how to do that.
281

281

00:11:40,015  -->  00:11:43,739
So there's not really a need to do it all again.
282

282

00:11:43,739  -->  00:11:46,568
So what we need is this background-image stuff here,
283

283

00:11:46,568  -->  00:11:47,401
right.
284

284

00:11:48,441  -->  00:11:49,941
And so here it is.
285

285

00:11:50,880  -->  00:11:52,569
So we have linear-gradient
286

286

00:11:52,569  -->  00:11:55,305
with this green color here.
287

287

00:11:55,305  -->  00:11:57,174
Now, this color picker here no longer works
288

288

00:11:57,174  -->  00:11:58,648
because of the SCSS variable.
289

289

00:11:58,648  -->  00:11:59,481
But don't worry,
290

290

00:11:59,481  -->  00:12:01,226
everything is right.
291

291

00:12:01,226  -->  00:12:05,297
So the light green to the dark green to the right bottom.
292

292

00:12:05,297  -->  00:12:07,526
Now what's different here is the image.
293

293

00:12:07,526  -->  00:12:11,109
And this time it's called nat-4, nat-4.jpg.
294

294

00:12:13,266  -->  00:12:14,556
And what we also want,
295

295

00:12:14,556  -->  00:12:16,806
almost always, I would say,
296

296

00:12:18,011  -->  00:12:20,333
is the background-size set to cover,
297

297

00:12:20,333  -->  00:12:23,209
so it nicely covers the entire section.
298

298

00:12:23,209  -->  00:12:27,288
Alright, let's take a look at that now.
299

299

00:12:27,288  -->  00:12:28,860
So that's very nice already.
300

300

00:12:28,860  -->  00:12:31,024
And it's good enough for now.
301

301

00:12:31,024  -->  00:12:33,527
So let's continue now with these boxes here.
302

302

00:12:33,527  -->  00:12:35,296
And then as the finishing touch,
303

303

00:12:35,296  -->  00:12:37,358
we will skew the entire design
304

304

00:12:37,358  -->  00:12:40,023
to make it look like this one here,
305

305

00:12:40,023  -->  00:12:42,773
with these non-rectangular sides.
306

306

00:12:44,281  -->  00:12:46,002
So, the feature-box.
307

307

00:12:46,002  -->  00:12:47,589
We want it to be white,
308

308

00:12:47,589  -->  00:12:50,077
and a bit transparent at the same time.
309

309

00:12:50,077  -->  00:12:51,146
So let's do that.
310

310

00:12:51,146  -->  00:12:52,813
So background-color.
311

311

00:12:54,011  -->  00:12:55,723
And so we use an rgba.
312

312

00:12:55,723  -->  00:12:57,723
Once again, color-white.
313

313

00:13:01,360  -->  00:13:04,750
And then let's say we want 80 percent of it to be white,
314

314

00:13:04,750  -->  00:13:07,414
with an opacity of 20 percent.
315

315

00:13:07,414  -->  00:13:08,382
Because what this means is that
316

316

00:13:08,382  -->  00:13:10,685
we can see through 80 percent,
317

317

00:13:10,685  -->  00:13:13,214
and so the remaining 20 percent is
318

318

00:13:13,214  -->  00:13:15,437
what you can see through the color.
319

319

00:13:15,437  -->  00:13:19,263
Now the font size that we want is 1.5.
320

320

00:13:19,263  -->  00:13:22,704
Because I experimented with 1.6rem,
321

321

00:13:22,704  -->  00:13:24,856
but it's way too big, actually.
322

322

00:13:24,856  -->  00:13:26,319
It doesn't look really natural,
323

323

00:13:26,319  -->  00:13:27,854
it doesn't look good.
324

324

00:13:27,854  -->  00:13:31,084
Now we also want some padding in these boxes.
325

325

00:13:31,084  -->  00:13:33,917
So 2.5rem, so basically 25 pixels.
326

326

00:13:36,405  -->  00:13:38,531
We want the text in them to be centered,
327

327

00:13:38,531  -->  00:13:40,281
if you remember that.
328

328

00:13:42,258  -->  00:13:45,625
And we want them to have a nice border-radius.
329

329

00:13:45,625  -->  00:13:47,864
Really a small one,
330

330

00:13:47,864  -->  00:13:49,021
so nothing too much,
331

331

00:13:49,021  -->  00:13:51,517
because that would look weird and not modern.
332

332

00:13:51,517  -->  00:13:52,735
But a very small one,
333

333

00:13:52,735  -->  00:13:54,993
then again, looks modern.
334

334

00:13:54,993  -->  00:13:57,833
And now finally, a box shadow.
335

335

00:13:57,833  -->  00:14:00,267
Because that also is a huge design trend
336

336

00:14:00,267  -->  00:14:01,572
that's going on right now,
337

337

00:14:01,572  -->  00:14:05,471
and so that's why I included it in this course.
338

338

00:14:05,471  -->  00:14:06,991
So you probably already know
339

339

00:14:06,991  -->  00:14:09,857
that I care a lot about great design.
340

340

00:14:09,857  -->  00:14:11,698
And that's why I build all my courses,
341

341

00:14:11,698  -->  00:14:14,698
actually, around these cool designs.
342

342

00:14:18,200  -->  00:14:19,672
And I try to make these projects
343

343

00:14:19,672  -->  00:14:21,636
as attractive as possible to you,
344

344

00:14:21,636  -->  00:14:24,053
so that it's more fun for you to code.
345

345

00:14:24,053  -->  00:14:24,915
Alright.
346

346

00:14:24,915  -->  00:14:27,591
So this is all pretty straight-forward and pretty easy.
347

347

00:14:27,591  -->  00:14:29,739
It's nothing really new to you anymore.
348

348

00:14:29,739  -->  00:14:34,317
And so, yeah, this looks pretty good already.
349

349

00:14:34,317  -->  00:14:36,899
Well, what's missing here is to give this some more space,
350

350

00:14:36,899  -->  00:14:38,867
just like we did up here.
351

351

00:14:38,867  -->  00:14:42,309
And then to just format the icon.
352

352

00:14:42,309  -->  00:14:46,476
So first, let's use the utility class that we used up here.
353

353

00:14:47,497  -->  00:14:50,787
So we want this small margin at the bottom
354

354

00:14:50,787  -->  00:14:52,682
going on here, as well.
355

355

00:14:52,682  -->  00:14:54,364
So where is that?
356

356

00:14:54,364  -->  00:14:56,364
Now yeah, so right here.
357

357

00:14:57,411  -->  00:14:58,244
Okay,
358

358

00:14:58,244  -->  00:15:02,441
and now we want to style the feature-box icon.
359

359

00:15:02,441  -->  00:15:04,140
And so it's already here.
360

360

00:15:04,140  -->  00:15:06,043
And so let's write some code for it.
361

361

00:15:06,043  -->  00:15:08,908
First thing we want to do is to increase it.
362

362

00:15:08,908  -->  00:15:11,403
And so remember that this is effectively a font.
363

363

00:15:11,403  -->  00:15:13,778
And so we can say font-size,
364

364

00:15:13,778  -->  00:15:16,698
in order to change the size of the icon.
365

365

00:15:16,698  -->  00:15:18,281
So font-size: 6rem,
366

366

00:15:19,136  -->  00:15:20,146
which is a lot,
367

367

00:15:20,146  -->  00:15:23,089
but it actually is the correct size.
368

368

00:15:23,089  -->  00:15:25,579
We wanted to add a margin to the bottom,
369

369

00:15:25,579  -->  00:15:27,579
like 5 pixels, so .5rem.
370

370

00:15:28,837  -->  00:15:31,963
And so let's now take a look at how it looks,
371

371

00:15:31,963  -->  00:15:35,572
and what our goal is for this icon.
372

372

00:15:35,572  -->  00:15:38,227
So I think I mentioned before that once again,
373

373

00:15:38,227  -->  00:15:41,453
this has this really nice gradient here going on,
374

374

00:15:41,453  -->  00:15:43,861
just like it has in here.
375

375

00:15:43,861  -->  00:15:46,641
And do you remember how we do that?
376

376

00:15:46,641  -->  00:15:47,817
Well, if you do,
377

377

00:15:47,817  -->  00:15:50,623
then this is the challenge for this section.
378

378

00:15:50,623  -->  00:15:53,124
So try to code up this gradient here,
379

379

00:15:53,124  -->  00:15:54,670
just like we did before.
380

380

00:15:54,670  -->  00:15:55,981
And so pause the video,
381

381

00:15:55,981  -->  00:15:59,662
and I'll be waiting for you to do that.
382

382

00:15:59,662  -->  00:16:01,702
So, did you manage to do it?
383

383

00:16:01,702  -->  00:16:03,316
I really hope so.
384

384

00:16:03,316  -->  00:16:04,759
Now I am not going to do it,
385

385

00:16:04,759  -->  00:16:07,477
I will just copy (chuckles) what we did before.
386

386

00:16:07,477  -->  00:16:09,347
So I'm a bit lazy here this time.
387

387

00:16:09,347  -->  00:16:11,822
So it's here in the typography, I remember.
388

388

00:16:11,822  -->  00:16:14,096
And it is here in the heading.
389

389

00:16:14,096  -->  00:16:15,846
So, background-image.
390

390

00:16:16,792  -->  00:16:18,480
Actually it starts in here,
391

391

00:16:18,480  -->  00:16:19,892
because we want the gradient to go
392

392

00:16:19,892  -->  00:16:22,246
from one side to the other only.
393

393

00:16:22,246  -->  00:16:23,996
And then all of this.
394

394

00:16:24,861  -->  00:16:27,395
Close it, put it here,
395

395

00:16:27,395  -->  00:16:29,171
and it should already be enough.
396

396

00:16:29,171  -->  00:16:30,630
So it's now an inline-block.
397

397

00:16:30,630  -->  00:16:32,372
It has this background-image,
398

398

00:16:32,372  -->  00:16:34,484
which is this gradient from green to green,
399

399

00:16:34,484  -->  00:16:35,954
light to dark green.
400

400

00:16:35,954  -->  00:16:38,466
And then it clips that gradient by the text.
401

401

00:16:38,466  -->  00:16:39,692
And remember that once again,
402

402

00:16:39,692  -->  00:16:44,538
we can do this because the icon font is text, in fact.
403

403

00:16:44,538  -->  00:16:47,223
And so once again we can use color,
404

404

00:16:47,223  -->  00:16:48,733
because it is text.
405

405

00:16:48,733  -->  00:16:51,502
So let's check out if this is already working.
406

406

00:16:51,502  -->  00:16:53,029
And indeed here it is,
407

407

00:16:53,029  -->  00:16:54,325
so, great.
408

408

00:16:54,325  -->  00:16:57,380
That's exactly how we want this to look like.
409

409

00:16:57,380  -->  00:17:01,426
The only thing that's missing now is this hover effect.
410

410

00:17:01,426  -->  00:17:03,621
So it goes up a little bit when we hover,
411

411

00:17:03,621  -->  00:17:06,163
and then it goes back down.
412

412

00:17:06,163  -->  00:17:07,485
Actually it doesn't only go up,
413

413

00:17:07,485  -->  00:17:09,318
it also scales, right?
414

414

00:17:10,573  -->  00:17:14,974
So what we need here is to add a line of code here,
415

415

00:17:14,974  -->  00:17:19,103
where we say when we hover the feature-box.
416

416

00:17:19,103  -->  00:17:20,060
So what happens?
417

417

00:17:20,060  -->  00:17:22,062
Of course there's a transform.
418

418

00:17:22,062  -->  00:17:22,895
And you're already noticing
419

419

00:17:22,895  -->  00:17:24,768
that we're using transform all the time.
420

420

00:17:24,768  -->  00:17:26,894
And that's because it's really an amazing property,
421

421

00:17:26,894  -->  00:17:28,862
it allows us to do so many stuff.
422

422

00:17:28,862  -->  00:17:30,575
So we want it to move up,
423

423

00:17:30,575  -->  00:17:32,206
and so by now you already know
424

424

00:17:32,206  -->  00:17:34,612
that we do that by using translateY,
425

425

00:17:34,612  -->  00:17:36,612
right, so in the Y direction.
426

426

00:17:36,612  -->  00:17:40,211
And then let's just get it up just a tiny little bit,
427

427

00:17:40,211  -->  00:17:42,378
like 1.03, just like this.
428

428

00:17:44,528  -->  00:17:47,361
Alright, now let's check that out.
429

429

00:17:49,688  -->  00:17:53,855
Okay, and of course, we're missing the transition here.
430

430

00:17:54,823  -->  00:17:58,279
So transition, and now we can actually write
431

431

00:17:58,279  -->  00:18:00,192
the property that we wanna animate,
432

432

00:18:00,192  -->  00:18:01,679
because it's just one.
433

433

00:18:01,679  -->  00:18:05,846
Transition, and let's do an animation of .3s this time.
434

434

00:18:09,094  -->  00:18:12,271
Actually we don't even need this selector here,
435

435

00:18:12,271  -->  00:18:14,783
because we're not formatting the code at all.
436

436

00:18:14,783  -->  00:18:17,148
So you're maybe asking why this, then,
437

437

00:18:17,148  -->  00:18:20,797
has the font size that we specified.
438

438

00:18:20,797  -->  00:18:24,565
And well, it does so because of inheritance.
439

439

00:18:24,565  -->  00:18:29,437
So we defined the font-size in the feature-box of 1.5rem.
440

440

00:18:29,437  -->  00:18:30,493
And then the paragraph,
441

441

00:18:30,493  -->  00:18:32,543
which is a child of the feature-box,
442

442

00:18:32,543  -->  00:18:34,540
simply inherits this font-size.
443

443

00:18:34,540  -->  00:18:36,373
So we just have to define it on the parent,
444

444

00:18:36,373  -->  00:18:39,358
and then it will automatically inherit.
445

445

00:18:39,358  -->  00:18:42,406
Okay, and so now it should work as expected.
446

446

00:18:42,406  -->  00:18:43,823
Well, not really.
447

447

00:18:45,140  -->  00:18:47,182
Let me check out why that is.
448

448

00:18:47,182  -->  00:18:48,555
Well of course,
449

449

00:18:48,555  -->  00:18:50,225
it's transform here.
450

450

00:18:50,225  -->  00:18:51,975
What a silly mistake.
451

451

00:18:52,962  -->  00:18:54,361
But that happens all the time.
452

452

00:18:54,361  -->  00:18:55,225
As you're coding,
453

453

00:18:55,225  -->  00:18:57,658
it's absolutely normal to make mistakes.
454

454

00:18:57,658  -->  00:18:58,872
And that's something you can't avoid,
455

455

00:18:58,872  -->  00:19:01,540
and it's really, it's not a problem.
456

456

00:19:01,540  -->  00:19:02,489
I do these mistakes,
457

457

00:19:02,489  -->  00:19:03,689
you probably do these mistakes,
458

458

00:19:03,689  -->  00:19:07,770
and everyone does these kind of silly mistakes.
459

459

00:19:07,770  -->  00:19:09,510
And so what we have to do now
460

460

00:19:09,510  -->  00:19:12,510
is to just complete our markup here.
461

461

00:19:16,658  -->  00:19:18,879
Well, what's going on in here?
462

462

00:19:18,879  -->  00:19:20,182
I'm not really sure.
463

463

00:19:20,182  -->  00:19:23,471
I don't think there's any mistakes.
464

464

00:19:23,471  -->  00:19:25,304
Well, that's this div,
465

465

00:19:26,429  -->  00:19:27,526
that's this one,
466

466

00:19:27,526  -->  00:19:28,663
that closes here,
467

467

00:19:28,663  -->  00:19:29,910
and that closes here.
468

468

00:19:29,910  -->  00:19:31,286
Well it's a weird formatting,
469

469

00:19:31,286  -->  00:19:34,399
but I'm not gonna fix that right now.
470

470

00:19:34,399  -->  00:19:36,149
What I want now is to
471

471

00:19:37,872  -->  00:19:39,870
check out this font reference here.
472

472

00:19:39,870  -->  00:19:42,544
So the next one that we want is the compass.
473

473

00:19:42,544  -->  00:19:44,607
So where is that?
474

474

00:19:44,607  -->  00:19:48,107
It's probably just called compass, anyway.
475

475

00:19:48,997  -->  00:19:50,164
So here it is.
476

476

00:19:52,190  -->  00:19:53,791
So this one here is called compass,
477

477

00:19:53,791  -->  00:19:57,014
actually no need to even copy anything,
478

478

00:19:57,014  -->  00:19:58,430
or paste.
479

479

00:19:58,430  -->  00:20:01,965
So the compass, then the next one.
480

480

00:20:01,965  -->  00:20:03,358
Let's take a look.
481

481

00:20:03,358  -->  00:20:06,025
It's the map and then the heart.
482

482

00:20:07,088  -->  00:20:08,838
So map, that's right.
483

483

00:20:09,804  -->  00:20:13,554
And then let's just check if there's a heart.
484

484

00:20:15,145  -->  00:20:16,899
Alright, so, heart.
485

485

00:20:16,899  -->  00:20:18,482
So, map, and heart.
486

486

00:20:22,992  -->  00:20:24,637
And the text that we have for these,
487

487

00:20:24,637  -->  00:20:26,877
the first one was Explore the world.
488

488

00:20:26,877  -->  00:20:29,210
The next one is Meet nature.
489

489

00:20:33,305  -->  00:20:35,555
Then we have Find your way.
490

490

00:20:37,086  -->  00:20:40,003
And finally, Live a healthier life.
491

491

00:20:43,577  -->  00:20:45,410
So let's check it out.
492

492

00:20:46,520  -->  00:20:48,756
Alright, so here we go.
493

493

00:20:48,756  -->  00:20:50,438
Well, something that is weird here
494

494

00:20:50,438  -->  00:20:51,867
is this really small space
495

495

00:20:51,867  -->  00:20:54,062
that we have here between these boxes.
496

496

00:20:54,062  -->  00:20:56,413
It's different than this one here.
497

497

00:20:56,413  -->  00:20:58,996
So let me just check this out.
498

498

00:21:00,028  -->  00:21:02,195
So, everything looks good,
499

499

00:21:03,355  -->  00:21:05,410
but, oh yeah okay, I see.
500

500

00:21:05,410  -->  00:21:07,075
So here, we have this small margin,
501

501

00:21:07,075  -->  00:21:09,857
this really small margin, only 2rem.
502

502

00:21:09,857  -->  00:21:12,138
And I remember that we changed this,
503

503

00:21:12,138  -->  00:21:15,356
where I demonstrated to you how great it is
504

504

00:21:15,356  -->  00:21:19,523
to have a variable to set the gutter off the grid.
505

505

00:21:20,796  -->  00:21:21,629
So it's here.
506

506

00:21:21,629  -->  00:21:22,624
So I set this to 2,
507

507

00:21:22,624  -->  00:21:24,602
but it originally was at 6.
508

508

00:21:24,602  -->  00:21:27,412
So let's set it back to 6 now,
509

509

00:21:27,412  -->  00:21:28,500
and then take a look.
510

510

00:21:28,500  -->  00:21:29,498
And okay, yeah,
511

511

00:21:29,498  -->  00:21:32,266
so this looks better now.
512

512

00:21:32,266  -->  00:21:33,642
And actually up here,
513

513

00:21:33,642  -->  00:21:36,360
I also thought before that it was really close.
514

514

00:21:36,360  -->  00:21:38,380
And now I know why that was,
515

515

00:21:38,380  -->  00:21:40,931
it was also because of this small gutter.
516

516

00:21:40,931  -->  00:21:42,411
Now we have a bit too much text here,
517

517

00:21:42,411  -->  00:21:44,474
let's just delete a couple of words
518

518

00:21:44,474  -->  00:21:48,101
so that it looks more natural like it did before.
519

519

00:21:48,101  -->  00:21:51,019
But here, everything is great now.
520

520

00:21:51,019  -->  00:21:54,185
So the next step is to put it like this,
521

521

00:21:54,185  -->  00:21:56,768
so to skew this entire section.
522

522

00:21:58,601  -->  00:21:59,527
Okay?
523

523

00:21:59,527  -->  00:22:02,285
So this was just a small mistake,
524

524

00:22:02,285  -->  00:22:05,452
just a small bug that I forgot to fix.
525

525

00:22:06,821  -->  00:22:10,321
Alright, just delete some words from here.
526

526

00:22:12,567  -->  00:22:14,361
And so, yeah,
527

527

00:22:14,361  -->  00:22:17,362
let's go back to the feature-box.
528

528

00:22:17,362  -->  00:22:19,779
Or actually to the home file,
529

529

00:22:20,762  -->  00:22:24,373
because it's here in the section-features definition,
530

530

00:22:24,373  -->  00:22:28,540
where we are going to take care of the skewed design.
531

531

00:22:29,750  -->  00:22:32,635
So how are we going to do that?
532

532

00:22:32,635  -->  00:22:35,094
So maybe the first thing that comes to your mind
533

533

00:22:35,094  -->  00:22:37,159
is to again, use the clip-path property
534

534

00:22:37,159  -->  00:22:39,694
that we used before on the heading.
535

535

00:22:39,694  -->  00:22:41,878
And yeah, we could theoretically do that,
536

536

00:22:41,878  -->  00:22:43,062
and it would be okay.
537

537

00:22:43,062  -->  00:22:45,690
But I wanted to show you another nice trick,
538

538

00:22:45,690  -->  00:22:47,288
and that is the following.
539

539

00:22:47,288  -->  00:22:52,101
So what we can do is to simply skew the entire section.
540

540

00:22:52,101  -->  00:22:53,813
So we use a transform,
541

541

00:22:53,813  -->  00:22:57,079
and we used skew before, so skew.
542

542

00:22:57,079  -->  00:23:00,158
But we want to do it in the Y direction.
543

543

00:23:00,158  -->  00:23:02,687
So let's set it to -7deg.
544

544

00:23:02,687  -->  00:23:04,911
Now I'm going to show you the differences in a second
545

545

00:23:04,911  -->  00:23:06,909
in the inspector, okay?
546

546

00:23:06,909  -->  00:23:09,533
So let's just check it out here.
547

547

00:23:09,533  -->  00:23:10,704
And so here we go.
548

548

00:23:10,704  -->  00:23:11,744
Don't worry about this one,
549

549

00:23:11,744  -->  00:23:13,473
we're gonna fix it in a second.
550

550

00:23:13,473  -->  00:23:16,250
But now this is what it looks like.
551

551

00:23:16,250  -->  00:23:17,083
Alright?
552

552

00:23:17,083  -->  00:23:18,333
So let me just,
553

553

00:23:19,614  -->  00:23:21,117
show different values to you.
554

554

00:23:21,117  -->  00:23:23,166
So -7 looks like this.
555

555

00:23:23,166  -->  00:23:25,122
So from 0, it would be like this.
556

556

00:23:25,122  -->  00:23:27,118
And if we put positive values,
557

557

00:23:27,118  -->  00:23:28,989
it starts skewing in this direction.
558

558

00:23:28,989  -->  00:23:29,822
Okay?
559

559

00:23:32,588  -->  00:23:33,860
But with the negative value,
560

560

00:23:33,860  -->  00:23:35,619
it then moves upwards,
561

561

00:23:35,619  -->  00:23:37,099
so it skews upwards.
562

562

00:23:37,099  -->  00:23:39,340
And I chose -7 simply because,
563

563

00:23:39,340  -->  00:23:43,332
visually, it looks like this is the same inclination now
564

564

00:23:43,332  -->  00:23:44,832
as this one, okay?
565

565

00:23:45,944  -->  00:23:48,277
So it's just a visual thing.
566

566

00:23:49,126  -->  00:23:51,438
Now, two things that we have to fix here.
567

567

00:23:51,438  -->  00:23:53,502
First up, since we are skewing all of this,
568

568

00:23:53,502  -->  00:23:56,828
we now created this wide gap here.
569

569

00:23:56,828  -->  00:23:58,117
So what can we do about that?
570

570

00:23:58,117  -->  00:24:00,178
We simply move up the entire thing
571

571

00:24:00,178  -->  00:24:01,726
by a couple of pixels here,
572

572

00:24:01,726  -->  00:24:03,214
a couple of rems,
573

573

00:24:03,214  -->  00:24:06,679
so that it covers all of this white.
574

574

00:24:06,679  -->  00:24:09,120
And the next thing is then to, of course,
575

575

00:24:09,120  -->  00:24:11,824
put these back in their original position.
576

576

00:24:11,824  -->  00:24:13,561
And let's actually start with that.
577

577

00:24:13,561  -->  00:24:15,697
So how do you think we're gonna do that?
578

578

00:24:15,697  -->  00:24:17,794
Well, the most intuitive thing to do
579

579

00:24:17,794  -->  00:24:20,922
is to simply skew these in the opposite direction,
580

580

00:24:20,922  -->  00:24:21,755
right?
581

581

00:24:21,755  -->  00:24:22,836
And that's what we're gonna do.
582

582

00:24:22,836  -->  00:24:26,227
So we skewed the entire section by -7deg,
583

583

00:24:26,227  -->  00:24:29,705
and so let's just skew these boxes by seven degrees,
584

584

00:24:29,705  -->  00:24:32,407
so they basically just skew back.
585

585

00:24:32,407  -->  00:24:35,809
And now, we could go ahead and go into the feature-boxes,
586

586

00:24:35,809  -->  00:24:38,019
and then implement that here.
587

587

00:24:38,019  -->  00:24:40,656
So put the skew, and put seven degrees.
588

588

00:24:40,656  -->  00:24:42,305
But we're gonna do it differently.
589

589

00:24:42,305  -->  00:24:44,289
Because imagine that one day,
590

590

00:24:44,289  -->  00:24:46,833
we want to put something else here in the section-features.
591

591

00:24:46,833  -->  00:24:49,676
Okay, so, imagine we add a couple of other boxes
592

592

00:24:49,676  -->  00:24:51,609
with different names or something.
593

593

00:24:51,609  -->  00:24:53,735
And then, what would we do?
594

594

00:24:53,735  -->  00:24:55,690
We would then have to add that transform,
595

595

00:24:55,690  -->  00:24:57,311
and this new content as well.
596

596

00:24:57,311  -->  00:24:58,882
And so we don't want to do that.
597

597

00:24:58,882  -->  00:24:59,825
And so what I'm gonna do
598

598

00:24:59,825  -->  00:25:02,144
is that I will show you a new selector,
599

599

00:25:02,144  -->  00:25:04,688
which is a direct child selector.
600

600

00:25:04,688  -->  00:25:06,912
So let's write it like this.
601

601

00:25:06,912  -->  00:25:09,368
So ampersand and then direct child.
602

602

00:25:09,368  -->  00:25:13,173
And the direct childs that I want to select are all of them.
603

603

00:25:13,173  -->  00:25:14,843
And so the universal selector here.
604

604

00:25:14,843  -->  00:25:17,948
So universal selector simply selects everything.
605

605

00:25:17,948  -->  00:25:20,643
But only everything that is a direct child
606

606

00:25:20,643  -->  00:25:23,006
of the section-features.
607

607

00:25:23,006  -->  00:25:24,445
Okay, and that's it.
608

608

00:25:24,445  -->  00:25:28,467
So let me demonstrate to you how it would look like
609

609

00:25:28,467  -->  00:25:29,935
in compiled CSS.
610

610

00:25:29,935  -->  00:25:34,153
So basically, section-features and then direct childs,
611

611

00:25:34,153  -->  00:25:35,401
all of them.
612

612

00:25:35,401  -->  00:25:37,990
And why do we have to use this direct child?
613

613

00:25:37,990  -->  00:25:40,036
So if you would just do it like this,
614

614

00:25:40,036  -->  00:25:42,792
we would select all the childs, right?
615

615

00:25:42,792  -->  00:25:44,393
Not only the direct childs,
616

616

00:25:44,393  -->  00:25:46,441
but simply all the children element.
617

617

00:25:46,441  -->  00:25:47,511
And we don't wanna do that.
618

618

00:25:47,511  -->  00:25:50,011
We only want to select the direct children.
619

619

00:25:50,011  -->  00:25:52,928
So in the HTML, let me take a look.
620

620

00:25:54,620  -->  00:25:58,210
So the direct children is actually only one child,
621

621

00:25:58,210  -->  00:25:59,049
and it's that one.
622

622

00:25:59,049  -->  00:26:00,271
So it's the row.
623

623

00:26:00,271  -->  00:26:02,441
And so basically what this command does
624

624

00:26:02,441  -->  00:26:04,465
is it takes this element here,
625

625

00:26:04,465  -->  00:26:07,556
and it skews the row by minus seven degrees.
626

626

00:26:07,556  -->  00:26:10,293
Well we haven't written that, but we will.
627

627

00:26:10,293  -->  00:26:12,089
And of course it's here.
628

628

00:26:12,089  -->  00:26:15,172
And so, let's simply do it like this.
629

629

00:26:19,994  -->  00:26:22,244
Alright, let's take a look.
630

630

00:26:23,652  -->  00:26:25,464
And indeed, here we go.
631

631

00:26:25,464  -->  00:26:29,498
Let me check it in the inspector here, as well.
632

632

00:26:29,498  -->  00:26:31,882
So you see that in here,
633

633

00:26:31,882  -->  00:26:33,661
this is where it applies.
634

634

00:26:33,661  -->  00:26:35,315
In here, it does not apply.
635

635

00:26:35,315  -->  00:26:37,945
It only applies here, alright?
636

636

00:26:37,945  -->  00:26:39,385
So if we take this out,
637

637

00:26:39,385  -->  00:26:40,986
it looks like it did before.
638

638

00:26:40,986  -->  00:26:42,139
And if we put it back,
639

639

00:26:42,139  -->  00:26:43,922
then of course it's skewed.
640

640

00:26:43,922  -->  00:26:46,165
So again, it's skewed basically in the other direction
641

641

00:26:46,165  -->  00:26:49,880
to compensate for the skewing of the entire section.
642

642

00:26:49,880  -->  00:26:52,399
Now if we didn't have the selector like this,
643

643

00:26:52,399  -->  00:26:55,186
let me actually change it.
644

644

00:26:55,186  -->  00:26:57,628
So without the direct child,
645

645

00:26:57,628  -->  00:27:00,147
then everything would be skewed as well.
646

646

00:27:00,147  -->  00:27:02,771
And so now we have this one who is skewed,
647

647

00:27:02,771  -->  00:27:04,051
so it looks really weird now.
648

648

00:27:04,051  -->  00:27:06,668
So this one is now skewed, this box.
649

649

00:27:06,668  -->  00:27:07,859
And then in there,
650

650

00:27:07,859  -->  00:27:10,220
the three elements are also skewed.
651

651

00:27:10,220  -->  00:27:12,670
So these here are triple-skewed,
652

652

00:27:12,670  -->  00:27:14,076
so they are skewed three times.
653

653

00:27:14,076  -->  00:27:15,364
Because the parent is skewed,
654

654

00:27:15,364  -->  00:27:17,175
and the parent of that one is skewed as well,
655

655

00:27:17,175  -->  00:27:19,258
and so it's really weird.
656

656

00:27:20,308  -->  00:27:21,883
So you see now,
657

657

00:27:21,883  -->  00:27:24,300
well, it doesn't appear here.
658

658

00:27:25,406  -->  00:27:28,772
But anyway, so that's what would happen
659

659

00:27:28,772  -->  00:27:31,324
if you would not have used the direct child.
660

660

00:27:31,324  -->  00:27:33,531
So again, the direct child will only select
661

661

00:27:33,531  -->  00:27:36,242
the first child that it comes across basically,
662

662

00:27:36,242  -->  00:27:39,626
and then apply the styles that we put in there.
663

663

00:27:39,626  -->  00:27:40,857
Alright?
664

664

00:27:40,857  -->  00:27:42,610
And so, this was another way
665

665

00:27:42,610  -->  00:27:45,610
of doing this skewed section design.
666

666

00:27:46,522  -->  00:27:50,195
And of course this image here is now skewed.
667

667

00:27:50,195  -->  00:27:52,386
It doesn't look the same way it looked before.
668

668

00:27:52,386  -->  00:27:53,715
But you don't really notice that,
669

669

00:27:53,715  -->  00:27:56,088
so it's not really a big problem.
670

670

00:27:56,088  -->  00:27:56,921
Alright,
671

671

00:27:56,921  -->  00:27:57,958
and now what we just have to do
672

672

00:27:57,958  -->  00:28:00,888
is to move up the entire thing a little bit.
673

673

00:28:00,888  -->  00:28:04,420
And let's do that by trial and error, basically.
674

674

00:28:04,420  -->  00:28:06,486
So section-features,
675

675

00:28:06,486  -->  00:28:10,653
let's just simply apply a negative margin here to the top.
676

676

00:28:11,576  -->  00:28:13,409
So margin-top, -10rem.
677

677

00:28:16,117  -->  00:28:17,711
So we're starting with 10rem,
678

678

00:28:17,711  -->  00:28:20,711
and let's see how far we have to go.
679

679

00:28:21,783  -->  00:28:24,601
And so it already is covering now
680

680

00:28:24,601  -->  00:28:25,539
the other section,
681

681

00:28:25,539  -->  00:28:28,963
exactly like we wanted it to look like.
682

682

00:28:28,963  -->  00:28:30,546
Let me take a look.
683

683

00:28:33,701  -->  00:28:35,300
Well, this is actually it.
684

684

00:28:35,300  -->  00:28:36,171
And for some reason,
685

685

00:28:36,171  -->  00:28:38,620
I cannot manipulate this right now.
686

686

00:28:38,620  -->  00:28:40,901
Well, what's happening here?
687

687

00:28:40,901  -->  00:28:42,870
Let me reload the page.
688

688

00:28:42,870  -->  00:28:45,597
Alright, so for some reason that didn't work.
689

689

00:28:45,597  -->  00:28:46,539
But it does now.
690

690

00:28:46,539  -->  00:28:48,907
So with -11, it doesn't really work.
691

691

00:28:48,907  -->  00:28:53,087
<v ->9, so at -9 you already see this white thing here.</v>
692

692

00:28:53,087  -->  00:28:54,610
So just to be sure,
693

693

00:28:54,610  -->  00:28:57,679
let's leave it at -10rem, okay?
694

694

00:28:57,679  -->  00:28:59,961
And so now we're good to go.
695

695

00:28:59,961  -->  00:29:00,993
Okay.
696

696

00:29:00,993  -->  00:29:02,510
Now we see that by doing this,
697

697

00:29:02,510  -->  00:29:06,645
we don't have a lot of space here in this section.
698

698

00:29:06,645  -->  00:29:08,533
So this is really close,
699

699

00:29:08,533  -->  00:29:10,427
but I think it's still alright.
700

700

00:29:10,427  -->  00:29:13,355
We can leave it like that.
701

701

00:29:13,355  -->  00:29:14,647
And maybe if, in the end,
702

702

00:29:14,647  -->  00:29:15,912
it does look strange,
703

703

00:29:15,912  -->  00:29:20,512
we can then do a final adjustment of that, okay?
704

704

00:29:20,512  -->  00:29:21,968
And so I think that is it,
705

705

00:29:21,968  -->  00:29:24,858
and that's everything I had to show you for this lecture.
706

706

00:29:24,858  -->  00:29:26,852
So I'm showing you a lot of different things.
707

707

00:29:26,852  -->  00:29:27,685
As you can see,
708

708

00:29:27,685  -->  00:29:29,345
I'm showing you a lot of selectors,
709

709

00:29:29,345  -->  00:29:30,808
a lot of new properties,
710

710

00:29:30,808  -->  00:29:35,455
basically a lot of new tools for your CSS toolkit.
711

711

00:29:35,455  -->  00:29:37,723
And I'm doing that because I want you to be able
712

712

00:29:37,723  -->  00:29:40,987
to use all these tools in your future websites.
713

713

00:29:40,987  -->  00:29:42,779
So I hope you're really following this,
714

714

00:29:42,779  -->  00:29:44,090
and understanding this.
715

715

00:29:44,090  -->  00:29:46,699
Because I don't want you to just copy my designs
716

716

00:29:46,699  -->  00:29:48,487
when you start building your own websites.
717

717

00:29:48,487  -->  00:29:50,994
I want you to truly and deeply understand
718

718

00:29:50,994  -->  00:29:52,208
exactly what I'm doing,
719

719

00:29:52,208  -->  00:29:53,809
and the tools I'm giving you,
720

720

00:29:53,809  -->  00:29:56,625
so that you can then use them in your own designs
721

721

00:29:56,625  -->  00:29:59,340
and coming up with your own designs, as well.
722

722

00:29:59,340  -->  00:30:00,173
So with all of this,
723

723

00:30:00,173  -->  00:30:01,057
I want to give you tools,
724

724

00:30:01,057  -->  00:30:02,339
and I want to make you think,
725

725

00:30:02,339  -->  00:30:04,273
think about how everything works.
726

726

00:30:04,273  -->  00:30:05,841
And in the end,
727

727

00:30:05,841  -->  00:30:08,690
just make you a capable CSS developer.
728

728

00:30:08,690  -->  00:30:11,881
So that is really my goal with all of this.
729

729

00:30:11,881  -->  00:30:14,798
But enough talk, see you next time.
