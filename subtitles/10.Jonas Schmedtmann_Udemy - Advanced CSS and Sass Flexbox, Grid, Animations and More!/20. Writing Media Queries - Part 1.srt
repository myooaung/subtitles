00:00:01,725  -->  00:00:04,218
<v Jonas>With our interface finally completed,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,218  -->  00:00:06,727
it's now time to write some media queries
3

3

00:00:06,727  -->  00:00:09,382
to optimize it for smaller screens.
4

4

00:00:09,382  -->  00:00:10,813
Now, we have learned about
5

5

00:00:10,813  -->  00:00:12,598
how to do this before in this course,
6

6

00:00:12,598  -->  00:00:15,767
so it's not really something new at this point.
7

7

00:00:15,767  -->  00:00:20,122
However, what is new is how easy flex box makes the process
8

8

00:00:20,122  -->  00:00:22,724
of making our layout completely responsive
9

9

00:00:22,724  -->  00:00:25,047
with just a small amount of code.
10

10

00:00:25,047  -->  00:00:26,810
In this lecture, and the next one,
11

11

00:00:26,810  -->  00:00:29,613
that's what we're gonna do so that I can actually show you
12

12

00:00:29,613  -->  00:00:33,056
how easy it is and not just tell you.
13

13

00:00:33,056  -->  00:00:34,750
Now, about the breakpoints,
14

14

00:00:34,750  -->  00:00:37,347
this time we're gonna use a different strategy.
15

15

00:00:37,347  -->  00:00:39,112
We're gonna use that strategy
16

16

00:00:39,112  -->  00:00:41,161
where we basically set the breakpoints
17

17

00:00:41,161  -->  00:00:44,008
to where the design starts to break, okay?
18

18

00:00:44,008  -->  00:00:45,562
So that's what I called, back then,
19

19

00:00:45,562  -->  00:00:47,902
the perfect way of doing stuff.
20

20

00:00:47,902  -->  00:00:49,912
Now, we're still gonna keep the old breakpoints
21

21

00:00:49,912  -->  00:00:52,720
that we used in the other project in mind as well,
22

22

00:00:52,720  -->  00:00:54,643
but only if there is actually something
23

23

00:00:54,643  -->  00:00:56,528
that breaks at these width.
24

24

00:00:56,528  -->  00:00:59,861
Okay, so, let's now start taking a look,
25

25

00:01:00,991  -->  00:01:03,077
and set this here to mobile right?
26

26

00:01:03,077  -->  00:01:06,536
That we have our responsive layout in this nice view here.
27

27

00:01:06,536  -->  00:01:10,536
Now, this is what I wanted to reduce, all right!
28

28

00:01:11,803  -->  00:01:14,519
Let's start decreasing this.
29

29

00:01:14,519  -->  00:01:18,921
You see we are at 1500 pixels approximately now.
30

30

00:01:18,921  -->  00:01:22,787
Okay, so now we're at about 1200, okay?
31

31

00:01:22,787  -->  00:01:24,402
And that's the max-width
32

32

00:01:24,402  -->  00:01:26,500
that we define for our container here.
33

33

00:01:26,500  -->  00:01:27,667
Remember that?
34

34

00:01:27,667  -->  00:01:30,839
So the container here has 120 REMs,
35

35

00:01:30,839  -->  00:01:32,847
so 1200 pixels basically.
36

36

00:01:32,847  -->  00:01:35,119
So if it starts decreasing furthermore,
37

37

00:01:35,119  -->  00:01:37,599
then of course the width becomes 100%
38

38

00:01:37,599  -->  00:01:39,417
of the available view port width,
39

39

00:01:39,417  -->  00:01:42,963
because that's exactly what max-width here does, okay?
40

40

00:01:42,963  -->  00:01:45,031
Now, we want to change something here
41

41

00:01:45,031  -->  00:01:48,427
which is actually removing this part here from the top,
42

42

00:01:48,427  -->  00:01:50,856
because that starts to look a bit weird.
43

43

00:01:50,856  -->  00:01:53,631
So what I'm trying to say is that our first breakpoint
44

44

00:01:53,631  -->  00:01:56,052
should be at 1200 pixels.
45

45

00:01:56,052  -->  00:01:57,907
So, as soon as we approach this here,
46

46

00:01:57,907  -->  00:02:00,997
then we move the container all the way up here to the top,
47

47

00:02:00,997  -->  00:02:04,813
and so we don't have this pink background color anymore.
48

48

00:02:04,813  -->  00:02:07,334
Neither at the sides, and nor at the top.
49

49

00:02:07,334  -->  00:02:10,095
So that is going to be our first breakpoint.
50

50

00:02:10,095  -->  00:02:12,157
Now about the media queries themselves,
51

51

00:02:12,157  -->  00:02:13,275
in the last project,
52

52

00:02:13,275  -->  00:02:17,281
we actually wrote that huge media-query manager,
53

53

00:02:17,281  -->  00:02:19,683
but right now I wanna keep it simple here, okay?
54

54

00:02:19,683  -->  00:02:21,806
So, all we're gonna do is just write out
55

55

00:02:21,806  -->  00:02:23,824
the media queries in the old way.
56

56

00:02:23,824  -->  00:02:26,141
So, let's go here to our layout,
57

57

00:02:26,141  -->  00:02:27,824
and to our container,
58

58

00:02:27,824  -->  00:02:29,483
and so all we have to do
59

59

00:02:29,483  -->  00:02:32,582
is to now add the media query in here.
60

60

00:02:32,582  -->  00:02:34,415
So media, only screen,
61

61

00:02:37,575  -->  00:02:39,386
and then our condition.
62

62

00:02:39,386  -->  00:02:40,957
Now keep in mind that now, once again,
63

63

00:02:40,957  -->  00:02:44,079
we are using a desktop-first strategy, right?
64

64

00:02:44,079  -->  00:02:48,246
So our media queries here will be off to type max-width.
65

65

00:02:49,415  -->  00:02:52,856
So just like in the other project we did before.
66

66

00:02:52,856  -->  00:02:55,356
So max-width, and 1200 pixels.
67

67

00:02:57,314  -->  00:02:58,837
Now two things about that,
68

68

00:02:58,837  -->  00:03:01,841
first we should have this width here in Ms",
69

69

00:03:01,841  -->  00:03:03,780
because of the reasons that I explained to you
70

70

00:03:03,780  -->  00:03:04,616
in the last project,
71

71

00:03:04,616  -->  00:03:07,804
and second, I actually want this to be variables,
72

72

00:03:07,804  -->  00:03:09,600
so that I don't have to write out
73

73

00:03:09,600  -->  00:03:11,039
this number here all the time,
74

74

00:03:11,039  -->  00:03:13,178
each time that I am going to use it.
75

75

00:03:13,178  -->  00:03:15,908
So, let's do that in the base CSS.
76

76

00:03:15,908  -->  00:03:18,194
Now probably, you think that we will do it
77

77

00:03:18,194  -->  00:03:20,729
as a CSS custom property right?
78

78

00:03:20,729  -->  00:03:23,944
But the thing is that that doesn't work okay?
79

79

00:03:23,944  -->  00:03:26,384
So, we cannot declare one of these variables here,
80

80

00:03:26,384  -->  00:03:29,176
and then use it in a media query here in this place.
81

81

00:03:29,176  -->  00:03:30,265
That simply doesn't work.
82

82

00:03:30,265  -->  00:03:32,602
CSS doesn't allow it to work.
83

83

00:03:32,602  -->  00:03:35,916
So we have to do it with SaaS variables, okay?
84

84

00:03:35,916  -->  00:03:38,166
So that's absolutely no problem at all.
85

85

00:03:38,166  -->  00:03:40,834
We can mix CSS custom properties,
86

86

00:03:40,834  -->  00:03:42,330
and use them for some use cases,
87

87

00:03:42,330  -->  00:03:44,865
and then use SaaS variables for other stuff.
88

88

00:03:44,865  -->  00:03:46,379
So, no problem at all.
89

89

00:03:46,379  -->  00:03:49,044
So, remember this is how we determine SaaS variables.
90

90

00:03:49,044  -->  00:03:52,044
I'm gonna call it bp for breakpoint.
91

91

00:03:53,021  -->  00:03:55,771
And then this one is the largest,
92

92

00:03:56,643  -->  00:04:00,484
and it's 75em, and let me show that to you.
93

93

00:04:00,484  -->  00:04:02,817
So 1200 divided by 16 is 75,
94

94

00:04:05,053  -->  00:04:08,386
so 75em, not rem, but em is what I want.
95

95

00:04:11,542  -->  00:04:15,684
So 1200 pixels just so that we can remember it later
96

96

00:04:15,684  -->  00:04:17,306
when we use it.
97

97

00:04:17,306  -->  00:04:18,930
That's he largest breakpoint.
98

98

00:04:18,930  -->  00:04:22,930
Now, we can actually use this, so let's copy it.
99

99

00:04:24,939  -->  00:04:28,997
All right, that is our media query for the container.
100

100

00:04:28,997  -->  00:04:30,997
And what do we actually want to change here?
101

101

00:04:30,997  -->  00:04:31,950
Well, it's very simple,
102

102

00:04:31,950  -->  00:04:36,130
all we wanna do is to set the margin to zero, right?
103

103

00:04:36,130  -->  00:04:38,327
So, before we had 8rem, top and bottom,
104

104

00:04:38,327  -->  00:04:40,184
and auto on the left and the right side
105

105

00:04:40,184  -->  00:04:42,655
to center the container inside its parent element.
106

106

00:04:42,655  -->  00:04:44,256
But right now we don't need that anymore,
107

107

00:04:44,256  -->  00:04:46,692
because it's already filling the entire view port anyway.
108

108

00:04:46,692  -->  00:04:50,353
So just margin zero should fix that.
109

109

00:04:50,353  -->  00:04:53,150
Actually, here it's already working.
110

110

00:04:53,150  -->  00:04:56,435
So we approach 1200 here, and then, bam,
111

111

00:04:56,435  -->  00:04:58,043
all the margin disappear.
112

112

00:04:58,043  -->  00:05:01,298
And up here you also can already see our media query, right?
113

113

00:05:01,298  -->  00:05:03,551
All right, nothing that's all we have to change,
114

114

00:05:03,551  -->  00:05:06,521
actually, for this width, so let's now continue
115

115

00:05:06,521  -->  00:05:08,688
to move down a little bit.
116

116

00:05:10,337  -->  00:05:13,994
And it starts looking a bit weird down here already,
117

117

00:05:13,994  -->  00:05:16,911
but let's keeping going just a bit.
118

118

00:05:18,079  -->  00:05:19,615
And now you see that down here
119

119

00:05:19,615  -->  00:05:21,398
it's also now moving to a new line,
120

120

00:05:21,398  -->  00:05:23,390
and so that's not really ideal,
121

121

00:05:23,390  -->  00:05:27,112
and so what I wanna do is to keep here at 1100,
122

122

00:05:27,112  -->  00:05:28,684
and change the global font size,
123

123

00:05:28,684  -->  00:05:30,609
and that will them decrease all the length,
124

124

00:05:30,609  -->  00:05:32,511
which are measured in rem right?
125

125

00:05:32,511  -->  00:05:34,979
So, once more that's exactly what we did
126

126

00:05:34,979  -->  00:05:36,224
with the Nater's Project.
127

127

00:05:36,224  -->  00:05:38,848
Decreasing the font size, which are sized in rem,
128

128

00:05:38,848  -->  00:05:41,896
which in turn depends on the global font size.
129

129

00:05:41,896  -->  00:05:44,563
So, this is our next breakpoint.
130

130

00:05:47,979  -->  00:05:51,479
So large, and 1100 divided by 16 is 68.75.
131

131

00:06:02,055  -->  00:06:04,530
All right so, 1100 pixels,
132

132

00:06:04,530  -->  00:06:07,754
and actually that one is here in the base-file,
133

133

00:06:07,754  -->  00:06:10,171
so that's just included here.
134

134

00:06:13,504  -->  00:06:17,087
Select media only for screens and max-width
135

135

00:06:21,266  -->  00:06:22,266
of bp-large.
136

136

00:06:24,608  -->  00:06:27,904
All right, so right now our font size is 62.5%,
137

137

00:06:27,904  -->  00:06:30,832
which makes it so that one rem is 10 pixels.
138

138

00:06:30,832  -->  00:06:33,214
Now, let's decrease that to eight pixels.
139

139

00:06:33,214  -->  00:06:38,132
Okay, so eight divided by 16 is, of course, 50%.
140

140

00:06:38,132  -->  00:06:40,049
So, font size 50%.
141

141

00:06:43,016  -->  00:06:47,016
And that's actually it, so let's test it out.
142

142

00:06:47,016  -->  00:06:48,325
And, yeah, that looks better,
143

143

00:06:48,325  -->  00:06:50,323
but actually we have another problem here now,
144

144

00:06:50,323  -->  00:06:52,507
which is that the space here is back,
145

145

00:06:52,507  -->  00:06:55,850
and that's because the 120 rem that we defined for the width
146

146

00:06:55,850  -->  00:06:59,256
of the container are now no longer 1200 pixels,
147

147

00:06:59,256  -->  00:07:01,874
But instead, they are, let's calculate that,
148

148

00:07:01,874  -->  00:07:05,591
so, 120 rem which are now only eight pixels,
149

149

00:07:05,591  -->  00:07:09,990
and so that's now only 960 pixels, no longer 1200 pixels.
150

150

00:07:09,990  -->  00:07:12,260
So let's just very quickly fix that,
151

151

00:07:12,260  -->  00:07:14,843
and saying here, in the layout,
152

152

00:07:16,006  -->  00:07:19,673
for a container that right now the max-width
153

153

00:07:20,599  -->  00:07:23,899
should be 100%, and we can also say that
154

154

00:07:23,899  -->  00:07:28,066
width should be 100% just to be 100% sure.
155

155

00:07:29,655  -->  00:07:31,798
Now that should be fixed.
156

156

00:07:31,798  -->  00:07:32,631
Yeah.
157

157

00:07:35,484  -->  00:07:38,261
So we hit 1110, bam, here we go.
158

158

00:07:38,261  -->  00:07:40,080
Now we still see some space down here,
159

159

00:07:40,080  -->  00:07:42,747
let me see where that came from.
160

160

00:07:45,578  -->  00:07:47,554
So where is that container?
161

161

00:07:47,554  -->  00:07:49,606
And actually there shouldn't be any space,
162

162

00:07:49,606  -->  00:07:52,595
but yeah of course if we increase the page here like this,
163

163

00:07:52,595  -->  00:07:54,412
then it has to show us something right?
164

164

00:07:54,412  -->  00:07:56,717
So the container it ends here, and it has no margin,
165

165

00:07:56,717  -->  00:07:58,550
but we still have a part of the page
166

166

00:07:58,550  -->  00:08:00,772
if our screen is this big,
167

167

00:08:00,772  -->  00:08:03,306
and to then it will of course show that the background
168

168

00:08:03,306  -->  00:08:06,376
gray-end that we defined for the body.
169

169

00:08:06,376  -->  00:08:10,032
So, if we reduce the view port, then it will no longer show,
170

170

00:08:10,032  -->  00:08:12,583
but if we increase it,
171

171

00:08:12,583  -->  00:08:14,659
and let me show that to you even more.
172

172

00:08:14,659  -->  00:08:16,659
Well, actually I cannot.
173

173

00:08:19,607  -->  00:08:22,092
But, for example, if the view port was like this,
174

174

00:08:22,092  -->  00:08:25,240
then even more of this pink color here would be created.
175

175

00:08:25,240  -->  00:08:26,816
But that's not a problem at all,
176

176

00:08:26,816  -->  00:08:29,259
so let's not worry about that, okay?
177

177

00:08:29,259  -->  00:08:31,128
The only thing that's not perfect here
178

178

00:08:31,128  -->  00:08:32,542
is this situation right now,
179

179

00:08:32,542  -->  00:08:35,375
but let's fix that in another way.
180

180

00:08:37,712  -->  00:08:39,216
Let me inspect this element here,
181

181

00:08:39,216  -->  00:08:40,988
and what I'm simply gonna do is to decrease
182

182

00:08:40,988  -->  00:08:43,321
this margin area a bit more.
183

183

00:08:44,374  -->  00:08:45,374
So 0.8, 0.9.
184

184

00:08:46,655  -->  00:08:49,145
So let's put it at-2rem,
185

185

00:08:49,145  -->  00:08:53,312
and so then that should no longer occur in no width at all.
186

186

00:08:55,115  -->  00:08:58,784
So, let's come here to our components.
187

187

00:08:58,784  -->  00:09:01,034
Overview, button, and list.
188

188

00:09:03,018  -->  00:09:05,031
And so here we are in the recommend.
189

189

00:09:05,031  -->  00:09:08,506
So let's put this one here at -2rem,
190

190

00:09:08,506  -->  00:09:12,673
so instead of having to write another media query here.
191

191

00:09:15,520  -->  00:09:18,046
Okay, so that's fixed now.
192

192

00:09:18,046  -->  00:09:20,605
Let's keep moving down with our width,
193

193

00:09:20,605  -->  00:09:24,449
and for now everything still keeps looking great right?
194

194

00:09:24,449  -->  00:09:27,980
And now we have that problem here again with the images.
195

195

00:09:27,980  -->  00:09:32,483
So, let's actually add a new media query here at 900.
196

196

00:09:32,483  -->  00:09:35,222
Because at this point, everything start to look a bit
197

197

00:09:35,222  -->  00:09:36,438
too narrow here.
198

198

00:09:36,438  -->  00:09:39,268
Like the side nav is already becoming very narrow,
199

199

00:09:39,268  -->  00:09:40,786
and so is this column here,
200

200

00:09:40,786  -->  00:09:42,665
and especially the review column okay?
201

201

00:09:42,665  -->  00:09:44,887
So we're getting less and less space here,
202

202

00:09:44,887  -->  00:09:46,559
and that becomes even more dramatic
203

203

00:09:46,559  -->  00:09:49,069
as we decrease it further down.
204

204

00:09:49,069  -->  00:09:52,268
So, here at 900 let's make another breakpoint,
205

205

00:09:52,268  -->  00:09:54,968
and what we're gonna do is to basically put
206

206

00:09:54,968  -->  00:09:57,466
this navigation here which is now a sidebar,
207

207

00:09:57,466  -->  00:09:59,447
all the way here on the top.
208

208

00:09:59,447  -->  00:10:01,410
So spanning from the left to the right.
209

209

00:10:01,410  -->  00:10:05,555
With all of these four navigation items side-by-side.
210

210

00:10:05,555  -->  00:10:08,867
So that then, this part down here so the hotel view,
211

211

00:10:08,867  -->  00:10:11,182
which is all of this here can occupy it
212

212

00:10:11,182  -->  00:10:13,993
100% of the view port width.
213

213

00:10:13,993  -->  00:10:16,104
And that will buy us some more space.
214

214

00:10:16,104  -->  00:10:19,139
So, that shouldn't be all too hard to do.
215

215

00:10:19,139  -->  00:10:21,955
So, let's just check out which element we're talking about,
216

216

00:10:21,955  -->  00:10:24,955
and that is the content here, right?
217

217

00:10:26,540  -->  00:10:28,259
So the content is the element
218

218

00:10:28,259  -->  00:10:31,426
that has both of these things that we were talking about.
219

219

00:10:31,426  -->  00:10:34,393
So the sidebar and the hotel view right?
220

220

00:10:34,393  -->  00:10:36,446
So the content is already set to flex
221

221

00:10:36,446  -->  00:10:38,052
so it's a flex box container,
222

222

00:10:38,052  -->  00:10:40,643
because remember we positioned these two elements here
223

223

00:10:40,643  -->  00:10:42,826
side-by-side using flex box,
224

224

00:10:42,826  -->  00:10:44,403
and so now all we have to do,
225

225

00:10:44,403  -->  00:10:46,615
if you wanna put one on top of the other
226

226

00:10:46,615  -->  00:10:49,499
is to change the flex direction right?
227

227

00:10:49,499  -->  00:10:51,595
Because right now it's a row,
228

228

00:10:51,595  -->  00:10:54,725
and so all we have to do is to change it to a column,
229

229

00:10:54,725  -->  00:10:56,142
so let's do that.
230

230

00:10:57,815  -->  00:11:00,655
And first let's create another breakpoint here,
231

231

00:11:00,655  -->  00:11:04,355
or another variable for breakpoint.
232

232

00:11:04,355  -->  00:11:07,204
So after large comes medium,
233

233

00:11:07,204  -->  00:11:10,371
and 900 pixels divided by 16 is 65.25.
234

234

00:11:13,678  -->  00:11:15,345
56 I believe it was.
235

235

00:11:18,065  -->  00:11:20,315
Just to be sure, so 56.25em
236

236

00:11:23,360  -->  00:11:24,860
equals 900 pixels.
237

237

00:11:25,794  -->  00:11:28,857
Okay, so let's come here to our layout again.
238

238

00:11:28,857  -->  00:11:30,203
Let me actually copy this one
239

239

00:11:30,203  -->  00:11:33,213
so I don't have to write it out all the time.
240

240

00:11:33,213  -->  00:11:35,421
And so remember, the one we want to manipulate here
241

241

00:11:35,421  -->  00:11:36,671
is the content.
242

242

00:11:38,575  -->  00:11:42,653
So at the medium breakpoint, what we want to change
243

243

00:11:42,653  -->  00:11:45,320
is the flex direction to column,
244

244

00:11:48,100  -->  00:11:50,470
and that will put our navigation on top,
245

245

00:11:50,470  -->  00:11:53,277
and the hotel overview beneath it.
246

246

00:11:53,277  -->  00:11:56,198
So let's test that as we hit 900 pixels,
247

247

00:11:56,198  -->  00:11:57,289
and here we go.
248

248

00:11:57,289  -->  00:11:58,122
So, great.
249

249

00:11:58,122  -->  00:12:00,485
We have the sidebar here stretching all the way
250

250

00:12:00,485  -->  00:12:02,503
to the right side, and then down there
251

251

00:12:02,503  -->  00:12:06,926
the hotel view occupying 100% of the available width.
252

252

00:12:06,926  -->  00:12:08,215
So, that's great.
253

253

00:12:08,215  -->  00:12:11,991
Now we're back to having more space down here, all right?
254

254

00:12:11,991  -->  00:12:15,117
So, next up, let's put these items here side-by-side,
255

255

00:12:15,117  -->  00:12:18,509
because it doesn't make much sense to be like this right?
256

256

00:12:18,509  -->  00:12:21,098
And also, I'm gonna get rid of this text here actually,
257

257

00:12:21,098  -->  00:12:22,830
because we wanna have the navigation,
258

258

00:12:22,830  -->  00:12:25,627
then right after that we want to start the hotel overview,
259

259

00:12:25,627  -->  00:12:29,377
and not see any of this text over there okay?
260

260

00:12:31,311  -->  00:12:33,894
So, let's go to the navigation,
261

261

00:12:35,161  -->  00:12:39,328
and I think that's a component right here at the beginning.
262

262

00:12:41,523  -->  00:12:43,545
Yeah, here it is. The side-nav.
263

263

00:12:43,545  -->  00:12:46,103
So, remember that we want to put the items
264

264

00:12:46,103  -->  00:12:47,989
all beside each other right?
265

265

00:12:47,989  -->  00:12:52,364
So all we have to do is to set its parent to a flex, right?
266

266

00:12:52,364  -->  00:12:56,173
So making off the items, flex items,
267

267

00:12:56,173  -->  00:12:59,015
which will then automatically be side-by-side.
268

268

00:12:59,015  -->  00:13:02,480
Now of course we have to do this in a media query.
269

269

00:13:02,480  -->  00:13:05,425
So let me copy that, and of course this code here
270

270

00:13:05,425  -->  00:13:07,196
should be in the media query,
271

271

00:13:07,196  -->  00:13:09,827
and not just out there.
272

272

00:13:09,827  -->  00:13:12,293
All right, so let's take a look at that.
273

273

00:13:12,293  -->  00:13:13,460
And all right!
274

274

00:13:14,442  -->  00:13:16,460
So it's starting to look pretty good already
275

275

00:13:16,460  -->  00:13:18,659
they are now nicely side-by-side.
276

276

00:13:18,659  -->  00:13:21,823
Let's just get rid of this margin here.
277

277

00:13:21,823  -->  00:13:22,990
So margin zero
278

278

00:13:26,920  -->  00:13:28,785
so that margin-top that we had here,
279

279

00:13:28,785  -->  00:13:30,125
we don't want that anymore.
280

280

00:13:30,125  -->  00:13:31,186
And then as I was saying,
281

281

00:13:31,186  -->  00:13:34,269
let's get rid of the legal text also.
282

282

00:13:37,023  -->  00:13:41,190
And what I want to copy is actually this media query.
283

283

00:13:47,287  -->  00:13:48,655
So display: none.
284

284

00:13:48,655  -->  00:13:52,714
All right, so the legal text will be gone now,
285

285

00:13:52,714  -->  00:13:55,200
and just to check it,
286

286

00:13:55,200  -->  00:13:56,872
Okay, so that looks good already.
287

287

00:13:56,872  -->  00:13:58,808
Now, what we should do here, of course,
288

288

00:13:58,808  -->  00:14:02,975
is to make of them occupy it 1/4 of the entire width here.
289

289

00:14:04,601  -->  00:14:06,467
Basically, what we want them to do
290

290

00:14:06,467  -->  00:14:08,992
is to occupy this entire width.
291

291

00:14:08,992  -->  00:14:10,307
Let's do that.
292

292

00:14:10,307  -->  00:14:14,324
Of course, that's not really hard at all.
293

293

00:14:14,324  -->  00:14:16,490
How are we going to do that?
294

294

00:14:16,490  -->  00:14:18,970
Well, it's very simple.
295

295

00:14:18,970  -->  00:14:21,365
We set flex to one, okay?
296

296

00:14:21,365  -->  00:14:24,279
We give all these four flex items the ability
297

297

00:14:24,279  -->  00:14:26,170
to grow as much as they can,
298

298

00:14:26,170  -->  00:14:29,022
and since they all have the same flex value, which is one,
299

299

00:14:29,022  -->  00:14:32,272
they will all occupy it the same space.
300

300

00:14:33,186  -->  00:14:37,353
Now, just here, let's remove that margin from the bottom.
301

301

00:14:40,955  -->  00:14:44,538
Now, we should be pretty much done with it.
302

302

00:14:45,390  -->  00:14:48,772
Let's actually zoom a bit in here.
303

303

00:14:48,772  -->  00:14:52,135
75%, and that looks pretty good to me.
304

304

00:14:52,135  -->  00:14:53,664
Now, maybe we should also center
305

305

00:14:53,664  -->  00:14:57,087
this content here inside of the box.
306

306

00:14:57,087  -->  00:14:59,673
Let's do that as well.
307

307

00:14:59,673  -->  00:15:01,673
It's in the link, right?
308

308

00:15:03,114  -->  00:15:06,127
Let's put that media query in here.
309

309

00:15:06,127  -->  00:15:07,766
What do we have to do in order
310

310

00:15:07,766  -->  00:15:10,076
to horizontally align these items?
311

311

00:15:10,076  -->  00:15:14,353
Well, all we have do is justify content, center,
312

312

00:15:14,353  -->  00:15:16,623
as we've been doing so many times.
313

313

00:15:16,623  -->  00:15:20,790
Now, let's just actually increase the padding as well.
314

314

00:15:23,394  -->  00:15:25,977
Let's say 2rem, and here we go.
315

315

00:15:27,591  -->  00:15:29,355
That looks perfect, right?
316

316

00:15:29,355  -->  00:15:32,522
Now, just some smaller fixes that we should do here as well
317

317

00:15:32,522  -->  00:15:36,078
is maybe decrease all of this padding that we have here.
318

318

00:15:36,078  -->  00:15:37,973
All of this excessive white space
319

319

00:15:37,973  -->  00:15:41,694
that we really don't have space for at this view port width.
320

320

00:15:41,694  -->  00:15:43,549
Let's get rid of all that.
321

321

00:15:43,549  -->  00:15:46,138
For that, let's remember that this element here
322

322

00:15:46,138  -->  00:15:47,305
is the detail.
323

323

00:15:49,281  -->  00:15:52,155
Here we should definitely decrease the padding
324

324

00:15:52,155  -->  00:15:55,488
and to say then here for the description
325

325

00:15:56,342  -->  00:15:59,199
and probably the reviews as well.
326

326

00:15:59,199  -->  00:16:00,366
Let's do that.
327

327

00:16:01,971  -->  00:16:04,319
Just copy this media query,
328

328

00:16:04,319  -->  00:16:06,205
and so let's do that.
329

329

00:16:06,205  -->  00:16:08,575
Legal: we already changed that.
330

330

00:16:08,575  -->  00:16:13,487
The overview, and actually this is in the layout, right?
331

331

00:16:13,487  -->  00:16:16,237
It's actually here in the detail.
332

332

00:16:19,537  -->  00:16:22,562
We want the padding of 3rem now,
333

333

00:16:22,562  -->  00:16:24,229
no longer 4.5, okay?
334

334

00:16:26,095  -->  00:16:28,928
Next, let's check the description.
335

335

00:16:30,051  -->  00:16:32,690
Here we can actually leave a padding of 2rem, I would say,
336

336

00:16:32,690  -->  00:16:35,893
it was three, so let's decrease it to two.
337

337

00:16:35,893  -->  00:16:38,074
Now, the margin-right also needs to change
338

338

00:16:38,074  -->  00:16:41,448
because remember that this margin-right of 4.5
339

339

00:16:41,448  -->  00:16:44,794
was the exact same value as the padding here on the detail.
340

340

00:16:44,794  -->  00:16:48,961
We should probably decrease that one to three as well,
341

341

00:16:53,503  -->  00:16:54,336
so 3rem.
342

342

00:16:58,292  -->  00:17:00,375
Now, where is the review?
343

343

00:17:01,285  -->  00:17:03,581
List, recommend, ah, here we go.
344

344

00:17:03,581  -->  00:17:07,748
The review, I'm also gonna decrease the padding in here.
345

345

00:17:08,764  -->  00:17:12,931
Now, the media query is gone, so let's copy it again.
346

346

00:17:16,304  -->  00:17:19,427
Padding: 2rem, and that's actually okay like that.
347

347

00:17:19,427  -->  00:17:20,260
Since we're here,
348

348

00:17:20,260  -->  00:17:24,427
let's also decrease the margin at the bottom to 3rem.
349

349

00:17:28,133  -->  00:17:32,300
Let's just check if we have something else to change.
350

350

00:17:34,814  -->  00:17:38,981
I think this section here can also need some less space.
351

351

00:17:40,578  -->  00:17:43,995
Let's say, 2.5rem and zero down from 3.5.
352

352

00:17:48,485  -->  00:17:49,902
Let's check that.
353

353

00:17:50,835  -->  00:17:54,094
Yeah, that looks a bit more natural, I believe.
354

354

00:17:54,094  -->  00:17:58,534
So without all of this space that we had before.
355

355

00:17:58,534  -->  00:18:01,555
The same here in the cta section as well.
356

356

00:18:01,555  -->  00:18:02,964
If you now decrease this here,
357

357

00:18:02,964  -->  00:18:06,300
we should be good to go for a long time,
358

358

00:18:06,300  -->  00:18:08,467
for a long range of width.
359

359

00:18:10,340  -->  00:18:11,923
It still looks good
360

360

00:18:12,890  -->  00:18:14,173
except this here
361

361

00:18:14,173  -->  00:18:17,166
and maybe we should find another fix for this here as well.
362

362

00:18:17,166  -->  00:18:20,012
Let me actually go here to the components
363

363

00:18:20,012  -->  00:18:21,762
and to the recommend,
364

364

00:18:24,366  -->  00:18:27,283
so these photos here are this ones.
365

365

00:18:28,374  -->  00:18:30,615
If you want them to stay always side-by-side,
366

366

00:18:30,615  -->  00:18:33,160
we can actually achieve that with flex box.
367

367

00:18:33,160  -->  00:18:36,493
Let's set the container to display flex.
368

368

00:18:38,020  -->  00:18:40,426
Then these elements, so these flex items,
369

369

00:18:40,426  -->  00:18:44,008
they will just stay side-by-side all the time.
370

370

00:18:44,008  -->  00:18:45,758
Yeah, just like this.
371

371

00:18:46,846  -->  00:18:50,179
That's a very easy fix for that problem.
372

372

00:18:51,653  -->  00:18:55,486
All right, so we're still good here I believe.
373

373

00:18:57,006  -->  00:18:59,881
There's no major problems at any point,
374

374

00:18:59,881  -->  00:19:01,486
so I think that the next breakpoint
375

375

00:19:01,486  -->  00:19:04,220
could be, for example, here, 600 pixels.
376

376

00:19:04,220  -->  00:19:06,511
Such as we had in our other project,
377

377

00:19:06,511  -->  00:19:09,375
so 600, I think, is a pretty good breakpoint.
378

378

00:19:09,375  -->  00:19:11,059
In this project, it's a good point
379

379

00:19:11,059  -->  00:19:15,388
to make some more changes in here, in this interface.
380

380

00:19:15,388  -->  00:19:17,835
I'm actually leaving for the next video.
381

381

00:19:17,835  -->  00:19:19,654
If you want to do that right now,
382

382

00:19:19,654  -->  00:19:23,821
then just come with me right to that next lecture.
