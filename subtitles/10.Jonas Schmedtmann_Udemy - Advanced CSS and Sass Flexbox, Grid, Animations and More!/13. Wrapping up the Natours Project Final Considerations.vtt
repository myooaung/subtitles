00:00:01.023  -->  00:00:02.970
<v Instructor>Welcome back to the last lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:02.970  -->  00:00:05.657
of the natours project, so it's now time
3

3

00:00:05.657  -->  00:00:08.549
to wrap it up, but before doing that,
4

4

00:00:08.549  -->  00:00:11.655
there are some small tweaks that we should make,
5

5

00:00:11.655  -->  00:00:13.234
and there are some final considerations
6

6

00:00:13.234  -->  00:00:16.361
that I want to say about this project as well.
7

7

00:00:16.361  -->  00:00:19.170
And the first very small and very subtle change
8

8

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:22.605
that I want to do is to change the effect
9

9

00:00:22.605  -->  00:00:25.377
that happens when we select some text on the page,
10

10

00:00:25.377  -->  00:00:28.391
okay, so this is just the standard that happens,
11

11

00:00:28.391  -->  00:00:30.660
but I don't really like that, and I always like
12

12

00:00:30.660  -->  00:00:33.302
to add my own personal style and touch
13

13

00:00:33.302  -->  00:00:36.679
to these kind of small details, okay,
14

14

00:00:36.679  -->  00:00:40.177
so we can change the style of selected text.
15

15

00:00:40.177  -->  00:00:42.640
Okay, and so let's quickly do that,
16

16

00:00:42.640  -->  00:00:46.004
and we can do so here, in the base file,
17

17

00:00:46.004  -->  00:00:50.728
okay, so down here let's just add the selections pseudo
18

18

00:00:50.728  -->  00:00:52.561
element, so selection,
19

19

00:00:55.360  -->  00:00:59.527
and then we can simply change the background color.
20

20

00:01:00.506  -->  00:01:03.339
For example, to the primary color.
21

21

00:01:04.832  -->  00:01:08.999
So color, primary and then change the text color as well,
22

22

00:01:08.999  -->  00:01:13.166
so color, and then I think this one is called color white.
23

23

00:01:15.417  -->  00:01:19.886
Okay, and we should have our development set up still,
24

24

00:01:19.886  -->  00:01:23.140
yeah, so it should have reloaded now,
25

25

00:01:23.140  -->  00:01:26.538
and yeah, so this looks much better, right?
26

26

00:01:26.538  -->  00:01:29.065
So whenever the user selects text, now,
27

27

00:01:29.065  -->  00:01:30.981
he can see your own personal style
28

28

00:01:30.981  -->  00:01:33.300
applied to that selection, okay.
29

29

00:01:33.300  -->  00:01:35.552
So I think that looks pretty cool.
30

30

00:01:35.552  -->  00:01:37.803
Now another small thing that I want to change,
31

31

00:01:37.803  -->  00:01:40.444
or to fix, is something that's considered
32

32

00:01:40.444  -->  00:01:43.977
to be a best practice, and that's in the media queries,
33

33

00:01:43.977  -->  00:01:46.960
okay, so in here, the media queries work
34

34

00:01:46.960  -->  00:01:50.960
just fine like this, but we should actually add,
35

35

00:01:52.289  -->  00:01:55.264
only screen to them, okay, and what that
36

36

00:01:55.264  -->  00:01:59.811
does is that the media query only gets applied to screens,
37

37

00:01:59.811  -->  00:02:03.276
okay, so this is basically first condition,
38

38

00:02:03.276  -->  00:02:06.623
only screen, and then the max width,
39

39

00:02:06.623  -->  00:02:09.800
so for example if someone tries to print out our page,
40

40

00:02:09.800  -->  00:02:12.336
then these media queries don't apply,
41

41

00:02:12.336  -->  00:02:15.336
okay, so they only apply to screens.
42

42

00:02:16.316  -->  00:02:20.483
So let's just copy this, into all our media queries,
43

43

00:02:22.589  -->  00:02:26.585
alright, and we actually have another one in our header,
44

44

00:02:26.585  -->  00:02:29.252
I believe, so, yeah, right here.
45

45

00:02:32.497  -->  00:02:36.414
And we want this applied to all of them, right?
46

46

00:02:40.724  -->  00:02:43.717
Alright, so that was another small thing
47

47

00:02:43.717  -->  00:02:46.453
that I wanted to fix and since we're talking
48

48

00:02:46.453  -->  00:02:48.789
about media queries, there's another thing
49

49

00:02:48.789  -->  00:02:51.794
that I should show you and that's this piece of code,
50

50

00:02:51.794  -->  00:02:54.930
and this was already in our HTML so in the starter files
51

51

00:02:54.930  -->  00:02:57.024
that are provided for this project,
52

52

00:02:57.024  -->  00:02:58.783
but we should still not overlook this,
53

53

00:02:58.783  -->  00:03:00.686
because responsive web design does not work
54

54

00:03:00.686  -->  00:03:04.849
without having this meta element here in the HTML head.
55

55

00:03:04.849  -->  00:03:07.638
Because what this does is basically to say that
56

56

00:03:07.638  -->  00:03:10.366
our website should be rendered with the width
57

57

00:03:10.366  -->  00:03:12.792
of the device, so this is here, what happens,
58

58

00:03:12.792  -->  00:03:16.124
the width of the content should be the device width,
59

59

00:03:16.124  -->  00:03:18.195
so if we have a device with 500 pixels,
60

60

00:03:18.195  -->  00:03:21.513
then a website should have a width of 500 pixels.
61

61

00:03:21.513  -->  00:03:23.170
And that's of course, what we want,
62

62

00:03:23.170  -->  00:03:25.429
but if we do not specify this here in the HTML,
63

63

00:03:25.429  -->  00:03:28.397
then the browser will basically zoom out our page,
64

64

00:03:28.397  -->  00:03:31.098
so that the largest possible version of our page
65

65

00:03:31.098  -->  00:03:33.045
fits the screen, so for example,
66

66

00:03:33.045  -->  00:03:35.954
if our widest element, like the rel for example
67

67

00:03:35.954  -->  00:03:38.219
has 1,000 pixels, then the browser will try
68

68

00:03:38.219  -->  00:03:41.255
to render the page with a width of 1,000 pixels.
69

69

00:03:41.255  -->  00:03:44.359
If we didn't have this meta name view port element
70

70

00:03:44.359  -->  00:03:46.943
in our markup, okay, so whenever you're coding
71

71

00:03:46.943  -->  00:03:50.477
a new page, don't forget to put this part in there.
72

72

00:03:50.477  -->  00:03:53.026
Alright, now, another thing about media queries,
73

73

00:03:53.026  -->  00:03:55.431
is something that I want to show you here,
74

74

00:03:55.431  -->  00:03:57.578
actually, in the inspector, because there's still
75

75

00:03:57.578  -->  00:04:01.745
a problem going on, and that is here with the cards,
76

76

00:04:02.649  -->  00:04:04.759
so remember that for smaller screens,
77

77

00:04:04.759  -->  00:04:08.844
we put that side that was before on the back,
78

78

00:04:08.844  -->  00:04:11.781
here in the front, so that the user can see the button here
79

79

00:04:11.781  -->  00:04:14.058
without hovering the card, right,
80

80

00:04:14.058  -->  00:04:15.784
and that's because on mobile devices,
81

81

00:04:15.784  -->  00:04:18.250
people can not really hover, and even if they can,
82

82

00:04:18.250  -->  00:04:20.576
it's not so easy to happen, and so maybe the user
83

83

00:04:20.576  -->  00:04:22.974
could never even see that there is a back part
84

84

00:04:22.974  -->  00:04:25.394
of these cards, and would never see this button,
85

85

00:04:25.394  -->  00:04:27.963
okay, and so therefore for the smaller screens,
86

86

00:04:27.963  -->  00:04:30.217
we did it like this because we're assuming
87

87

00:04:30.217  -->  00:04:32.891
that the smaller screens are only for devices
88

88

00:04:32.891  -->  00:04:35.227
where the users can not hover.
89

89

00:04:35.227  -->  00:04:36.911
Now, imagine that we're browsing this page
90

90

00:04:36.911  -->  00:04:40.094
on a huge device, like an iPad,
91

91

00:04:40.094  -->  00:04:43.344
in landscape mode, or like an iPad Pro.
92

92

00:04:46.983  -->  00:04:50.544
Also, whether in portrait mode or in landscape mode.
93

93

00:04:50.544  -->  00:04:52.086
So right now you see that even though
94

94

00:04:52.086  -->  00:04:54.782
we're on a touch device, you can not see the back part,
95

95

00:04:54.782  -->  00:04:57.193
right, so the user will not hover this card,
96

96

00:04:57.193  -->  00:04:59.583
and will not see the book now button
97

97

00:04:59.583  -->  00:05:02.135
that's behind the cards because again,
98

98

00:05:02.135  -->  00:05:06.298
on a mobile touch device, users do usually not hover,
99

99

00:05:06.298  -->  00:05:08.711
and so what all of that means is that we can not
100

100

00:05:08.711  -->  00:05:11.037
simply identify a touch device by the width
101

101

00:05:11.037  -->  00:05:14.819
of the screen alone, okay, but, good news
102

102

00:05:14.819  -->  00:05:18.169
is that in CSS we can actually write a media query
103

103

00:05:18.169  -->  00:05:21.011
which can identify if the user can hover
104

104

00:05:21.011  -->  00:05:23.527
over elements, or not, and with that,
105

105

00:05:23.527  -->  00:05:25.794
we can very easily identify touch devices
106

106

00:05:25.794  -->  00:05:29.857
and non touch devices, where we have a mouse, okay?
107

107

00:05:29.857  -->  00:05:32.940
So let's very quickly implement that.
108

108

00:05:34.214  -->  00:05:37.797
And so we should go to our current element.
109

109

00:05:41.342  -->  00:05:45.348
And so down here we have the media query,
110

110

00:05:45.348  -->  00:05:48.015
and we now want to add another condition to it.
111

111

00:05:48.015  -->  00:05:50.520
Now the problem here is that we used this
112

112

00:05:50.520  -->  00:05:53.615
respond mix in in order to write this media query,
113

113

00:05:53.615  -->  00:05:56.313
and so it's impossible to add a second condition
114

114

00:05:56.313  -->  00:05:58.885
to the media query, so what we have to do here
115

115

00:05:58.885  -->  00:06:01.481
is to actually write out the real media query,
116

116

00:06:01.481  -->  00:06:04.898
so let's get that, so tab port, tab port.
117

117

00:06:07.134  -->  00:06:09.384
So that is the media query,
118

118

00:06:11.711  -->  00:06:15.544
so I'm going to remove that or comment it out.
119

119

00:06:18.431  -->  00:06:22.439
And so this is the original media query that we had.
120

120

00:06:22.439  -->  00:06:24.002
So we want all of this to happen
121

121

00:06:24.002  -->  00:06:28.319
when the screen is smaller than 56 M, right,
122

122

00:06:28.319  -->  00:06:32.742
but we also want it to happen if we have a touch device,
123

123

00:06:32.742  -->  00:06:35.755
right, and how do we do that, well,
124

124

00:06:35.755  -->  00:06:38.751
it's actually very simple, so again,
125

125

00:06:38.751  -->  00:06:40.751
we use only screen, and,
126

126

00:06:43.822  -->  00:06:46.572
all we have to say is hover none.
127

127

00:06:48.015  -->  00:06:50.570
So the card should be displayed with the back part visible
128

128

00:06:50.570  -->  00:06:53.233
when the screen is smaller than this,
129

129

00:06:53.233  -->  00:06:57.197
or whenever we're using a device where we can not hover.
130

130

00:06:57.197  -->  00:06:59.286
Which basically means, whenever we have a device
131

131

00:06:59.286  -->  00:07:02.174
which uses touch as the primary input.
132

132

00:07:02.174  -->  00:07:04.312
Now if you wanted to do this the other way around,
133

133

00:07:04.312  -->  00:07:08.048
then you could use hover and say that to hover,
134

134

00:07:08.048  -->  00:07:10.962
okay, so that's the opposite of hover none,
135

135

00:07:10.962  -->  00:07:13.546
but in this case, of course, that's what we want.
136

136

00:07:13.546  -->  00:07:15.937
And so now let's reload this entire thing,
137

137

00:07:15.937  -->  00:07:19.415
and you see that now it is actually appearing here,
138

138

00:07:19.415  -->  00:07:22.021
even on this large width, right.
139

139

00:07:22.021  -->  00:07:23.568
Now in order to have some more control
140

140

00:07:23.568  -->  00:07:25.617
about this testing, we can add here,
141

141

00:07:25.617  -->  00:07:30.237
the device type, okay, I know of course it's set to mobile
142

142

00:07:30.237  -->  00:07:32.672
because we're on an iPad Pro here
143

143

00:07:32.672  -->  00:07:34.734
and so that, of course, is a mobile device.
144

144

00:07:34.734  -->  00:07:36.742
Now if we have an iPad for example,
145

145

00:07:36.742  -->  00:07:41.410
then it looks like this, or in portrait like this,
146

146

00:07:41.410  -->  00:07:44.679
but if you go back to responses, then we can also,
147

147

00:07:44.679  -->  00:07:47.244
set this here manually, so for example
148

148

00:07:47.244  -->  00:07:51.212
on this huge width here, of course this should originally
149

149

00:07:51.212  -->  00:07:53.361
be hidden, and so if we set this to desktop,
150

150

00:07:53.361  -->  00:07:56.480
then of course it's gone, right,
151

151

00:07:56.480  -->  00:07:59.480
because now it's not a touch device.
152

152

00:08:01.891  -->  00:08:04.389
But if we set it to touch or to mobile,
153

153

00:08:04.389  -->  00:08:07.550
then it's back to looking like this,
154

154

00:08:07.550  -->  00:08:11.795
so our media query is actually working just fine.
155

155

00:08:11.795  -->  00:08:14.697
So I hope that made sense to you, okay,
156

156

00:08:14.697  -->  00:08:17.127
so let's now get out of this mode,
157

157

00:08:17.127  -->  00:08:21.095
and okay, so something else that I want to talk about
158

158

00:08:21.095  -->  00:08:23.440
with you is this navigation, here,
159

159

00:08:23.440  -->  00:08:25.727
okay, so, maybe you notice that when we click here,
160

160

00:08:25.727  -->  00:08:27.882
then nothing really happens, right?
161

161

00:08:27.882  -->  00:08:30.070
And that's because that is something that
162

162

00:08:30.070  -->  00:08:33.668
is not really possible to implement with CSS alone,
163

163

00:08:33.668  -->  00:08:35.559
so if you wanted to really make this functional,
164

164

00:08:35.559  -->  00:08:38.116
so maybe when you click on the button
165

165

00:08:38.116  -->  00:08:40.074
then it scrolls to the correct section,
166

166

00:08:40.074  -->  00:08:42.082
and at the same time, closes the navigation,
167

167

00:08:42.082  -->  00:08:44.120
so if you want all of that functionality,
168

168

00:08:44.120  -->  00:08:47.343
then you really have to use JavaScript and not CSS alone,
169

169

00:08:47.343  -->  00:08:49.878
okay, but what I wanted to show you with this,
170

170

00:08:49.878  -->  00:08:52.663
is that just with CSS, we can do an amazing effect
171

171

00:08:52.663  -->  00:08:55.703
like this here and also how to take advantage
172

172

00:08:55.703  -->  00:08:58.594
of the jack box hack, okay, so I really wanted
173

173

00:08:58.594  -->  00:09:00.941
to show you that even though the functionality
174

174

00:09:00.941  -->  00:09:04.988
is not 100% there, okay, now, another thing
175

175

00:09:04.988  -->  00:09:08.382
is down here when you see that these icons here
176

176

00:09:08.382  -->  00:09:10.539
are missing, okay, and that is because in the HTML,
177

177

00:09:10.539  -->  00:09:13.956
we already removed that part, right here,
178

178

00:09:15.489  -->  00:09:17.875
remember, so let's not worry about this,
179

179

00:09:17.875  -->  00:09:20.240
because once we run our built process,
180

180

00:09:20.240  -->  00:09:22.907
those icons will be back, right,
181

181

00:09:24.214  -->  00:09:27.353
so what I wanted to show you now, next,
182

182

00:09:27.353  -->  00:09:30.801
is this here, so everything works just fine,
183

183

00:09:30.801  -->  00:09:33.482
but the problem with this is that usually
184

184

00:09:33.482  -->  00:09:35.206
when we have a popup effect, when we click
185

185

00:09:35.206  -->  00:09:37.423
outside this area here, then the popup
186

186

00:09:37.423  -->  00:09:41.246
should also go away, right, that's usual behavior
187

187

00:09:41.246  -->  00:09:44.023
of a popup, and that's not working right now,
188

188

00:09:44.023  -->  00:09:46.368
but in the real world, there should be another way
189

189

00:09:46.368  -->  00:09:49.020
of closing a popup, alright, so once again
190

190

00:09:49.020  -->  00:09:51.290
for that, you'll probably have to use JavaScript
191

191

00:09:51.290  -->  00:09:55.321
and not rely only on CSS, but again I wanted to show you
192

192

00:09:55.321  -->  00:09:58.211
how you can actually implement something like this,
193

193

00:09:58.211  -->  00:10:01.555
in pure CSS and show you how far CSS has become
194

194

00:10:01.555  -->  00:10:05.555
and how advanced it has become, in recent years.
195

195

00:10:06.408  -->  00:10:09.730
Okay, now aside from that I think this webpage
196

196

00:10:09.730  -->  00:10:13.129
is looking really great, I hope that you did
197

197

00:10:13.129  -->  00:10:15.195
all the challenges so you made everything
198

198

00:10:15.195  -->  00:10:17.340
really responsive so all the background images,
199

199

00:10:17.340  -->  00:10:21.128
including and yeah so this project should basically
200

200

00:10:21.128  -->  00:10:23.106
be ready to launch, now just taking a last look
201

201

00:10:23.106  -->  00:10:25.922
at our code, a thing that I didn't do throughout
202

202

00:10:25.922  -->  00:10:28.449
the course, was to comment my code, okay,
203

203

00:10:28.449  -->  00:10:30.661
but that's something that in real life,
204

204

00:10:30.661  -->  00:10:33.434
you should absolutely do, not only for yourself,
205

205

00:10:33.434  -->  00:10:35.345
so when you come back in the future,
206

206

00:10:35.345  -->  00:10:37.372
you still know how exactly your CSS works,
207

207

00:10:37.372  -->  00:10:39.233
but also for other developers,
208

208

00:10:39.233  -->  00:10:41.650
so imagine you write some CSS, and then later
209

209

00:10:41.650  -->  00:10:44.215
someone else has to maintain that CSS,
210

210

00:10:44.215  -->  00:10:46.649
so another developer, then in order to make his life
211

211

00:10:46.649  -->  00:10:49.154
easier you should always comment your CSS,
212

212

00:10:49.154  -->  00:10:52.364
so you should definitely write a lot more CSS comments
213

213

00:10:52.364  -->  00:10:55.192
than I did, okay, all I did was like,
214

214

00:10:55.192  -->  00:10:57.170
say front side styling, and some other
215

215

00:10:57.170  -->  00:10:59.557
really basic comments like that,
216

216

00:10:59.557  -->  00:11:01.240
but again, when you write code in the real world,
217

217

00:11:01.240  -->  00:11:03.994
then please make sure that you write a lot of comments,
218

218

00:11:03.994  -->  00:11:06.685
always, now another thing that we could have done
219

219

00:11:06.685  -->  00:11:09.902
in our project is to use a lot more variables,
220

220

00:11:09.902  -->  00:11:12.117
so basically all the numbers, they could simply
221

221

00:11:12.117  -->  00:11:14.158
be stored in variables, for example,
222

222

00:11:14.158  -->  00:11:16.533
all of the margins, we could have a couple
223

223

00:11:16.533  -->  00:11:18.799
of global variables here in our variable file,
224

224

00:11:18.799  -->  00:11:21.032
and then all the margins could simply depend
225

225

00:11:21.032  -->  00:11:24.357
on these variables, or for the Z index,
226

226

00:11:24.357  -->  00:11:26.555
you could use them as variables as well,
227

227

00:11:26.555  -->  00:11:29.121
or maybe all the font sizes, so a lot
228

228

00:11:29.121  -->  00:11:31.607
of variables could be used and I didn't do that
229

229

00:11:31.607  -->  00:11:34.149
because I wanted to focus more on the CSS part itself
230

230

00:11:34.149  -->  00:11:37.485
and not so much on the scss part.
231

231

00:11:37.485  -->  00:11:40.013
Okay, but still, we did a lot of scss
232

232

00:11:40.013  -->  00:11:42.529
and of architecture, and I also showed you
233

233

00:11:42.529  -->  00:11:44.994
how you could use variables for all of that,
234

234

00:11:44.994  -->  00:11:46.446
and so therefore, I used variables
235

235

00:11:46.446  -->  00:11:49.612
for some of the things just to show you how it works,
236

236

00:11:49.612  -->  00:11:52.517
and then I did other stuff, without the variables, okay,
237

237

00:11:52.517  -->  00:11:54.682
so we're not always jumping back and forth
238

238

00:11:54.682  -->  00:11:57.167
between files and simply to make this project
239

239

00:11:57.167  -->  00:12:00.442
a bit more fun to code here in the videos.
240

240

00:12:00.442  -->  00:12:02.300
Okay, and now the very last thing
241

241

00:12:02.300  -->  00:12:04.401
before we leave this video, is to actually
242

242

00:12:04.401  -->  00:12:08.568
run our built command one last time, right, so let's do that
243

243

00:12:10.836  -->  00:12:13.753
and we can finish this process here,
244

244

00:12:13.753  -->  00:12:17.830
and on a Mac you can do that by hitting control C,
245

245

00:12:17.830  -->  00:12:20.184
okay, so not command C, but control C,
246

246

00:12:20.184  -->  00:12:23.554
and on Windows, I am unfortunately not really sure,
247

247

00:12:23.554  -->  00:12:26.221
so probably just open another window, I would say,
248

248

00:12:26.221  -->  00:12:29.903
and close the one which has this process running, okay,
249

249

00:12:29.903  -->  00:12:34.688
and the process that we want to run now, is our...
250

250

00:12:34.688  -->  00:12:38.224
I've got to close these, is our package json,
251

251

00:12:38.224  -->  00:12:41.091
and it's called built CSS.
252

252

00:12:41.091  -->  00:12:42.924
So NPM run, build CSS.
253

253

00:12:49.729  -->  00:12:52.604
And letting it do it's thing, and alright,
254

254

00:12:52.604  -->  00:12:55.909
so let's take one last look, and now actually,
255

255

00:12:55.909  -->  00:12:59.298
it's not working because we canceled the live server,
256

256

00:12:59.298  -->  00:13:01.845
okay, so we have to actually start that again,
257

257

00:13:01.845  -->  00:13:04.762
so NPM run start and so here we go,
258

258

00:13:08.572  -->  00:13:12.105
now our icons should be back, and yeah,
259

259

00:13:12.105  -->  00:13:13.706
so right now everything is working,
260

260

00:13:13.706  -->  00:13:17.689
and so yeah, that's it that's the project,
261

261

00:13:17.689  -->  00:13:20.508
I really hope that you enjoyed coding this project,
262

262

00:13:20.508  -->  00:13:23.914
as much as I did, I think it was really a lot of fun.
263

263

00:13:23.914  -->  00:13:26.296
And really cool beautiful project to learn,
264

264

00:13:26.296  -->  00:13:28.879
all of these new skills that you just learned.
265

265

00:13:28.879  -->  00:13:31.817
So once again, congratulations, for this achievement,
266

266

00:13:31.817  -->  00:13:34.968
we've come, really, a long way up until this point.
267

267

00:13:34.968  -->  00:13:37.391
Now if you want to continue then next up,
268

268

00:13:37.391  -->  00:13:39.519
I have another very cool project,
269

269

00:13:39.519  -->  00:13:42.409
where the main focus is on mastering flex box,
270

270

00:13:42.409  -->  00:13:45.324
which is an amazing new way of building lay outs,
271

271

00:13:45.324  -->  00:13:47.325
so if you're excited about that,
272

272

00:13:47.325  -->  00:13:49.364
then let's move on together right now,
273

273

00:13:49.364  -->  00:13:53.531
right to the next section, hope to see you over there.
