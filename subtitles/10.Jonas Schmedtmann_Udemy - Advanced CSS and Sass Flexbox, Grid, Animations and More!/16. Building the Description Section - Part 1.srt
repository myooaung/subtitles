00:00:01,376  -->  00:00:03,369
<v Instructor>Are you excited for the next section</v>
2

2

00:00:03,369  -->  00:00:04,265
of our app?
3

3

00:00:04,265  -->  00:00:07,778
I hope so because this is a really cool one.
4

4

00:00:07,778  -->  00:00:10,892
So, now you're gonna build the hotel description part
5

5

00:00:10,892  -->  00:00:12,203
of the interface.
6

6

00:00:12,203  -->  00:00:13,792
And for that, you're gonna continue
7

7

00:00:13,792  -->  00:00:15,545
using flex-block's properties,
8

8

00:00:15,545  -->  00:00:18,997
including flex-wrap, to build a multi-column list.
9

9

00:00:18,997  -->  00:00:22,703
Plus, I will teach you how and why we use CSS masks
10

10

00:00:22,703  -->  00:00:25,203
with mask-image and mask-size.
11

11

00:00:27,108  -->  00:00:29,217
So, in this lecture and the next one,
12

12

00:00:29,217  -->  00:00:32,100
we're gonna take care of this part here of our app.
13

13

00:00:32,100  -->  00:00:34,816
So this container here, and all the content
14

14

00:00:34,816  -->  00:00:35,923
that's in here.
15

15

00:00:35,923  -->  00:00:37,051
But before we can do that,
16

16

00:00:37,051  -->  00:00:39,632
we have to actually build this layout here.
17

17

00:00:39,632  -->  00:00:43,074
So, with this column here and this one on the right side,
18

18

00:00:43,074  -->  00:00:45,169
and format this container element,
19

19

00:00:45,169  -->  00:00:46,555
which contains these two columns.
20

20

00:00:46,555  -->  00:00:47,388
Okay.
21

21

00:00:47,388  -->  00:00:49,074
So that's the first thing that we're gonna do,
22

22

00:00:49,074  -->  00:00:51,063
and then after that we can take care
23

23

00:00:51,063  -->  00:00:53,765
of what's here in the hotel description.
24

24

00:00:53,765  -->  00:00:56,325
Alright, so back to our markup.
25

25

00:00:56,325  -->  00:00:58,750
Here we are in the hotel view still,
26

26

00:00:58,750  -->  00:01:01,984
because, remember, that entire part on the right side.
27

27

00:01:01,984  -->  00:01:04,556
So, all of that here, everything here,
28

28

00:01:04,556  -->  00:01:06,741
we call the hotel view.
29

29

00:01:06,741  -->  00:01:09,527
And then in there, we already have the gallery,
30

30

00:01:09,527  -->  00:01:12,200
the overview, and so now it's time to put
31

31

00:01:12,200  -->  00:01:14,617
an element called the detail.
32

32

00:01:17,741  -->  00:01:20,778
So, detail will be this box, which contains
33

33

00:01:20,778  -->  00:01:22,870
the two columns that I just showed you.
34

34

00:01:22,870  -->  00:01:25,791
So, detail is all of this part here,
35

35

00:01:25,791  -->  00:01:27,628
which has the gray background.
36

36

00:01:27,628  -->  00:01:30,602
Alright, then we have on the left side the description,
37

37

00:01:30,602  -->  00:01:34,663
and on the right side here, the user reviews.
38

38

00:01:34,663  -->  00:01:35,996
So, description.
39

39

00:01:42,133  -->  00:01:43,633
And, user reviews.
40

40

00:01:45,305  -->  00:01:47,972
Okay, let me just write it here.
41

41

00:01:52,275  -->  00:01:55,137
So that's now format, these three elements.
42

42

00:01:55,137  -->  00:01:57,740
And actually, we're gonna do that in the layout file now.
43

43

00:01:57,740  -->  00:02:02,242
Okay, because this is more concerned about layout.
44

44

00:02:02,242  -->  00:02:05,742
It's not really about building components.
45

45

00:02:07,094  -->  00:02:09,511
So we're gonna do the detail,
46

46

00:02:10,833  -->  00:02:12,166
the description,
47

47

00:02:14,032  -->  00:02:16,365
as well as the user reviews.
48

48

00:02:21,511  -->  00:02:23,528
So, we want the description and the user reviews
49

49

00:02:23,528  -->  00:02:26,943
to be side by side, and so we use flex-blocks
50

50

00:02:26,943  -->  00:02:28,360
on the container.
51

51

00:02:30,356  -->  00:02:33,474
So, display flex, and so they will be side by side.
52

52

00:02:33,474  -->  00:02:37,224
Let me just give them some background colors.
53

53

00:02:40,153  -->  00:02:42,486
So, orange red for this one.
54

54

00:02:46,264  -->  00:02:49,109
And, this one I like to put yellow-green.
55

55

00:02:49,109  -->  00:02:51,628
Okay, so we want this one here
56

56

00:02:51,628  -->  00:02:54,998
to actually have 60 percent of the available width.
57

57

00:02:54,998  -->  00:02:58,184
And so, let's do that with our flex property.
58

58

00:02:58,184  -->  00:03:00,599
And here I'm saying that I don't want it to grow,
59

59

00:03:00,599  -->  00:03:01,757
so Flex-grow zero.
60

60

00:03:01,757  -->  00:03:05,027
I also don't want it to shrink, so flex-shrink zero.
61

61

00:03:05,027  -->  00:03:08,460
And then the 60 percent for the flex basis.
62

62

00:03:08,460  -->  00:03:11,746
Alright, so usually when I'm using a percentage value here
63

63

00:03:11,746  -->  00:03:13,763
I set the other two to zero.
64

64

00:03:13,763  -->  00:03:14,744
Okay?
65

65

00:03:14,744  -->  00:03:17,140
And in this one, I basically want to occupy
66

66

00:03:17,140  -->  00:03:20,723
the remaining space by setting flex to one.
67

67

00:03:22,698  -->  00:03:26,809
And now, also we want some margin between them, of course.
68

68

00:03:26,809  -->  00:03:30,294
So I can simply say margin right four-point-five rem.
69

69

00:03:30,294  -->  00:03:33,530
So, let's take a look at that.
70

70

00:03:33,530  -->  00:03:35,373
And alright, so that's the layout
71

71

00:03:35,373  -->  00:03:37,366
that we were looking for actually.
72

72

00:03:37,366  -->  00:03:41,533
Now let's just give this container here a padding.
73

73

00:03:43,518  -->  00:03:46,490
So padding, and four-point-five rem as well.
74

74

00:03:46,490  -->  00:03:48,831
So the padding here is the same one
75

75

00:03:48,831  -->  00:03:50,901
as the right margin on the description.
76

76

00:03:50,901  -->  00:03:52,764
And that looks like that.
77

77

00:03:52,764  -->  00:03:55,442
And so, this distance here on this top,
78

78

00:03:55,442  -->  00:03:58,703
and here on this side, and between the two boxes,
79

79

00:03:58,703  -->  00:04:00,183
is always the same.
80

80

00:04:00,183  -->  00:04:03,062
Next up, we want it to have the subtle gray
81

81

00:04:03,062  -->  00:04:04,479
background color.
82

82

00:04:06,713  -->  00:04:09,006
So, background color, and let me actually copy
83

83

00:04:09,006  -->  00:04:10,498
the variable name from here,
84

84

00:04:10,498  -->  00:04:11,998
and it's this one.
85

85

00:04:15,342  -->  00:04:19,509
And I also want it to have the border on the bottom.
86

86

00:04:20,564  -->  00:04:22,702
So, the same one that we've been using all the time.
87

87

00:04:22,702  -->  00:04:25,167
And actually, since we've been using it all the time,
88

88

00:04:25,167  -->  00:04:27,940
let's actually create a variable for it.
89

89

00:04:27,940  -->  00:04:28,906
Okay?
90

90

00:04:28,906  -->  00:04:30,340
So let me get that.
91

91

00:04:30,340  -->  00:04:33,725
And so, we can copy all of this here into a new variable.
92

92

00:04:33,725  -->  00:04:35,048
Then each time we have this border,
93

93

00:04:35,048  -->  00:04:37,179
no matter if it's on the bottom, or somewhere else,
94

94

00:04:37,179  -->  00:04:40,928
we can simply then use a variable for that.
95

95

00:04:40,928  -->  00:04:44,030
Okay, so lets just create a variable here,
96

96

00:04:44,030  -->  00:04:46,774
and I'm simply gonna call it line.
97

97

00:04:46,774  -->  00:04:49,645
Alright, now you see that this variable here,
98

98

00:04:49,645  -->  00:04:53,271
so the line variable, actually contains another variable.
99

99

00:04:53,271  -->  00:04:57,438
But that's perfectly fine, it's gonna work just fine.
100

100

00:04:58,680  -->  00:05:02,563
So we can now replace it here with line, alright.
101

101

00:05:02,563  -->  00:05:06,139
And actually we have this somewhere else, I think.
102

102

00:05:06,139  -->  00:05:07,306
It's in the...
103

103

00:05:08,962  -->  00:05:10,725
Right here in the overview, right.
104

104

00:05:10,725  -->  00:05:14,300
So this here is the exact same thing,
105

105

00:05:14,300  -->  00:05:17,069
and so we just say line.
106

106

00:05:17,069  -->  00:05:20,670
And then, of course, we also want it here.
107

107

00:05:20,670  -->  00:05:23,558
In the detail that we were working on before.
108

108

00:05:23,558  -->  00:05:25,541
So, lets take a look at that,
109

109

00:05:25,541  -->  00:05:26,652
and here we go.
110

110

00:05:26,652  -->  00:05:28,191
So our three lines are still there.
111

111

00:05:28,191  -->  00:05:31,614
So here, here, and now here as well.
112

112

00:05:31,614  -->  00:05:33,628
Okay, so we already have the layout
113

113

00:05:33,628  -->  00:05:35,816
of the detail section here completed.
114

114

00:05:35,816  -->  00:05:37,339
Now, let's just start to format
115

115

00:05:37,339  -->  00:05:39,871
this description box here, okay.
116

116

00:05:39,871  -->  00:05:44,711
So, description, and we want it to have a white background,
117

117

00:05:44,711  -->  00:05:48,127
and we want it to have a box shadow as well.
118

118

00:05:48,127  -->  00:05:51,210
And that box shadow is zero, two rem,
119

119

00:05:52,133  -->  00:05:55,466
then five rem for the blur, RGBA, black,
120

120

00:05:57,428  -->  00:05:59,566
and then just very subtle here.
121

121

00:05:59,566  -->  00:06:02,690
So, almost invisible shadow, just like this.
122

122

00:06:02,690  -->  00:06:04,773
So, let's check that out.
123

123

00:06:05,740  -->  00:06:06,899
And so, here we go.
124

124

00:06:06,899  -->  00:06:09,119
So maybe the shadow isn't even visible to you
125

125

00:06:09,119  -->  00:06:10,160
here in the screen cast.
126

126

00:06:10,160  -->  00:06:12,230
But I'm sure you're gonna see it on your page
127

127

00:06:12,230  -->  00:06:14,493
and it will look even better when this element
128

128

00:06:14,493  -->  00:06:16,458
actually grows a bit bigger.
129

129

00:06:16,458  -->  00:06:20,625
Let's actually do that already, just by adding some padding.
130

130

00:06:22,125  -->  00:06:23,274
So, three rem.
131

131

00:06:23,274  -->  00:06:25,154
And also another thing that I wanna do,
132

132

00:06:25,154  -->  00:06:26,932
is to create a variable for this.
133

133

00:06:26,932  -->  00:06:29,323
Because, we're gonna re-use this shadow later
134

134

00:06:29,323  -->  00:06:30,968
for the review boxes.
135

135

00:06:30,968  -->  00:06:33,135
Okay, so let me copy that.
136

136

00:06:34,324  -->  00:06:38,768
Okay, and you see we have already a shadow here.
137

137

00:06:38,768  -->  00:06:40,518
And so, shadow light.
138

138

00:06:43,095  -->  00:06:44,595
And it's this one.
139

139

00:06:46,367  -->  00:06:47,784
So, shadow light.
140

140

00:06:51,988  -->  00:06:53,763
And alright.
141

141

00:06:53,763  -->  00:06:55,423
Check that out.
142

142

00:06:55,423  -->  00:06:58,336
An now you can actually see the shadow here a bit better.
143

143

00:06:58,336  -->  00:07:00,345
You also see that this one here already grew
144

144

00:07:00,345  -->  00:07:03,253
to have the same size as the description box.
145

145

00:07:03,253  -->  00:07:05,674
And that's, once again, because the align items
146

146

00:07:05,674  -->  00:07:08,577
property is by default set to stretch.
147

147

00:07:08,577  -->  00:07:10,372
And so, therefore, they're both stretched
148

148

00:07:10,372  -->  00:07:11,794
to have the same size.
149

149

00:07:11,794  -->  00:07:14,662
Now, what do we have here in this description box,
150

150

00:07:14,662  -->  00:07:16,330
Let's take a look.
151

151

00:07:16,330  -->  00:07:18,993
And what we have is these two paragraphs,
152

152

00:07:18,993  -->  00:07:21,819
then this list here and then down here,
153

153

00:07:21,819  -->  00:07:24,198
like this recommend panel, okay.
154

154

00:07:24,198  -->  00:07:26,490
So there's text in with these pictures here
155

155

00:07:26,490  -->  00:07:28,717
of the friends who recommend the hotel.
156

156

00:07:28,717  -->  00:07:32,884
Alright so, let's mark that up here back in the HTML.
157

157

00:07:34,495  -->  00:07:38,328
So, P, and I'm simply gonna call it paragraph.
158

158

00:07:40,307  -->  00:07:44,462
And then I actually have a file here called text, TXT,
159

159

00:07:44,462  -->  00:07:48,045
here in the image folder, where is the text
160

160

00:07:48,942  -->  00:07:50,692
that I want to put there.
161

161

00:07:50,692  -->  00:07:53,548
So, for the first paragraph, this is the text that I want.
162

162

00:07:53,548  -->  00:07:55,800
And so, please go ahead and copy it,
163

163

00:07:55,800  -->  00:07:58,023
so that it looks exactly the way
164

164

00:07:58,023  -->  00:07:59,534
that I want it to look, okay.
165

165

00:07:59,534  -->  00:08:03,367
And then we have another paragraph after that,
166

166

00:08:04,529  -->  00:08:06,279
with some other text.
167

167

00:08:13,993  -->  00:08:15,475
Okay.
168

168

00:08:15,475  -->  00:08:20,124
Next up we have that list, so, an unordered list.
169

169

00:08:20,124  -->  00:08:21,560
And we're simply gonna call it list.
170

170

00:08:21,560  -->  00:08:24,002
And so these are basically reusable components,
171

171

00:08:24,002  -->  00:08:27,925
that could be reusable if our app had another page,
172

172

00:08:27,925  -->  00:08:29,022
another section.
173

173

00:08:29,022  -->  00:08:31,578
So for example, on the flight section, or the tours,
174

174

00:08:31,578  -->  00:08:32,842
or the car rental sections.
175

175

00:08:32,842  -->  00:08:35,771
So maybe if we had that we could then reuse
176

176

00:08:35,771  -->  00:08:37,690
these components there.
177

177

00:08:37,690  -->  00:08:38,523
So, LI...
178

178

00:08:42,261  -->  00:08:43,499
List item.
179

179

00:08:43,499  -->  00:08:46,621
So the first one says close to the beach,
180

180

00:08:46,621  -->  00:08:49,851
and now let me just copy these lines.
181

181

00:08:49,851  -->  00:08:50,843
Actually, it copied a lot of times.
182

182

00:08:50,843  -->  00:08:52,839
I think it's eight times, so,
183

183

00:08:52,839  -->  00:08:55,256
one, two, three, four, eight.
184

184

00:08:58,816  -->  00:09:00,733
So, breakfast included.
185

185

00:09:05,382  -->  00:09:06,503
Free airport shuttle.
186

186

00:09:06,503  -->  00:09:08,851
And then there's actually one thing that I wanna show you.
187

187

00:09:08,851  -->  00:09:11,232
And I think this is part of embed as well.
188

188

00:09:11,232  -->  00:09:13,966
But, anyway I have it here in my text editor,
189

189

00:09:13,966  -->  00:09:15,825
and it is called expand selection.
190

190

00:09:15,825  -->  00:09:18,264
And what that does, is basically when I'm inside
191

191

00:09:18,264  -->  00:09:21,365
of this text here, when I hit expand selection like this,
192

192

00:09:21,365  -->  00:09:24,585
then it will select this entire text, okay.
193

193

00:09:24,585  -->  00:09:27,687
And now if I hit that again, it will expand the selection
194

194

00:09:27,687  -->  00:09:31,540
even more, and will select this entire part here.
195

195

00:09:31,540  -->  00:09:36,113
And if I hit it again, it will expand and select everything.
196

196

00:09:36,113  -->  00:09:39,530
Okay so, expand selection, maybe you have it in your
197

197

00:09:39,530  -->  00:09:41,230
text editor as well.
198

198

00:09:41,230  -->  00:09:43,260
It's a really useful feature.
199

199

00:09:43,260  -->  00:09:46,559
So I'm jut going to use a shortcut here.
200

200

00:09:46,559  -->  00:09:49,334
So, that makes it much easier.
201

201

00:09:49,334  -->  00:09:51,584
So, free Wifi in all rooms.
202

202

00:09:54,119  -->  00:09:57,286
Next up, air conditioning and heating.
203

203

00:10:04,356  -->  00:10:05,189
Pets allowed.
204

204

00:10:05,189  -->  00:10:07,715
And I'm just making this a huge list so that we can use
205

205

00:10:07,715  -->  00:10:09,824
some flex-blocks on this a bit later.
206

206

00:10:09,824  -->  00:10:12,302
Until we have to have a couple of list items here,
207

207

00:10:12,302  -->  00:10:14,135
not just two or three.
208

208

00:10:16,759  -->  00:10:20,926
We speak all language, and finally, perfect for families.
209

209

00:10:23,204  -->  00:10:25,983
Okay, so these are just a basic couple of features
210

210

00:10:25,983  -->  00:10:27,703
of our hotel, basically.
211

211

00:10:27,703  -->  00:10:32,110
And then, next up finally, we have do you recommend section.
212

212

00:10:32,110  -->  00:10:34,693
So, just a div code, recommend.
213

213

00:10:36,294  -->  00:10:40,294
And then we have some text there, so, paragraph,
214

214

00:10:42,194  -->  00:10:43,732
which is the recommend count.
215

215

00:10:43,732  -->  00:10:47,899
We're just gonna say, Lucy and three other friends
216

216

00:10:50,505  -->  00:10:52,255
recommend this hotel.
217

217

00:10:53,328  -->  00:10:56,008
Well this is not perfect.
218

218

00:10:56,008  -->  00:11:00,175
So, recommend this hotel, and then we have a div here.
219

219

00:11:03,554  -->  00:11:06,479
So at container, where we're gonna put the pictures
220

220

00:11:06,479  -->  00:11:08,003
of these friends.
221

221

00:11:08,003  -->  00:11:10,670
So an image with the class name,
222

222

00:11:12,775  -->  00:11:14,645
recommend photo.
223

223

00:11:14,645  -->  00:11:17,228
With the source, IMG, and user,
224

224

00:11:18,707  -->  00:11:21,457
I'm going to start here at three.
225

225

00:11:25,137  -->  00:11:28,517
And we have four pictures, and this one is number four,
226

226

00:11:28,517  -->  00:11:29,684
five, and six.
227

227

00:11:30,749  -->  00:11:33,499
Enter here just alternative text.
228

228

00:11:34,397  -->  00:11:37,299
And that is pretty much it, I believe.
229

229

00:11:37,299  -->  00:11:39,382
So, let's check that out,
230

230

00:11:40,326  -->  00:11:41,936
and here we go.
231

231

00:11:41,936  -->  00:11:43,729
So that's our content.
232

232

00:11:43,729  -->  00:11:46,327
Let's now just set an overall font size here,
233

233

00:11:46,327  -->  00:11:49,505
so that we basically format the font
234

234

00:11:49,505  -->  00:11:51,995
of the entire container at the same time.
235

235

00:11:51,995  -->  00:11:56,162
So in the description box, font size, 14 pixels, so 1.4 rem.
236

236

00:11:58,471  -->  00:12:02,702
And so, yeah, I think we're done with this file here.
237

237

00:12:02,702  -->  00:12:06,035
And so, we can now come to the next one.
238

238

00:12:07,003  -->  00:12:08,944
Alright, and once again you see that this one here
239

239

00:12:08,944  -->  00:12:11,595
stretches to fill the entire content.
240

240

00:12:11,595  -->  00:12:12,725
You know what you also see,
241

241

00:12:12,725  -->  00:12:14,866
is that the container is now too big.
242

242

00:12:14,866  -->  00:12:17,388
And that's because we set a fixed height
243

243

00:12:17,388  -->  00:12:20,127
here on the hotel view container I believe.
244

244

00:12:20,127  -->  00:12:22,994
So let me check that out and remove it,
245

245

00:12:22,994  -->  00:12:24,602
because that was just for testing.
246

246

00:12:24,602  -->  00:12:25,435
Yeah, here you see it?
247

247

00:12:25,435  -->  00:12:28,125
So the hotel view has this height of 80 rem,
248

248

00:12:28,125  -->  00:12:30,102
but now we of course don't want that anymore.
249

249

00:12:30,102  -->  00:12:32,079
We want the content to define the height
250

250

00:12:32,079  -->  00:12:33,750
of the box as usual.
251

251

00:12:33,750  -->  00:12:36,064
And so now that should be gone.
252

252

00:12:36,064  -->  00:12:40,246
And yeah, alright, so now we're ready to format
253

253

00:12:40,246  -->  00:12:42,568
all of these components that we now have
254

254

00:12:42,568  -->  00:12:44,201
in our description box.
255

255

00:12:44,201  -->  00:12:46,441
So let's do that right in the next video.
256

256

00:12:46,441  -->  00:12:48,774
I hope you'll join me there.
