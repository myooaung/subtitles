00:00:01,218  -->  00:00:05,385
<v ->Let's continue to build the overview of our hotel.</v>
2

2

00:00:06,236  -->  00:00:08,998
So the first thing I wanna do is to add a border
3

3

00:00:08,998  -->  00:00:10,953
to the bottom of this element here.
4

4

00:00:10,953  -->  00:00:14,863
A small gray line such as the header has, or should have,
5

5

00:00:14,863  -->  00:00:18,493
because it doesn't have the line here that it should have.
6

6

00:00:18,493  -->  00:00:20,536
So probably something's going wrong there.
7

7

00:00:20,536  -->  00:00:22,914
So let's check that out.
8

8

00:00:22,914  -->  00:00:27,556
So right here in the layout, the header, border-bottom,
9

9

00:00:27,556  -->  00:00:30,308
oh okay, so (laughs) I only specified the color.
10

10

00:00:30,308  -->  00:00:34,393
Of course I also have to specify the width and the type.
11

11

00:00:34,393  -->  00:00:37,654
So one pixel solid, and it's actually the exact same one
12

12

00:00:37,654  -->  00:00:39,143
that I want
13

13

00:00:39,143  -->  00:00:41,801
here on the hotel overview.
14

14

00:00:41,801  -->  00:00:44,400
(clicking)
15

15

00:00:44,400  -->  00:00:45,668
Yeah, now that's better.
16

16

00:00:45,668  -->  00:00:48,366
So now you see the border here separating the header
17

17

00:00:48,366  -->  00:00:49,799
from the rest of the page,
18

18

00:00:49,799  -->  00:00:52,008
and that's specially visible here on this image,
19

19

00:00:52,008  -->  00:00:54,092
which is also white on the top.
20

20

00:00:54,092  -->  00:00:56,916
And down here we have it in the overview as well.
21

21

00:00:56,916  -->  00:00:59,408
Next, we should probably vertically center
22

22

00:00:59,408  -->  00:01:02,269
these four elements in this box.
23

23

00:01:02,269  -->  00:01:03,673
And so we're going to use Flexbox,
24

24

00:01:03,673  -->  00:01:06,087
which we already have active here,
25

25

00:01:06,087  -->  00:01:09,670
and using the align-items: property, right?
26

26

00:01:10,813  -->  00:01:14,396
So aligning the items along the cross axis,
27

27

00:01:15,577  -->  00:01:17,328
and you want center.
28

28

00:01:17,328  -->  00:01:19,157
And with one simple line of CSS
29

29

00:01:19,157  -->  00:01:21,987
all of this is now vertically aligned.
30

30

00:01:21,987  -->  00:01:24,635
Next up is the header,
31

31

00:01:24,635  -->  00:01:25,885
or the heading.
32

32

00:01:26,987  -->  00:01:29,987
So font-size:, I chose 2.25rem here,
33

33

00:01:32,799  -->  00:01:35,619
as a font-weight: we only want 300,
34

34

00:01:35,619  -->  00:01:38,452
so big text but small font weight.
35

35

00:01:39,627  -->  00:01:41,787
Then text-transform: to uppercase,
36

36

00:01:41,787  -->  00:01:44,954
and also a very slight letter-spacing:
37

37

00:01:46,944  -->  00:01:49,864
of one pixel, that makes it look slightly better.
38

38

00:01:49,864  -->  00:01:51,870
Then of course, some padding: here
39

39

00:01:51,870  -->  00:01:54,693
to give it some breathing space around it.
40

40

00:01:54,693  -->  00:01:59,683
And 1.5rem top and bottom, and three left and right.
41

41

00:01:59,683  -->  00:02:02,588
And so, let's take a look at that.
42

42

00:02:02,588  -->  00:02:05,006
Alright, that looks a lot better already.
43

43

00:02:05,006  -->  00:02:07,092
And you saw that all of the items, of course,
44

44

00:02:07,092  -->  00:02:10,893
automatically adjusted and are still vertically centered.
45

45

00:02:10,893  -->  00:02:12,814
And so next up are our stars.
46

46

00:02:12,814  -->  00:02:14,572
And for some reason you see that they are not,
47

47

00:02:14,572  -->  00:02:18,358
really not 100 percent vertically aligned,
48

48

00:02:18,358  -->  00:02:20,691
so lets take a look at that.
49

49

00:02:23,997  -->  00:02:26,495
Right, so this here is the element,
50

50

00:02:26,495  -->  00:02:28,050
so the container of these stars.
51

51

00:02:28,050  -->  00:02:29,073
And you see that there is like,
52

52

00:02:29,073  -->  00:02:32,141
a small space below each of the stars.
53

53

00:02:32,141  -->  00:02:34,470
And that happens because these SVG elements,
54

54

00:02:34,470  -->  00:02:36,926
they behave like in-line elements,
55

55

00:02:36,926  -->  00:02:38,811
and so it's a bit like text.
56

56

00:02:38,811  -->  00:02:41,881
That produces that small white space that we see here.
57

57

00:02:41,881  -->  00:02:43,886
We can remove that by setting the line height
58

58

00:02:43,886  -->  00:02:45,768
and the font size to zero, for example,
59

59

00:02:45,768  -->  00:02:48,591
but we have a simpler way of doing that.
60

60

00:02:48,591  -->  00:02:50,023
And that is by simply setting
61

61

00:02:50,023  -->  00:02:52,690
their parent element to Flexbox.
62

62

00:02:55,451  -->  00:02:57,248
So just do display: flex;
63

63

00:02:57,248  -->  00:03:00,248
and all of these icon star elements,
64

64

00:03:02,504  -->  00:03:03,450
these here,
65

65

00:03:03,450  -->  00:03:05,139
they will now become flex items
66

66

00:03:05,139  -->  00:03:07,060
and then that space will be gone.
67

67

00:03:07,060  -->  00:03:08,613
And there you see it.
68

68

00:03:08,613  -->  00:03:10,453
So you see that now this parent element,
69

69

00:03:10,453  -->  00:03:11,762
which is now a flex container,
70

70

00:03:11,762  -->  00:03:14,910
has the exact same height as the stars themselves.
71

71

00:03:14,910  -->  00:03:17,815
So now it's vertically centered perfectly and also,
72

72

00:03:17,815  -->  00:03:19,901
they are now really nicely side by side,
73

73

00:03:19,901  -->  00:03:21,783
which they weren't before.
74

74

00:03:21,783  -->  00:03:23,787
So let's take that out.
75

75

00:03:23,787  -->  00:03:26,445
So that's without flex and that's with flex,
76

76

00:03:26,445  -->  00:03:29,028
and so that looks a lot better.
77

77

00:03:29,964  -->  00:03:34,405
Next up, let's actually format this in line button here.
78

78

00:03:34,405  -->  00:03:37,856
So that is a whole new component, right?
79

79

00:03:37,856  -->  00:03:40,439
So it's called btn-inline here,
80

80

00:03:42,261  -->  00:03:46,011
so let's create a new component for that one.
81

81

00:03:48,435  -->  00:03:50,768
I also want to comment here.
82

82

00:03:53,460  -->  00:03:55,710
(clicking)
83

83

00:03:58,871  -->  00:04:00,704
And so, button inline.
84

84

00:04:02,602  -->  00:04:06,068
So, first thing is we want to remove the border
85

85

00:04:06,068  -->  00:04:07,764
of this button,
86

86

00:04:07,764  -->  00:04:08,868
because these buttons by default
87

87

00:04:08,868  -->  00:04:10,013
always come with this border
88

88

00:04:10,013  -->  00:04:12,509
and we don't want that of course.
89

89

00:04:12,509  -->  00:04:15,667
Then we want the color: to be the primary color.
90

90

00:04:15,667  -->  00:04:17,917
(clicking)
91

91

00:04:21,104  -->  00:04:23,104
And we want a font-size:
92

92

00:04:24,226  -->  00:04:27,541
of, actually we want it to be inherit.
93

93

00:04:27,541  -->  00:04:28,853
Okay, and why is that?
94

94

00:04:28,853  -->  00:04:31,840
Well, let me show you the example here.
95

95

00:04:31,840  -->  00:04:35,155
So in this case, for example, the text is really small
96

96

00:04:35,155  -->  00:04:37,774
and down here where we use it again, it's bigger.
97

97

00:04:37,774  -->  00:04:40,595
And so we do that by setting one font size here
98

98

00:04:40,595  -->  00:04:42,273
on this parent element,
99

99

00:04:42,273  -->  00:04:44,650
for example this huge parent element here,
100

100

00:04:44,650  -->  00:04:46,656
and then we can also set a font size
101

101

00:04:46,656  -->  00:04:48,784
on the parent element of this button,
102

102

00:04:48,784  -->  00:04:51,486
and then all we have to do is to set the font size
103

103

00:04:51,486  -->  00:04:53,982
on that button itself to inherit.
104

104

00:04:53,982  -->  00:04:58,109
And so by that it becomes a bit more modular, more reusable.
105

105

00:04:58,109  -->  00:05:01,753
Next we want it to have a border at the bottom,
106

106

00:05:01,753  -->  00:05:02,753
of one pixel
107

107

00:05:03,786  -->  00:05:04,669
solid
108

108

00:05:04,669  -->  00:05:07,972
and now is the time where I'm gonna use currentColor again.
109

109

00:05:07,972  -->  00:05:10,018
Okay, and that's because this way,
110

110

00:05:10,018  -->  00:05:12,966
the border will have the exact same color as the text,
111

111

00:05:12,966  -->  00:05:14,235
and that's what we want.
112

112

00:05:14,235  -->  00:05:17,185
And later when I then add the hover effect,
113

113

00:05:17,185  -->  00:05:19,685
which I can actually do right now,
114

114

00:05:19,685  -->  00:05:21,935
(clicking)
115

115

00:05:22,786  -->  00:05:24,398
all I have to say then is that I want the
116

116

00:05:24,398  -->  00:05:25,315
color to be
117

117

00:05:27,083  -->  00:05:28,250
the dark gray.
118

118

00:05:29,144  -->  00:05:32,644
So (--color-grey-dark-1).
119

119

00:05:34,331  -->  00:05:36,574
So all I have to do is to change the text color
120

120

00:05:36,574  -->  00:05:39,193
in the hover state and then the border
121

121

00:05:39,193  -->  00:05:41,852
will automatically update as well, right?
122

122

00:05:41,852  -->  00:05:43,852
So let's check that out.
123

123

00:05:46,355  -->  00:05:48,606
So here you go, as we hover the button
124

124

00:05:48,606  -->  00:05:51,302
the border becomes the exact same color as the text.
125

125

00:05:51,302  -->  00:05:52,570
So without currentColor,
126

126

00:05:52,570  -->  00:05:54,654
I would now have to add another line here
127

127

00:05:54,654  -->  00:05:59,236
and say border bottom and then also with this gray color.
128

128

00:05:59,236  -->  00:06:01,407
But with currentColor we don't have to do
129

129

00:06:01,407  -->  00:06:03,455
anything like that, and that's great.
130

130

00:06:03,455  -->  00:06:06,527
So next, we want a small padding at the bottom as well
131

131

00:06:06,527  -->  00:06:08,526
of two pixels, to create some space
132

132

00:06:08,526  -->  00:06:10,572
between the text and the border.
133

133

00:06:10,572  -->  00:06:12,454
And also we want this to be displayed
134

134

00:06:12,454  -->  00:06:16,052
as an inline-block and not just as inline.
135

135

00:06:16,052  -->  00:06:19,530
And I saw that the background was this weird gray
136

136

00:06:19,530  -->  00:06:21,968
and I also don't want that,
137

137

00:06:21,968  -->  00:06:24,988
so background-color and I'm gonna set it to transparent,
138

138

00:06:24,988  -->  00:06:27,280
so once again this helps making the button
139

139

00:06:27,280  -->  00:06:30,063
a bit more modular because here in this case,
140

140

00:06:30,063  -->  00:06:32,680
for example, it is on a gray background,
141

141

00:06:32,680  -->  00:06:34,522
but here it's on a white background.
142

142

00:06:34,522  -->  00:06:37,834
So we don't want to attribute a fixed color
143

143

00:06:37,834  -->  00:06:39,593
for that background.
144

144

00:06:39,593  -->  00:06:43,767
Okay now all we have to do is set the cursor: to pointer
145

145

00:06:43,767  -->  00:06:46,182
and then add the transition of course,
146

146

00:06:46,182  -->  00:06:47,682
so transition: all
147

147

00:06:48,532  -->  00:06:49,695
.2 seconds.
148

148

00:06:49,695  -->  00:06:52,612
So that is the basic functionality,
149

149

00:06:54,873  -->  00:06:56,023
so it works great,
150

150

00:06:56,023  -->  00:06:59,870
but remember that we also had this focus effect.
151

151

00:06:59,870  -->  00:07:01,955
So this animation effect here.
152

152

00:07:01,955  -->  00:07:03,754
And I put it here so that I could show you
153

153

00:07:03,754  -->  00:07:07,182
another cool thing with animations.
154

154

00:07:07,182  -->  00:07:10,698
Okay, so let me show that to you.
155

155

00:07:10,698  -->  00:07:12,948
(clicking)
156

156

00:07:14,455  -->  00:07:15,288
So, focus
157

157

00:07:17,116  -->  00:07:19,463
and the first thing is outline: none;
158

158

00:07:19,463  -->  00:07:22,247
which is going to remove that default blue border,
159

159

00:07:22,247  -->  00:07:23,842
but then we have to actually create
160

160

00:07:23,842  -->  00:07:26,912
that pulsating animation that we just saw okay?
161

161

00:07:26,912  -->  00:07:31,372
So that is a CSS animation using the keyframes at rule.
162

162

00:07:31,372  -->  00:07:33,772
Alright, because we have no way of doing that
163

163

00:07:33,772  -->  00:07:35,492
with a transition animation,
164

164

00:07:35,492  -->  00:07:38,316
so we write what we want to happen using
165

165

00:07:38,316  -->  00:07:40,149
the keyframes at rule.
166

166

00:07:41,306  -->  00:07:43,433
Okay, so @keyframes and I'm gonna call this
167

167

00:07:43,433  -->  00:07:45,675
animation pulsate.
168

168

00:07:45,675  -->  00:07:47,925
(clicking)
169

169

00:07:49,492  -->  00:07:53,492
And then I define what happens at the beginning,
170

170

00:07:54,807  -->  00:07:58,531
at the end, and also in the middle.
171

171

00:07:58,531  -->  00:08:00,536
So we have three states here,
172

172

00:08:00,536  -->  00:08:04,322
so one at zero, one at 50% of the time,
173

173

00:08:04,322  -->  00:08:05,860
and then 100%.
174

174

00:08:05,860  -->  00:08:09,172
So let's take a close look at what actually happens here
175

175

00:08:09,172  -->  00:08:11,258
so that we can code up this animation.
176

176

00:08:11,258  -->  00:08:13,473
So basically in the beginning nothing happens,
177

177

00:08:13,473  -->  00:08:16,215
then in the middle it is scaled up a little bit,
178

178

00:08:16,215  -->  00:08:17,669
and it has this shadow going on,
179

179

00:08:17,669  -->  00:08:20,902
and then in the end it goes back to the normal.
180

180

00:08:20,902  -->  00:08:23,319
And so that's what we have to code up here.
181

181

00:08:23,319  -->  00:08:25,761
So the state in the middle basically
182

182

00:08:25,761  -->  00:08:28,624
is just a transform with a scale.
183

183

00:08:28,624  -->  00:08:31,919
So we scale this just a little bit,
184

184

00:08:31,919  -->  00:08:32,752
like 1.05,
185

185

00:08:34,170  -->  00:08:37,753
and we also give it a very small box-shadow
186

186

00:08:39,192  -->  00:08:41,609
like 0 1rem 4rem for the blur
187

187

00:08:43,622  -->  00:08:45,122
and then the color
188

188

00:08:46,374  -->  00:08:47,749
of black with
189

189

00:08:47,749  -->  00:08:48,582
.25
190

190

00:08:49,591  -->  00:08:50,882
opacity.
191

191

00:08:50,882  -->  00:08:52,826
And then what we have to do is to of course
192

192

00:08:52,826  -->  00:08:56,576
set the initial and the final state
193

193

00:08:56,576  -->  00:08:57,978
to the normal state.
194

194

00:08:57,978  -->  00:09:00,728
So scale of one and no box-shadow
195

195

00:09:01,718  -->  00:09:04,949
and that's very easy, we just use the none keyword,
196

196

00:09:04,949  -->  00:09:08,063
and at the end it's exactly the same.
197

197

00:09:08,063  -->  00:09:10,329
Okay, so in the beginning we have
198

198

00:09:10,329  -->  00:09:11,788
no scale and no box-shadow,
199

199

00:09:11,788  -->  00:09:15,186
then at 50% we scale it up a little bit, give it a shadow,
200

200

00:09:15,186  -->  00:09:18,404
and then 100% back to normal.
201

201

00:09:18,404  -->  00:09:20,932
And now all we have to do is to add
202

202

00:09:20,932  -->  00:09:22,539
our animation: property.
203

203

00:09:22,539  -->  00:09:23,622
So animation:
204

204

00:09:25,086  -->  00:09:26,711
pulsate
205

205

00:09:26,711  -->  00:09:27,593
one second
206

206

00:09:27,593  -->  00:09:29,389
but that is actually not enough,
207

207

00:09:29,389  -->  00:09:33,770
because look at what happens when we do that.
208

208

00:09:33,770  -->  00:09:36,388
So I'm gonna click now.
209

209

00:09:36,388  -->  00:09:38,965
And it happened, but it only happened once of course.
210

210

00:09:38,965  -->  00:09:43,139
I can click again, and then it's gonna happen again,
211

211

00:09:43,139  -->  00:09:45,389
but I want it to be infinite.
212

212

00:09:45,389  -->  00:09:46,946
And so all we have to do is
213

213

00:09:46,946  -->  00:09:49,403
to actually add the word infinite
214

214

00:09:49,403  -->  00:09:51,696
and so that is going to create an infinite animation
215

215

00:09:51,696  -->  00:09:53,945
as long as the button is focused of course.
216

216

00:09:53,945  -->  00:09:56,730
So this only applies in the focused state of course.
217

217

00:09:56,730  -->  00:10:00,289
But try it now, it should already be working,
218

218

00:10:00,289  -->  00:10:02,273
and yeah actually it is.
219

219

00:10:02,273  -->  00:10:03,482
So, great.
220

220

00:10:03,482  -->  00:10:05,893
So we have that part completed as well.
221

221

00:10:05,893  -->  00:10:08,146
And now we should probably define a font size
222

222

00:10:08,146  -->  00:10:10,931
for this parent element as I was saying before,
223

223

00:10:10,931  -->  00:10:15,098
and we should also vertically align these two elements.
224

224

00:10:16,824  -->  00:10:19,582
So, moving back up here, we have the location,
225

225

00:10:19,582  -->  00:10:20,749
ah here it is.
226

226

00:10:22,113  -->  00:10:25,866
So lets give it a font-size of 1.2rem
227

227

00:10:25,866  -->  00:10:28,566
and then we want to vertically align the two elements,
228

228

00:10:28,566  -->  00:10:30,203
the icon and the button.
229

229

00:10:30,203  -->  00:10:32,536
So of course we use Flexbox,
230

230

00:10:33,626  -->  00:10:34,811
display: flex;
231

231

00:10:34,811  -->  00:10:36,561
and vertically align,
232

232

00:10:37,836  -->  00:10:38,669
center.
233

233

00:10:38,669  -->  00:10:40,574
So by now you've used it so many times
234

234

00:10:40,574  -->  00:10:44,195
that I'm sure that it's becoming really familiar.
235

235

00:10:44,195  -->  00:10:46,816
Okay, now we should just give some space here
236

236

00:10:46,816  -->  00:10:48,659
to the right side here of this icon
237

237

00:10:48,659  -->  00:10:51,645
so to create some space between these two.
238

238

00:10:51,645  -->  00:10:54,478
So actually we need this selector,
239

239

00:10:56,644  -->  00:10:58,894
(clicking)
240

240

00:11:01,179  -->  00:11:03,846
so margin-right let's say .5rem,
241

241

00:11:06,458  -->  00:11:09,898
okay and so now we have this part here completed as well.
242

242

00:11:09,898  -->  00:11:13,372
So all that's left to do is now this writing part
243

243

00:11:13,372  -->  00:11:15,541
so let's do that.
244

244

00:11:15,541  -->  00:11:16,893
So first, it's the background-color
245

245

00:11:16,893  -->  00:11:20,726
that you noticed to be our primary pink color.
246

246

00:11:24,586  -->  00:11:27,407
So (--color-primary) then also let's give it a margin
247

247

00:11:27,407  -->  00:11:29,861
to the right side to create that space
248

248

00:11:29,861  -->  00:11:32,626
between the location and the rating, so 3rem,
249

249

00:11:32,626  -->  00:11:34,189
and actually it's not to the right
250

250

00:11:34,189  -->  00:11:36,114
it's to the left of course.
251

251

00:11:36,114  -->  00:11:39,408
And also it should have a white color.
252

252

00:11:39,408  -->  00:11:40,241
So color:
253

253

00:11:43,213  -->  00:11:44,855
white.
254

254

00:11:44,855  -->  00:11:47,840
And now just for this text here,
255

255

00:11:47,840  -->  00:11:50,294
so the average is really big,
256

256

00:11:50,294  -->  00:11:51,127
so 2.25rem
257

257

00:11:54,957  -->  00:11:58,252
and then a smaller font-weight
258

258

00:11:58,252  -->  00:12:00,870
and then the count down there is a lot smaller.
259

259

00:12:00,870  -->  00:12:05,037
So font-size: .8rem; and also I want it to uppercase.
260

260

00:12:08,157  -->  00:12:10,243
So let's take a look at that,
261

261

00:12:10,243  -->  00:12:12,164
and that looks pretty good already,
262

262

00:12:12,164  -->  00:12:14,659
we just need some padding here on the left and right side.
263

263

00:12:14,659  -->  00:12:16,870
And of course, this should stretch
264

264

00:12:16,870  -->  00:12:19,731
the entire height of the parent container right?
265

265

00:12:19,731  -->  00:12:23,085
So going from up here, all the way down here.
266

266

00:12:23,085  -->  00:12:24,393
So how do we do that?
267

267

00:12:24,393  -->  00:12:28,197
Take a moment and think about how we can do that, okay?
268

268

00:12:28,197  -->  00:12:29,709
So have you figured it out?
269

269

00:12:29,709  -->  00:12:31,754
Well it's actually the exact same situation
270

270

00:12:31,754  -->  00:12:34,657
that we had up here with these elements, right?
271

271

00:12:34,657  -->  00:12:36,948
We also wanted them to stretch all the way
272

272

00:12:36,948  -->  00:12:38,425
from the top to the bottom,
273

273

00:12:38,425  -->  00:12:42,292
and so that's what we need to do here.
274

274

00:12:42,292  -->  00:12:46,459
We do that by setting the align-self: property right?
275

275

00:12:48,641  -->  00:12:50,564
And we simply set it to stretch,
276

276

00:12:50,564  -->  00:12:53,184
because remember that all of these elements
277

277

00:12:53,184  -->  00:12:55,980
are aligned to the center because of this declaration
278

278

00:12:55,980  -->  00:12:57,455
that we have up here.
279

279

00:12:57,455  -->  00:12:59,402
And so now we override that here
280

280

00:12:59,402  -->  00:13:02,226
for this single element called &amp;_rating
281

281

00:13:02,226  -->  00:13:04,151
and align it to the stretch,
282

282

00:13:04,151  -->  00:13:05,786
so basically make it stretch
283

283

00:13:05,786  -->  00:13:09,808
and occupy all the space that it has available for that.
284

284

00:13:09,808  -->  00:13:11,813
Okay, and now just about the padding
285

285

00:13:11,813  -->  00:13:13,576
that I was talking about,
286

286

00:13:13,576  -->  00:13:15,789
so we don't need any padding at top and bottom,
287

287

00:13:15,789  -->  00:13:19,956
we just need padding at the left and right side, so 2.25rem.
288

288

00:13:23,155  -->  00:13:24,953
Alright, and now what's left to do
289

289

00:13:24,953  -->  00:13:28,922
is to center these two both horizontally and vertically
290

290

00:13:28,922  -->  00:13:30,681
here in this container.
291

291

00:13:30,681  -->  00:13:35,056
So my favorite tool for that is of course, Flexbox.
292

292

00:13:35,056  -->  00:13:36,840
So, display:
293

293

00:13:36,840  -->  00:13:37,673
flex;
294

294

00:13:38,721  -->  00:13:42,138
and I'm gonna say align-items: to center,
295

295

00:13:44,496  -->  00:13:46,870
and justify-content: to center as well.
296

296

00:13:46,870  -->  00:13:48,673
But now you will probably think
297

297

00:13:48,673  -->  00:13:50,177
that there will be a problem with this,
298

298

00:13:50,177  -->  00:13:51,773
and that is absolutely true,
299

299

00:13:51,773  -->  00:13:55,293
because they will now be side by side right?
300

300

00:13:55,293  -->  00:13:56,726
So the elements are side by side
301

301

00:13:56,726  -->  00:13:58,729
and no longer on top of each other,
302

302

00:13:58,729  -->  00:14:00,760
and that's exactly what Flexbox does,
303

303

00:14:00,760  -->  00:14:03,582
it lays out the flex items in a row.
304

304

00:14:03,582  -->  00:14:06,506
But remember that we can change that, right?
305

305

00:14:06,506  -->  00:14:10,508
And so all we have to do is to set flex-direction:
306

306

00:14:10,508  -->  00:14:11,799
to column
307

307

00:14:11,799  -->  00:14:14,315
and that's actually it.
308

308

00:14:14,315  -->  00:14:15,870
So let's see, and here we go.
309

309

00:14:15,870  -->  00:14:19,065
So in the main axis, the justify content
310

310

00:14:19,065  -->  00:14:21,085
aligns these elements to the center.
311

311

00:14:21,085  -->  00:14:22,927
So in that direction they are to the center,
312

312

00:14:22,927  -->  00:14:25,177
and then along the cross axis which is notice,
313

313

00:14:25,177  -->  00:14:28,192
align items also centers the elements.
314

314

00:14:28,192  -->  00:14:30,118
And so that's what we end up with.
315

315

00:14:30,118  -->  00:14:32,162
Now I just want to slightly decrease
316

316

00:14:32,162  -->  00:14:35,641
the space between these two, and that's very simple.
317

317

00:14:35,641  -->  00:14:39,611
So I can simply set a negative margin to the bottom,
318

318

00:14:39,611  -->  00:14:40,611
so like -3px
319

319

00:14:44,301  -->  00:14:46,714
and yeah, that looks more consistent.
320

320

00:14:46,714  -->  00:14:47,547
Looks better.
321

321

00:14:47,547  -->  00:14:51,047
So let's compare it to our original result
322

322

00:14:52,235  -->  00:14:54,620
and yeah, it's actually exactly the same, right?
323

323

00:14:54,620  -->  00:14:57,255
So looks pretty similar, and so yeah,
324

324

00:14:57,255  -->  00:15:00,282
we're done with this part of the interface.
325

325

00:15:00,282  -->  00:15:01,426
It looks great, right?
326

326

00:15:01,426  -->  00:15:04,347
I think it's absolutely fantastic, really beautiful,
327

327

00:15:04,347  -->  00:15:06,346
and I hope that you think the same
328

328

00:15:06,346  -->  00:15:08,237
and that you're really proud of all the work
329

329

00:15:08,237  -->  00:15:11,196
that you have accomplished so far in this section.
330

330

00:15:11,196  -->  00:15:14,316
So great job, I hope you're learning lots of Flexbox
331

331

00:15:14,316  -->  00:15:16,804
and I hope you're really enjoying this project.
332

332

00:15:16,804  -->  00:15:18,583
If you wanna continue with it right now
333

333

00:15:18,583  -->  00:15:22,083
then let's just move on to the next video.
