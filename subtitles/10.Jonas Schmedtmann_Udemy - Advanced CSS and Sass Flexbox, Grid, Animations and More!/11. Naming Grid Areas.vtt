00:00:01.240  -->  00:00:03.897
<v Instructor>So the third method of positioning grid items</v>
2

2

00:00:03.897  -->  00:00:08.351
on the grid, is by actually naming entire areas.
3

3

00:00:08.351  -->  00:00:11.498
So let's see how we can do that.
4

4

00:00:11.498  -->  00:00:16.192
So let's again start by commenting out this code here,
5

5

00:00:16.192  -->  00:00:19.525
so that we can again start from scratch.
6

6

00:00:21.457  -->  00:00:24.974
Or actually, not really from scratch, but simply by using
7

7

00:00:24.974  -->  00:00:28.557
this code that we had in the first example.
8

8

00:00:29.812  -->  00:00:30.645
OK
9

9

00:00:34.529  -->  00:00:38.696
So, method number three is to actually name grid areas.
10

10

00:00:41.445  -->  00:00:43.612
OK, so, how do we do that?
11

11

00:00:45.532  -->  00:00:49.699
Well, we simply use the grid template areas property.
12

12

00:00:53.753  -->  00:00:56.606
And now, this is probably going to look really weird to you.
13

13

00:00:56.606  -->  00:00:59.631
OK, because I remember that when I first saw this,
14

14

00:00:59.631  -->  00:01:02.961
I found it really strange the way it worked.
15

15

00:01:02.961  -->  00:01:06.357
But anyway, this is how we name grid areas.
16

16

00:01:06.357  -->  00:01:08.966
So, we write a couple of strings, and in there
17

17

00:01:08.966  -->  00:01:12.867
we basically give each grid cell a name.
18

18

00:01:12.867  -->  00:01:16.064
OK, so in our case we have a four by four grid.
19

19

00:01:16.064  -->  00:01:17.729
So in the first string we give
20

20

00:01:17.729  -->  00:01:21.419
the first four grid cells four names.
21

21

00:01:21.419  -->  00:01:24.937
OK, and what are our first four cells?
22

22

00:01:24.937  -->  00:01:28.299
Well, it's this, this, this, and this.
23

23

00:01:28.299  -->  00:01:30.962
Right, and all of them are for the header.
24

24

00:01:30.962  -->  00:01:33.302
So let's give them a name,
25

25

00:01:33.302  -->  00:01:35.356
and I'm simply going to call them head.
26

26

00:01:35.356  -->  00:01:39.523
And this is how it works, so head, head, head, and head.
27

27

00:01:41.324  -->  00:01:44.663
So the four cells will be called head,
28

28

00:01:44.663  -->  00:01:46.204
and that's because we want the header
29

29

00:01:46.204  -->  00:01:48.593
to be in all of these four cells.
30

30

00:01:48.593  -->  00:01:50.642
So basically, this first string defines
31

31

00:01:50.642  -->  00:01:53.504
the first row of our grid.
32

32

00:01:53.504  -->  00:01:57.671
OK, now we hit enter, then we come here to this exact place,
33

33

00:01:59.203  -->  00:02:01.188
and actually it doesn't have to be this exact place,
34

34

00:02:01.188  -->  00:02:04.612
but I like to do it like this because it's easier to see,
35

35

00:02:04.612  -->  00:02:08.362
and then we need to call the next four cells.
36

36

00:02:09.227  -->  00:02:12.451
So this one, this one, this one, and this one.
37

37

00:02:12.451  -->  00:02:15.024
So, let's call these three here box,
38

38

00:02:15.024  -->  00:02:17.274
and then the last one side.
39

39

00:02:18.974  -->  00:02:21.222
So in here I like to use the really small name,
40

40

00:02:21.222  -->  00:02:23.932
like as small as possible, so that it doesn't take
41

41

00:02:23.932  -->  00:02:26.424
too much space up here in the declaration.
42

42

00:02:26.424  -->  00:02:28.977
So that it's also not too hard to write,
43

43

00:02:28.977  -->  00:02:31.279
because there's usually a lot of repetition.
44

44

00:02:31.279  -->  00:02:35.446
So you see box, box, box, and then the last one is side.
45

45

00:02:36.549  -->  00:02:39.982
And so basically this template area here just creates
46

46

00:02:39.982  -->  00:02:42.725
a representation with text of how
47

47

00:02:42.725  -->  00:02:45.473
our final layout is gonna look like.
48

48

00:02:45.473  -->  00:02:48.618
So what do we have here in the third row?
49

49

00:02:48.618  -->  00:02:51.034
So basically these three cells.
50

50

00:02:51.034  -->  00:02:53.929
Well, all we have here is the main.
51

51

00:02:53.929  -->  00:02:56.956
So main, main, and main, and then
52

52

00:02:56.956  -->  00:03:00.215
on the side we have the side bar.
53

53

00:03:00.215  -->  00:03:03.155
So these two here will be the side bar,
54

54

00:03:03.155  -->  00:03:05.375
these three will be the main content,
55

55

00:03:05.375  -->  00:03:09.613
and these three will be small boxes, individually.
56

56

00:03:09.613  -->  00:03:13.895
Alright, and then down here, which is the last row,
57

57

00:03:13.895  -->  00:03:17.813
and so it's the last string, we have four times the footer.
58

58

00:03:17.813  -->  00:03:20.313
So let's simply use foot here.
59

59

00:03:22.681  -->  00:03:25.181
So foot, foot, foot, and foot.
60

60

00:03:27.513  -->  00:03:28.395
And that's it.
61

61

00:03:28.395  -->  00:03:30.530
So that is our template string,
62

62

00:03:30.530  -->  00:03:34.391
then at the end don't forget to semicolon.
63

63

00:03:34.391  -->  00:03:37.264
OK, so again this looks a bit weird, I know,
64

64

00:03:37.264  -->  00:03:40.516
but this is actually a great way of placing items
65

65

00:03:40.516  -->  00:03:42.508
on the grid, because it's really simple.
66

66

00:03:42.508  -->  00:03:44.773
Once you have this declaration here finished,
67

67

00:03:44.773  -->  00:03:47.524
then all we have to do is, to actually place
68

68

00:03:47.524  -->  00:03:48.883
the items, like this.
69

69

00:03:48.883  -->  00:03:52.517
So let's first delete all of this here,
70

70

00:03:52.517  -->  00:03:55.850
so that we go back to our initial state.
71

71

00:03:57.992  -->  00:03:59.159
Like this, OK?
72

72

00:04:01.243  -->  00:04:02.465
So this is how it looks like without
73

73

00:04:02.465  -->  00:04:05.148
any placement whatsoever.
74

74

00:04:05.148  -->  00:04:08.175
And so let's now position the header.
75

75

00:04:08.175  -->  00:04:10.610
So remember this grid area property
76

76

00:04:10.610  -->  00:04:12.693
that I showed you before.
77

77

00:04:13.630  -->  00:04:16.395
Back then we used it to put the column start,
78

78

00:04:16.395  -->  00:04:19.479
the column end, the row start, and do the row end.
79

79

00:04:19.479  -->  00:04:21.553
So these four numbers, remember that?
80

80

00:04:21.553  -->  00:04:25.063
Right in the first or second lecture of the section I think.
81

81

00:04:25.063  -->  00:04:28.587
But there actually another way of using this property here,
82

82

00:04:28.587  -->  00:04:30.557
and that is called for the template areas
83

83

00:04:30.557  -->  00:04:32.821
that be defined here.
84

84

00:04:32.821  -->  00:04:36.350
So remember that for the header, we called it head,
85

85

00:04:36.350  -->  00:04:38.866
and so all I have to do now is write head,
86

86

00:04:38.866  -->  00:04:42.116
without any quotes here, and that's it.
87

87

00:04:43.381  -->  00:04:46.723
So it places this item here on this entire area
88

88

00:04:46.723  -->  00:04:49.588
that I defined to be the head.
89

89

00:04:49.588  -->  00:04:53.244
So imagine I put something else here, like side for example.
90

90

00:04:53.244  -->  00:04:55.435
Then let's see what's happened.
91

91

00:04:55.435  -->  00:04:58.497
OK, so now it only occupies these three cells here,
92

92

00:04:58.497  -->  00:05:02.463
because the head is only in these three.
93

93

00:05:02.463  -->  00:05:04.796
OK, that makes sense, right?
94

94

00:05:05.846  -->  00:05:07.964
So let's put it back to head here.
95

95

00:05:07.964  -->  00:05:11.374
So now you will see it going back.
96

96

00:05:11.374  -->  00:05:13.846
Then these boxes here, they're actually automatically
97

97

00:05:13.846  -->  00:05:18.210
positioned, such as before, so let's go to the side bar.
98

98

00:05:18.210  -->  00:05:20.500
And it's very simple again, we don't have to think
99

99

00:05:20.500  -->  00:05:24.167
like we had to think with the other methods.
100

100

00:05:25.333  -->  00:05:30.241
All we have to do now is to say the name of the area,
101

101

00:05:30.241  -->  00:05:33.813
which is side, so we here are again with
102

102

00:05:33.813  -->  00:05:37.650
the side bar exactly where it should be.
103

103

00:05:37.650  -->  00:05:39.150
Right, so perfect.
104

104

00:05:41.708  -->  00:05:45.875
The same thing here, main, and the same thing here,
105

105

00:05:51.021  -->  00:05:52.268
actually just foot.
106

106

00:05:52.268  -->  00:05:53.435
And that's it.
107

107

00:05:54.479  -->  00:05:57.146
So our layout is complete again.
108

108

00:05:58.083  -->  00:05:59.412
So you see that this is like
109

109

00:05:59.412  -->  00:06:01.719
a completely different philosophy.
110

110

00:06:01.719  -->  00:06:05.324
In this case, we first think about layout,
111

111

00:06:05.324  -->  00:06:07.836
so where all of these items should be placed,
112

112

00:06:07.836  -->  00:06:09.628
and then all we have to do is to give
113

113

00:06:09.628  -->  00:06:12.362
the names here to each of the items.
114

114

00:06:12.362  -->  00:06:14.765
While with the two other methods that we did before,
115

115

00:06:14.765  -->  00:06:17.410
we used the names of the lines or the numbers,
116

116

00:06:17.410  -->  00:06:18.694
which is quite similar.
117

117

00:06:18.694  -->  00:06:20.565
Then, for each of these items here,
118

118

00:06:20.565  -->  00:06:24.395
we had to think where to position them.
119

119

00:06:24.395  -->  00:06:27.360
Now, when we create this template area definition here,
120

120

00:06:27.360  -->  00:06:29.878
we need to be careful and create a complete
121

121

00:06:29.878  -->  00:06:32.568
representation of our grid, OK?
122

122

00:06:32.568  -->  00:06:34.344
So if it's a bit different at all,
123

123

00:06:34.344  -->  00:06:36.841
then all of this is not going to work.
124

124

00:06:36.841  -->  00:06:39.607
The let me, for example, just delete this here,
125

125

00:06:39.607  -->  00:06:43.025
and you will see that it's not working at all anymore.
126

126

00:06:43.025  -->  00:06:46.474
So, this look just like really weird.
127

127

00:06:46.474  -->  00:06:49.325
So it's not working at all, and just because I didn't
128

128

00:06:49.325  -->  00:06:52.510
really fill up all the sixteen cells that we have, right?
129

129

00:06:52.510  -->  00:06:55.704
So we have four columns, four rows, when four times four
130

130

00:06:55.704  -->  00:06:59.871
makes sixteen, and so in here I have to have sixteen names.
131

131

00:07:01.171  -->  00:07:04.972
OK, and so let's go back to what we had.
132

132

00:07:04.972  -->  00:07:06.612
Now, another thing that we can do here with
133

133

00:07:06.612  -->  00:07:09.597
this template areas, is to actually leave empty cells.
134

134

00:07:09.597  -->  00:07:12.919
And all we have to do for that, is instead just delete it,
135

135

00:07:12.919  -->  00:07:14.762
is to put a dot.
136

136

00:07:14.762  -->  00:07:16.681
So let's see what happens then.
137

137

00:07:16.681  -->  00:07:19.846
Well, what happens is that this box here
138

138

00:07:19.846  -->  00:07:21.667
then moves up to this empty cell.
139

139

00:07:21.667  -->  00:07:23.970
And that's because we didn't really position
140

140

00:07:23.970  -->  00:07:25.970
these boxes here, right?
141

141

00:07:26.901  -->  00:07:28.353
And so that's what happens.
142

142

00:07:28.353  -->  00:07:30.551
So if you really wanted to leave this empty,
143

143

00:07:30.551  -->  00:07:34.838
we would have to then place theses three boxes here.
144

144

00:07:34.838  -->  00:07:37.000
So let's actually do that, that shouldn't be too hard.
145

145

00:07:37.000  -->  00:07:41.167
So it's small box one, two, and three, and we can probably
146

146

00:07:42.041  -->  00:07:44.958
do this all with the same selector.
147

147

00:07:47.513  -->  00:07:48.346
So two.
148

148

00:07:54.749  -->  00:07:56.799
And then the number three.
149

149

00:07:56.799  -->  00:07:59.382
And so grid area should be box.
150

150

00:08:02.762  -->  00:08:04.981
So let's take a look at that.
151

151

00:08:04.981  -->  00:08:07.785
And that's actually not quite what we want,
152

152

00:08:07.785  -->  00:08:12.076
because the template area definition is not really correct.
153

153

00:08:12.076  -->  00:08:14.954
So what we say here is that this area here should
154

154

00:08:14.954  -->  00:08:18.703
all be the same, which in fact it is not.
155

155

00:08:18.703  -->  00:08:23.014
So let's actually, to make this better, or to make
156

156

00:08:23.014  -->  00:08:26.931
it correct actually, give this different names.
157

157

00:08:28.182  -->  00:08:32.015
And so what we have to do now here, grid-area,
158

158

00:08:34.400  -->  00:08:35.733
should be box-1.
159

159

00:08:37.068  -->  00:08:39.151
So let's get rid of that.
160

160

00:08:45.315  -->  00:08:46.737
So a number two for this one.
161

161

00:08:46.737  -->  00:08:48.070
Oh, what's that?
162

162

00:08:51.099  -->  00:08:53.599
And number three for this one.
163

163

00:08:54.641  -->  00:08:58.698
Yep, so now it's correct, everything is correct, right?
164

164

00:08:58.698  -->  00:09:01.588
And we have this empty cell here like we defined.
165

165

00:09:01.588  -->  00:09:03.634
And we could put another one, for example, here if you
166

166

00:09:03.634  -->  00:09:07.801
wanted, and then the header would just span these two cells.
167

167

00:09:08.805  -->  00:09:10.624
And of course, that's entirely possible,
168

168

00:09:10.624  -->  00:09:15.472
we can have empty cells in our grids without any problem.
169

169

00:09:15.472  -->  00:09:17.312
So if that's the layout we are looking for,
170

170

00:09:17.312  -->  00:09:20.530
then CSS grid gives us the total flexibility
171

171

00:09:20.530  -->  00:09:23.042
to do exactly like that.
172

172

00:09:23.042  -->  00:09:25.132
Alright, and that's actually it.
173

173

00:09:25.132  -->  00:09:29.370
So this is all I had to tell you about naming grid areas,
174

174

00:09:29.370  -->  00:09:32.847
and how to position grid items on the grid.
175

175

00:09:32.847  -->  00:09:34.362
So these other three methods,
176

176

00:09:34.362  -->  00:09:36.549
and they can be used in different situations.
177

177

00:09:36.549  -->  00:09:38.946
For example this one here with the template areas,
178

178

00:09:38.946  -->  00:09:42.902
I think it's really great for smaller layouts like this one.
179

179

00:09:42.902  -->  00:09:44.433
So, when I have to build a small layout,
180

180

00:09:44.433  -->  00:09:46.727
then I would always use something like this.
181

181

00:09:46.727  -->  00:09:49.678
I think it's really, really straight forward.
182

182

00:09:49.678  -->  00:09:52.583
So keep that in mind, for a small simple layout
183

183

00:09:52.583  -->  00:09:56.017
I would say on something like four by four, or five by five,
184

184

00:09:56.017  -->  00:09:58.578
then it's completely fine to do it like this.
185

185

00:09:58.578  -->  00:10:01.939
But if we have a huge layout, like a complete page,
186

186

00:10:01.939  -->  00:10:06.799
maybe with 12 columns, or 15 columns, and 10 or 15 lines,
187

187

00:10:06.799  -->  00:10:08.718
then it becomes very unpractical
188

188

00:10:08.718  -->  00:10:11.232
to write out all of these areas.
189

189

00:10:11.232  -->  00:10:14.917
It's much simpler to simply name the grid lines and do
190

190

00:10:14.917  -->  00:10:17.941
it like this, like I showed you in the previous lecture.
191

191

00:10:17.941  -->  00:10:19.551
But for small layouts, again, I think
192

192

00:10:19.551  -->  00:10:22.277
this one here is perfect.
193

193

00:10:22.277  -->  00:10:26.444
OK, and that wraps up this project, so project number two,
194

194

00:10:27.293  -->  00:10:29.720
and I think that you already did a huge progress.
195

195

00:10:29.720  -->  00:10:31.815
So actually, you already know many
196

196

00:10:31.815  -->  00:10:34.346
of the important stuff about CSS grids.
197

197

00:10:34.346  -->  00:10:37.468
You're already ready to build some simple layouts
198

198

00:10:37.468  -->  00:10:40.759
using grids, and that's fantastic, right?
199

199

00:10:40.759  -->  00:10:43.192
Now there's some more advanced stuff to learn of course,
200

200

00:10:43.192  -->  00:10:44.660
and we're going to do that throughout
201

201

00:10:44.660  -->  00:10:46.215
the rest of the section.
202

202

00:10:46.215  -->  00:10:48.188
But for now it's great that you've come this far, that you
203

203

00:10:48.188  -->  00:10:50.282
made all this progress, and maybe you can even try
204

204

00:10:50.282  -->  00:10:51.952
to build something right now.
205

205

00:10:51.952  -->  00:10:55.531
Maybe just a small example, to see if you got all of this
206

206

00:10:55.531  -->  00:10:58.531
and if you really understood it, OK?
