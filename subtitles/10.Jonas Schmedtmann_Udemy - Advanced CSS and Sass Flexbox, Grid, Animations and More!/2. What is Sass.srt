<v Instructor>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,785  -->  00:00:05,308
Now before jumping right into Sass Code,
3

3

00:00:05,308  -->  00:00:08,739
let's first take a look at what Sass actually is.
4

4

00:00:08,739  -->  00:00:10,563
So this lecture is designed to give you
5

5

00:00:10,563  -->  00:00:12,999
a very quick overview of what Sass is,
6

6

00:00:12,999  -->  00:00:16,822
how it works, and what features it includes.
7

7

00:00:16,822  -->  00:00:19,066
So, putting it in very simple terms,
8

8

00:00:19,066  -->  00:00:22,973
Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS
9

9

00:00:22,973  -->  00:00:25,656
that adds a lot of power and elegance
10

10

00:00:25,656  -->  00:00:27,570
to the basic language.
11

11

00:00:27,570  -->  00:00:30,541
So basically, we use Sass to fix the problems
12

12

00:00:30,541  -->  00:00:32,698
that we have with CSS.
13

13

00:00:32,698  -->  00:00:35,707
CSS gets very messy, very quickly.
14

14

00:00:35,707  -->  00:00:38,877
For each project, having a single CSS file
15

15

00:00:38,877  -->  00:00:41,033
with thousands of lines of code
16

16

00:00:41,033  -->  00:00:43,963
without any reusable pieces, without any logic,
17

17

00:00:43,963  -->  00:00:47,665
gets completely unmanageable after some time.
18

18

00:00:47,665  -->  00:00:50,191
And that's why we use Sass which provide us
19

19

00:00:50,191  -->  00:00:52,916
with a couple of handy features and tools
20

20

00:00:52,916  -->  00:00:56,331
that CSS simply doesn't have, while at the same time,
21

21

00:00:56,331  -->  00:01:00,112
not changing the fundamental way that CSS works.
22

22

00:01:00,112  -->  00:01:03,324
This in particular, makes Sass very easy to learn,
23

23

00:01:03,324  -->  00:01:04,772
and so I'm sure that you'll be
24

24

00:01:04,772  -->  00:01:07,947
up to speed with Sass in no time.
25

25

00:01:07,947  -->  00:01:10,631
The way Sass works is like this.
26

26

00:01:10,631  -->  00:01:14,989
Instead of writing a CSS file with regular CSS code,
27

27

00:01:14,989  -->  00:01:18,426
we write Sass code in Sass files.
28

28

00:01:18,426  -->  00:01:20,010
Then, we run a compiler,
29

29

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:22,488
and that compiler converts the Sass code we wrote
30

30

00:01:22,488  -->  00:01:26,186
into regular CSS code as if all we ever did was write
31

31

00:01:26,186  -->  00:01:28,940
in regular CSS in the first place.
32

32

00:01:28,940  -->  00:01:31,593
So, we need to process our Sass code first,
33

33

00:01:31,593  -->  00:01:35,215
and that's why it's called a CSS preprocessor.
34

34

00:01:35,215  -->  00:01:38,387
Our website has no idea that the code we wrote
35

35

00:01:38,387  -->  00:01:40,379
in the beginning was in Sass
36

36

00:01:40,379  -->  00:01:42,576
because it only ever sees the final output
37

37

00:01:42,576  -->  00:01:45,350
of the compiler in the form of CSS of course.
38

38

00:01:45,350  -->  00:01:46,363
Okay?
39

39

00:01:46,363  -->  00:01:48,071
Does it make sense?
40

40

00:01:48,071  -->  00:01:50,958
Now there are actually other CSS preprocessors
41

41

00:01:50,958  -->  00:01:54,549
like Less or Stylus, but Sass is the most popular one
42

42

00:01:54,549  -->  00:01:57,879
which is why I chose it for this course.
43

43

00:01:57,879  -->  00:02:01,294
So what are these features that Sass actually gives us?
44

44

00:02:01,294  -->  00:02:02,717
Let's get a quick overview
45

45

00:02:02,717  -->  00:02:04,747
before we actually start writing Sass,
46

46

00:02:04,747  -->  00:02:07,026
so we that we know what we're looking at here.
47

47

00:02:07,026  -->  00:02:09,298
First, Sass gives us variables which,
48

48

00:02:09,298  -->  00:02:11,615
just like in normal programming languages,
49

49

00:02:11,615  -->  00:02:14,746
allow us to have reusable values such as colors,
50

50

00:02:14,746  -->  00:02:16,829
font sizes, spacing, etc.
51

51

00:02:18,376  -->  00:02:21,712
Next, we have nesting, in order to nest selectors
52

52

00:02:21,712  -->  00:02:26,103
inside of one another, allowing us to write less code.
53

53

00:02:26,103  -->  00:02:28,177
Next up, there are operators
54

54

00:02:28,177  -->  00:02:31,840
for mathematical operations right inside of CSS.
55

55

00:02:31,840  -->  00:02:34,361
Then, partials and imports which are one
56

56

00:02:34,361  -->  00:02:37,615
of the most important and most useful features of Sass,
57

57

00:02:37,615  -->  00:02:40,501
allowing us to write CSS in different files,
58

58

00:02:40,501  -->  00:02:44,036
and then importing them all into one single file.
59

59

00:02:44,036  -->  00:02:45,989
Next, there are mixins,
60

60

00:02:45,989  -->  00:02:48,838
to write reusable pieces of CSS code.
61

61

00:02:48,838  -->  00:02:51,449
And also functions, which are quite similar to mixins
62

62

00:02:51,449  -->  00:02:53,768
with the difference that they produce a value
63

63

00:02:53,768  -->  00:02:55,676
that can be used later.
64

64

00:02:55,676  -->  00:02:58,686
Next up, we have extends, which can be used
65

65

00:02:58,686  -->  00:03:01,573
to make different selectors inherit declarations
66

66

00:03:01,573  -->  00:03:03,933
that are common to all of them.
67

67

00:03:03,933  -->  00:03:07,066
And finally, control directives allow developers
68

68

00:03:07,066  -->  00:03:10,357
to write complex code using conditionals and loops
69

69

00:03:10,357  -->  00:03:12,879
like in real programming language.
70

70

00:03:12,879  -->  00:03:16,140
However, we do not cover this topic in this course
71

71

00:03:16,140  -->  00:03:19,408
because it's nearly not needed in a real world project.
72

72

00:03:19,408  -->  00:03:22,946
It's more for writing CSS frameworks or something.
73

73

00:03:22,946  -->  00:03:25,966
So, this was just a very high level overview of Sass.
74

74

00:03:25,966  -->  00:03:27,391
In the next two lectures,
75

75

00:03:27,391  -->  00:03:29,505
we're actually gonna start using this,
76

76

00:03:29,505  -->  00:03:32,962
and everything will make a ton of sense to you.
77

77

00:03:32,962  -->  00:03:36,100
Now, one other thing before we start writing Sass.
78

78

00:03:36,100  -->  00:03:38,502
Maybe you have been googling Sass before
79

79

00:03:38,502  -->  00:03:41,796
and looked at some Sass code, and seen different ways
80

80

00:03:41,796  -->  00:03:44,194
that the code looks, and that's right.
81

81

00:03:44,194  -->  00:03:46,756
There are actually two Sass syntaxes
82

82

00:03:46,756  -->  00:03:48,510
which can be quite confusing,
83

83

00:03:48,510  -->  00:03:50,991
so we'll have to clear that up.
84

84

00:03:50,991  -->  00:03:53,835
One syntax, which is actually the original one,
85

85

00:03:53,835  -->  00:03:56,378
is just called Sass like the language.
86

86

00:03:56,378  -->  00:04:00,545
The other one is called SCSS which stands for Sassy CSS.
87

87

00:04:01,591  -->  00:04:04,605
The Sass syntax is indentation sensitive
88

88

00:04:04,605  -->  00:04:08,266
and doesn't use any curly braces and semicolons
89

89

00:04:08,266  -->  00:04:10,791
as you see here on the left side.
90

90

00:04:10,791  -->  00:04:13,521
However, I find this syntax a bit confusing,
91

91

00:04:13,521  -->  00:04:16,045
and I find it also more difficult to learn,
92

92

00:04:16,045  -->  00:04:19,054
and also more difficult to convert original CSS projects
93

93

00:04:19,054  -->  00:04:21,171
to Sass with the syntax.
94

94

00:04:21,171  -->  00:04:23,862
That's why I prefer the SCSS syntax
95

95

00:04:23,862  -->  00:04:28,127
which preserves the way that original CSS looks like.
96

96

00:04:28,127  -->  00:04:30,648
That's why SCSS is what we're gonna use
97

97

00:04:30,648  -->  00:04:33,416
in the rest of this course.
98

98

00:04:33,416  -->  00:04:36,223
Now, if for some reason you prefer the Sass syntax,
99

99

00:04:36,223  -->  00:04:38,989
please feel absolutely free to use that one
100

100

00:04:38,989  -->  00:04:41,670
because everything should still work the exact same way,
101

101

00:04:41,670  -->  00:04:43,574
will just look different.
102

102

00:04:43,574  -->  00:04:47,440
All right, and that's it for the basic Sass intro.
103

103

00:04:47,440  -->  00:04:49,127
In the next lecture, we're finally gonna dive
104

104

00:04:49,127  -->  00:04:51,159
right into it, so don't wait,
105

105

00:04:51,159  -->  00:04:53,826
and hit play on that next video.
