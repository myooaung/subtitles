00:00:00,333  -->  00:00:04,030
<v Narrator>Hello, great to have you back in the course.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,030  -->  00:00:06,950
Let's start working on our next section now
3

3

00:00:06,950  -->  00:00:09,459
where basically customers can tell about
4

4

00:00:09,459  -->  00:00:11,956
their experience with Natours.
5

5

00:00:11,956  -->  00:00:14,627
You're gonna learn here how to make text flow
6

6

00:00:14,627  -->  00:00:18,187
around shapes using the shape outside and float properties
7

7

00:00:18,187  -->  00:00:21,861
together, and how to apply a filter to images.
8

8

00:00:21,861  -->  00:00:24,316
Then, you're gonna create a background video
9

9

00:00:24,316  -->  00:00:26,867
filling the entire section, and for that
10

10

00:00:26,867  -->  00:00:29,951
you're gonna learn how to use the HTML video element
11

11

00:00:29,951  -->  00:00:33,909
and how and when to use the object fit property.
12

12

00:00:33,909  -->  00:00:37,235
So you see that once more, this section is full-packed
13

13

00:00:37,235  -->  00:00:39,902
with new stuff for you to learn.
14

14

00:00:41,065  -->  00:00:43,518
This is what the section looks like.
15

15

00:00:43,518  -->  00:00:46,643
Here we have a testimonial of this person
16

16

00:00:46,643  -->  00:00:49,484
of Mary Smith, then down here, another one.
17

17

00:00:49,484  -->  00:00:51,796
Now, what's special about this is that we have
18

18

00:00:51,796  -->  00:00:53,543
this round image here, so this shape
19

19

00:00:53,543  -->  00:00:56,850
and then this text flows around that shape.
20

20

00:00:56,850  -->  00:00:59,382
That's what we're gonna do in this lecture.
21

21

00:00:59,382  -->  00:01:00,965
You also see that we have this style here
22

22

00:01:00,965  -->  00:01:03,673
with this non-rectangular design again, so this line
23

23

00:01:03,673  -->  00:01:06,131
that you see here, and on this side as well
24

24

00:01:06,131  -->  00:01:08,414
that's a design pattern that's repeating
25

25

00:01:08,414  -->  00:01:10,197
across this webpage.
26

26

00:01:10,197  -->  00:01:12,522
And then of course you also see that we have
27

27

00:01:12,522  -->  00:01:14,765
this background video here going on
28

28

00:01:14,765  -->  00:01:17,715
you're also gonna learn how to do that.
29

29

00:01:17,715  -->  00:01:19,555
Then in the end, there's just a small button here
30

30

00:01:19,555  -->  00:01:21,862
which could then lead to another page
31

31

00:01:21,862  -->  00:01:24,521
where the user could read more stories, okay?
32

32

00:01:24,521  -->  00:01:26,563
So let's start once again with the title
33

33

00:01:26,563  -->  00:01:28,938
so with the H-one element here
34

34

00:01:28,938  -->  00:01:30,679
then we style this entire section
35

35

00:01:30,679  -->  00:01:32,093
but not the background video, okay?
36

36

00:01:32,093  -->  00:01:34,363
We're gonna leave that one to the very end.
37

37

00:01:34,363  -->  00:01:37,828
Then we can also start styling this component here.
38

38

00:01:37,828  -->  00:01:40,316
This is gonna be a story component.
39

39

00:01:40,316  -->  00:01:42,563
So let's do that.
40

40

00:01:42,563  -->  00:01:44,396
Closing the card here.
41

41

00:01:46,129  -->  00:01:48,357
Let's create a new section.
42

42

00:01:48,357  -->  00:01:49,190
Section
43

43

00:01:50,269  -->  00:01:51,519
Section stories
44

44

00:01:53,741  -->  00:01:58,128
Then again, we will get our H-two element here
45

45

00:01:58,128  -->  00:02:00,753
so our secondary heading
46

46

00:02:00,753  -->  00:02:02,920
let's grab that from here.
47

47

00:02:05,223  -->  00:02:06,640
This time it says
48

48

00:02:08,057  -->  00:02:10,140
"we make people genuinely
49

49

00:02:13,381  -->  00:02:14,475
happy."
50

50

00:02:14,475  -->  00:02:19,331
All right, and now down here, let's start a new row.
51

51

00:02:19,331  -->  00:02:22,664
Actually this is all not well formatted.
52

52

00:02:25,899  -->  00:02:28,742
Okay, let's start a new row now.
53

53

00:02:28,742  -->  00:02:32,101
Now this time, we're not going to put any columns in the row
54

54

00:02:32,101  -->  00:02:34,776
We're just using this nicely centered container
55

55

00:02:34,776  -->  00:02:36,776
that the row gives us, so that we can put
56

56

00:02:36,776  -->  00:02:39,835
our story component in there, okay?
57

57

00:02:39,835  -->  00:02:42,434
And we also make use of the margin bottom
58

58

00:02:42,434  -->  00:02:44,392
that this row here already has.
59

59

00:02:44,392  -->  00:02:46,314
So we cannot just put columns here in the row
60

60

00:02:46,314  -->  00:02:48,632
we can also use it for other stuff.
61

61

00:02:48,632  -->  00:02:52,190
So let's put a story component here
62

62

00:02:52,190  -->  00:02:53,490
story element
63

63

00:02:53,490  -->  00:02:56,724
and for now there's nothing really in there
64

64

00:02:56,724  -->  00:02:59,269
let's just leave it like this, okay?
65

65

00:02:59,269  -->  00:03:01,782
So once again, let's start by formatting
66

66

00:03:01,782  -->  00:03:05,199
the section stories here in the home file
67

67

00:03:11,005  -->  00:03:13,172
give it some padding first
68

68

00:03:15,254  -->  00:03:18,171
of 15 rem top and bottom, let's say
69

69

00:03:19,785  -->  00:03:22,727
and zero left and right, of course.
70

70

00:03:22,727  -->  00:03:26,366
Then, for now, we'll also give it a background color
71

71

00:03:26,366  -->  00:03:29,234
and why not the same grey as before.
72

72

00:03:29,234  -->  00:03:31,477
So this is only temporary, because then later on
73

73

00:03:31,477  -->  00:03:34,300
we're gonna put that background video, okay?
74

74

00:03:34,300  -->  00:03:38,055
But for now, let's put this color there.
75

75

00:03:38,055  -->  00:03:42,222
Right, and so now we can add our new component in here
76

76

00:03:43,899  -->  00:03:45,816
so it's a story in CSS.
77

77

00:03:49,542  -->  00:03:53,625
And that's not what I wanted, I wanted main, okay
78

78

00:03:55,029  -->  00:03:57,029
and this one is "story."
79

79

00:03:59,254  -->  00:04:03,087
And close it, so what do we have in our story?
80

80

00:04:05,332  -->  00:04:07,840
First, the width is not 100%
81

81

00:04:07,840  -->  00:04:10,203
because that would be way too wide
82

82

00:04:10,203  -->  00:04:14,877
so let's put it to 75% then we want to nicely center it
83

83

00:04:14,877  -->  00:04:17,203
and again it's a block element inside a block element
84

84

00:04:17,203  -->  00:04:21,036
and so we can use margin zero and auto, right?
85

85

00:04:23,160  -->  00:04:26,160
Then let's also give it a box shadow
86

86

00:04:27,276  -->  00:04:28,883
zero
87

87

00:04:28,883  -->  00:04:32,716
then three in the Y direction, and a nice blur
88

88

00:04:34,316  -->  00:04:37,816
okay, then RGBA for the color, it's always
89

89

00:04:41,921  -->  00:04:44,921
and just point one should be enough.
90

90

00:04:46,365  -->  00:04:48,431
Also background color so that's visible
91

91

00:04:48,431  -->  00:04:50,656
against our background
92

92

00:04:50,656  -->  00:04:51,906
so color white.
93

93

00:04:55,805  -->  00:04:58,904
And now finally, a nice border radius.
94

94

00:04:58,904  -->  00:05:01,608
We've been using three pixels
95

95

00:05:01,608  -->  00:05:05,775
so let's do that here again to give it a consistent look.
96

96

00:05:09,096  -->  00:05:11,587
All right, and so here it is.
97

97

00:05:11,587  -->  00:05:15,811
Now we just need to fill it up with something, okay?
98

98

00:05:15,811  -->  00:05:19,061
You can also first give it some padding
99

99

00:05:20,551  -->  00:05:21,968
six rem let's say
100

100

00:05:23,107  -->  00:05:26,956
and all right, that should be enough for now.
101

101

00:05:26,956  -->  00:05:28,806
Let's take a look at what we have here.
102

102

00:05:28,806  -->  00:05:31,716
This is once again an H-three element
103

103

00:05:31,716  -->  00:05:34,037
and this is just a simple paragraph.
104

104

00:05:34,037  -->  00:05:35,907
Then here we have of course this image.
105

105

00:05:35,907  -->  00:05:38,771
But in order to create this effect where the text flows
106

106

00:05:38,771  -->  00:05:41,548
around the shape here, let's actually first start with
107

107

00:05:41,548  -->  00:05:45,661
just a round shape, and then take care of the image later.
108

108

00:05:45,661  -->  00:05:48,454
So, let's put a shape here in this side
109

109

00:05:48,454  -->  00:05:50,462
and then, on this side here a box
110

110

00:05:50,462  -->  00:05:52,664
where we can input the H-three
111

111

00:05:52,664  -->  00:05:56,664
and the paragraph, so then these two things side-by-side.
112

112

00:05:56,664  -->  00:05:57,497
All right?
113

113

00:05:59,939  -->  00:06:04,630
We start with the shape, that will make this one a figure
114

114

00:06:04,630  -->  00:06:06,130
called story shape
115

115

00:06:09,211  -->  00:06:10,636
and I'm making this a figure because
116

116

00:06:10,636  -->  00:06:13,115
it's semantically the best thing to do
117

117

00:06:13,115  -->  00:06:16,461
because we will have an image together with a caption
118

118

00:06:16,461  -->  00:06:19,893
and so we have the image and then a caption this Mary Smith
119

119

00:06:19,893  -->  00:06:23,685
name here is the caption, and so in HTML five we have
120

120

00:06:23,685  -->  00:06:26,016
this figure element where we can put an image and then
121

121

00:06:26,016  -->  00:06:29,112
some caption, with a figcaption element.
122

122

00:06:29,112  -->  00:06:30,463
But again, let's do that later.
123

123

00:06:30,463  -->  00:06:33,518
For now, let's leave it empty and continue
124

124

00:06:33,518  -->  00:06:35,969
with the part which contains the text.
125

125

00:06:35,969  -->  00:06:37,052
So just a div
126

126

00:06:38,069  -->  00:06:38,902
story
127

127

00:06:39,744  -->  00:06:41,512
text, and then in here
128

128

00:06:41,512  -->  00:06:44,852
as I was saying, we have the heading tertiary again
129

129

00:06:44,852  -->  00:06:45,685
so H-three
130

130

00:06:47,702  -->  00:06:48,535
heading
131

131

00:06:50,085  -->  00:06:50,918
tertiary.
132

132

00:06:54,833  -->  00:06:57,166
"I had the best week ever with my family"
133

133

00:06:57,166  -->  00:06:58,916
is what it says here.
134

134

00:07:03,616  -->  00:07:07,507
All right, and then down there just some paragraph.
135

135

00:07:07,507  -->  00:07:10,090
So let me just copy the ...
136

136

00:07:10,090  -->  00:07:12,070
random text that we have here.
137

137

00:07:12,070  -->  00:07:13,645
Well actually ...
138

138

00:07:13,645  -->  00:07:17,229
no let's get the text, it's better.
139

139

00:07:17,229  -->  00:07:19,479
I think it's this one here.
140

140

00:07:22,514  -->  00:07:24,514
And paste it here, okay.
141

141

00:07:27,887  -->  00:07:30,437
In here, in the heading, in the H-three element
142

142

00:07:30,437  -->  00:07:33,727
we also have to add that margin to the bottom, right?
143

143

00:07:33,727  -->  00:07:35,321
Remember that?
144

144

00:07:35,321  -->  00:07:38,615
And I don't remember quite which class it was.
145

145

00:07:38,615  -->  00:07:41,033
Let me take a look here at the utilities.
146

146

00:07:41,033  -->  00:07:44,487
I think we used to use this one here
147

147

00:07:44,487  -->  00:07:46,404
so margin bottom small.
148

148

00:07:49,903  -->  00:07:51,070
Give it a save
149

149

00:07:52,295  -->  00:07:53,628
and take a look.
150

150

00:07:55,314  -->  00:07:58,200
All right, let's actually now set the font size
151

151

00:07:58,200  -->  00:08:00,950
here for this entire thing to ...
152

152

00:08:02,356  -->  00:08:06,439
Here we have this, push this one here to the side
153

153

00:08:07,983  -->  00:08:09,816
so we can do font size
154

154

00:08:11,624  -->  00:08:13,457
and then there's a variable for that
155

155

00:08:13,457  -->  00:08:17,624
let me check out the name ... it's default font size
156

156

00:08:20,704  -->  00:08:23,464
and so the paragraph will then inherit that.
157

157

00:08:23,464  -->  00:08:26,964
Okay, so let's now take care of the shape.
158

158

00:08:30,180  -->  00:08:32,437
This is just a div element for now.
159

159

00:08:32,437  -->  00:08:35,345
Let's give it some height and some width
160

160

00:08:35,345  -->  00:08:37,678
so 15 rem and height as well
161

161

00:08:41,678  -->  00:08:43,931
so it's basically a square for now
162

162

00:08:43,931  -->  00:08:47,674
and then we want this element sitting on the left side.
163

163

00:08:47,674  -->  00:08:50,402
So float, left, in order to make
164

164

00:08:50,402  -->  00:08:52,870
the rest of the content float around it.
165

165

00:08:52,870  -->  00:08:54,695
That's how it works, right?
166

166

00:08:54,695  -->  00:08:55,695
And now just so that we can see it
167

167

00:08:55,695  -->  00:08:59,028
let's give it a background color as well
168

168

00:09:00,469  -->  00:09:03,302
and orange-red again here my favorite
169

169

00:09:03,302  -->  00:09:05,802
and let's take a look at that.
170

170

00:09:06,640  -->  00:09:09,442
Okay, and with that in place, let's actually add a bit
171

171

00:09:09,442  -->  00:09:12,994
more text here, and then make this content float around
172

172

00:09:12,994  -->  00:09:15,385
as if it was floating around a circle
173

173

00:09:15,385  -->  00:09:17,572
so a shape like a circle.
174

174

00:09:17,572  -->  00:09:19,340
Okay we can do that, this doesn't even have to look
175

175

00:09:19,340  -->  00:09:21,691
like a circle in order to do that.
176

176

00:09:21,691  -->  00:09:24,836
All we have to do is to use the shape outside property
177

177

00:09:24,836  -->  00:09:28,336
and so let me show you how we can do that.
178

178

00:09:29,715  -->  00:09:33,548
In here, we can use the shape outside property
179

179

00:09:35,547  -->  00:09:36,628
just like this.
180

180

00:09:36,628  -->  00:09:40,191
So we have to define a vectorized shape here once more.
181

181

00:09:40,191  -->  00:09:43,100
We did that already when we used the clip-path property.
182

182

00:09:43,100  -->  00:09:46,749
We defined a polygon back then, remember?
183

183

00:09:46,749  -->  00:09:48,911
Well, when we did that back then, I told you that we could
184

184

00:09:48,911  -->  00:09:51,932
use other things here, like circles or ellipses
185

185

00:09:51,932  -->  00:09:55,265
and so now this time let's use a circle.
186

186

00:09:57,587  -->  00:10:01,026
So, a circle, and in here we can define the size
187

187

00:10:01,026  -->  00:10:04,987
of the circle and the position of the center of the circle.
188

188

00:10:04,987  -->  00:10:06,307
How does that work?
189

189

00:10:06,307  -->  00:10:09,529
Well the first number we put here is actually the radius
190

190

00:10:09,529  -->  00:10:13,540
of the circle, and so if we say 50%, then the radius
191

191

00:10:13,540  -->  00:10:17,301
will be half the height and the width of the element
192

192

00:10:17,301  -->  00:10:20,146
and so in this case that will be seven point five rem
193

193

00:10:20,146  -->  00:10:23,041
and so if the radius is seven point five rem
194

194

00:10:23,041  -->  00:10:26,376
then the diameter of the circle will, of course, be 15
195

195

00:10:26,376  -->  00:10:30,818
and that's exactly the size of the shape here, right?
196

196

00:10:30,818  -->  00:10:32,176
And then we say
197

197

00:10:32,176  -->  00:10:33,009
50%
198

198

00:10:34,082  -->  00:10:34,915
50%
199

199

00:10:34,915  -->  00:10:37,831
because that means that is the center of the circle
200

200

00:10:37,831  -->  00:10:41,339
so exactly the center horizontally and vertically
201

201

00:10:41,339  -->  00:10:42,515
all right?
202

202

00:10:42,515  -->  00:10:44,597
Now I can change this later here in this vector
203

203

00:10:44,597  -->  00:10:47,980
to show you the difference, but that is what we want here
204

204

00:10:47,980  -->  00:10:50,815
and in order for this to work, the element must actually
205

205

00:10:50,815  -->  00:10:53,918
be floated, and that's the case here, right?
206

206

00:10:53,918  -->  00:10:56,372
And so we have already done that, and another thing
207

207

00:10:56,372  -->  00:10:59,335
that I should tell you about this is that in Safari
208

208

00:10:59,335  -->  00:11:03,659
it currently only works with the webkit prefix
209

209

00:11:03,659  -->  00:11:04,992
so let's do that
210

210

00:11:05,900  -->  00:11:06,944
okay?
211

211

00:11:06,944  -->  00:11:09,767
Like this, it works in Chrome and Safari currently
212

212

00:11:09,767  -->  00:11:12,283
so it doesn't even work in Firefox
213

213

00:11:12,283  -->  00:11:15,292
neither in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge
214

214

00:11:15,292  -->  00:11:17,017
but of course that's for now as of recording
215

215

00:11:17,017  -->  00:11:19,425
of this course by the end of 2017
216

216

00:11:19,425  -->  00:11:21,140
so if you're watching this in the future
217

217

00:11:21,140  -->  00:11:23,648
this might have changed, okay?
218

218

00:11:23,648  -->  00:11:26,225
So that is that, the browser support ...
219

219

00:11:26,225  -->  00:11:29,530
And another thing that I have to tell you is that beside
220

220

00:11:29,530  -->  00:11:32,527
having to be floated here, this also only works
221

221

00:11:32,527  -->  00:11:37,073
if the element has defined dimensions, so width and height.
222

222

00:11:37,073  -->  00:11:39,516
So this is quite a demanding property.
223

223

00:11:39,516  -->  00:11:42,806
It has to be floated it has to has a height
224

224

00:11:42,806  -->  00:11:44,798
and a width, only then it works.
225

225

00:11:44,798  -->  00:11:48,965
Okay, as I was saying let's just add some more text here
226

226

00:11:51,075  -->  00:11:53,158
like repeating that part.
227

227

00:11:55,783  -->  00:11:57,373
Okay, let's take a look.
228

228

00:11:57,373  -->  00:12:00,195
And so you see, it's different already here, right?
229

229

00:12:00,195  -->  00:12:03,794
So you see, it's like wrapping around a circle.
230

230

00:12:03,794  -->  00:12:05,367
And instead of just imagining a circle
231

231

00:12:05,367  -->  00:12:08,284
let's actually put one there, okay?
232

232

00:12:09,599  -->  00:12:13,678
We can do that by using the clip-path property.
233

233

00:12:13,678  -->  00:12:17,145
So clip-path, and then we just use the exact same circle.
234

234

00:12:17,145  -->  00:12:17,978
All right?
235

235

00:12:21,279  -->  00:12:23,517
Okay, and actually the same thing
236

236

00:12:23,517  -->  00:12:25,850
also with the webkit prefix.
237

237

00:12:27,466  -->  00:12:28,299
Okay.
238

238

00:12:31,768  -->  00:12:35,275
Again, this shape outside, all it does is to define
239

239

00:12:35,275  -->  00:12:38,069
where the content floats around the element
240

240

00:12:38,069  -->  00:12:40,700
in this case, a circle, and if we actually want the element
241

241

00:12:40,700  -->  00:12:43,032
to look like that circle, we can then use
242

242

00:12:43,032  -->  00:12:45,483
the clip-path property, okay?
243

243

00:12:45,483  -->  00:12:49,880
And so that should be better now, should look more logical.
244

244

00:12:49,880  -->  00:12:51,538
And so yeah, actually it's really
245

245

00:12:51,538  -->  00:12:54,455
flowing around that element, right?
246

246

00:12:56,671  -->  00:12:58,940
Let's just take a look here, and as I was telling you
247

247

00:12:58,940  -->  00:13:02,773
let me actually change these values here a bit
248

248

00:13:05,592  -->  00:13:08,887
so you see if the circle would be bigger than this
249

249

00:13:08,887  -->  00:13:11,713
but already start stop working.
250

250

00:13:11,713  -->  00:13:15,546
So 50% is really the best that we can do.
251

251

00:13:16,603  -->  00:13:20,336
The same thing of course works here.
252

252

00:13:20,336  -->  00:13:23,972
But here, we can just decrease the radius
253

253

00:13:23,972  -->  00:13:26,889
then of course the shape decreases.
254

254

00:13:29,185  -->  00:13:33,159
All right, let's now add some space here between this
255

255

00:13:33,159  -->  00:13:36,050
and the best way to move around an element that is floated
256

256

00:13:36,050  -->  00:13:39,096
is to actually not mess with margins or anything like that
257

257

00:13:39,096  -->  00:13:41,711
we should just use a transform, okay?
258

258

00:13:41,711  -->  00:13:46,475
So let's do that, transform, and then translate it.
259

259

00:13:46,475  -->  00:13:49,268
And of course in this case, in the X direction
260

260

00:13:49,268  -->  00:13:51,851
and let's do it minus three rem
261

261

00:13:52,821  -->  00:13:56,092
and let's take a look at that.
262

262

00:13:56,092  -->  00:13:58,445
That didn't do the trick, actually.
263

263

00:13:58,445  -->  00:14:01,778
Probably because it should be like this.
264

264

00:14:02,930  -->  00:14:06,012
All right, here we go, that looks much better.
265

265

00:14:06,012  -->  00:14:09,403
Now the thing is that we had this padding here going on
266

266

00:14:09,403  -->  00:14:13,111
so these 6 rem, which is the blue color here
267

267

00:14:13,111  -->  00:14:16,806
in this diagram, but with this transform now, we occupy
268

268

00:14:16,806  -->  00:14:18,953
the half of the padding there on the left side
269

269

00:14:18,953  -->  00:14:20,512
so let's add some more padding there
270

270

00:14:20,512  -->  00:14:22,947
so these three rem that we had here
271

271

00:14:22,947  -->  00:14:26,697
let's add that padding here on the left side.
272

272

00:14:27,752  -->  00:14:30,885
After that, we say padding, left
273

273

00:14:30,885  -->  00:14:32,393
nine rem
274

274

00:14:32,393  -->  00:14:34,226
so six plus the three.
275

275

00:14:35,259  -->  00:14:37,225
Okay, and with that taken care of
276

276

00:14:37,225  -->  00:14:40,392
let's actually now include that image.
277

277

00:14:41,707  -->  00:14:44,540
In here, inside the figure element
278

278

00:14:45,460  -->  00:14:47,513
let's put the image.
279

279

00:14:47,513  -->  00:14:51,706
So the image now will be going into the img folder
280

280

00:14:51,706  -->  00:14:55,373
and then nat eight, so this is what we want.
281

281

00:14:57,605  -->  00:15:01,355
And here, let's just say, "person on a tour."
282

282

00:15:02,228  -->  00:15:06,394
'cause that's what this image will look like.
283

283

00:15:06,394  -->  00:15:09,811
Now we can get rid of that background color
284

284

00:15:09,811  -->  00:15:12,680
and take a look at what we see here.
285

285

00:15:12,680  -->  00:15:15,792
Well, that looks rather strange, doesn't it?
286

286

00:15:15,792  -->  00:15:17,463
So let's see where that image actually is.
287

287

00:15:17,463  -->  00:15:20,324
This image is taking all of this entire space.
288

288

00:15:20,324  -->  00:15:22,574
It's 2000 times 1333 pixels
289

289

00:15:24,453  -->  00:15:26,630
and that's because we didn't give it a width.
290

290

00:15:26,630  -->  00:15:29,578
So remember once again, flexible images
291

291

00:15:29,578  -->  00:15:33,155
for responsive web design, they always need a width.
292

292

00:15:33,155  -->  00:15:35,822
Always, without exception, okay?
293

293

00:15:37,144  -->  00:15:40,537
I think we actually didn't give it a class name, did we?
294

294

00:15:40,537  -->  00:15:42,620
Figure ... No we did not.
295

295

00:15:45,178  -->  00:15:46,678
It's a story image
296

296

00:15:49,731  -->  00:15:50,898
just like this
297

297

00:15:52,189  -->  00:15:53,022
so
298

298

00:15:53,989  -->  00:15:55,344
the story image.
299

299

00:15:55,344  -->  00:15:58,677
Let's just give it a width of 100%.
300

300

00:15:59,937  -->  00:16:01,142
And why is that?
301

301

00:16:01,142  -->  00:16:04,114
Well, it's because this image is inside of a shape
302

302

00:16:04,114  -->  00:16:07,145
which has this width here well defined
303

303

00:16:07,145  -->  00:16:10,097
and so if we say width 100%, that will be
304

304

00:16:10,097  -->  00:16:13,064
the hundred percent of the parent, so 15 rem.
305

305

00:16:13,064  -->  00:16:16,897
So now it should look good, but actually it does not
306

306

00:16:16,897  -->  00:16:19,889
and that's of course, it's obvious, because the image
307

307

00:16:19,889  -->  00:16:24,056
is wider than it's high, so if we gave it a 100% width
308

308

00:16:25,064  -->  00:16:27,976
then, of course, it cannot fill this entire circle
309

309

00:16:27,976  -->  00:16:29,184
that we we put here, so it shouldn't
310

310

00:16:29,184  -->  00:16:31,684
be width 100%, but height
311

311

00:16:33,634  -->  00:16:36,372
and now then it should look okay.
312

312

00:16:36,372  -->  00:16:38,488
That looks much better now.
313

313

00:16:38,488  -->  00:16:40,885
Now one last thing that we didn't do yet
314

314

00:16:40,885  -->  00:16:45,052
is this non-rectangular design that I have here, okay?
315

315

00:16:45,889  -->  00:16:48,499
So let's take care of that, and we actually do it the exact
316

316

00:16:48,499  -->  00:16:52,883
same way as we did before with the feature section.
317

317

00:16:52,883  -->  00:16:54,866
So let's do that.
318

318

00:16:54,866  -->  00:16:58,866
What we're gonna do is to skew this entire story
319

319

00:17:00,166  -->  00:17:02,820
so transform, and then skew.
320

320

00:17:02,820  -->  00:17:05,211
Now the difference is that this time we're gonna do it
321

321

00:17:05,211  -->  00:17:06,711
in the X direction
322

322

00:17:07,894  -->  00:17:09,144
and 12 degrees.
323

323

00:17:11,162  -->  00:17:15,169
Let's take a look at that, and here we go.
324

324

00:17:15,169  -->  00:17:17,777
Actually it should be minus 12 because we want it
325

325

00:17:17,777  -->  00:17:21,916
in the other direction, so that's what it looks like.
326

326

00:17:21,916  -->  00:17:23,672
Now we have the same problem that we had before
327

327

00:17:23,672  -->  00:17:26,779
which is that now, we basically have to skew
328

328

00:17:26,779  -->  00:17:30,999
this one and this one in the opposite direction.
329

329

00:17:30,999  -->  00:17:33,114
So how did we do it last time?
330

330

00:17:33,114  -->  00:17:35,197
Well, we did it like this
331

331

00:17:36,255  -->  00:17:38,547
we used the direct child selector
332

332

00:17:38,547  -->  00:17:40,482
and then selected everything.
333

333

00:17:40,482  -->  00:17:43,587
In this case, that would just be the shape element
334

334

00:17:43,587  -->  00:17:47,930
as well as the ... well, where is it actually?
335

335

00:17:47,930  -->  00:17:51,503
Yeah, so here it is, the story text element.
336

336

00:17:51,503  -->  00:17:55,670
Let me actually define it here, I didn't do it yet.
337

337

00:17:57,096  -->  00:18:01,263
Okay, and so that would select the shape, and the text.
338

338

00:18:03,157  -->  00:18:05,333
However, this is not going to work
339

339

00:18:05,333  -->  00:18:07,583
and I'm gonna show you why.
340

340

00:18:08,680  -->  00:18:11,161
Let me first put it here, and then show you
341

341

00:18:11,161  -->  00:18:12,828
why it doesn't work.
342

342

00:18:14,168  -->  00:18:16,712
Okay, so it does actually work with the text
343

343

00:18:16,712  -->  00:18:19,131
but not with the story, and that's because
344

344

00:18:19,131  -->  00:18:22,188
we already have one transform here going on
345

345

00:18:22,188  -->  00:18:24,883
this translate here is already a transform
346

346

00:18:24,883  -->  00:18:28,171
and it actually takes precedence over this one
347

347

00:18:28,171  -->  00:18:30,436
so therefore only the translation applies
348

348

00:18:30,436  -->  00:18:32,199
and not the skew.
349

349

00:18:32,199  -->  00:18:34,832
Now in CSS, there's currently no way of having two
350

350

00:18:34,832  -->  00:18:37,762
transform properties applying at the same time
351

351

00:18:37,762  -->  00:18:40,677
and that's a shame, but I read that they are working on this
352

352

00:18:40,677  -->  00:18:43,561
so I think that basically in the future these functions
353

353

00:18:43,561  -->  00:18:45,662
that we use here, they will be transformed
354

354

00:18:45,662  -->  00:18:49,950
to real properties, so maybe someday we will have skew X
355

355

00:18:49,950  -->  00:18:52,977
as a property, and then we can specify 12 degrees
356

356

00:18:52,977  -->  00:18:56,175
or we can have translate X as a property, and then
357

357

00:18:56,175  -->  00:18:59,265
specify minus three as a declared value.
358

358

00:18:59,265  -->  00:19:02,215
But for now, this is what we have, so what I'm gonna do
359

359

00:19:02,215  -->  00:19:06,546
is to simply add this one here to the text
360

360

00:19:06,546  -->  00:19:09,346
and then just the skew part
361

361

00:19:09,346  -->  00:19:10,860
here to this transform
362

362

00:19:10,860  -->  00:19:13,140
and then it's going to work and so we have to
363

363

00:19:13,140  -->  00:19:15,737
make it separately so adding the skew now
364

364

00:19:15,737  -->  00:19:17,570
on both here manually.
365

365

00:19:18,445  -->  00:19:22,051
And so like this, it is going to work.
366

366

00:19:22,051  -->  00:19:24,802
All right, so let's take a look at the original
367

367

00:19:24,802  -->  00:19:26,194
and what is missing here, of course
368

368

00:19:26,194  -->  00:19:29,382
is this effect that's going on, okay?
369

369

00:19:29,382  -->  00:19:31,088
But I'm leaving that to the next lecture
370

370

00:19:31,088  -->  00:19:33,244
so that we can take a break now, okay?
371

371

00:19:33,244  -->  00:19:35,244
So, see you, bye then.
