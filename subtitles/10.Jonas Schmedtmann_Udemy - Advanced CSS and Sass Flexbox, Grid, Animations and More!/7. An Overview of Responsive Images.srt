00:00:01,276  -->  00:00:03,841
[Instructor] Big parts of our website are already
2

2

00:00:03,841  -->  00:00:06,143
100% responsive by now.
3

3

00:00:06,143  -->  00:00:08,189
But there is one important aspect we haven't
4

4

00:00:08,189  -->  00:00:11,748
really tackled yet and that is resonsive images.
5

5

00:00:11,748  -->  00:00:14,368
Now we do have flexible images already.
6

6

00:00:14,368  -->  00:00:17,655
So our images nicely scale with the view port width
7

7

00:00:17,655  -->  00:00:21,822
but responsive images take things to a whole new level.
8

8

00:00:22,690  -->  00:00:25,479
And that's because responsive images are not only
9

9

00:00:25,479  -->  00:00:29,260
an aspect of responsive design but even more importantly
10

10

00:00:29,260  -->  00:00:31,543
of web performance.
11

11

00:00:31,543  -->  00:00:33,198
Remember this diagram we talked about
12

12

00:00:33,198  -->  00:00:35,787
but in the beginning of the course where I told you
13

13

00:00:35,787  -->  00:00:38,540
how important performance is?
14

14

00:00:38,540  -->  00:00:41,325
Here it is again because responsive images
15

15

00:00:41,325  -->  00:00:44,312
are crucial for web performance.
16

16

00:00:44,312  -->  00:00:47,861
What are responsive images all about?
17

17

00:00:47,861  -->  00:00:49,921
The philosophy behind responsive images
18

18

00:00:49,921  -->  00:00:53,390
is to serve the right image to the right screen size
19

19

00:00:53,390  -->  00:00:57,124
and device using different techniques in HTML or CSS
20

20

00:00:57,124  -->  00:00:59,848
so that users don't have to download images
21

21

00:00:59,848  -->  00:01:02,690
that are way too large for their devices.
22

22

00:01:02,690  -->  00:01:06,597
For example, let's suppose the image for the zero section
23

23

00:01:06,597  -->  00:01:09,009
is one megabyte large.
24

24

00:01:09,009  -->  00:01:11,274
Now it may be absolutely okay to send this
25

25

00:01:11,274  -->  00:01:14,214
one megabyte image to a desktop computer
26

26

00:01:14,214  -->  00:01:17,728
but it's not okay to send this one megabyte to a phone,
27

27

00:01:17,728  -->  00:01:20,579
which may have a slow or expensive data plan
28

28

00:01:20,579  -->  00:01:22,574
somewhere in the world.
29

29

00:01:22,574  -->  00:01:25,965
As developers we really have a responsibility here
30

30

00:01:25,965  -->  00:01:29,929
and responsive images help us solve these problems.
31

31

00:01:29,929  -->  00:01:32,991
So instead of sending one megabytes to whatever
32

32

00:01:32,991  -->  00:01:34,514
device is consuming the page,
33

33

00:01:34,514  -->  00:01:37,515
it makes way more sense to send the one megabyte image
34

34

00:01:37,515  -->  00:01:40,238
to a device with a large screen that actually
35

35

00:01:40,238  -->  00:01:43,008
needs the image and a much smaller version of the image
36

36

00:01:43,008  -->  00:01:45,688
to a device with a small screen that doesn't
37

37

00:01:45,688  -->  00:01:47,634
need such a large image anyway.
38

38

00:01:47,634  -->  00:01:48,669
Right?
39

39

00:01:48,669  -->  00:01:51,001
And that's what we're going to do and it's pretty
40

40

00:01:51,001  -->  00:01:53,011
exciting to be able to do this in my opinion.
41

41

00:01:53,011  -->  00:01:54,130
It's really cool.
42

42

00:01:54,130  -->  00:01:57,554
Let me just tell you that this is pretty advanced stuff
43

43

00:01:57,554  -->  00:02:00,352
and that not many developers out there know
44

44

00:02:00,352  -->  00:02:02,380
and take this even seriously.
45

45

00:02:02,380  -->  00:02:05,283
So once again, knowing this advanced stuff
46

46

00:02:05,283  -->  00:02:09,300
will really bring you to a complete new level.
47

47

00:02:09,300  -->  00:02:10,783
Now in which situations should
48

48

00:02:10,783  -->  00:02:14,045
we actually use responsive images?
49

49

00:02:14,045  -->  00:02:17,284
There are mainly three use cases where it makes sense.
50

50

00:02:17,284  -->  00:02:20,296
The first one is called resolution switching.
51

51

00:02:20,296  -->  00:02:22,248
And all that we do in resolution switching
52

52

00:02:22,248  -->  00:02:25,560
is to serve up the same image for a smaller screen
53

53

00:02:25,560  -->  00:02:27,785
but with a smaller resolution.
54

54

00:02:27,785  -->  00:02:30,538
So basically, just like we saw in the slide before,
55

55

00:02:30,538  -->  00:02:33,146
same image but a smaller version for a device
56

56

00:02:33,146  -->  00:02:35,898
that doesn't need such a big image.
57

57

00:02:35,898  -->  00:02:38,878
Next, there's density switching which is actually
58

58

00:02:38,878  -->  00:02:41,597
a special case of resolution switching
59

59

00:02:41,597  -->  00:02:43,607
but where the screen size does not matter
60

60

00:02:43,607  -->  00:02:47,286
but a screen pixel density does instead.
61

61

00:02:47,286  -->  00:02:49,593
So what is pixel density?
62

62

00:02:49,593  -->  00:02:53,009
In simple terms, pixel density is the amount of pixels
63

63

00:02:53,009  -->  00:02:56,165
found in an inch or a centimeter.
64

64

00:02:56,165  -->  00:02:57,972
Now what matters to us is that
65

65

00:02:57,972  -->  00:03:00,071
there are low resolution screens,
66

66

00:03:00,071  -->  00:03:02,297
and high resolution screens.
67

67

00:03:02,297  -->  00:03:05,669
Low resolution screens are just typical PC screens,
68

68

00:03:05,669  -->  00:03:09,272
I would say and they can be called 1x screen
69

69

00:03:09,272  -->  00:03:11,837
because they use one pixel to display
70

70

00:03:11,837  -->  00:03:14,216
one pixel of our design.
71

71

00:03:14,216  -->  00:03:17,642
So if we say an image should be 100 pixels high,
72

72

00:03:17,642  -->  00:03:21,638
they will actually use 100 physical pixels in the screen
73

73

00:03:21,638  -->  00:03:25,870
to display these 100 pixels that we specified.
74

74

00:03:25,870  -->  00:03:28,715
Now high-resolution screens are the ones found
75

75

00:03:28,715  -->  00:03:31,624
in all modern smart phones and even some computers
76

76

00:03:31,624  -->  00:03:35,785
already have them, like the MacBooks with retina displays.
77

77

00:03:35,785  -->  00:03:37,636
These are high-resolution screens
78

78

00:03:37,636  -->  00:03:41,352
and can be called 2x screens because they actually use
79

79

00:03:41,352  -->  00:03:45,946
two physical pixels to display one pixel of our design.
80

80

00:03:45,946  -->  00:03:49,589
So if we say we want an image to be 100 pixels high
81

81

00:03:49,589  -->  00:03:53,707
it will actually be 200 pixels in a physical screen.
82

82

00:03:53,707  -->  00:03:56,248
And this all happens automatically of course.
83

83

00:03:56,248  -->  00:03:59,210
What does all of that mean for our images?
84

84

00:03:59,210  -->  00:04:02,926
It means that if we want our images to look sharp
85

85

00:04:02,926  -->  00:04:05,398
on high-resolution displays which use double
86

86

00:04:05,398  -->  00:04:08,692
the amount of pixels then we actually have to serve
87

87

00:04:08,692  -->  00:04:13,160
an image with double the resolution of the original image.
88

88

00:04:13,160  -->  00:04:15,438
And that's what density switching is for,
89

89

00:04:15,438  -->  00:04:18,379
to serve one image to a high-resolution screen
90

90

00:04:18,379  -->  00:04:22,110
and another one if the screen is low resolution.
91

91

00:04:22,110  -->  00:04:25,508
The last use case is called art direction.
92

92

00:04:25,508  -->  00:04:27,792
Art direction happens when you don't just want
93

93

00:04:27,792  -->  00:04:31,018
to serve the same image but in smaller resolution,
94

94

00:04:31,018  -->  00:04:34,707
but a whole different image for a different screen size.
95

95

00:04:34,707  -->  00:04:37,458
For example, you may want to keep the important details
96

96

00:04:37,458  -->  00:04:39,628
in an image but remove parts of the image
97

97

00:04:39,628  -->  00:04:43,096
around these details, just like in this example where
98

98

00:04:43,096  -->  00:04:45,259
the size of the details doesn't even change
99

99

00:04:45,259  -->  00:04:48,012
on a small screen, just stays the same.
100

100

00:04:48,012  -->  00:04:50,671
Or you could also want to load a completely
101

101

00:04:50,671  -->  00:04:52,616
different image altogether.
102

102

00:04:52,616  -->  00:04:56,908
And responsive images actually allow you to do that.
103

103

00:04:56,908  -->  00:04:59,711
In conclusion, resolution and density switching
104

104

00:04:59,711  -->  00:05:02,133
is when you want to serve the same image
105

105

00:05:02,133  -->  00:05:04,598
but with different resolutions.
106

106

00:05:04,598  -->  00:05:06,992
And art directions is when you want to serve
107

107

00:05:06,992  -->  00:05:09,348
a completely different image.
108

108

00:05:09,348  -->  00:05:11,137
Now why are we even talking about
109

109

00:05:11,137  -->  00:05:12,898
these different situations?
110

110

00:05:12,898  -->  00:05:15,412
We are because it's important to distinguish
111

111

00:05:15,412  -->  00:05:17,016
between the different use cases
112

112

00:05:17,016  -->  00:05:19,836
because they require us to use different solutions
113

113

00:05:19,836  -->  00:05:21,853
in our HTML and CSS code.
114

114

00:05:21,853  -->  00:05:23,865
So we have to choose accordingly.
115

115

00:05:23,865  -->  00:05:24,896
Make sense?
116

116

00:05:24,896  -->  00:05:28,131
And since code is what really matters here,
117

117

00:05:28,131  -->  00:05:30,014
that's what we're going to do next.
118

118

00:05:30,014  -->  00:05:31,793
So let's now move on to the next lecture
119

119

00:05:31,793  -->  00:05:35,960
and start implementing some responsive images in our HTML.
