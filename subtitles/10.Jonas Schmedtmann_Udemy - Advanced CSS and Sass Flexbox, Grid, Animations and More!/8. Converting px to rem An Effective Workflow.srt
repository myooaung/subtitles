00:00:01,381  -->  00:00:02,499
<v Instructor>Hello there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,499  -->  00:00:03,864
Let's now put some of the stuff
3

3

00:00:03,864  -->  00:00:06,135
we've been talking about into practice
4

4

00:00:06,135  -->  00:00:07,754
by going back to our project
5

5

00:00:07,754  -->  00:00:11,190
and convert all our pixel units to rem,
6

6

00:00:11,190  -->  00:00:14,128
and I'll explain you why of course.
7

7

00:00:14,128  -->  00:00:15,764
So in this lecture, you're gonna learn
8

8

00:00:15,764  -->  00:00:18,992
how and why we use rem units in our project,
9

9

00:00:18,992  -->  00:00:20,675
and why you should do the same,
10

10

00:00:20,675  -->  00:00:24,106
and, of course, work flow to convert pixels to rem
11

11

00:00:24,106  -->  00:00:26,371
in the easiest way.
12

12

00:00:26,371  -->  00:00:29,318
So this is what we're gonna do in this lecture.
13

13

00:00:29,318  -->  00:00:32,013
We will change all the absolute pixel units
14

14

00:00:32,013  -->  00:00:34,538
to relative rem units, okay?
15

15

00:00:34,538  -->  00:00:36,391
And why are we gonna do that?
16

16

00:00:36,391  -->  00:00:38,620
Well, it's quite simple actually.
17

17

00:00:38,620  -->  00:00:40,609
It's because we want an easy way
18

18

00:00:40,609  -->  00:00:42,888
to change all the measurements on our page
19

19

00:00:42,888  -->  00:00:44,985
with one simple setting,
20

20

00:00:44,985  -->  00:00:46,815
for example, when we hit a break point
21

21

00:00:46,815  -->  00:00:49,776
to display our page on a mobile device.
22

22

00:00:49,776  -->  00:00:51,971
When that happens we want a way to decrease
23

23

00:00:51,971  -->  00:00:55,920
all the measurements in our site at the same time,
24

24

00:00:55,920  -->  00:00:58,605
and instead of writing hundreds of lines of code
25

25

00:00:58,605  -->  00:01:00,211
and in media queries,
26

26

00:01:00,211  -->  00:01:02,611
we can just change one global setting,
27

27

00:01:02,611  -->  00:01:04,652
and that is the global font size.
28

28

00:01:04,652  -->  00:01:07,672
So let me show you how this awesome technique works.
29

29

00:01:07,672  -->  00:01:10,427
So you remember how the rem unit is always
30

30

00:01:10,427  -->  00:01:13,583
in relation to the root font size, right?
31

31

00:01:13,583  -->  00:01:15,620
So if we now set that root font size,
32

32

00:01:15,620  -->  00:01:17,020
we can and very easily change
33

33

00:01:17,020  -->  00:01:20,085
all the other measurements on our page to rem,
34

34

00:01:20,085  -->  00:01:21,162
so let's do that.
35

35

00:01:21,162  -->  00:01:25,329
So the root font size is set in the HTML selector, okay?
36

36

00:01:27,501  -->  00:01:30,334
And so we say font size 10 pixels.
37

37

00:01:32,725  -->  00:01:35,424
Not the 16 that we had before, but 10.
38

38

00:01:35,424  -->  00:01:37,509
I'm actually gonna remove this one
39

39

00:01:37,509  -->  00:01:41,422
by just commenting it out so it stays here for you to see.
40

40

00:01:41,422  -->  00:01:44,044
And so I changed this so 10 pixels,
41

41

00:01:44,044  -->  00:01:47,731
but now, why did I change it to 10 pixels?
42

42

00:01:47,731  -->  00:01:49,804
Well, we do 10 pixels here in order
43

43

00:01:49,804  -->  00:01:52,056
to make our life easier to be honest.
44

44

00:01:52,056  -->  00:01:54,715
That's because now we know that 1 rem
45

45

00:01:54,715  -->  00:01:57,747
equals exactly 10 pixels, right?
46

46

00:01:57,747  -->  00:02:01,128
Because remember, 1 rem is exactly the root font size,
47

47

00:02:01,128  -->  00:02:03,738
so if 10 pixels is now the root font size,
48

48

00:02:03,738  -->  00:02:06,176
then 1 rem is 10 pixels,
49

49

00:02:06,176  -->  00:02:07,823
and so now it's really easy to replace
50

50

00:02:07,823  -->  00:02:10,159
all the pixel units with rem,
51

51

00:02:10,159  -->  00:02:13,416
because all we have to is to divide all the pixels by 10
52

52

00:02:13,416  -->  00:02:15,205
and that's our rem, right?
53

53

00:02:15,205  -->  00:02:18,003
Now, if it was 1 rem is 16 pixels,
54

54

00:02:18,003  -->  00:02:20,238
then we would have to make a lot of calculations,
55

55

00:02:20,238  -->  00:02:21,873
and we don't want to do that, of course,
56

56

00:02:21,873  -->  00:02:26,115
so this is a pretty common technique to avoid that, okay?
57

57

00:02:26,115  -->  00:02:28,846
So with this in mind, let's actually do that.
58

58

00:02:28,846  -->  00:02:31,562
So we start here at the top and change all,
59

59

00:02:31,562  -->  00:02:35,318
or let's say most, of our pixel measurements to rem.
60

60

00:02:35,318  -->  00:02:37,586
So we have a 30 pixel padding,
61

61

00:02:37,586  -->  00:02:41,437
so just divide it by 10 and you end up with 3 rem,
62

62

00:02:41,437  -->  00:02:42,866
okay, and that's it.
63

63

00:02:42,866  -->  00:02:44,928
So let's keep looking, what do we have here?
64

64

00:02:44,928  -->  00:02:48,731
Oh, another one, 40 pixels, so it's 4 rem, right?
65

65

00:02:48,731  -->  00:02:50,522
So you don't have to do any calculations,
66

66

00:02:50,522  -->  00:02:53,784
you just divide it by 10 for rem.
67

67

00:02:53,784  -->  00:02:57,201
And here, 3.5 rem, it makes sense, right?
68

68

00:02:59,026  -->  00:03:03,156
And I will actually show you the effect of this in a second.
69

69

00:03:03,156  -->  00:03:05,976
So here we have percentages, nothing changes,
70

70

00:03:05,976  -->  00:03:06,976
here, 6 rem.
71

71

00:03:09,904  -->  00:03:12,904
Here again, 6 rem, and here 3.5 rem.
72

72

00:03:20,106  -->  00:03:22,689
Font size here should be 2 rem.
73

73

00:03:25,534  -->  00:03:27,117
Here it's 1.74 rem.
74

74

00:03:28,582  -->  00:03:33,343
Well that's a bit specific, let's just keep it at 1.7 rem,
75

75

00:03:33,343  -->  00:03:35,260
or we can say 1.75 rem.
76

76

00:03:36,285  -->  00:03:38,409
Okay, that looks acceptable.
77

77

00:03:38,409  -->  00:03:40,576
Now here, we have -10 rem,
78

78

00:03:42,816  -->  00:03:43,816
here just 1,
79

79

00:03:46,990  -->  00:03:48,740
and 10, and -1, okay?
80

80

00:03:51,193  -->  00:03:53,649
So ideally of course, you start by doing this
81

81

00:03:53,649  -->  00:03:55,826
right in the beginning of the project,
82

82

00:03:55,826  -->  00:03:57,316
but I didn't want to overwhelm you
83

83

00:03:57,316  -->  00:03:59,974
and to scare you with all too much theory
84

84

00:03:59,974  -->  00:04:01,356
right at the beginning of the course,
85

85

00:04:01,356  -->  00:04:03,313
and so we just started the simple way,
86

86

00:04:03,313  -->  00:04:04,796
and the way you probably already know
87

87

00:04:04,796  -->  00:04:07,754
how to do everything which is in simple pixels,
88

88

00:04:07,754  -->  00:04:09,807
but if you're doing responsive design and modern design,
89

89

00:04:09,807  -->  00:04:11,738
and modern CSS development,
90

90

00:04:11,738  -->  00:04:12,849
then it's really good practice
91

91

00:04:12,849  -->  00:04:15,432
to use relative units like rem.
92

92

00:04:17,292  -->  00:04:18,844
So here we have 3 rem.
93

93

00:04:18,844  -->  00:04:22,122
Now of course we could also have used m's instead of rems,
94

94

00:04:22,122  -->  00:04:23,696
but that's a whole lot of work.
95

95

00:04:23,696  -->  00:04:25,115
Believe me, I've tried it,
96

96

00:04:25,115  -->  00:04:27,643
and it's really difficult to make,
97

97

00:04:27,643  -->  00:04:31,423
because, remember that m's depend not on the root font size
98

98

00:04:31,423  -->  00:04:33,954
but on the font size of the parent element,
99

99

00:04:33,954  -->  00:04:36,308
and with that you have to do a lot of calculations
100

100

00:04:36,308  -->  00:04:39,062
and it becomes really, really difficult to manage.
101

101

00:04:39,062  -->  00:04:41,528
So I always set everything to rem
102

102

00:04:41,528  -->  00:04:45,341
and then it's really the best solution.
103

103

00:04:45,341  -->  00:04:48,424
1.5 rem, 4 rem, and 10 rem of course.
104

104

00:04:53,770  -->  00:04:57,937
Here, we can also do it here in these box shadows,
105

105

00:04:59,063  -->  00:05:00,480
and here it's .5,
106

106

00:05:02,113  -->  00:05:04,430
so whenever you have a point
107

107

00:05:04,430  -->  00:05:07,069
you don't write out just 0 in CSS, okay?
108

108

00:05:07,069  -->  00:05:09,570
So of course you can, it works,
109

109

00:05:09,570  -->  00:05:12,703
but it's just a coding practice
110

110

00:05:12,703  -->  00:05:14,870
to only put the dot, okay?
111

111

00:05:16,918  -->  00:05:21,628
It's just a good practice that professionals use.
112

112

00:05:21,628  -->  00:05:23,336
So 10 rem in here.
113

113

00:05:23,336  -->  00:05:25,500
Any more pixels here, no, that's it.
114

114

00:05:25,500  -->  00:05:28,246
Alright, so let's now take a look
115

115

00:05:28,246  -->  00:05:31,022
and see if everything's still working the same.
116

116

00:05:31,022  -->  00:05:32,732
Alright, great.
117

117

00:05:32,732  -->  00:05:36,533
The only thing is, here, the text size here,
118

118

00:05:36,533  -->  00:05:40,456
because originally we set it to 16 pixels, right?
119

119

00:05:40,456  -->  00:05:45,182
And so now here we actually have to set the font size.
120

120

00:05:45,182  -->  00:05:46,758
Here it is.
121

121

00:05:46,758  -->  00:05:50,209
So if we still want it at 16 pixels,
122

122

00:05:50,209  -->  00:05:51,891
and this should be really easy, right?
123

123

00:05:51,891  -->  00:05:53,891
So 16 pixels is 1.6 rem.
124

124

00:05:56,181  -->  00:05:59,514
So let's go back, and here we go, great.
125

125

00:06:01,624  -->  00:06:04,624
Now what I want to show you is this.
126

126

00:06:07,299  -->  00:06:08,263
So if you now go ahead
127

127

00:06:08,263  -->  00:06:12,430
and just change the overall font size, here it is,
128

128

00:06:14,502  -->  00:06:17,898
then see how the entire design changes.
129

129

00:06:17,898  -->  00:06:21,094
I'll go down to 9, and you'll see that everything changes.
130

130

00:06:21,094  -->  00:06:22,628
Everything became smaller.
131

131

00:06:22,628  -->  00:06:25,411
Take a look at the padding here outside,
132

132

00:06:25,411  -->  00:06:27,980
at this padding, and here at this size,
133

133

00:06:27,980  -->  00:06:31,775
and also the text size as I will decrease it further.
134

134

00:06:31,775  -->  00:06:34,086
Sorry, this was increasing, so I decrease it further now.
135

135

00:06:34,086  -->  00:06:37,016
Everything is becoming smaller, right?
136

136

00:06:37,016  -->  00:06:40,341
And that is amazing once we start writing media queries.
137

137

00:06:40,341  -->  00:06:42,616
It will make our lives so much easier.
138

138

00:06:42,616  -->  00:06:44,773
So imagine we had, now, this smaller version,
139

139

00:06:44,773  -->  00:06:47,858
like on a phone, then this would already take
140

140

00:06:47,858  -->  00:06:49,316
a lot of work from us.
141

141

00:06:49,316  -->  00:06:50,593
Instead of writing all the media queries
142

142

00:06:50,593  -->  00:06:52,725
to make all the font sizes smaller
143

143

00:06:52,725  -->  00:06:55,691
and to make all of these distances here smaller,
144

144

00:06:55,691  -->  00:06:57,533
like these 30 pixels,
145

145

00:06:57,533  -->  00:07:01,861
this now automatically converts to something else.
146

146

00:07:01,861  -->  00:07:02,775
For example, in this,
147

147

00:07:02,775  -->  00:07:05,314
wow, this is now really small,
148

148

00:07:05,314  -->  00:07:07,897
let me check this, where is it?
149

149

00:07:10,532  -->  00:07:14,484
Yeah, this body, it has now a padding not of 30 pixels,
150

150

00:07:14,484  -->  00:07:16,730
but of 15 here, as you can see down here.
151

151

00:07:16,730  -->  00:07:18,351
You see now it's 15 pixels
152

152

00:07:18,351  -->  00:07:21,214
and not the 30 that it was before,
153

153

00:07:21,214  -->  00:07:25,381
and that's because we set the font size here to 5, right?
154

154

00:07:26,226  -->  00:07:30,393
So 5 is half of 10, and so 15 is half of 30, right?
155

155

00:07:31,665  -->  00:07:33,998
If we put it back like to 8,
156

156

00:07:35,751  -->  00:07:39,918
then the padding becomes 24 and so forth and so on.
157

157

00:07:40,996  -->  00:07:45,080
And the same will of course work in the other direction.
158

158

00:07:45,080  -->  00:07:47,842
So imagine we have a really huge screen or something,
159

159

00:07:47,842  -->  00:07:49,689
and we want to increase our design,
160

160

00:07:49,689  -->  00:07:52,106
or someone zooms in the page,
161

161

00:07:53,201  -->  00:07:54,805
and that's what happens.
162

162

00:07:54,805  -->  00:07:57,853
So we can also write media queries for larger screens
163

163

00:07:57,853  -->  00:08:00,270
and then increase the design.
164

164

00:08:01,540  -->  00:08:04,105
Alright, so that is the trick,
165

165

00:08:04,105  -->  00:08:07,496
and a huge, huge advantage of using rem.
166

166

00:08:07,496  -->  00:08:09,607
Now, we can still improve this,
167

167

00:08:09,607  -->  00:08:11,791
because it's actually a very bad practice
168

168

00:08:11,791  -->  00:08:14,752
to set the font size to pixels as well,
169

169

00:08:14,752  -->  00:08:18,736
so up here, this shouldn't really be 10 pixels.
170

170

00:08:18,736  -->  00:08:20,314
It should be something else.
171

171

00:08:20,314  -->  00:08:22,367
The problem is that by doing so we actually
172

172

00:08:22,367  -->  00:08:24,601
override the browser font size setting
173

173

00:08:24,601  -->  00:08:27,794
that the user can manually change in the settings,
174

174

00:08:27,794  -->  00:08:29,156
and many people actually do that.
175

175

00:08:29,156  -->  00:08:31,267
For example, when they have bad sight
176

176

00:08:31,267  -->  00:08:32,744
and cannot see so good,
177

177

00:08:32,744  -->  00:08:33,876
then some people actually
178

178

00:08:33,876  -->  00:08:36,986
increase the default font size of their browser.
179

179

00:08:36,986  -->  00:08:38,325
Now if we set the font to,
180

180

00:08:38,325  -->  00:08:40,612
like, the 10 pixels like we did here,
181

181

00:08:40,612  -->  00:08:43,106
then we remove the ability for these people
182

182

00:08:43,106  -->  00:08:44,658
to see our website properly,
183

183

00:08:44,658  -->  00:08:47,749
because they can no longer change the default font size.
184

184

00:08:47,749  -->  00:08:49,931
Well, they can, but our root font size
185

185

00:08:49,931  -->  00:08:51,663
will not be affected by that anymore.
186

186

00:08:51,663  -->  00:08:52,841
It will just be 10 pixels
187

187

00:08:52,841  -->  00:08:56,637
no matter what the user has as a default font size.
188

188

00:08:56,637  -->  00:08:59,003
So this is a really bad practice,
189

189

00:08:59,003  -->  00:09:00,722
and that is why we're going to set
190

190

00:09:00,722  -->  00:09:03,696
over a font size to a percentage here,
191

191

00:09:03,696  -->  00:09:05,718
which will translate to a percentage
192

192

00:09:05,718  -->  00:09:08,463
of the font size given by the browser.
193

193

00:09:08,463  -->  00:09:10,294
Now the default font size,
194

194

00:09:10,294  -->  00:09:12,477
if the user doesn't change anything,
195

195

00:09:12,477  -->  00:09:15,656
which is the initial situation that we want, is 16 pixels,
196

196

00:09:15,656  -->  00:09:17,677
so that's the absolute default,
197

197

00:09:17,677  -->  00:09:20,501
and that's a situation that we're counting on here.
198

198

00:09:20,501  -->  00:09:23,169
So if we put 100% here, this would mean
199

199

00:09:23,169  -->  00:09:26,356
that the root font size would be 16 pixel
200

200

00:09:26,356  -->  00:09:28,369
if the user doesn't change anything,
201

201

00:09:28,369  -->  00:09:31,012
and if the user does change the default font size,
202

202

00:09:31,012  -->  00:09:32,684
let's say to 18 pixels,
203

203

00:09:32,684  -->  00:09:34,742
then the root font size will be 18 pixel.
204

204

00:09:34,742  -->  00:09:36,373
If he changes to 20 pixel,
205

205

00:09:36,373  -->  00:09:39,155
then it will be 20, and so on and so forth.
206

206

00:09:39,155  -->  00:09:41,716
Now, but we don't want 16 pixels here, right?
207

207

00:09:41,716  -->  00:09:43,338
What we want is 10 pixels,
208

208

00:09:43,338  -->  00:09:44,490
and so it's very simple.
209

209

00:09:44,490  -->  00:09:47,629
All we have to do is to divide what we want,
210

210

00:09:47,629  -->  00:09:49,736
which is 10, by 16.
211

211

00:09:49,736  -->  00:09:52,176
So I'm having a calculator here,
212

212

00:09:52,176  -->  00:09:55,009
so 10 divided by 16 is 62.5%,
213

213

00:09:57,474  -->  00:09:59,825
and that is what we're putting here.
214

214

00:09:59,825  -->  00:10:03,992
62.5%, and that's it, that's the whole technique.
215

215

00:10:04,851  -->  00:10:07,518
So now, imagine, let's say .625,
216

216

00:10:08,951  -->  00:10:11,709
so if the default is 16 like we had before,
217

217

00:10:11,709  -->  00:10:14,904
then this translates to 10 pixels, right,
218

218

00:10:14,904  -->  00:10:15,981
which is what we want.
219

219

00:10:15,981  -->  00:10:19,138
But if the user changes to, let's say 20 pixels,
220

220

00:10:19,138  -->  00:10:22,713
then our default font size will be 12.5 pixels,
221

221

00:10:22,713  -->  00:10:25,329
so the root font size I was saying,
222

222

00:10:25,329  -->  00:10:29,417
and if the user does 22, it goes to 13.75 pixels,
223

223

00:10:29,417  -->  00:10:31,013
and so on and so forth,
224

224

00:10:31,013  -->  00:10:32,781
and so with this we allow the user
225

225

00:10:32,781  -->  00:10:35,462
to actually zoom in on the page automatically,
226

226

00:10:35,462  -->  00:10:37,347
not only to change the font size,
227

227

00:10:37,347  -->  00:10:39,690
but to also zoom in on the page,
228

228

00:10:39,690  -->  00:10:41,530
because basically that's what happens.
229

229

00:10:41,530  -->  00:10:43,542
Not exactly zooming, but increasing
230

230

00:10:43,542  -->  00:10:46,077
all of the measurements that we have on our page.
231

231

00:10:46,077  -->  00:10:47,803
So make sure that you understand this technique.
232

232

00:10:47,803  -->  00:10:51,377
It's really widely used in the CSS developer community
233

233

00:10:51,377  -->  00:10:55,176
because it's so simple and yet so powerful, as you saw.
234

234

00:10:55,176  -->  00:10:57,511
Now, one thing that I should probably tell you
235

235

00:10:57,511  -->  00:11:02,373
is that rems are not supported below Internet Explorer 9,
236

236

00:11:02,373  -->  00:11:04,295
so if you have to develop a site
237

237

00:11:04,295  -->  00:11:05,595
for one of these browsers,
238

238

00:11:05,595  -->  00:11:07,645
so the really old Internet Explorers,
239

239

00:11:07,645  -->  00:11:10,202
then you cannot use rems because your site
240

240

00:11:10,202  -->  00:11:12,923
will simply not work at all, okay?
241

241

00:11:12,923  -->  00:11:14,776
Now, since that applies to almost everything
242

242

00:11:14,776  -->  00:11:16,458
that I'm gonna show you in this course,
243

243

00:11:16,458  -->  00:11:18,956
I guess that's not really irrelevant at all,
244

244

00:11:18,956  -->  00:11:21,806
because if you're interested in taking this modern course
245

245

00:11:21,806  -->  00:11:23,273
that you're taking right now,
246

246

00:11:23,273  -->  00:11:25,527
then you're probably not trying to develop
247

247

00:11:25,527  -->  00:11:28,766
for these old browsers anyway.
248

248

00:11:28,766  -->  00:11:30,212
Alright, and one more thing we can do
249

249

00:11:30,212  -->  00:11:31,836
before we finish this lecture
250

250

00:11:31,836  -->  00:11:33,824
is to use the power of inheritance,
251

251

00:11:33,824  -->  00:11:36,341
since we already talked about inheritance.
252

252

00:11:36,341  -->  00:11:38,467
So whenever we can use inheritance,
253

253

00:11:38,467  -->  00:11:41,068
we should use it instead of using here
254

254

00:11:41,068  -->  00:11:44,103
something like the universal selector,
255

255

00:11:44,103  -->  00:11:45,310
and so what I'm going to do now
256

256

00:11:45,310  -->  00:11:48,877
is to remove this box-sizing from here
257

257

00:11:48,877  -->  00:11:51,210
and put it here on the body.
258

258

00:11:53,231  -->  00:11:56,585
So now we set the body to box-sizing border-box,
259

259

00:11:56,585  -->  00:11:58,825
and then in here what we do
260

260

00:11:58,825  -->  00:12:03,702
is to say box-sizing and we use the inherit keyword,
261

261

00:12:03,702  -->  00:12:05,134
and that's it.
262

262

00:12:05,134  -->  00:12:07,700
So remember how we could use the inherit keyword
263

263

00:12:07,700  -->  00:12:09,031
to force inheritance.
264

264

00:12:09,031  -->  00:12:10,397
That's what we're doing here.
265

265

00:12:10,397  -->  00:12:14,041
So the box-sizing property by itself is not inherited,
266

266

00:12:14,041  -->  00:12:15,943
but by setting the box-sizing property
267

267

00:12:15,943  -->  00:12:20,341
on each and every element on the entire page to inherit,
268

268

00:12:20,341  -->  00:12:22,028
it'll automatically inherit
269

269

00:12:22,028  -->  00:12:24,836
whatever we put here on border-box.
270

270

00:12:24,836  -->  00:12:27,227
So this is considered a slightly better practice
271

271

00:12:27,227  -->  00:12:28,784
by the CSS community
272

272

00:12:28,784  -->  00:12:31,865
because it makes it a bit easier to change the box-sizing
273

273

00:12:31,865  -->  00:12:34,349
like in plugins or other components
274

274

00:12:34,349  -->  00:12:35,658
where we might want to use
275

275

00:12:35,658  -->  00:12:38,234
a different property for box-sizing.
276

276

00:12:38,234  -->  00:12:39,779
So it doesn't make a huge difference,
277

277

00:12:39,779  -->  00:12:41,517
just a slightly better practice
278

278

00:12:41,517  -->  00:12:45,117
to do the box-sizing border-box like this.
279

279

00:12:45,117  -->  00:12:46,398
Alright, and since we're at it,
280

280

00:12:46,398  -->  00:12:50,001
we should actually update this universal reset here,
281

281

00:12:50,001  -->  00:12:52,244
because we can do slightly better than this,
282

282

00:12:52,244  -->  00:12:56,281
which is to also select all of the after pseudo-elements
283

283

00:12:56,281  -->  00:12:59,864
and also all of the before pseudo-elements.
284

284

00:13:02,278  -->  00:13:03,532
That's because, right now,
285

285

00:13:03,532  -->  00:13:06,848
only the real elements get this behavior here,
286

286

00:13:06,848  -->  00:13:10,164
but the after and before pseudo-elements,
287

287

00:13:10,164  -->  00:13:11,925
they don't get this behavior,
288

288

00:13:11,925  -->  00:13:12,865
and since we don't want to see
289

289

00:13:12,865  -->  00:13:14,887
any strange behavior happening,
290

290

00:13:14,887  -->  00:13:17,788
we will also include these ones here as well.
291

291

00:13:17,788  -->  00:13:21,955
So you know we already have a after pseudo-element down here
292

292

00:13:22,933  -->  00:13:25,796
and if we had put a width or a height
293

293

00:13:25,796  -->  00:13:28,029
and then a padding or a border,
294

294

00:13:28,029  -->  00:13:32,123
then it wouldn't have behaved the way we expected it,
295

295

00:13:32,123  -->  00:13:37,056
which we expected because of the box-sizing of border-box,
296

296

00:13:37,056  -->  00:13:38,695
so actually it's down here.
297

297

00:13:38,695  -->  00:13:40,950
So it wouldn't have worked the way we expected
298

298

00:13:40,950  -->  00:13:44,206
because we actually didn't have this part here
299

299

00:13:44,206  -->  00:13:48,099
in the universal selector in our global reset.
300

300

00:13:48,099  -->  00:13:50,483
So just another slightly improvement
301

301

00:13:50,483  -->  00:13:52,229
over our previous code.
302

302

00:13:52,229  -->  00:13:54,507
Okay, and that's really it for this lecture.
303

303

00:13:54,507  -->  00:13:56,674
See you in the next video.
