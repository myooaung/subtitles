00:00:01.267  -->  00:00:04.334
<v Jonas>This is part two of writing our media queries.</v>
2

2

00:00:04.334  -->  00:00:06.452
And this is where we left off.
3

3

00:00:06.452  -->  00:00:08.999
So remember that last media query we wrote
4

4

00:00:08.999  -->  00:00:11.499
was for the 1,000 pixels here.
5

5

00:00:13.004  -->  00:00:14.509
Okay, so right here.
6

6

00:00:14.509  -->  00:00:16.303
So let's now move down, like a lot.
7

7

00:00:16.303  -->  00:00:18.451
For example here to 700,
8

8

00:00:18.451  -->  00:00:22.368
and take a look if everything is still alright.
9

9

00:00:23.238  -->  00:00:24.642
But it's really not.
10

10

00:00:24.642  -->  00:00:28.978
Okay so here, you see that the text is already overflowing
11

11

00:00:28.978  -->  00:00:32.978
and well, down here everything looks okay to me.
12

12

00:00:34.399  -->  00:00:35.462
And here as well,
13

13

00:00:35.462  -->  00:00:38.004
and that's because, remember we did all of this here
14

14

00:00:38.004  -->  00:00:39.659
automatically and without the media queries,
15

15

00:00:39.659  -->  00:00:42.047
and so we're not going to have to worry about
16

16

00:00:42.047  -->  00:00:46.214
neither this section here, and also not all of this here.
17

17

00:00:48.236  -->  00:00:50.283
So the problem lies here in this story,
18

18

00:00:50.283  -->  00:00:52.850
and also I see here in the realtors
19

19

00:00:52.850  -->  00:00:55.224
because that's not really enough space.
20

20

00:00:55.224  -->  00:00:57.466
Okay, and so we need to fix that.
21

21

00:00:57.466  -->  00:01:00.738
And I always like to go here in 100 pixel steps
22

22

00:01:00.738  -->  00:01:03.405
and so if it's not right at 719,
23

23

00:01:04.766  -->  00:01:07.849
then let's do the media query at 800.
24

24

00:01:10.063  -->  00:01:11.427
Okay, so right here.
25

25

00:01:11.427  -->  00:01:14.692
So that is the last point where it still looks good,
26

26

00:01:14.692  -->  00:01:17.109
or at least acceptable, okay.
27

27

00:01:18.049  -->  00:01:21.461
And so from here on, we will then change stuff.
28

28

00:01:21.461  -->  00:01:23.378
And how are we going to do that?
29

29

00:01:23.378  -->  00:01:26.351
Well the first thing is to put this realtors
30

30

00:01:26.351  -->  00:01:29.292
here actually below the header.
31

31

00:01:29.292  -->  00:01:31.280
So we will have the header expand all the way
32

32

00:01:31.280  -->  00:01:34.139
from the first column, to the last one,
33

33

00:01:34.139  -->  00:01:36.458
and the realtors here as well.
34

34

00:01:36.458  -->  00:01:39.284
And so we will put that one here down below,
35

35

00:01:39.284  -->  00:01:43.649
and then put these realtors here, all of them side by side
36

36

00:01:43.649  -->  00:01:45.827
and get rid of that text here.
37

37

00:01:45.827  -->  00:01:48.949
Okay and the same thing here as well.
38

38

00:01:48.949  -->  00:01:52.788
So we're going to put this text part here first,
39

39

00:01:52.788  -->  00:01:54.891
and then the images below.
40

40

00:01:54.891  -->  00:01:58.641
Okay but let's start with this top part here.
41

41

00:02:00.900  -->  00:02:05.258
So again we start with the variable definition,
42

42

00:02:05.258  -->  00:02:06.425
so breakpoint,
43

43

00:02:08.012  -->  00:02:09.929
and this one is medium.
44

44

00:02:10.806  -->  00:02:14.473
And so let's calculate 800 by 16 makes 50em.
45

45

00:02:17.917  -->  00:02:20.584
So 15em, and that is 800 pixels.
46

46

00:02:25.684  -->  00:02:28.365
Okay and so of course the first thing that we have to change
47

47

00:02:28.365  -->  00:02:30.282
is our grid definition.
48

48

00:02:34.654  -->  00:02:39.075
Right, because right now we are going to have a new row.
49

49

00:02:39.075  -->  00:02:42.138
And the column here we actually don't need as well,
50

50

00:02:42.138  -->  00:02:44.393
but what we want here is the new row.
51

51

00:02:44.393  -->  00:02:47.026
And that's right after the header, right.
52

52

00:02:47.026  -->  00:02:49.286
So this first row is for the sidebar,
53

53

00:02:49.286  -->  00:02:52.100
the second one here will be for the header,
54

54

00:02:52.100  -->  00:02:55.243
and the one after that will be a new one,
55

55

00:02:55.243  -->  00:02:57.576
and that's for the realtors.
56

56

00:02:58.683  -->  00:03:00.101
Okay, and so that's it.
57

57

00:03:00.101  -->  00:03:03.288
So we want it to be the size to fit the content,
58

58

00:03:03.288  -->  00:03:06.517
just as we have here in all of these others.
59

59

00:03:06.517  -->  00:03:09.632
Now besides that, what I also want is this header
60

60

00:03:09.632  -->  00:03:12.965
to actually fill up the entire viewport.
61

61

00:03:14.499  -->  00:03:17.249
So let's do that by saying 100vh.
62

62

00:03:18.830  -->  00:03:21.854
But that will actually not be 100% correct,
63

63

00:03:21.854  -->  00:03:25.274
but let's actually take a look at why that is.
64

64

00:03:25.274  -->  00:03:27.850
So the positioning here didn't change yet,
65

65

00:03:27.850  -->  00:03:29.236
because we didn't change that.
66

66

00:03:29.236  -->  00:03:33.403
But we see that the row here changed to 100 viewport, right?
67

67

00:03:34.555  -->  00:03:36.195
But the thing is that actually it has
68

68

00:03:36.195  -->  00:03:38.349
some more space down here.
69

69

00:03:38.349  -->  00:03:41.347
So you see that when I scroll down, I want it to end
70

70

00:03:41.347  -->  00:03:44.177
basically at this point so that the next section starts
71

71

00:03:44.177  -->  00:03:45.699
right after the header.
72

72

00:03:45.699  -->  00:03:47.849
But you see that it actually continues here,
73

73

00:03:47.849  -->  00:03:51.255
and that's because of this six rem here that we have here
74

74

00:03:51.255  -->  00:03:52.875
at the top, right.
75

75

00:03:52.875  -->  00:03:55.378
So we said that this row here has 100 viewport height,
76

76

00:03:55.378  -->  00:03:56.763
and in fact it has.
77

77

00:03:56.763  -->  00:03:59.232
So when we scroll, like to this point, then you see
78

78

00:03:59.232  -->  00:04:00.986
that it fills the entire area.
79

79

00:04:00.986  -->  00:04:04.312
What we didn't account for was this six rem here.
80

80

00:04:04.312  -->  00:04:06.176
And so let's do that, and we can do that
81

81

00:04:06.176  -->  00:04:08.593
using the calc function.
82

82

00:04:08.593  -->  00:04:10.477
And so the calc function is really amazing,
83

83

00:04:10.477  -->  00:04:13.317
it's really helpful, and I showed you some applications
84

84

00:04:13.317  -->  00:04:15.522
of this earlier in the course,
85

85

00:04:15.522  -->  00:04:18.055
but here again it is really useful.
86

86

00:04:18.055  -->  00:04:20.225
And so you can also see now that we can actually
87

87

00:04:20.225  -->  00:04:23.540
use the calc function here in the grid definitions.
88

88

00:04:23.540  -->  00:04:27.468
Okay, and so what we do now, is to basically take
89

89

00:04:27.468  -->  00:04:31.169
100 viewport height and then subtract the six rem
90

90

00:04:31.169  -->  00:04:34.086
that we have here for the sidebar.
91

91

00:04:34.086  -->  00:04:36.852
Okay, and so that's going to do the trick.
92

92

00:04:36.852  -->  00:04:39.188
And so you will see now that once we start scrolling,
93

93

00:04:39.188  -->  00:04:43.061
that the next section will appear right below that.
94

94

00:04:43.061  -->  00:04:44.646
Right?
So just like this.
95

95

00:04:44.646  -->  00:04:46.458
That's exactly what we want.
96

96

00:04:46.458  -->  00:04:48.816
Now next up, let's then finally position
97

97

00:04:48.816  -->  00:04:51.853
these two grid items here to where we want them to be.
98

98

00:04:51.853  -->  00:04:54.174
And remember, we want both of them to span
99

99

00:04:54.174  -->  00:04:55.841
the entire viewport.
100

100

00:04:58.468  -->  00:05:01.830
So that's right here in the header.
101

101

00:05:01.830  -->  00:05:05.663
And so let me get that media query here again.
102

102

00:05:07.431  -->  00:05:10.881
And yeah, I can do it right here.
103

103

00:05:10.881  -->  00:05:12.391
And so what's going to change
104

104

00:05:12.391  -->  00:05:15.721
is this grid column here, right.
105

105

00:05:15.721  -->  00:05:19.888
So right now we will have grid column from one to minus one.
106

106

00:05:22.286  -->  00:05:23.623
And that's it.
107

107

00:05:23.623  -->  00:05:27.469
I could also have used full-start to full-end,
108

108

00:05:27.469  -->  00:05:31.620
but it's really just the same so it doesn't really matter.
109

109

00:05:31.620  -->  00:05:35.787
Now next up, we have to do the same thing for the realtors.
110

110

00:05:36.734  -->  00:05:38.234
So let's come here
111

111

00:05:39.398  -->  00:05:42.504
and put the same media query in here.
112

112

00:05:42.504  -->  00:05:44.043
And now taking a look, and you'll see
113

113

00:05:44.043  -->  00:05:46.641
that it's already working.
114

114

00:05:46.641  -->  00:05:49.380
Okay so now both the header and the realtors
115

115

00:05:49.380  -->  00:05:50.966
span the entire viewport.
116

116

00:05:50.966  -->  00:05:52.173
But you see that this is here now occupying
117

117

00:05:52.173  -->  00:05:54.973
way too much space, and we actually do have space
118

118

00:05:54.973  -->  00:05:57.106
to put all of this side by side.
119

119

00:05:57.106  -->  00:05:59.189
And so let's do that now.
120

120

00:06:00.714  -->  00:06:05.037
So where is that, yeah it's here, it's this list, right.
121

121

00:06:05.037  -->  00:06:09.674
So that this, or other grid that we have here,
122

122

00:06:09.674  -->  00:06:13.231
and so remember that our grid template columns here
123

123

00:06:13.231  -->  00:06:16.408
was min-content and max-content.
124

124

00:06:16.408  -->  00:06:18.825
And so let's change that now.
125

125

00:06:21.437  -->  00:06:24.175
And what we want here is to actually have this here
126

126

00:06:24.175  -->  00:06:25.145
three times,
127

127

00:06:25.145  -->  00:06:28.400
so we will have an image and then the text,
128

128

00:06:28.400  -->  00:06:30.817
and then again an image, and then again a text,
129

129

00:06:30.817  -->  00:06:32.880
and then again the image, and then again the text.
130

130

00:06:32.880  -->  00:06:37.047
So it will be min-content and max-content, but three times.
131

131

00:06:38.517  -->  00:06:41.350
So repeat three times all of this.
132

132

00:06:42.383  -->  00:06:44.308
And so you see here that we can put actually
133

133

00:06:44.308  -->  00:06:47.837
more than one track here in this repeat function, right.
134

134

00:06:47.837  -->  00:06:49.977
So we can put as many tracks as we want here
135

135

00:06:49.977  -->  00:06:51.872
and they will then be multiplied.
136

136

00:06:51.872  -->  00:06:54.570
So we will end up with six column tracks here
137

137

00:06:54.570  -->  00:06:58.685
instead of the two that we started with.
138

138

00:06:58.685  -->  00:07:00.423
Okay that should already be enough,
139

139

00:07:00.423  -->  00:07:02.232
and yeah that looks great.
140

140

00:07:02.232  -->  00:07:05.461
So that part is solved, and so let's move on
141

141

00:07:05.461  -->  00:07:07.441
to this one here.
142

142

00:07:07.441  -->  00:07:10.571
And so the solution here will be, as I mentioned before,
143

143

00:07:10.571  -->  00:07:14.944
to put this part here, so the content part here on top,
144

144

00:07:14.944  -->  00:07:18.786
and then this part with the images here below.
145

145

00:07:18.786  -->  00:07:22.597
And both spanning of course the entire viewport as well.
146

146

00:07:22.597  -->  00:07:25.514
So let's implement that very quick.
147

147

00:07:26.406  -->  00:07:29.096
And so actually we just have to copy this media query here
148

148

00:07:29.096  -->  00:07:32.179
to where is it, yeah, near the story.
149

149

00:07:34.705  -->  00:07:38.138
So the pictures part will span from one to minus one,
150

150

00:07:38.138  -->  00:07:41.092
overriding what we have here.
151

151

00:07:41.092  -->  00:07:44.209
And then of course the same for the content.
152

152

00:07:44.209  -->  00:07:48.376
So overriding then effectively this part of the code.
153

153

00:07:50.002  -->  00:07:52.085
Okay, let's check it out.
154

154

00:07:53.157  -->  00:07:55.759
And yeah, so that doesn't look like perfect,
155

155

00:07:55.759  -->  00:07:58.937
but it's for now okay like this.
156

156

00:07:58.937  -->  00:08:00.545
But we want to change now though,
157

157

00:08:00.545  -->  00:08:02.929
is that this part here should come first.
158

158

00:08:02.929  -->  00:08:05.497
And so for that, we are now gonna actively place
159

159

00:08:05.497  -->  00:08:09.048
this item here on the row that we want it to be.
160

160

00:08:09.048  -->  00:08:12.883
So what row line does this one start?
161

161

00:08:12.883  -->  00:08:15.906
So now here in this dev tools, we don't have to draw lines,
162

162

00:08:15.906  -->  00:08:17.582
but we can count them manually.
163

163

00:08:17.582  -->  00:08:19.977
So up here is number one,
164

164

00:08:19.977  -->  00:08:22.429
then row line number two,
165

165

00:08:22.429  -->  00:08:24.012
number three, four,
166

166

00:08:25.100  -->  00:08:25.933
and five.
167

167

00:08:27.088  -->  00:08:31.255
So we want the content to start at five and go to six.
168

168

00:08:35.990  -->  00:08:37.990
So grid-row five to six.
169

169

00:08:40.659  -->  00:08:42.305
Let's check it out.
170

170

00:08:42.305  -->  00:08:44.538
And yeah, indeed, that's it.
171

171

00:08:44.538  -->  00:08:47.304
Now all we have to change is the placement here
172

172

00:08:47.304  -->  00:08:49.279
of these images of course.
173

173

00:08:49.279  -->  00:08:50.696
So let's do that.
174

174

00:08:52.167  -->  00:08:56.084
And so I'm going to paste the media query here.
175

175

00:08:58.029  -->  00:09:00.490
And so how are we going to do that?
176

176

00:09:00.490  -->  00:09:03.622
So remember that we have a six by six grid
177

177

00:09:03.622  -->  00:09:06.549
and so let's put this image here
178

178

00:09:06.549  -->  00:09:10.457
starting on grid column number one to, let's say,
179

179

00:09:10.457  -->  00:09:12.746
grid column number three.
180

180

00:09:12.746  -->  00:09:14.246
And then the rows,
181

181

00:09:15.975  -->  00:09:20.142
let's start it from the start and all the way to the end.
182

182

00:09:22.226  -->  00:09:25.378
Okay, and then actually let's add a padding here
183

183

00:09:25.378  -->  00:09:26.795
to these pictures
184

184

00:09:31.450  -->  00:09:32.533
of three rem.
185

185

00:09:33.775  -->  00:09:36.649
And the same here, so basically
186

186

00:09:36.649  -->  00:09:39.066
we now want these images here
187

187

00:09:40.015  -->  00:09:42.274
to go from the start all the way to the beginning
188

188

00:09:42.274  -->  00:09:43.274
of the grid.
189

189

00:09:44.833  -->  00:09:47.271
And here I'm just gonna leave the column,
190

190

00:09:47.271  -->  00:09:51.148
but I also want the width to not be 115%.
191

191

00:09:51.148  -->  00:09:54.148
So let's say with 100% instead.
192

192

00:09:57.048  -->  00:09:59.508
And let's just take a look at that.
193

193

00:09:59.508  -->  00:10:01.779
And okay that doesn't look perfect yet,
194

194

00:10:01.779  -->  00:10:05.560
so let's maybe increase the size of this one here
195

195

00:10:05.560  -->  00:10:07.859
and then also make it actually occupy
196

196

00:10:07.859  -->  00:10:10.026
the entire grid area here.
197

197

00:10:11.096  -->  00:10:14.513
So I want a height of 100% here now.
198

198

00:10:19.768  -->  00:10:24.434
And let's then change the width automatically, so auto.
199

199

00:10:24.434  -->  00:10:27.816
And here let's say column number four.
200

200

00:10:27.816  -->  00:10:29.773
So how is that going to look like?
201

201

00:10:29.773  -->  00:10:31.952
And actually not much different,
202

202

00:10:31.952  -->  00:10:33.824
let's change the padding here.
203

203

00:10:33.824  -->  00:10:36.313
And you'll see that this is all very subjective,
204

204

00:10:36.313  -->  00:10:38.546
so you could do it in any different way,
205

205

00:10:38.546  -->  00:10:40.550
I'm just adapting it here so that it looks
206

206

00:10:40.550  -->  00:10:42.524
better in the end.
207

207

00:10:42.524  -->  00:10:45.499
And that's actually still not looking all too good,
208

208

00:10:45.499  -->  00:10:49.499
so let's try to increase this here even further.
209

209

00:10:50.634  -->  00:10:52.993
And what I also actually noticed
210

210

00:10:52.993  -->  00:10:54.907
is that we have something missing here,
211

211

00:10:54.907  -->  00:10:57.324
which is the background size.
212

212

00:11:01.113  -->  00:11:05.947
So we want a background size of cover here, of course.
213

213

00:11:05.947  -->  00:11:08.349
So that changed now, but here with this image,
214

214

00:11:08.349  -->  00:11:10.930
nothing really changed.
215

215

00:11:10.930  -->  00:11:12.513
Let's inspect that.
216

216

00:11:16.749  -->  00:11:21.621
And so that's kind of weird, let's change the width to 100%
217

217

00:11:21.621  -->  00:11:25.788
so that it actually fills the cell that we just defined.
218

218

00:11:26.771  -->  00:11:29.063
And yeah so that looks much better.
219

219

00:11:29.063  -->  00:11:32.462
So the width that we want is 100%
220

220

00:11:32.462  -->  00:11:36.629
so that it actually occupies the entire grid cell in width.
221

221

00:11:39.467  -->  00:11:42.775
So the width should still be 100%,
222

222

00:11:42.775  -->  00:11:45.496
so that's the same that we have up there.
223

223

00:11:45.496  -->  00:11:49.325
So let's actually get rid of this and of this as well.
224

224

00:11:49.325  -->  00:11:51.992
And yeah, so that should fix it.
225

225

00:11:54.552  -->  00:11:58.719
If we reload it, and yeah.
So that looks much nicer.
226

226

00:12:00.575  -->  00:12:03.825
And so yeah, this is fixed as well now.
227

227

00:12:04.753  -->  00:12:06.569
Right, looks really great.
228

228

00:12:06.569  -->  00:12:08.569
Well not at this point here again,
229

229

00:12:08.569  -->  00:12:11.466
but again we will have to fix that later
230

230

00:12:11.466  -->  00:12:12.765
in another media query.
231

231

00:12:12.765  -->  00:12:15.848
But for now, it works fine like that.
232

232

00:12:17.032  -->  00:12:20.865
So our entire page looks amazing at this point
233

233

00:12:22.133  -->  00:12:25.609
of 800 and even 700 pixels like this.
234

234

00:12:25.609  -->  00:12:29.527
So where should we then place our next media query?
235

235

00:12:29.527  -->  00:12:33.694
And everything looks great here at this point, I believe.
236

236

00:12:36.528  -->  00:12:38.930
So everything is fine,
237

237

00:12:38.930  -->  00:12:41.079
well not really here.
238

238

00:12:41.079  -->  00:12:43.746
And I think we actually should have fixed that
239

239

00:12:43.746  -->  00:12:46.333
in the other media query,
240

240

00:12:46.333  -->  00:12:48.000
so in this one here.
241

241

00:12:49.293  -->  00:12:51.293
So in the 800 pixel one.
242

242

00:12:52.389  -->  00:12:54.177
So this one.
243

243

00:12:54.177  -->  00:12:56.851
And so let's try to fix that now.
244

244

00:12:56.851  -->  00:13:00.996
And the problem is here in the grid definition again.
245

245

00:13:00.996  -->  00:13:04.277
So we have this 40 viewport width here
246

246

00:13:04.277  -->  00:13:06.777
that applies to this row here,
247

247

00:13:08.714  -->  00:13:11.964
because it's the one, two, three, four,
248

248

00:13:13.058  -->  00:13:14.969
the fifth row.
249

249

00:13:14.969  -->  00:13:18.446
So one, two, three, four, and five.
250

250

00:13:18.446  -->  00:13:21.088
But we actually no longer want this to happen.
251

251

00:13:21.088  -->  00:13:26.087
Instead, we want the content to dictate the size of the row.
252

252

00:13:26.087  -->  00:13:29.982
And so therefore, let's change this to min-content.
253

253

00:13:29.982  -->  00:13:34.149
And actually we didn't even add a new row here for this,
254

254

00:13:36.094  -->  00:13:39.867
so we simple placed this grid item here in this new row,
255

255

00:13:39.867  -->  00:13:41.475
but we didn't create a new one
256

256

00:13:41.475  -->  00:13:43.901
and that's not a problem because all that's gonna happen
257

257

00:13:43.901  -->  00:13:47.730
is that these rows are placed on the implicit grid.
258

258

00:13:47.730  -->  00:13:52.716
So what we want to do here is to change this to min-content.
259

259

00:13:52.716  -->  00:13:54.381
And so we have a lot of min-content here,
260

260

00:13:54.381  -->  00:13:58.768
and so in fact we can actually get rid of all of this,
261

261

00:13:58.768  -->  00:14:01.854
because as I was mentioning, the automatic placement
262

262

00:14:01.854  -->  00:14:03.884
already will take care of that,
263

263

00:14:03.884  -->  00:14:06.078
we don't have to worry about it.
264

264

00:14:06.078  -->  00:14:08.734
So the only two rows that we really want to style
265

265

00:14:08.734  -->  00:14:12.233
in terms of size, by ourselves, are the first two.
266

266

00:14:12.233  -->  00:14:14.329
So the sidebar and the header,
267

267

00:14:14.329  -->  00:14:18.496
and the rest will now be sized based on the content.
268

268

00:14:20.781  -->  00:14:24.169
And so if we now decrease this,
269

269

00:14:24.169  -->  00:14:28.357
then you see that everything is fine with this section.
270

270

00:14:28.357  -->  00:14:31.024
And so as is with this one here.
271

271

00:14:33.213  -->  00:14:35.425
And so all we really have to change here
272

272

00:14:35.425  -->  00:14:38.925
for the smaller screens is this part here.
273

273

00:14:40.083  -->  00:14:43.583
So at this smaller width, like 500 or 550,
274

274

00:14:44.968  -->  00:14:47.478
it starts overflowing.
275

275

00:14:47.478  -->  00:14:50.047
And so that's not what we want,
276

276

00:14:50.047  -->  00:14:51.634
and so we need to fix that.
277

277

00:14:51.634  -->  00:14:55.018
And I'm going to do that here on 600 pixels.
278

278

00:14:55.018  -->  00:14:59.712
And also I'm going to decrease the padding on this section.
279

279

00:14:59.712  -->  00:15:04.339
So at 600 pixels, these two things are all we have to change
280

280

00:15:04.339  -->  00:15:08.506
because again the rest here now works perfectly fine.
281

281

00:15:12.485  -->  00:15:15.235
So let's add a new variable here.
282

282

00:15:17.801  -->  00:15:18.634
bp-small,
283

283

00:15:19.802  -->  00:15:20.885
and 600 by 16
284

284

00:15:23.486  -->  00:15:24.319
is 37.5em.
285

285

00:15:32.940  -->  00:15:34.857
Which means 600 pixels.
286

286

00:15:36.003  -->  00:15:39.003
So the first issue is in the header.
287

287

00:15:40.355  -->  00:15:42.507
And so let's copy this actually.
288

288

00:15:42.507  -->  00:15:45.340
And so all we're gonna change here
289

289

00:15:47.224  -->  00:15:49.474
is the padding to five rem,
290

290

00:15:52.042  -->  00:15:54.709
so going from eight to five rem.
291

291

00:15:55.648  -->  00:15:59.231
And then the next thing is in the realtors.
292

292

00:16:00.341  -->  00:16:02.561
So up here, and what we want to happen now
293

293

00:16:02.561  -->  00:16:05.216
is to basically go back to what we had
294

294

00:16:05.216  -->  00:16:06.959
here in the beginning.
295

295

00:16:06.959  -->  00:16:10.459
So put these realtors one after the other,
296

296

00:16:11.571  -->  00:16:13.571
so one below each other.
297

297

00:16:14.491  -->  00:16:18.658
So all we have to do now is to go back to this grid columns,
298

298

00:16:20.242  -->  00:16:24.075
put it here, and then we should be good to go.
299

299

00:16:30.019  -->  00:16:34.605
Well, actually nothing really happened I believe.
300

300

00:16:34.605  -->  00:16:35.688
Let's reload.
301

301

00:16:39.423  -->  00:16:42.310
And maybe there's something wrong with the media query here,
302

302

00:16:42.310  -->  00:16:46.477
so bp-small, but actually everything seems to be correct.
303

303

00:16:48.078  -->  00:16:49.564
Let's check out if there's any error
304

304

00:16:49.564  -->  00:16:52.573
maybe here in the Terminal, and yeah, so again,
305

305

00:16:52.573  -->  00:16:54.902
of course there is something.
306

306

00:16:54.902  -->  00:16:58.450
And yeah, so it's this semicolon.
307

307

00:16:58.450  -->  00:17:00.721
So give it a save again,
308

308

00:17:00.721  -->  00:17:03.028
and yeah, so here we go.
309

309

00:17:03.028  -->  00:17:05.528
One after the other now again.
310

310

00:17:06.938  -->  00:17:10.125
And here we have the smaller padding,
311

311

00:17:10.125  -->  00:17:12.837
which looks a lot better now.
312

312

00:17:12.837  -->  00:17:17.449
And so this now works, even on like really small screens,
313

313

00:17:17.449  -->  00:17:18.866
like this, right?
314

314

00:17:19.993  -->  00:17:22.330
Now this is maybe not really perfect,
315

315

00:17:22.330  -->  00:17:24.869
so you could decrease the spacing here
316

316

00:17:24.869  -->  00:17:28.536
in this section, decrease this spacing here,
317

317

00:17:29.533  -->  00:17:31.152
and all of the spacing here in this grid,
318

318

00:17:31.152  -->  00:17:33.345
but I'm not going to do all of that,
319

319

00:17:33.345  -->  00:17:37.205
all I wanted to really do is to make the layout look good.
320

320

00:17:37.205  -->  00:17:40.434
And that's actually happening, so everything is perfect.
321

321

00:17:40.434  -->  00:17:42.726
And you saw how little CSS media queries
322

322

00:17:42.726  -->  00:17:46.129
I actually had to wrote in order to make the layout
323

323

00:17:46.129  -->  00:17:49.742
go all the way from this fully-fledged web page,
324

324

00:17:49.742  -->  00:17:52.159
to a mobile screen like this.
325

325

00:17:53.140  -->  00:17:56.253
So we only wrote maybe 100 lines of media queries,
326

326

00:17:56.253  -->  00:17:58.379
maybe even less, to achieve this.
327

327

00:17:58.379  -->  00:18:02.171
And that's all because of the power of CSS grid.
328

328

00:18:02.171  -->  00:18:04.373
I really can't stress that enough.
329

329

00:18:04.373  -->  00:18:07.362
So if you want to go ahead and make this even better
330

330

00:18:07.362  -->  00:18:10.032
and practice your media query skills here,
331

331

00:18:10.032  -->  00:18:11.749
then please do that.
332

332

00:18:11.749  -->  00:18:15.479
But I believe that for now, this is more than enough.
333

333

00:18:15.479  -->  00:18:18.508
So great work, great progress up until this point.
334

334

00:18:18.508  -->  00:18:21.046
And our website is now basically ready.
335

335

00:18:21.046  -->  00:18:22.854
In the next two videos, we will just discuss
336

336

00:18:22.854  -->  00:18:25.648
a couple of more theoretical stuff,
337

337

00:18:25.648  -->  00:18:29.310
but as for the coding, it is now actually pretty much done.
338

338

00:18:29.310  -->  00:18:32.977
So great work, and yeah, see you next time.
