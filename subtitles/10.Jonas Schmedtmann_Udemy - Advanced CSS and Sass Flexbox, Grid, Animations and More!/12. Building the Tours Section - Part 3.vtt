00:00:01.728  -->  00:00:04.067
<v Instructor>And now the third and final part</v>
2

2

00:00:04.067  -->  00:00:08.234
of building these rotating cards in the tours section.
3

3

00:00:09.230  -->  00:00:11.343
So this is what the back part looks like.
4

4

00:00:11.343  -->  00:00:14.343
It's just the text saying only $297.
5

5

00:00:15.534  -->  00:00:17.694
And then down here one of these white buttons,
6

6

00:00:17.694  -->  00:00:19.342
which we already have.
7

7

00:00:19.342  -->  00:00:20.831
So we have one single box
8

8

00:00:20.831  -->  00:00:22.281
that is all of this content here,
9

9

00:00:22.281  -->  00:00:24.610
which I am calling the call to action box,
10

10

00:00:24.610  -->  00:00:27.298
which is nicely centered vertically and horizontally
11

11

00:00:27.298  -->  00:00:29.462
inside of the cart.
12

12

00:00:29.462  -->  00:00:33.038
So, that shouldn't be all too hard, right?
13

13

00:00:33.038  -->  00:00:35.371
So, the back part.
14

14

00:00:35.371  -->  00:00:38.902
So, the CTA, so call to action box,
15

15

00:00:38.902  -->  00:00:40.557
which is easier to write.
16

16

00:00:40.557  -->  00:00:42.971
And actually I forgot the card.
17

17

00:00:42.971  -->  00:00:46.505
Block name here, of course, that needs to be here.
18

18

00:00:46.505  -->  00:00:48.191
And so, what do we have in here?
19

19

00:00:48.191  -->  00:00:51.486
So, we should also have a small box for the price.
20

20

00:00:51.486  -->  00:00:54.486
So I restate only and then the $297.
21

21

00:00:55.514  -->  00:00:57.354
So a box for both these things.
22

22

00:00:57.354  -->  00:01:01.104
So let's call it cart price box, very simple.
23

23

00:01:04.060  -->  00:01:06.179
And then simply the only.
24

24

00:01:06.179  -->  00:01:08.086
So I will make this a paragraph.
25

25

00:01:08.086  -->  00:01:11.491
Okay, because it's just a word of text.
26

26

00:01:11.491  -->  00:01:12.324
So, card
27

27

00:01:14.476  -->  00:01:15.393
price only.
28

28

00:01:19.431  -->  00:01:23.068
So, only, and then another paragraph,
29

29

00:01:23.068  -->  00:01:23.901
card
30

30

00:01:26.809  -->  00:01:27.809
price value.
31

31

00:01:30.666  -->  00:01:33.867
So these may sound like a bit weird names.
32

32

00:01:33.867  -->  00:01:37.148
Well, it's not really easy to find all these names
33

33

00:01:37.148  -->  00:01:39.058
for all these elements we have
34

34

00:01:39.058  -->  00:01:41.335
for our interfaces.
35

35

00:01:41.335  -->  00:01:43.158
So we have the card price box,
36

36

00:01:43.158  -->  00:01:44.991
and then after that we have the button.
37

37

00:01:44.991  -->  00:01:49.158
Remember, so we have an A element with a class button.
38

38

00:01:51.457  -->  00:01:53.645
And pointing to nowhere.
39

39

00:01:53.645  -->  00:01:55.395
And it says book now.
40

40

00:01:57.773  -->  00:02:00.680
All right, and remember that we had I think two
41

41

00:02:00.680  -->  00:02:04.176
types of buttons, let me take that out actually.
42

42

00:02:04.176  -->  00:02:08.391
So, we had the button and the white button.
43

43

00:02:08.391  -->  00:02:11.390
There will probably be a green one
44

44

00:02:11.390  -->  00:02:13.668
sometime, but okay, for now we have the white one.
45

45

00:02:13.668  -->  00:02:17.251
So I should also add here the button white.
46

46

00:02:19.563  -->  00:02:21.823
And actually it's too for the modifier.
47

47

00:02:21.823  -->  00:02:23.636
So button white in here.
48

48

00:02:23.636  -->  00:02:25.972
So, card CTA contains all of this.
49

49

00:02:25.972  -->  00:02:28.472
So let's now style a card CTA.
50

50

00:02:35.131  -->  00:02:38.261
So, front side styling just to keep
51

51

00:02:38.261  -->  00:02:40.511
this nicely organized here.
52

52

00:02:42.950  -->  00:02:44.771
So card CTA.
53

53

00:02:44.771  -->  00:02:46.432
And remember, we're going to position it
54

54

00:02:46.432  -->  00:02:48.100
with absolute positioning.
55

55

00:02:48.100  -->  00:02:52.267
So, position, absolute, and then our center method.
56

56

00:02:53.784  -->  00:02:55.945
Remember how that works?
57

57

00:02:55.945  -->  00:02:58.778
So, top, we move it 50% down.
58

58

00:03:00.535  -->  00:03:04.004
Left, we move it 50% of the parent element's width
59

59

00:03:04.004  -->  00:03:07.105
to the left, and then we transform it back
60

60

00:03:07.105  -->  00:03:09.012
to the exact center.
61

61

00:03:09.012  -->  00:03:12.728
So, translate, minus 50%, and this time
62

62

00:03:12.728  -->  00:03:16.096
of the width of the element, not the parent.
63

63

00:03:16.096  -->  00:03:19.697
And 50% of the height as well
64

64

00:03:19.697  -->  00:03:22.434
minus 50% to put it back up.
65

65

00:03:22.434  -->  00:03:25.574
So the exact same thing as we did in the header.
66

66

00:03:25.574  -->  00:03:29.612
Let's just quickly check that out before we move on.
67

67

00:03:29.612  -->  00:03:32.945
Wow, something is not working 100%.
68

68

00:03:36.163  -->  00:03:37.344
Well, now it's on the other side,
69

69

00:03:37.344  -->  00:03:40.677
so it's a bit difficult to check it out.
70

70

00:03:43.879  -->  00:03:45.657
Okay, but we can still see it here.
71

71

00:03:45.657  -->  00:03:48.400
It's like invisible, but I can see what's going on here.
72

72

00:03:48.400  -->  00:03:52.237
It's here, so there's a small mistake.
73

73

00:03:52.237  -->  00:03:54.237
Okay, and that should fix it.
74

74

00:03:54.237  -->  00:03:57.404
Now, moving on, we have the prize box.
75

75

00:04:02.911  -->  00:04:05.578
And we also have the price only.
76

76

00:04:15.811  -->  00:04:18.026
And the price value.
77

77

00:04:18.026  -->  00:04:20.846
Okay, the price value should be really big.
78

78

00:04:20.846  -->  00:04:23.163
Remember that one.
79

79

00:04:23.163  -->  00:04:25.936
So, let's put it to six rem.
80

80

00:04:25.936  -->  00:04:29.936
And then really a thin text, so font weight 100.
81

81

00:04:31.386  -->  00:04:33.241
Because usually when we have really huge text,
82

82

00:04:33.241  -->  00:04:35.687
it looks better when we then make it really thin
83

83

00:04:35.687  -->  00:04:39.854
instead of just leaving it like a big and bold text.
84

84

00:04:41.578  -->  00:04:43.308
And then the only part can be quite small actually.
85

85

00:04:43.308  -->  00:04:45.058
So font size 1.4 rem.
86

86

00:04:52.890  -->  00:04:54.053
And two upper case.
87

87

00:04:54.053  -->  00:04:56.636
So let's take a look right now.
88

88

00:04:57.734  -->  00:05:00.689
All right, so that looks quite cool actually already.
89

89

00:05:00.689  -->  00:05:02.911
We just have to center this here,
90

90

00:05:02.911  -->  00:05:07.335
make the text white, and then add some margin here.
91

91

00:05:07.335  -->  00:05:10.115
Okay, and for that, the price box is perfect
92

92

00:05:10.115  -->  00:05:12.385
because it contains these two price only
93

93

00:05:12.385  -->  00:05:14.302
and price value.
94

94

00:05:14.302  -->  00:05:17.635
And so, we can do text line center here.
95

95

00:05:20.826  -->  00:05:24.650
We can set a margin to the bottom of eight rem.
96

96

00:05:24.650  -->  00:05:27.704
And we can also set a color to white here.
97

97

00:05:27.704  -->  00:05:29.574
Because remember, the other elements will then
98

98

00:05:29.574  -->  00:05:31.407
inherit this property.
99

99

00:05:32.299  -->  00:05:33.632
So, color white,
100

100

00:05:35.303  -->  00:05:37.141
and we should be good to go.
101

101

00:05:37.141  -->  00:05:39.913
Then there's only one problem left to fix,
102

102

00:05:39.913  -->  00:05:41.444
which is this button here.
103

103

00:05:41.444  -->  00:05:43.572
But I think I know why that is.
104

104

00:05:43.572  -->  00:05:46.239
So let me actually inspect this.
105

105

00:05:48.293  -->  00:05:51.477
But, first of all, let me do something.
106

106

00:05:51.477  -->  00:05:53.838
So, this is the back side of the card.
107

107

00:05:53.838  -->  00:05:56.338
If we remove this rotate here,
108

108

00:05:57.266  -->  00:06:00.068
okay, then we can actually manipulate this.
109

109

00:06:00.068  -->  00:06:03.901
So, what you're seeing here is that the button
110

110

00:06:05.326  -->  00:06:08.964
is adapting to the width of this CTA box here.
111

111

00:06:08.964  -->  00:06:13.047
And that's why then the text is broken up into lines.
112

112

00:06:13.047  -->  00:06:15.695
So, all we have to do is to really give this some width,
113

113

00:06:15.695  -->  00:06:19.521
and then that should eventually fix it.
114

114

00:06:19.521  -->  00:06:22.884
So, CTA, just give it some width.
115

115

00:06:22.884  -->  00:06:27.051
Maybe not 100%, but like 90%, that should be okay.
116

116

00:06:29.035  -->  00:06:32.037
So, I also noticed that here is an error.
117

117

00:06:32.037  -->  00:06:35.287
So, price, somehow I would print, okay.
118

118

00:06:36.815  -->  00:06:39.565
But now I believe that it's okay.
119

119

00:06:40.742  -->  00:06:44.143
Well, still not really, because it's now not centered.
120

120

00:06:44.143  -->  00:06:46.666
That's also an easy fix.
121

121

00:06:46.666  -->  00:06:49.170
We just have to make text align center here.
122

122

00:06:49.170  -->  00:06:52.503
And we can actually copy that from here.
123

123

00:06:53.714  -->  00:06:55.797
So, that should work now.
124

124

00:06:58.439  -->  00:07:00.528
All right, so really nice.
125

125

00:07:00.528  -->  00:07:01.915
So, that was easier.
126

126

00:07:01.915  -->  00:07:04.290
Now all we have to do is to actually create
127

127

00:07:04.290  -->  00:07:07.717
the other two cards and then put the green button in here.
128

128

00:07:07.717  -->  00:07:09.917
So, these are the other two cards.
129

129

00:07:09.917  -->  00:07:10.906
Let me show them to you.
130

130

00:07:10.906  -->  00:07:13.572
So, it says 497 on the back,
131

131

00:07:13.572  -->  00:07:16.659
897 on the back this one, and on the front,
132

132

00:07:16.659  -->  00:07:17.950
they look like this.
133

133

00:07:17.950  -->  00:07:19.273
So what I want you to do is to now
134

134

00:07:19.273  -->  00:07:23.171
go ahead and actually build these cards by yourself.
135

135

00:07:23.171  -->  00:07:25.736
I think I already gave you the colors.
136

136

00:07:25.736  -->  00:07:27.353
Yeah, I did, I know I did.
137

137

00:07:27.353  -->  00:07:31.225
And so, you're ready to actually do this all by yourself.
138

138

00:07:31.225  -->  00:07:33.699
Well, except maybe for the images.
139

139

00:07:33.699  -->  00:07:35.544
So you don't have the names of the images.
140

140

00:07:35.544  -->  00:07:37.794
So let me give them to you.
141

141

00:07:39.223  -->  00:07:40.390
So, it's here.
142

142

00:07:41.553  -->  00:07:45.553
So I can give you the images of the backgrounds.
143

143

00:07:48.962  -->  00:07:51.129
They are simply called six
144

144

00:07:52.915  -->  00:07:54.248
and seven, okay?
145

145

00:07:56.020  -->  00:07:57.510
So, then all you have to do is to change
146

146

00:07:57.510  -->  00:07:59.260
the color names here.
147

147

00:08:00.183  -->  00:08:01.590
So this is the text here.
148

148

00:08:01.590  -->  00:08:05.757
Go ahead and copy it and I'll see you back here in a second.
149

149

00:08:07.355  -->  00:08:09.749
So, I hope you managed to make it work.
150

150

00:08:09.749  -->  00:08:13.916
So, now really quickly going to do it as well here.
151

151

00:08:15.322  -->  00:08:18.886
So one column here, and actually I don't think it's
152

152

00:08:18.886  -->  00:08:21.886
all of this, so we want this column.
153

153

00:08:25.603  -->  00:08:28.770
So I can copy all of this in this way.
154

154

00:08:30.766  -->  00:08:33.019
Oh, and actually I already have the columns here.
155

155

00:08:33.019  -->  00:08:37.186
So sorry about that, let's just copy the card then.
156

156

00:08:42.002  -->  00:08:43.585
Give it some space.
157

157

00:08:58.411  -->  00:09:01.411
It's only one r, so the first hiker.
158

158

00:09:04.097  -->  00:09:04.930
Seven,
159

159

00:09:06.482  -->  00:09:07.482
40, and six.
160

160

00:09:15.338  -->  00:09:16.671
And it's medium.
161

161

00:09:19.068  -->  00:09:20.901
And it also costs 497.
162

162

00:09:22.949  -->  00:09:24.199
Of course, it's
163

163

00:09:28.923  -->  00:09:32.178
picture two, span two, and back two.
164

164

00:09:32.178  -->  00:09:34.928
And now the same thing down here.
165

165

00:09:43.963  -->  00:09:48.521
The snow adventure, and it's a five day tour,
166

166

00:09:48.521  -->  00:09:49.354
up 15,
167

167

00:09:51.753  -->  00:09:54.753
three sleeping provided tents again.
168

168

00:10:01.292  -->  00:10:03.887
And this one is hard, and so it's more expensive.
169

169

00:10:03.887  -->  00:10:04.720
897.
170

170

00:10:07.150  -->  00:10:09.694
All right, and now in the CSS.
171

171

00:10:09.694  -->  00:10:11.067
So we have number two and three.
172

172

00:10:11.067  -->  00:10:14.567
So here it's the green one is the primary.
173

173

00:10:18.131  -->  00:10:20.048
And this is a tertiary.
174

174

00:10:26.060  -->  00:10:28.060
And the same thing here.
175

175

00:10:39.722  -->  00:10:42.222
And, of course, this one here.
176

176

00:10:47.470  -->  00:10:49.613
And, finally, well, where's the other one?
177

177

00:10:49.613  -->  00:10:51.863
Okay, yeah, it was up here.
178

178

00:11:09.684  -->  00:11:12.354
And, finally, the tertiary color.
179

179

00:11:12.354  -->  00:11:15.104
And let's hope that it works now.
180

180

00:11:17.496  -->  00:11:19.149
And it does, so this is my version here.
181

181

00:11:19.149  -->  00:11:21.293
It's not the original version.
182

182

00:11:21.293  -->  00:11:22.543
So, here we go.
183

183

00:11:24.552  -->  00:11:26.962
This is exactly it.
184

184

00:11:26.962  -->  00:11:31.815
So, three cards, all rotating, all looking amazing.
185

185

00:11:31.815  -->  00:11:33.165
Now all there's left to do actually is to
186

186

00:11:33.165  -->  00:11:34.277
put this button here.
187

187

00:11:34.277  -->  00:11:36.181
Okay, so let's do that.
188

188

00:11:36.181  -->  00:11:41.070
And that's a final thing we have to do in this section.
189

189

00:11:41.070  -->  00:11:45.517
So right here, after the row, I believe that's the row.
190

190

00:11:45.517  -->  00:11:46.971
So right here after the row is where we're
191

191

00:11:46.971  -->  00:11:49.164
gonna put it then.
192

192

00:11:49.164  -->  00:11:50.903
And how should we do it?
193

193

00:11:50.903  -->  00:11:52.673
Well, remember that the button is centered
194

194

00:11:52.673  -->  00:11:54.915
and it has some margin between the card
195

195

00:11:54.915  -->  00:11:56.342
and the button.
196

196

00:11:56.342  -->  00:11:58.665
And so, this is actually a similar case to
197

197

00:11:58.665  -->  00:12:01.904
this heading that we have here going on.
198

198

00:12:01.904  -->  00:12:03.732
So we simply put a div here.
199

199

00:12:03.732  -->  00:12:06.874
Then we had some helper classes which helped us.
200

200

00:12:06.874  -->  00:12:08.054
And that's what we're gonna do now,
201

201

00:12:08.054  -->  00:12:11.471
so let me just copy that and put it here.
202

202

00:12:12.444  -->  00:12:14.312
So we want this to be centered.
203

203

00:12:14.312  -->  00:12:17.145
Of course no H two here this time.
204

204

00:12:19.796  -->  00:12:22.025
But instead is an anchor link.
205

205

00:12:22.025  -->  00:12:25.192
So a.button pointing to nowhere again.
206

206

00:12:27.438  -->  00:12:30.438
And then here, this cover all tours.
207

207

00:12:33.114  -->  00:12:35.386
So this would lead to some page where
208

208

00:12:35.386  -->  00:12:38.071
all the tours are listed, but which we don't have
209

209

00:12:38.071  -->  00:12:39.708
in our project of course.
210

210

00:12:39.708  -->  00:12:41.703
And for example, then on this page here,
211

211

00:12:41.703  -->  00:12:43.436
there could be all of the available tours,
212

212

00:12:43.436  -->  00:12:46.614
and then we could reuse all of these cards here.
213

213

00:12:46.614  -->  00:12:50.997
And so, that's why we did them as components.
214

214

00:12:50.997  -->  00:12:54.992
Now, this here is for margin bottom big.
215

215

00:12:54.992  -->  00:12:58.079
But we want something for margin to the top.
216

216

00:12:58.079  -->  00:13:00.690
So let's add another helper class.
217

217

00:13:00.690  -->  00:13:02.273
So another utility.
218

218

00:13:05.426  -->  00:13:09.176
And let's simply call it margin top, why not?
219

219

00:13:10.747  -->  00:13:11.664
Margin top.
220

220

00:13:12.558  -->  00:13:14.133
And so, this way we don't have to create
221

221

00:13:14.133  -->  00:13:16.865
a whole new style just to position this button
222

222

00:13:16.865  -->  00:13:18.782
where we want it to be.
223

223

00:13:20.169  -->  00:13:24.984
Okay, actually we have to say that it's a green button.
224

224

00:13:24.984  -->  00:13:28.818
And I think we don't have it already.
225

225

00:13:28.818  -->  00:13:30.790
I think it's only the white one that we have.
226

226

00:13:30.790  -->  00:13:32.707
And, yeah, it seems so.
227

227

00:13:36.738  -->  00:13:37.571
So,
228

228

00:13:40.351  -->  00:13:43.684
green and here it's called color primary
229

229

00:13:46.025  -->  00:13:47.810
because that's our green color.
230

230

00:13:47.810  -->  00:13:49.092
And so, that should work now already.
231

231

00:13:49.092  -->  00:13:50.675
Let's check it out.
232

232

00:13:52.208  -->  00:13:54.104
And, yeah, here we go.
233

233

00:13:54.104  -->  00:13:56.201
There's just one thing that we have to change,
234

234

00:13:56.201  -->  00:13:59.064
which is just the color, which is not gray dark
235

235

00:13:59.064  -->  00:14:03.770
in here in the green one, but here it's actually white.
236

236

00:14:03.770  -->  00:14:05.672
And the rest should be perfect.
237

237

00:14:05.672  -->  00:14:07.172
So let's close it.
238

238

00:14:08.091  -->  00:14:10.671
Close this one as well.
239

239

00:14:10.671  -->  00:14:13.921
And so, yeah, so here we go, that's it.
240

240

00:14:16.066  -->  00:14:20.490
It's the title, it's the boxes, and it's the button.
241

241

00:14:20.490  -->  00:14:23.622
Oh, and now we said we should fix this huge space here.
242

242

00:14:23.622  -->  00:14:25.789
So let's finish with that.
243

243

00:14:28.949  -->  00:14:32.032
So, maybe 15 it enough on the bottom.
244

244

00:14:33.937  -->  00:14:36.437
And, yeah, so that looks good.
245

245

00:14:37.892  -->  00:14:41.247
Now, just this space here seems to be big,
246

246

00:14:41.247  -->  00:14:42.845
bigger than this one here, while in fact,
247

247

00:14:42.845  -->  00:14:45.767
it's also 80 pixels, but I guess it looks different
248

248

00:14:45.767  -->  00:14:47.794
because of the shadow here, so it gives us
249

249

00:14:47.794  -->  00:14:49.713
a different impression.
250

250

00:14:49.713  -->  00:14:52.713
So let's change the big one here to,
251

251

00:14:54.647  -->  00:14:56.243
oh, let's actually create a new one, why not?
252

252

00:14:56.243  -->  00:14:59.873
So we are more consistent this way.
253

253

00:14:59.873  -->  00:15:01.790
So, one is called huge.
254

254

00:15:02.706  -->  00:15:04.373
And huge has 10 rem.
255

255

00:15:08.935  -->  00:15:11.511
So, we want a huge margin for the top.
256

256

00:15:11.511  -->  00:15:13.684
And then finally one thing that I noticed here
257

257

00:15:13.684  -->  00:15:16.565
is that these corners here are no longer round.
258

258

00:15:16.565  -->  00:15:18.837
And that actually happens because of the clear path
259

259

00:15:18.837  -->  00:15:20.675
property that we used here.
260

260

00:15:20.675  -->  00:15:23.043
So this clear path in Google Chrome,
261

261

00:15:23.043  -->  00:15:25.823
the breaks the over flow that we sat for that.
262

262

00:15:25.823  -->  00:15:29.492
So remember, we actually sat the overflow hidden
263

263

00:15:29.492  -->  00:15:32.722
so that these corners that are overflowing
264

264

00:15:32.722  -->  00:15:35.530
the parent element are actually hidden.
265

265

00:15:35.530  -->  00:15:39.514
But for some reason when we then use the clear path here
266

266

00:15:39.514  -->  00:15:43.078
on that very image, then the overflow no longer works.
267

267

00:15:43.078  -->  00:15:45.370
So we have to now set this manually,
268

268

00:15:45.370  -->  00:15:46.662
but that's not a big deal.
269

269

00:15:46.662  -->  00:15:50.329
So, border, top, left, radius, three pixels.
270

270

00:15:56.293  -->  00:16:00.976
Border, top, right, and this should be the final line
271

271

00:16:00.976  -->  00:16:02.427
of code of this.
272

272

00:16:02.427  -->  00:16:03.960
Let's check out how many lines we wrote.
273

273

00:16:03.960  -->  00:16:08.692
Well, actually not 200, but 160, but still not so bad.
274

274

00:16:08.692  -->  00:16:11.419
If you put that together with the HTML, that's probably like
275

275

00:16:11.419  -->  00:16:13.594
300 lines of code.
276

276

00:16:13.594  -->  00:16:15.882
All right, and so now the cards are finalized.
277

277

00:16:15.882  -->  00:16:19.862
You see that the borders are now back to being rounded.
278

278

00:16:19.862  -->  00:16:22.885
And, yeah, it's overall a very nice design.
279

279

00:16:22.885  -->  00:16:25.903
And this was once again very great progress for you.
280

280

00:16:25.903  -->  00:16:29.420
Lots of new tools for you, lots of stuff to think about.
281

281

00:16:29.420  -->  00:16:33.087
And that is the whole point of this course.
