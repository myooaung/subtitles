00:00:01,531  -->  00:00:02,697
<v Instructor>I hope that you managed</v>
2

2

00:00:02,697  -->  00:00:04,560
to complete the challenge.
3

3

00:00:04,560  -->  00:00:07,186
Now here goes the solution.
4

4

00:00:07,186  -->  00:00:10,986
So once more we start from an empty CodePen Project
5

5

00:00:10,986  -->  00:00:14,975
and I will start with the markup here once again.
6

6

00:00:14,975  -->  00:00:18,308
So let's call this container a challenge
7

7

00:00:22,869  -->  00:00:24,802
and so now let's put our elements in there.
8

8

00:00:24,802  -->  00:00:27,385
So the first one is the header,
9

9

00:00:29,124  -->  00:00:32,791
the next one I'm going to call the small box
10

10

00:00:36,141  -->  00:00:39,415
one, so small box one
11

11

00:00:39,415  -->  00:00:41,582
and then actually three of them,
12

12

00:00:41,582  -->  00:00:44,650
and I could have done that with Amit
13

13

00:00:44,650  -->  00:00:47,967
like I showed you before in the other lecture,
14

14

00:00:47,967  -->  00:00:50,799
but there's only three boxes so it's not
15

15

00:00:50,799  -->  00:00:52,216
too hard.
16

16

00:00:55,967  -->  00:00:59,717
Then the next one is called the main content,
17

17

00:01:01,361  -->  00:01:03,444
then we have the sidebar,
18

18

00:01:04,602  -->  00:01:07,352
and of course finally the footer.
19

19

00:01:09,332  -->  00:01:13,499
Okay, so moving over here to our CSS now.
20

20

00:01:17,306  -->  00:01:19,823
Let's form it or challenge element.
21

21

00:01:19,823  -->  00:01:22,206
So let's set like some overall settings
22

22

00:01:22,206  -->  00:01:24,686
like we did before for this container
23

23

00:01:24,686  -->  00:01:26,936
like giving it a width
24

24

00:01:29,245  -->  00:01:32,499
and a margin of again
25

25

00:01:32,499  -->  00:01:35,227
30 pixels top bottom and then auto
26

26

00:01:35,227  -->  00:01:37,061
just so that it sits nicely
27

27

00:01:37,061  -->  00:01:40,144
centered here in our view port, okay.
28

28

00:01:41,000  -->  00:01:43,892
Then let's actually give a background color
29

29

00:01:43,892  -->  00:01:46,582
to all of these elements here, okay,
30

30

00:01:46,582  -->  00:01:48,400
and how do we do that, how do we select
31

31

00:01:48,400  -->  00:01:50,925
all of them at the same time?
32

32

00:01:50,925  -->  00:01:52,755
Well I just like to do it like this
33

33

00:01:52,755  -->  00:01:55,868
as I showed you before a million times in the course.
34

34

00:01:55,868  -->  00:01:59,600
So basically we select all of the direct children
35

35

00:01:59,600  -->  00:02:00,906
of the challenge.
36

36

00:02:00,906  -->  00:02:03,664
So using this SAS selector here.
37

37

00:02:03,664  -->  00:02:06,239
So it's challenge and then direct children
38

38

00:02:06,239  -->  00:02:09,406
and all of them, right, remember that?
39

39

00:02:10,504  -->  00:02:11,986
So background color
40

40

00:02:11,986  -->  00:02:15,819
and again I'm going with the orange-red, okay.
41

41

00:02:17,261  -->  00:02:20,684
The padding of 20 pixels let's say.
42

42

00:02:20,684  -->  00:02:22,517
Color should be white.
43

43

00:02:25,621  -->  00:02:28,954
Font size of 30 pixels and a font family
44

44

00:02:30,885  -->  00:02:32,615
just as Sans Serif one.
45

45

00:02:32,615  -->  00:02:33,931
So we don't want to bother
46

46

00:02:33,931  -->  00:02:36,538
with incorporating some font here, okay,
47

47

00:02:36,538  -->  00:02:39,630
just so that it looks a bit better than the original.
48

48

00:02:39,630  -->  00:02:42,549
So this is our layout let's say without any
49

49

00:02:42,549  -->  00:02:43,822
of the styling.
50

50

00:02:43,822  -->  00:02:46,680
Now remember that we had four columns basically.
51

51

00:02:46,680  -->  00:02:49,081
So one for each of these small boxes
52

52

00:02:49,081  -->  00:02:53,248
and then one on the side for the sidebar, right.
53

53

00:02:54,237  -->  00:02:57,589
So grid,
54

54

00:02:57,589  -->  00:03:00,039
template, rows
55

55

00:03:00,039  -->  00:03:03,323
and if you remember we also had four rows
56

56

00:03:03,323  -->  00:03:06,021
and the size I gave them was this one.
57

57

00:03:06,021  -->  00:03:10,412
So 100 pixels for the first one, so for the header,
58

58

00:03:10,412  -->  00:03:13,872
then 200 pixels for the small boxes
59

59

00:03:13,872  -->  00:03:16,556
then 400 pixels for the main content
60

60

00:03:16,556  -->  00:03:19,723
and 100 pixels again for the footer
61

61

00:03:20,901  -->  00:03:24,984
and then grid, template, columns.
62

62

00:03:26,374  -->  00:03:28,935
Remember that the sidebar was a bit smaller
63

63

00:03:28,935  -->  00:03:31,608
than the rest of the columns
64

64

00:03:31,608  -->  00:03:33,745
and so what we want is basically to have
65

65

00:03:33,745  -->  00:03:38,069
three equally sized columns and then one smaller one.
66

66

00:03:38,069  -->  00:03:40,198
So the way I'm going about this
67

67

00:03:40,198  -->  00:03:41,638
and you can probably guess,
68

68

00:03:41,638  -->  00:03:45,336
is to have three times one fractal unit
69

69

00:03:45,336  -->  00:03:49,967
and then the last column with let's say 200 pixels.
70

70

00:03:49,967  -->  00:03:53,973
So the sidebar will have just 200 pixels of course
71

71

00:03:53,973  -->  00:03:55,414
and then the rest of the space
72

72

00:03:55,414  -->  00:03:58,402
will be divided for the three other columns
73

73

00:03:58,402  -->  00:04:00,369
and the gutter of course that we have.
74

74

00:04:00,369  -->  00:04:03,965
Now what's missing here, you probably already noticed,
75

75

00:04:03,965  -->  00:04:06,699
is to actually make this a grid container.
76

76

00:04:06,699  -->  00:04:08,521
So display, grid,
77

77

00:04:08,521  -->  00:04:11,175
and now you will see this making effect,
78

78

00:04:11,175  -->  00:04:13,711
and yeah, you already have now
79

79

00:04:13,711  -->  00:04:16,980
or four column tracks and or
80

80

00:04:16,980  -->  00:04:18,980
four row tracks as well.
81

81

00:04:19,850  -->  00:04:23,451
Let's just give them some gap so we can see it.
82

82

00:04:23,451  -->  00:04:26,618
So grid gap 30 pixels.
83

83

00:04:28,262  -->  00:04:32,126
Okay, so you'll see our seven
84

84

00:04:32,126  -->  00:04:35,343
grid items here, but we don't see the rest of the
85

85

00:04:35,343  -->  00:04:37,411
of the rows and the column tracks, right.
86

86

00:04:37,411  -->  00:04:42,109
So let's just inspect this here, such as we did before,
87

87

00:04:42,109  -->  00:04:44,642
and so this is the layout tab here
88

88

00:04:44,642  -->  00:04:46,686
and so we can now select here
89

89

00:04:46,686  -->  00:04:48,646
the challenge grid container,
90

90

00:04:48,646  -->  00:04:51,588
which is the one here that we're working on.
91

91

00:04:51,588  -->  00:04:52,964
So you see it down here
92

92

00:04:52,964  -->  00:04:55,466
is a presentation of the grid that we have
93

93

00:04:55,466  -->  00:04:59,038
and so here, remember the rows are 100, 200, 400, and 100
94

94

00:04:59,038  -->  00:05:00,310
and that's what we can see here.
95

95

00:05:00,310  -->  00:05:01,967
So this is the 100 row,
96

96

00:05:01,967  -->  00:05:05,818
200, 400, which is much bigger and then 100,
97

97

00:05:05,818  -->  00:05:08,038
and you see that they are down here.
98

98

00:05:08,038  -->  00:05:10,668
So we see these empty grid cells,
99

99

00:05:10,668  -->  00:05:14,805
which were actually created with our grid track declaration.
100

100

00:05:14,805  -->  00:05:16,696
We just don't have enough grid items
101

101

00:05:16,696  -->  00:05:20,329
to fill all of these cells up, but don't worry
102

102

00:05:20,329  -->  00:05:23,222
we're going to care about that right now, okay.
103

103

00:05:23,222  -->  00:05:26,539
So let's start by positioning all our grid items
104

104

00:05:26,539  -->  00:05:29,694
exactly in the cells that we want them to be.
105

105

00:05:29,694  -->  00:05:31,404
So the first thing to do
106

106

00:05:31,404  -->  00:05:34,413
is to make the header span all the way from
107

107

00:05:34,413  -->  00:05:38,442
the first column line to the last one, right.
108

108

00:05:38,442  -->  00:05:41,859
So how do we do that?
109

109

00:05:43,861  -->  00:05:46,253
Well let's just select the header
110

110

00:05:46,253  -->  00:05:49,935
and then we can use grid column.
111

111

00:05:49,935  -->  00:05:51,919
So we start with number one
112

112

00:05:51,919  -->  00:05:53,947
and then remember the trick that we have
113

113

00:05:53,947  -->  00:05:55,997
to go all the way to the end of the grid.
114

114

00:05:55,997  -->  00:06:00,296
So we could just write span over four columns, right,
115

115

00:06:00,296  -->  00:06:02,180
but I prefer to do it like this
116

116

00:06:02,180  -->  00:06:04,199
as I showed you in the last lecture.
117

117

00:06:04,199  -->  00:06:05,874
So from one to minus one
118

118

00:06:05,874  -->  00:06:07,411
and so now we have the header
119

119

00:06:07,411  -->  00:06:09,690
going across the entire grid
120

120

00:06:09,690  -->  00:06:12,252
from left to right, okay.
121

121

00:06:12,252  -->  00:06:14,067
So that part is already done
122

122

00:06:14,067  -->  00:06:16,461
and notice that we don't actually have to declare
123

123

00:06:16,461  -->  00:06:18,434
the grid row property here,
124

124

00:06:18,434  -->  00:06:21,169
because the automatic placement algorithm takes care
125

125

00:06:21,169  -->  00:06:23,458
of putting the header right in the first line,
126

126

00:06:23,458  -->  00:06:25,654
because it's actually the first element here
127

127

00:06:25,654  -->  00:06:26,960
in the markup as well.
128

128

00:06:26,960  -->  00:06:28,593
So that's automatically placed here
129

129

00:06:28,593  -->  00:06:30,413
and we don't have to declare it.
130

130

00:06:30,413  -->  00:06:32,939
The same actually applies to our small boxes here.
131

131

00:06:32,939  -->  00:06:35,321
They're also already exactly where they should be
132

132

00:06:35,321  -->  00:06:36,931
so we don't have to do anything,
133

133

00:06:36,931  -->  00:06:38,820
because automatic placement again
134

134

00:06:38,820  -->  00:06:43,337
puts them where we want them to be, okay.
135

135

00:06:43,337  -->  00:06:45,926
So the next thing that we have then to worry about
136

136

00:06:45,926  -->  00:06:47,762
is just the sidebar.
137

137

00:06:47,762  -->  00:06:50,890
So the sidebar should be here in this cell,
138

138

00:06:50,890  -->  00:06:52,386
but not only this cell.
139

139

00:06:52,386  -->  00:06:54,718
So remember that it actually spans across
140

140

00:06:54,718  -->  00:06:57,289
these two cells here, right.
141

141

00:06:57,289  -->  00:07:00,137
So the sidebar should be starting here
142

142

00:07:00,137  -->  00:07:02,360
and then go across these two cells
143

143

00:07:02,360  -->  00:07:04,397
with the main content then occupying
144

144

00:07:04,397  -->  00:07:06,122
this entire space here
145

145

00:07:06,122  -->  00:07:08,984
on this left side, okay.
146

146

00:07:08,984  -->  00:07:11,056
So let's code that up very quick
147

147

00:07:11,056  -->  00:07:13,853
and I'm not really sure why this grid
148

148

00:07:13,853  -->  00:07:17,458
overlay is actually overlaying here this entire
149

149

00:07:17,458  -->  00:07:19,741
CodePen editor I'm sure that's not
150

150

00:07:19,741  -->  00:07:21,480
that's not really correct,
151

151

00:07:21,480  -->  00:07:25,223
but it's probably just a bug in Firefox right now,
152

152

00:07:25,223  -->  00:07:27,140
so it's not a big deal.
153

153

00:07:28,402  -->  00:07:31,985
All right, so let's worry about the sidebar
154

154

00:07:32,827  -->  00:07:35,183
and that's actually not correct.
155

155

00:07:35,183  -->  00:07:37,016
So sidebar,
156

156

00:07:38,748  -->  00:07:40,842
so grid column, where is it?
157

157

00:07:40,842  -->  00:07:44,592
It starts as you can see here on number four,
158

158

00:07:45,429  -->  00:07:48,247
so four to five,
159

159

00:07:48,247  -->  00:07:51,565
and we could have used minus one here again
160

160

00:07:51,565  -->  00:07:53,059
to all the way to the end,
161

161

00:07:53,059  -->  00:07:54,815
but in this case it's
162

162

00:07:54,815  -->  00:07:57,371
I guess it's not really necessary.
163

163

00:07:57,371  -->  00:08:00,286
So you have to the sidebar right here now,
164

164

00:08:00,286  -->  00:08:02,193
but it's not yet exactly where we want it.
165

165

00:08:02,193  -->  00:08:04,268
We want it to be here
166

166

00:08:04,268  -->  00:08:07,268
beginning on line number two, right.
167

167

00:08:08,269  -->  00:08:12,250
So grid, row, it should go from two
168

168

00:08:12,250  -->  00:08:14,988
and then span across two cells.
169

169

00:08:14,988  -->  00:08:17,988
So span two and that's it.
170

170

00:08:19,947  -->  00:08:22,130
You see, so now it starts here
171

171

00:08:22,130  -->  00:08:24,350
at the top and goes down here,
172

172

00:08:24,350  -->  00:08:26,123
and this is actually all a bit
173

173

00:08:26,123  -->  00:08:28,880
to big so I have to do all the scrolling up and down.
174

174

00:08:28,880  -->  00:08:31,106
Let me just zoom out a bit.
175

175

00:08:31,106  -->  00:08:34,210
I was in actually the code also
176

176

00:08:34,210  -->  00:08:35,987
becomes to small to see probably,
177

177

00:08:35,987  -->  00:08:39,357
but just to get a big overview here of our entire grid.
178

178

00:08:39,357  -->  00:08:41,371
You can see that it's already taking shape
179

179

00:08:41,371  -->  00:08:44,400
and becoming more like we want in the end.
180

180

00:08:44,400  -->  00:08:45,992
So next what we have to do
181

181

00:08:45,992  -->  00:08:47,884
is to just make this main content here
182

182

00:08:47,884  -->  00:08:49,922
span these three cells
183

183

00:08:49,922  -->  00:08:51,671
and then in the end finally
184

184

00:08:51,671  -->  00:08:53,443
out the footer down here,
185

185

00:08:53,443  -->  00:08:55,910
which also shouldn't be all too hard.
186

186

00:08:55,910  -->  00:08:59,249
Putting it back to its original size
187

187

00:08:59,249  -->  00:09:01,749
and then let's move on.
188

188

00:09:05,380  -->  00:09:08,944
So main content and now all we have to do here
189

189

00:09:08,944  -->  00:09:11,540
is to define the column,
190

190

00:09:11,540  -->  00:09:14,086
because the row is actually already correct, right.
191

191

00:09:14,086  -->  00:09:16,787
So we can see that it is already in a correct row
192

192

00:09:16,787  -->  00:09:18,715
and so all we have to do is to
193

193

00:09:18,715  -->  00:09:20,803
manipulate the position in the column.
194

194

00:09:20,803  -->  00:09:23,426
So it's going to start at number one
195

195

00:09:23,426  -->  00:09:26,109
and then I could write once more that it goes to
196

196

00:09:26,109  -->  00:09:27,832
all the way until number four,
197

197

00:09:27,832  -->  00:09:29,692
but I think it's more intuitive
198

198

00:09:29,692  -->  00:09:31,483
to simply say that it spans
199

199

00:09:31,483  -->  00:09:35,498
across three tracks or three cells.
200

200

00:09:35,498  -->  00:09:39,222
Okay, and so yeah, that's already looking good.
201

201

00:09:39,222  -->  00:09:41,144
So the main content is now
202

202

00:09:41,144  -->  00:09:42,978
exactly in a place where it should be
203

203

00:09:42,978  -->  00:09:44,661
and now all that's left to do
204

204

00:09:44,661  -->  00:09:47,744
is to also position the footer,
205

205

00:09:49,696  -->  00:09:52,963
and nothings easier than that.
206

206

00:09:52,963  -->  00:09:55,822
Grid, column, and it's just like the header,
207

207

00:09:55,822  -->  00:09:59,798
so one all the way to minus one
208

208

00:09:59,798  -->  00:10:02,623
and yeah that's it.
209

209

00:10:02,623  -->  00:10:03,994
So that's all we have to do.
210

210

00:10:03,994  -->  00:10:06,427
It's as simple as this, you see.
211

211

00:10:06,427  -->  00:10:08,985
Just a couple of lines of CSS
212

212

00:10:08,985  -->  00:10:10,496
to build this great layout
213

213

00:10:10,496  -->  00:10:12,083
that would have been so complex to build
214

214

00:10:12,083  -->  00:10:13,966
with the old school float layouts
215

215

00:10:13,966  -->  00:10:17,939
like we've been doing for way too long actually.
216

216

00:10:17,939  -->  00:10:20,216
So let me zoom out here again
217

217

00:10:20,216  -->  00:10:23,866
to see it in it's full glory, right.
218

218

00:10:23,866  -->  00:10:27,127
So yeah, so that's the final result
219

219

00:10:27,127  -->  00:10:28,815
and I really hope that you achieved
220

220

00:10:28,815  -->  00:10:31,593
to do it by yourself, but again if you did not
221

221

00:10:31,593  -->  00:10:33,880
don't worry about it, it's no problem.
222

222

00:10:33,880  -->  00:10:36,584
Now remember that I said in one of the earlier lectures
223

223

00:10:36,584  -->  00:10:38,064
that there are multiple ways
224

224

00:10:38,064  -->  00:10:40,742
of positioning grid items in the grid.
225

225

00:10:40,742  -->  00:10:43,964
So I want to use this example to demonstrate to you
226

226

00:10:43,964  -->  00:10:47,093
the different ways of doing exactly that.
227

227

00:10:47,093  -->  00:10:49,327
So there are basically two more ways
228

228

00:10:49,327  -->  00:10:50,904
that I want to show you,
229

229

00:10:50,904  -->  00:10:53,099
and this example is actually it's really perfect
230

230

00:10:53,099  -->  00:10:54,264
for that, okay.
231

231

00:10:54,264  -->  00:10:56,146
So in the two next videos
232

232

00:10:56,146  -->  00:10:58,394
I'm going to show you two different ways
233

233

00:10:58,394  -->  00:11:01,751
that you can also use to position grid items on the grid.
234

234

00:11:01,751  -->  00:11:03,668
So stay tuned for that.
