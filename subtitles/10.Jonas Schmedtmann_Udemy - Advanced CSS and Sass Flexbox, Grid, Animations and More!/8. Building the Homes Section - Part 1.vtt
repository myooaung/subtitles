<v Jonas>Hello there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.473  -->  00:00:05.083
It's great to see that you're still with me here
3

3

00:00:05.083  -->  00:00:06.584
building this project,
4

4

00:00:06.584  -->  00:00:08.516
and so in this lecture, and the next one
5

5

00:00:08.516  -->  00:00:11.189
we will build a section which contains
6

6

00:00:11.189  -->  00:00:13.860
the available homes on the website.
7

7

00:00:13.860  -->  00:00:16.533
And, I'm actually really excited for this one
8

8

00:00:16.533  -->  00:00:18.827
because now, you're gonna learn how to build
9

9

00:00:18.827  -->  00:00:22.169
a rather complex component using a mix of
10

10

00:00:22.169  -->  00:00:26.086
CSS grid properties, overlapping and flags box.
11

11

00:00:26.985  -->  00:00:29.484
So basically, what we're gonna do here in this section
12

12

00:00:29.484  -->  00:00:32.279
is to lay out these cards here, okay?
13

13

00:00:32.279  -->  00:00:35.611
So each of these homes gets its own card,
14

14

00:00:35.611  -->  00:00:37.826
and I actually love to design these cards,
15

15

00:00:37.826  -->  00:00:40.438
so we had a card in the Naders project,
16

16

00:00:40.438  -->  00:00:41.867
if you remember that one,
17

17

00:00:41.867  -->  00:00:43.635
and now we have these cards here,
18

18

00:00:43.635  -->  00:00:45.720
so one card for each home,
19

19

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:48.463
and of course, all of this here, all of these elements
20

20

00:00:48.463  -->  00:00:51.612
they are laid out using CSS grid
21

21

00:00:51.612  -->  00:00:54.191
and also the six cards that we have here,
22

22

00:00:54.191  -->  00:00:57.736
they are also laid out in a grid, okay?
23

23

00:00:57.736  -->  00:01:00.723
So, let's actually start with that overall grid
24

24

00:01:00.723  -->  00:01:03.498
which is a 3x2 grid, such as we had before
25

25

00:01:03.498  -->  00:01:05.874
in the 'features' section, and then after that
26

26

00:01:05.874  -->  00:01:08.504
we will start building, so
27

27

00:01:08.504  -->  00:01:10.710
let's go to our markup here, of course
28

28

00:01:10.710  -->  00:01:13.293
and create six 'home' elements.
29

29

00:01:14.568  -->  00:01:18.254
So, 'home', and I'm once more going to use 'emit', here
30

30

00:01:18.254  -->  00:01:20.611
which I showed you in the 'features' section
31

31

00:01:20.611  -->  00:01:24.025
and so, I use the curly brackets to add some content
32

32

00:01:24.025  -->  00:01:26.358
into each of these elements.
33

33

00:01:27.343  -->  00:01:30.262
So, let's just say 'home card' and then
34

34

00:01:30.262  -->  00:01:34.334
the number of the element x 6, because you want six,
35

35

00:01:34.334  -->  00:01:36.224
hit 'tab', and that's it.
36

36

00:01:36.224  -->  00:01:40.550
And so now we can open up our file here, so the 'homes' file
37

37

00:01:40.550  -->  00:01:43.030
and start building our grid.
38

38

00:01:43.030  -->  00:01:45.773
So, of course, our grid container here is this
39

39

00:01:45.773  -->  00:01:48.263
'homes' element, which is the parent of
40

40

00:01:48.263  -->  00:01:51.013
our six 'home' grid items.
41

41

00:01:51.013  -->  00:01:54.263
So, let's define our grid columns here,
42

42

00:01:56.898  -->  00:01:59.000
and let's do that the exact same way that we did
43

43

00:01:59.000  -->  00:02:01.296
in the 'features' section, okay?
44

44

00:02:01.296  -->  00:02:04.768
So, we're going to use 'repeat', and we say that we want
45

45

00:02:04.768  -->  00:02:08.682
as many columns as fit into the grid container.
46

46

00:02:08.682  -->  00:02:12.849
And for that, remember, we can use the 'auto-fit' key word.
47

47

00:02:14.349  -->  00:02:15.245
Okay?
48

48

00:02:15.245  -->  00:02:17.906
And then, we say that we want each of these columns
49

49

00:02:17.906  -->  00:02:20.953
to have at least 25 'rem', and that it can go
50

50

00:02:20.953  -->  00:02:23.697
all the way to one fractional unit.
51

51

00:02:23.697  -->  00:02:27.485
So, we do that with 'minmax', as we did
52

52

00:02:27.485  -->  00:02:30.543
many times before, and we set the minimum
53

53

00:02:30.543  -->  00:02:33.043
to '25rem', meaning 250 pixels
54

54

00:02:35.155  -->  00:02:37.634
and going all the way to one fractional unit
55

55

00:02:37.634  -->  00:02:40.409
if there is enough space available for that.
56

56

00:02:40.409  -->  00:02:43.341
So, again, this is what we did with the 'features' section
57

57

00:02:43.341  -->  00:02:45.375
and this will ensure, that basically,
58

58

00:02:45.375  -->  00:02:47.832
these columns are completely responsive,
59

59

00:02:47.832  -->  00:02:51.877
without having to write a media query at all.
60

60

00:02:51.877  -->  00:02:53.981
Now, let's also define the gap
61

61

00:02:53.981  -->  00:02:56.001
between the rows and the columns
62

62

00:02:56.001  -->  00:02:58.584
at the same time, of 70 pixels.
63

63

00:03:02.177  -->  00:03:04.631
And then just for 'home', let's define a quick
64

64

00:03:04.631  -->  00:03:06.459
background color here, just so that we can see
65

65

00:03:06.459  -->  00:03:09.209
if our grid is working correctly.
66

66

00:03:10.816  -->  00:03:12.654
So, background color, and I'm gonna use
67

67

00:03:12.654  -->  00:03:14.904
'color-grey-light-1', okay?
68

68

00:03:16.028  -->  00:03:17.492
So, this one here,
69

69

00:03:17.492  -->  00:03:20.995
and that's actually the real background color
70

70

00:03:20.995  -->  00:03:22.638
that these cards will have, so
71

71

00:03:22.638  -->  00:03:24.721
let's check that out now.
72

72

00:03:26.103  -->  00:03:29.285
And for some reason, that's not quite working yet
73

73

00:03:29.285  -->  00:03:31.885
and, um, yeah, that's because I keep forgetting
74

74

00:03:31.885  -->  00:03:35.412
to set the 'display' property to 'grid'.
75

75

00:03:35.412  -->  00:03:37.818
So, 'display: grid'.
76

76

00:03:37.818  -->  00:03:40.337
And also, let's add some margin here,
77

77

00:03:40.337  -->  00:03:42.482
such as in the 'features' section.
78

78

00:03:42.482  -->  00:03:46.649
So, '15rem', top and bottom, and zero on these sides.
79

79

00:03:47.910  -->  00:03:50.592
Okay, and so now, that should look better.
80

80

00:03:50.592  -->  00:03:51.821
And, yeah.
81

81

00:03:51.821  -->  00:03:54.299
Now, what's this weird background color?
82

82

00:03:54.299  -->  00:03:57.926
Now, I think that's, yeah, we left that here.
83

83

00:03:57.926  -->  00:04:00.973
So, of course we need to get rid of that.
84

84

00:04:00.973  -->  00:04:02.943
And, alright, so here we have
85

85

00:04:02.943  -->  00:04:05.808
our six 'home' cards, basically.
86

86

00:04:05.808  -->  00:04:07.772
Now, all we have to do is to fill them
87

87

00:04:07.772  -->  00:04:09.498
and then, of course, style them
88

88

00:04:09.498  -->  00:04:11.794
which is gonna be the toughest part.
89

89

00:04:11.794  -->  00:04:15.961
So, let's start with the content in the HTML, okay?
90

90

00:04:18.216  -->  00:04:20.886
So, we don't want any of this,
91

91

00:04:20.886  -->  00:04:22.747
let's give it some space here, and so
92

92

00:04:22.747  -->  00:04:26.282
what do we actually have in each of these home cards?
93

93

00:04:26.282  -->  00:04:29.187
Well, let's actually go back and check it out
94

94

00:04:29.187  -->  00:04:31.463
that's the easiest way.
95

95

00:04:31.463  -->  00:04:34.580
So, we have the image here, which shows the home
96

96

00:04:34.580  -->  00:04:37.912
then we have, like, this 'heart' button here
97

97

00:04:37.912  -->  00:04:41.508
which is basically so that the user can click this,
98

98

00:04:41.508  -->  00:04:43.572
and then put it on the wish list.
99

99

00:04:43.572  -->  00:04:46.274
So, saying that he likes, this property,
100

100

00:04:46.274  -->  00:04:49.085
then we have, of course, the name of the property,
101

101

00:04:49.085  -->  00:04:52.416
the location, how many rooms it has, the area,
102

102

00:04:52.416  -->  00:04:56.096
the price, and then down here we have this button
103

103

00:04:56.096  -->  00:04:59.298
where we can then click and contact a realtor.
104

104

00:04:59.298  -->  00:05:03.178
Okay, so, again, image, then this 'heart' icon here,
105

105

00:05:03.178  -->  00:05:05.727
then we have he name of the house,
106

106

00:05:05.727  -->  00:05:10.594
then these four details, and then finally, a button.
107

107

00:05:10.594  -->  00:05:14.190
So, let's put all of that here into our component.
108

108

00:05:14.190  -->  00:05:16.507
So, the image, and I'm gonna call it
109

109

00:05:16.507  -->  00:05:19.424
the 'home__img', very simple, okay?
110

110

00:05:20.871  -->  00:05:25.039
So, source, it's an image folder and 'home',
111

111

00:05:25.039  -->  00:05:28.206
or, actually, it's 'house', I believe.
112

112

00:05:29.636  -->  00:05:31.219
So, 'house-1.jpeg',
113

113

00:05:33.789  -->  00:05:36.188
and let's just call it 'House 1'.
114

114

00:05:36.188  -->  00:05:39.349
Next up, we have the 'heart' icon,
115

115

00:05:39.349  -->  00:05:42.211
and let's actually copy this, the syntax, here
116

116

00:05:42.211  -->  00:05:45.656
for the 'svg', because it's rather difficult
117

117

00:05:45.656  -->  00:05:49.192
to write it all out, so, this one is called
118

118

00:05:49.192  -->  00:05:50.275
'home__like',
119

119

00:05:51.350  -->  00:05:54.767
and the name of the icon is 'heart-full'.
120

120

00:05:56.310  -->  00:05:59.175
And so, that is the 'like' icon.
121

121

00:05:59.175  -->  00:06:01.714
Next up, we have the name of the home
122

122

00:06:01.714  -->  00:06:04.385
and for that, I'm going to use an 'h5' element
123

123

00:06:04.385  -->  00:06:06.053
but this time, not a re-usable one, because
124

124

00:06:06.053  -->  00:06:09.376
we want this one only to be in here
125

125

00:06:09.376  -->  00:06:12.626
and so, this is called the 'home__name'
126

126

00:06:15.126  -->  00:06:17.959
and it's a beautiful family house.
127

127

00:06:20.762  -->  00:06:23.952
Next up, we have these four details about the property
128

128

00:06:23.952  -->  00:06:27.296
so, the location, rooms, area and price.
129

129

00:06:27.296  -->  00:06:30.689
And so, each of these will be one element
130

130

00:06:30.689  -->  00:06:33.689
so, a 'diff' called 'home__location'
131

131

00:06:36.354  -->  00:06:38.896
and then, in here we will have an icon
132

132

00:06:38.896  -->  00:06:41.313
and a paragraph for the text.
133

133

00:06:42.907  -->  00:06:46.407
Okay, so, this one is called the 'map-pin'
134

134

00:06:51.217  -->  00:06:55.353
and then, for the text, let's just say it's in the USA
135

135

00:06:55.353  -->  00:06:58.317
and I'm actually not going to give these ones here
136

136

00:06:58.317  -->  00:07:00.438
a class name, because I would have to call this,
137

137

00:07:00.438  -->  00:07:04.301
like, 'home__location-icon' and then 'home__location-text'
138

138

00:07:04.301  -->  00:07:06.892
or something, and I don't think that's necessary.
139

139

00:07:06.892  -->  00:07:09.300
So, let's just keep it here at 'home__location'
140

140

00:07:09.300  -->  00:07:11.938
and then we know that we can style the 'svg' in there
141

141

00:07:11.938  -->  00:07:15.363
and the 'p' element in there separately, okay?
142

142

00:07:15.363  -->  00:07:18.657
So, let's check that out at this point.
143

143

00:07:18.657  -->  00:07:21.957
And so, of course, the image here is huge,
144

144

00:07:21.957  -->  00:07:25.829
and all of this looks rather strange, but, yeah
145

145

00:07:25.829  -->  00:07:29.739
that's because we didn't format anything at all.
146

146

00:07:29.739  -->  00:07:32.676
So, this will actually be quite similar for the other ones
147

147

00:07:32.676  -->  00:07:36.150
so I'm just gonna copy this a couple of times,
148

148

00:07:36.150  -->  00:07:39.000
and so, the first one was '__location',
149

149

00:07:39.000  -->  00:07:42.404
then the second one is the '__rooms',
150

150

00:07:42.404  -->  00:07:45.716
then this one will be '__area',
151

151

00:07:45.716  -->  00:07:49.249
and the last one is the '__price'.
152

152

00:07:49.249  -->  00:07:51.368
So for the '__rooms', we have this icon
153

153

00:07:51.368  -->  00:07:53.118
called 'profile-male'
154

154

00:07:56.824  -->  00:07:58.157
saying '5 rooms'
155

155

00:07:59.117  -->  00:08:02.784
then we have 'icon expand' here for the area
156

156

00:08:06.747  -->  00:08:09.699
and 325 square meters, so let's now use
157

157

00:08:09.699  -->  00:08:11.718
the 'sub' element here,
158

158

00:08:11.718  -->  00:08:13.803
I'm not sure if you're familiar with this one,
159

159

00:08:13.803  -->  00:08:15.783
but basically, what it does is that
160

160

00:08:15.783  -->  00:08:18.200
it moves the text a bit up, and so in this case,
161

161

00:08:18.200  -->  00:08:21.991
because we have square meters, the two should be a bit
162

162

00:08:21.991  -->  00:08:25.515
on top of the two, of the 'm', actually
163

163

00:08:25.515  -->  00:08:28.948
so, just like this, so, square meters.
164

164

00:08:28.948  -->  00:08:31.265
Maybe in the US, you're gonna use square feet,
165

165

00:08:31.265  -->  00:08:33.674
or something like that, I'm not really sure,
166

166

00:08:33.674  -->  00:08:37.785
but here in Europe, we use, of course, square meters.
167

167

00:08:37.785  -->  00:08:41.667
Then, for the price, we have the 'key' icon
168

168

00:08:41.667  -->  00:08:43.902
and let's say that this one costs
169

169

00:08:43.902  -->  00:08:46.320
one point two million dollars.
170

170

00:08:46.320  -->  00:08:49.100
So, quite an expensive home, but again,
171

171

00:08:49.100  -->  00:08:51.147
we're talking about luxury homes here,
172

172

00:08:51.147  -->  00:08:55.402
so that's reasonable, okay, looks good to me.
173

173

00:08:55.402  -->  00:08:58.319
Now, all that's left is the button.
174

174

00:09:01.446  -->  00:09:03.053
So, 'button', and now we're gonna re-use
175

175

00:09:03.053  -->  00:09:05.357
the one that we created before, which is called,
176

176

00:09:05.357  -->  00:09:06.524
simply, 'cta',
177

177

00:09:08.989  -->  00:09:11.419
and 'Contact realtor'.
178

178

00:09:11.419  -->  00:09:14.629
Okay, and that's it, and let's now just confirm
179

179

00:09:14.629  -->  00:09:16.462
if everything is okay,
180

180

00:09:18.072  -->  00:09:18.905
and it is.
181

181

00:09:18.905  -->  00:09:21.445
Okay, and so we're now ready to do the same thing here
182

182

00:09:21.445  -->  00:09:23.764
for all the other five homes,
183

183

00:09:23.764  -->  00:09:26.060
and if you find it a bit boring to watch me
184

184

00:09:26.060  -->  00:09:27.795
creating this HTML structure here,
185

185

00:09:27.795  -->  00:09:30.021
then you can just use the final code
186

186

00:09:30.021  -->  00:09:33.484
and skip this part until the end of the video, okay?
187

187

00:09:33.484  -->  00:09:36.361
So, then you don't have to waste time doing all of this.
188

188

00:09:36.361  -->  00:09:39.864
But, anyway, I will do it here, now, in the video
189

189

00:09:39.864  -->  00:09:42.944
and so, if you want to join me doing that,
190

190

00:09:42.944  -->  00:09:45.747
then, of course, you're more than welcome.
191

191

00:09:45.747  -->  00:09:47.914
So, let's get rid of this,
192

192

00:09:49.723  -->  00:09:52.306
and three, four, five, and six.
193

193

00:09:54.786  -->  00:09:57.369
So, that is a lot of code here.
194

194

00:09:59.663  -->  00:10:01.256
Where does it even start?
195

195

00:10:01.256  -->  00:10:04.379
Okay, there, so this is the first one,
196

196

00:10:04.379  -->  00:10:06.338
this is the second one.
197

197

00:10:06.338  -->  00:10:08.750
So, this is simply house number two,
198

198

00:10:08.750  -->  00:10:12.465
it is called the 'Modern Glass Villa',
199

199

00:10:12.465  -->  00:10:14.548
so, 'Modern Glass Villa'.
200

200

00:10:15.623  -->  00:10:17.970
And, if you're wondering how I selected
201

201

00:10:17.970  -->  00:10:19.509
all of this text here, at the same time,
202

202

00:10:19.509  -->  00:10:21.596
I simply used this shortcut here
203

203

00:10:21.596  -->  00:10:24.833
for 'Expand Selection', okay?
204

204

00:10:24.833  -->  00:10:27.239
So, on your computer, maybe this is a different shortcut
205

205

00:10:27.239  -->  00:10:29.108
but, I used this one here, okay?
206

206

00:10:29.108  -->  00:10:32.613
So, basically, with that we can select all of the text
207

207

00:10:32.613  -->  00:10:36.780
that is inside of two tags, like this one here, okay?
208

208

00:10:39.255  -->  00:10:42.338
So, we have 'Canada' here, '6 rooms',
209

209

00:10:43.672  -->  00:10:44.505
'450 m',
210

210

00:10:46.584  -->  00:10:48.001
and '$2,750,000',
211

211

00:10:52.018  -->  00:10:53.601
okay, so, next one.
212

212

00:10:58.642  -->  00:11:00.975
It's a 'Cozy Country House'.
213

213

00:11:06.922  -->  00:11:09.839
It's in the 'UK', it has '4 rooms',
214

214

00:11:14.063  -->  00:11:17.230
'250 m', and it costs only '$850,000'.
215

215

00:11:22.485  -->  00:11:25.371
I think I forgot the image, here.
216

216

00:11:25.371  -->  00:11:26.954
Yeah, that's right.
217

217

00:11:28.001  -->  00:11:28.834
So, two.
218

218

00:11:31.302  -->  00:11:34.918
This one is number three, or, actually
219

219

00:11:34.918  -->  00:11:38.210
this one should be number four already.
220

220

00:11:38.210  -->  00:11:42.127
So, number two, yep, that's number three, here.
221

221

00:11:46.487  -->  00:11:50.154
And so, this one is the 'Large Rustic Villa'
222

222

00:11:56.222  -->  00:11:57.972
located in 'Portugal'
223

223

00:12:02.351  -->  00:12:04.351
with '6 rooms', '480 m',
224

224

00:12:06.580  -->  00:12:07.997
and '$1,950,000'.
225

225

00:12:14.564  -->  00:12:15.564
Number five,
226

226

00:12:18.191  -->  00:12:20.691
it's a 'Majestic Palace House'
227

227

00:12:24.855  -->  00:12:28.120
in 'Germany, with a mind-blowing
228

228

00:12:28.120  -->  00:12:29.037
'18 rooms',
229

229

00:12:30.041  -->  00:12:31.208
and '4,230 m',
230

230

00:12:35.018  -->  00:12:35.851
so of course,
231

231

00:12:35.851  -->  00:12:38.370
I came up with all of this here arbitrarily,
232

232

00:12:38.370  -->  00:12:41.194
so none of this is real at all.
233

233

00:12:41.194  -->  00:12:43.380
So, if you're a realtor by chance,
234

234

00:12:43.380  -->  00:12:45.798
and none of this makes any sense to you,
235

235

00:12:45.798  -->  00:12:47.798
then I'm sorry for that.
236

236

00:12:50.012  -->  00:12:52.978
I just wanted to come up with some project, here,
237

237

00:12:52.978  -->  00:12:56.145
and so I made up all of these numbers.
238

238

00:12:57.915  -->  00:13:02.082
So, a 'Modern Family Apartment', this one is in 'Italy',
239

239

00:13:04.650  -->  00:13:07.067
with only '3 rooms', '180 m',
240

240

00:13:08.714  -->  00:13:09.964
and '$600,000'.
241

241

00:13:13.678  -->  00:13:15.886
Okay, and so that's it.
242

242

00:13:15.886  -->  00:13:19.368
So that's our content in the HTML,
243

243

00:13:19.368  -->  00:13:21.351
it looks all kind of weird now,
244

244

00:13:21.351  -->  00:13:24.000
and that's because these images are way too big,
245

245

00:13:24.000  -->  00:13:27.579
such as the icons, so let's just very quickly fix that
246

246

00:13:27.579  -->  00:13:30.562
so in order that it doesn't look that bad.
247

247

00:13:30.562  -->  00:13:34.229
So, let's close this one here, and this one.
248

248

00:13:37.625  -->  00:13:41.792
And so let's here now add the selectors for the image,
249

249

00:13:45.312  -->  00:13:48.409
and let's say, with 100%,
250

250

00:13:48.409  -->  00:13:50.434
and so that should make it better.
251

251

00:13:50.434  -->  00:13:54.601
Then, we can also add all the other selectors here.
252

252

00:13:55.598  -->  00:13:57.681
So, the one for '__like',
253

253

00:14:00.130  -->  00:14:01.547
for the '__name',
254

254

00:14:03.646  -->  00:14:06.406
and then the ones for the '__location', '__rooms',
255

255

00:14:06.406  -->  00:14:10.237
'__area' and '__price', they will actually be all the same.
256

256

00:14:10.237  -->  00:14:14.404
Okay, and so let's add them all into one bigger selector.
257

257

00:14:15.611  -->  00:14:17.028
So, '__location',
258

258

00:14:20.462  -->  00:14:21.629
the '__rooms',
259

259

00:14:23.055  -->  00:14:24.138
the '__area',
260

260

00:14:27.678  -->  00:14:28.846
and the '__price'.
261

261

00:14:28.846  -->  00:14:30.529
And then remember, that in there we have
262

262

00:14:30.529  -->  00:14:33.437
the 'svg' and the 'p', right?
263

263

00:14:33.437  -->  00:14:36.780
So, in each of them, we have the icon,
264

264

00:14:36.780  -->  00:14:39.363
and then the 'p' element, okay?
265

265

00:14:41.136  -->  00:14:43.386
So, let's add that as well,
266

266

00:14:45.527  -->  00:14:47.699
So, of course, as a nested element here,
267

267

00:14:47.699  -->  00:14:51.424
because it's inside of these selectors,
268

268

00:14:51.424  -->  00:14:53.036
and the same for the 'p'.
269

269

00:14:53.036  -->  00:14:56.368
So, let's also now style these 'svg's,
270

270

00:14:56.368  -->  00:15:00.399
because these icons are way too big now.
271

271

00:15:00.399  -->  00:15:03.390
So, first we can also fill them,
272

272

00:15:03.390  -->  00:15:06.007
so change their color basically,
273

273

00:15:06.007  -->  00:15:09.674
and again, I'm going to use 'color-primary',
274

274

00:15:13.601  -->  00:15:17.994
and then a 'height' and a 'width' of '2rem',
275

275

00:15:17.994  -->  00:15:19.769
and again, the 'height' and the 'width'
276

276

00:15:19.769  -->  00:15:22.410
here being the exact same value.
277

277

00:15:22.410  -->  00:15:24.347
Okay, and so just like this,
278

278

00:15:24.347  -->  00:15:26.896
this looks a bit more friendly now.
279

279

00:15:26.896  -->  00:15:28.705
So that is the first part
280

280

00:15:28.705  -->  00:15:31.462
of building this section and its own cards.
281

281

00:15:31.462  -->  00:15:34.069
In the next section, we're then gonna take care
282

282

00:15:34.069  -->  00:15:36.976
of actually building the cards and laying out
283

283

00:15:36.976  -->  00:15:38.625
all of these elements.
284

284

00:15:38.625  -->  00:15:42.792
So, if you're ready for that, then let's move on together.
