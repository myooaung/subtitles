00:00:02,245  -->  00:00:04,961
<v Jonas>Are you excited to learn something new right now?</v>
2

2

00:00:04,961  -->  00:00:06,504
Then you're in the right place,
3

3

00:00:06,504  -->  00:00:08,790
because we're gonna start using SASS variables
4

4

00:00:08,790  -->  00:00:10,623
and nesting right now.
5

5

00:00:11,778  -->  00:00:14,004
Once more we're gonna use CodePen here
6

6

00:00:14,004  -->  00:00:17,736
instead of starting to write SASS right in our code editor.
7

7

00:00:17,736  -->  00:00:19,677
That's because if we wanted to use SASS
8

8

00:00:19,677  -->  00:00:21,299
on our local computer right now,
9

9

00:00:21,299  -->  00:00:24,328
then we would first have to install and configure it
10

10

00:00:24,328  -->  00:00:26,706
and then compile the SASS code to CSS.
11

11

00:00:26,706  -->  00:00:28,900
But right now all we really wanna do
12

12

00:00:28,900  -->  00:00:31,585
is to just learn SASS and start using it,
13

13

00:00:31,585  -->  00:00:34,841
and not having to worry about all the configuration stuff.
14

14

00:00:34,841  -->  00:00:38,106
And CodePen allows us to do exactly that.
15

15

00:00:38,106  -->  00:00:41,028
In order to follow along with this lecture and the next one,
16

16

00:00:41,028  -->  00:00:43,653
just come here to codepen.io
17

17

00:00:43,653  -->  00:00:45,918
and then just create a new pen.
18

18

00:00:45,918  -->  00:00:47,957
Just like this.
19

19

00:00:47,957  -->  00:00:51,866
In here, we can write our HTML or CSS and JavaScript
20

20

00:00:51,866  -->  00:00:54,588
and it will render the results down here.
21

21

00:00:54,588  -->  00:00:57,002
We can also configure a bunch of stuff.
22

22

00:00:57,002  -->  00:00:59,180
We're not gonna write any JavaScript code,
23

23

00:00:59,180  -->  00:01:01,973
so let's just close this one.
24

24

00:01:01,973  -->  00:01:04,485
Then we can set some settings here.
25

25

00:01:04,485  -->  00:01:08,652
For example, for the CSS our CSS Preprocessor will be SASS.
26

26

00:01:10,423  -->  00:01:13,335
And remember we have SASS and SCSS,
27

27

00:01:13,335  -->  00:01:15,473
which actually stand both for SASS,
28

28

00:01:15,473  -->  00:01:17,512
but with a different syntaxes.
29

29

00:01:17,512  -->  00:01:19,996
So remember, we are going to use SCSS,
30

30

00:01:19,996  -->  00:01:23,322
which stands for Sassy CSS in this course.
31

31

00:01:23,322  -->  00:01:25,756
This is going to be our preprocessor,
32

32

00:01:25,756  -->  00:01:28,427
and then CodePen will automatically compile
33

33

00:01:28,427  -->  00:01:31,344
all code that we write here to CSS.
34

34

00:01:32,223  -->  00:01:35,297
It says here already SCSS now, right?
35

35

00:01:35,297  -->  00:01:37,918
So we're just gonna build a very small example here
36

36

00:01:37,918  -->  00:01:41,162
in these two lectures, just to get you familiar with steps.
37

37

00:01:41,162  -->  00:01:43,609
We're gonna write a small navigation.
38

38

00:01:43,609  -->  00:01:46,568
Let's start by very quickly marking that up
39

39

00:01:46,568  -->  00:01:48,771
in the HTML here.
40

40

00:01:48,771  -->  00:01:52,785
Nav, then in there we have a unordered list
41

41

00:01:52,785  -->  00:01:55,035
with a class of navigation.
42

42

00:01:59,264  -->  00:02:01,152
And in there we have a bunch of links.
43

43

00:02:01,152  -->  00:02:04,836
I'm sure you have done something like this before.
44

44

00:02:04,836  -->  00:02:07,523
And just an empty link here, okay?
45

45

00:02:07,523  -->  00:02:10,273
So something like this, About us.
46

46

00:02:14,190  -->  00:02:15,773
Let's copy this one
47

47

00:02:19,282  -->  00:02:21,064
and then close it.
48

48

00:02:21,064  -->  00:02:23,223
We want something different here.
49

49

00:02:23,223  -->  00:02:25,723
Let's say Pricing and Contact.
50

50

00:02:30,112  -->  00:02:31,289
Just follow along with me here,
51

51

00:02:31,289  -->  00:02:33,664
just copy this code, this HTML code,
52

52

00:02:33,664  -->  00:02:35,977
so that we can then start writing the SASS,
53

53

00:02:35,977  -->  00:02:38,320
which is what we really want.
54

54

00:02:38,320  -->  00:02:41,689
So we have this navigation here on this side.
55

55

00:02:41,689  -->  00:02:43,782
And then we just want two buttons
56

56

00:02:43,782  -->  00:02:46,192
sitting on the other side of the navigation bar.
57

57

00:02:46,192  -->  00:02:49,859
You'll see later what I'm trying to do here.
58

58

00:02:53,004  -->  00:02:57,171
This is just a div that will hold these two buttons,
59

59

00:02:59,533  -->  00:03:03,533
the button main, pointing to nowhere once again,
60

60

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:11,500
and then another one.
61

61

00:03:12,679  -->  00:03:15,211
Unfortunately, this CodePen doesn't really have
62

62

00:03:15,211  -->  00:03:17,728
an autocomplete function,
63

63

00:03:17,728  -->  00:03:20,997
so we have to really type out the entire code,
64

64

00:03:20,997  -->  00:03:22,830
which is a bit boring.
65

65

00:03:23,828  -->  00:03:27,995
But that's what we have to do. (chuckles)
66

66

00:03:30,921  -->  00:03:34,485
And then just close the div and close the nav element.
67

67

00:03:34,485  -->  00:03:35,318
And that's it.
68

68

00:03:35,318  -->  00:03:37,651
That's our simple markup.
69

69

00:03:37,651  -->  00:03:39,464
Now before we do anything else,
70

70

00:03:39,464  -->  00:03:42,079
let's do a normal reset like we did
71

71

00:03:42,079  -->  00:03:44,248
on our other project as well.
72

72

00:03:44,248  -->  00:03:47,581
Let's just say margin: 0 and padding: 0.
73

73

00:03:51,575  -->  00:03:55,624
Now let's start styling the nav element.
74

74

00:03:55,624  -->  00:03:58,643
Let's say we want a margin of 30 pixels
75

75

00:03:58,643  -->  00:04:00,810
and some background color.
76

76

00:04:02,324  -->  00:04:06,272
Now, colors are a typical use case for SASS variables.
77

77

00:04:06,272  -->  00:04:09,136
So let me show you how SASS variables actually work.
78

78

00:04:09,136  -->  00:04:11,951
Now first of all, what is a variable?
79

79

00:04:11,951  -->  00:04:14,305
A variable is just like a container
80

80

00:04:14,305  -->  00:04:16,465
where we can store some data,
81

81

00:04:16,465  -->  00:04:18,406
for example like the name of a color.
82

82

00:04:18,406  -->  00:04:21,086
Then we can reuse it all over our code.
83

83

00:04:21,086  -->  00:04:22,458
So we just have to define it once
84

84

00:04:22,458  -->  00:04:24,314
and then can use it everywhere.
85

85

00:04:24,314  -->  00:04:26,798
And if, for example, we then wanted to change that color,
86

86

00:04:26,798  -->  00:04:29,584
we only would have to change it in the variable definition
87

87

00:04:29,584  -->  00:04:32,692
and it would automatically change all over the code.
88

88

00:04:32,692  -->  00:04:35,966
So let's define a variable, and this is how it works.
89

89

00:04:35,966  -->  00:04:38,799
Let's call this one color-primary.
90

90

00:04:41,526  -->  00:04:45,193
The color I'm giving it is this one, f9ed69.
91

91

00:04:47,541  -->  00:04:49,899
This is just a yellow color
92

92

00:04:49,899  -->  00:04:52,844
that I have selected before for this project.
93

93

00:04:52,844  -->  00:04:55,242
Let me just comment this here.
94

94

00:04:55,242  -->  00:04:56,826
Actually what you can do in SASS
95

95

00:04:56,826  -->  00:04:58,634
is to write comments like this.
96

96

00:04:58,634  -->  00:05:02,302
So instead of having to write like we do in normal CSS,
97

97

00:05:02,302  -->  00:05:06,469
so just like this and here a comment, then like this,
98

98

00:05:08,113  -->  00:05:09,578
in SASS, it's actually easier.
99

99

00:05:09,578  -->  00:05:12,734
We can just do this double slashes.
100

100

00:05:12,734  -->  00:05:16,901
So just this, and then we can say this is a yellow color.
101

101

00:05:19,224  -->  00:05:23,391
All we have to do now here is to write color-primary.
102

102

00:05:25,108  -->  00:05:26,815
Let's see what happens.
103

103

00:05:26,815  -->  00:05:27,648
Here we go.
104

104

00:05:27,648  -->  00:05:29,659
Here is our yellow background color.
105

105

00:05:29,659  -->  00:05:31,381
Again, this is what happened.
106

106

00:05:31,381  -->  00:05:33,064
We stored this piece of data here,
107

107

00:05:33,064  -->  00:05:34,975
this piece of text in this case,
108

108

00:05:34,975  -->  00:05:37,526
in the color-primary variable.
109

109

00:05:37,526  -->  00:05:39,955
We then used that color variable down here,
110

110

00:05:39,955  -->  00:05:42,908
and it read the data from our variable definition
111

111

00:05:42,908  -->  00:05:44,846
which is up here.
112

112

00:05:44,846  -->  00:05:46,929
And we could now go ahead and use this variable
113

113

00:05:46,929  -->  00:05:48,746
wherever we wanted.
114

114

00:05:48,746  -->  00:05:51,856
Now, imagine that we wanted to change it.
115

115

00:05:51,856  -->  00:05:54,738
Let's cut it here and just write red, for example.
116

116

00:05:54,738  -->  00:05:57,968
And then it would change to red, right?
117

117

00:05:57,968  -->  00:05:59,818
That's not what we want, of course,
118

118

00:05:59,818  -->  00:06:02,914
so let's put our yellow color back here.
119

119

00:06:02,914  -->  00:06:04,198
And that are variables.
120

120

00:06:04,198  -->  00:06:06,756
Note that you always have to define a variable name
121

121

00:06:06,756  -->  00:06:09,316
starting with this dollar sign here.
122

122

00:06:09,316  -->  00:06:11,488
That is how SASS identifies variables,
123

123

00:06:11,488  -->  00:06:14,477
always starting with this dollar sign.
124

124

00:06:14,477  -->  00:06:15,956
Since we're here defining variables,
125

125

00:06:15,956  -->  00:06:19,465
let's actually add two more colors here already.
126

126

00:06:19,465  -->  00:06:23,632
So, color-secondary, which is kind of an orange, f08a5d.
127

127

00:06:31,430  -->  00:06:35,013
All right, and then another color-tertiary,
128

128

00:06:37,465  -->  00:06:41,382
so the third color, and this is a pink, b83b5e.
129

129

00:06:47,378  -->  00:06:50,326
Let's now actually style the navigation itself.
130

130

00:06:50,326  -->  00:06:53,684
But before we do that, we can also save our pen here.
131

131

00:06:53,684  -->  00:06:55,332
So just hit Save.
132

132

00:06:55,332  -->  00:06:58,695
Then it will ask you to create a new account here.
133

133

00:06:58,695  -->  00:07:00,724
But that's not really necessary
134

134

00:07:00,724  -->  00:07:04,688
because all that matters, it hasn't changed this link here.
135

135

00:07:04,688  -->  00:07:06,479
So now if you wanna share this with someone,
136

136

00:07:06,479  -->  00:07:09,374
you just have to copy this link and paste it.
137

137

00:07:09,374  -->  00:07:12,063
For example, if you have a question with some problem
138

138

00:07:12,063  -->  00:07:14,953
with your code and if you wanna share it to get some help,
139

139

00:07:14,953  -->  00:07:16,414
then you can simply go ahead
140

140

00:07:16,414  -->  00:07:19,885
and copy and paste this URL here.
141

141

00:07:19,885  -->  00:07:21,388
Now, something else we can do here
142

142

00:07:21,388  -->  00:07:25,847
is to click here and then see our compiled CSS.
143

143

00:07:25,847  -->  00:07:30,020
This is the SASS code which is compiled to this CSS code.
144

144

00:07:30,020  -->  00:07:32,522
This is very simply this code.
145

145

00:07:32,522  -->  00:07:35,851
So the variables, they of course don't produce any CSS code.
146

146

00:07:35,851  -->  00:07:38,568
They are just there to store some data for us.
147

147

00:07:38,568  -->  00:07:40,500
Then here the variable that we had here
148

148

00:07:40,500  -->  00:07:41,632
for the background color
149

149

00:07:41,632  -->  00:07:44,331
was simply replaced with the variable that we defined,
150

150

00:07:44,331  -->  00:07:45,973
so exactly as I showed you.
151

151

00:07:45,973  -->  00:07:49,842
So you see here, color-primary, this f9ed69.
152

152

00:07:49,842  -->  00:07:51,838
Now when we see the compiled CSS,
153

153

00:07:51,838  -->  00:07:54,202
that's exactly what you have here.
154

154

00:07:54,202  -->  00:07:59,051
That is what the compiler does behind the scenes.
155

155

00:07:59,051  -->  00:08:01,218
Now, about the navigation,
156

156

00:08:02,332  -->  00:08:03,857
let's first select it.
157

157

00:08:03,857  -->  00:08:08,024
The first thing we can say is that we want no list style.
158

158

00:08:09,201  -->  00:08:13,368
List-style: none, and so these small bullets will disappear.
159

159

00:08:14,589  -->  00:08:17,894
Now we wanna select these li items here, right?
160

160

00:08:17,894  -->  00:08:19,577
So these ones.
161

161

00:08:19,577  -->  00:08:23,076
This is an excellent time to talk about nesting.
162

162

00:08:23,076  -->  00:08:25,334
How would you usually do it without SASS
163

163

00:08:25,334  -->  00:08:28,032
if you wanted to select this li item?
164

164

00:08:28,032  -->  00:08:31,617
Probably you would just write something like this.
165

165

00:08:31,617  -->  00:08:34,919
Navigation, and then li, and then just select it, like this.
166

166

00:08:34,919  -->  00:08:35,752
Right?
167

167

00:08:35,752  -->  00:08:37,477
But with SASS and with nesting,
168

168

00:08:37,477  -->  00:08:39,075
we can actually do better than that.
169

169

00:08:39,075  -->  00:08:41,721
All we have to do in order to replace this
170

170

00:08:41,721  -->  00:08:44,138
is to write li right in here.
171

171

00:08:45,867  -->  00:08:46,808
And that's it.
172

172

00:08:46,808  -->  00:08:49,031
So these are nested selectors.
173

173

00:08:49,031  -->  00:08:50,714
We first select a navigation.
174

174

00:08:50,714  -->  00:08:54,583
And then inside the navigation, we select li elements.
175

175

00:08:54,583  -->  00:08:57,226
It's exactly what we have in here.
176

176

00:08:57,226  -->  00:09:00,272
But SASS allows us to write this in this easier way
177

177

00:09:00,272  -->  00:09:01,545
so we have to type less code
178

178

00:09:01,545  -->  00:09:04,612
and it's also better organized, I think.
179

179

00:09:04,612  -->  00:09:06,870
Again, this selector here basically means
180

180

00:09:06,870  -->  00:09:08,801
that we want to select the li
181

181

00:09:08,801  -->  00:09:11,448
which is inside of the navigation.
182

182

00:09:11,448  -->  00:09:13,650
This is exactly what we have here.
183

183

00:09:13,650  -->  00:09:14,582
We select a navigation
184

184

00:09:14,582  -->  00:09:17,104
and then the li is inside the navigation.
185

185

00:09:17,104  -->  00:09:18,160
So we can write the selector
186

186

00:09:18,160  -->  00:09:20,657
inside of the navigation selector.
187

187

00:09:20,657  -->  00:09:22,240
Does it make sense?
188

188

00:09:23,368  -->  00:09:25,982
We then no longer need this one.
189

189

00:09:25,982  -->  00:09:28,205
Let's just start by writing some code here
190

190

00:09:28,205  -->  00:09:30,744
before I can show you actually the compiled CSS
191

191

00:09:30,744  -->  00:09:33,830
to show you that it works the exact same way.
192

192

00:09:33,830  -->  00:09:37,623
So display, I'll put them as inline-blocks
193

193

00:09:37,623  -->  00:09:41,293
so that they are nicely sitting side by side,
194

194

00:09:41,293  -->  00:09:42,961
just like this exactly,
195

195

00:09:42,961  -->  00:09:46,663
so the three li elements are these three, right?
196

196

00:09:46,663  -->  00:09:50,076
You can already see that does this work, right?
197

197

00:09:50,076  -->  00:09:54,775
We also put a margin-left here of, let's say, 30 pixels.
198

198

00:09:54,775  -->  00:09:57,150
And again you saw that it worked.
199

199

00:09:57,150  -->  00:10:00,906
Let's take a look at the uncompiled CSS,
200

200

00:10:00,906  -->  00:10:03,550
or actually the compiled CSS, sorry.
201

201

00:10:03,550  -->  00:10:06,733
So yeah, this is the code that I showed you initially.
202

202

00:10:06,733  -->  00:10:10,667
It is the result of the nesting that we did in SASS.
203

203

00:10:10,667  -->  00:10:11,500
Great.
204

204

00:10:11,500  -->  00:10:14,227
This gives us a really cool new tool.
205

205

00:10:14,227  -->  00:10:17,886
Can actually also increase the space here of these panels
206

206

00:10:17,886  -->  00:10:21,923
so that we can see the code a bit better.
207

207

00:10:21,923  -->  00:10:24,893
So yeah, now you know how nesting works in SASS.
208

208

00:10:24,893  -->  00:10:25,726
But that's not all.
209

209

00:10:25,726  -->  00:10:28,565
Nesting can be even more powerful than this.
210

210

00:10:28,565  -->  00:10:32,029
Let's say you wanted to format only the first element here,
211

211

00:10:32,029  -->  00:10:34,008
only the first li element.
212

212

00:10:34,008  -->  00:10:38,390
You could very simply use the first child pseudoclass.
213

213

00:10:38,390  -->  00:10:40,595
I'm sure you're already familiar with that.
214

214

00:10:40,595  -->  00:10:44,687
What you can do, for example, would be something like this,
215

215

00:10:44,687  -->  00:10:46,604
li and then last-child.
216

216

00:10:51,604  -->  00:10:53,883
We can then say that we want no margin in there,
217

217

00:10:53,883  -->  00:10:54,716
margin: 0.
218

218

00:10:55,893  -->  00:10:56,906
And so it worked.
219

219

00:10:56,906  -->  00:10:58,278
Now actually, we want,
220

220

00:10:58,278  -->  00:11:00,827
sorry, not the last child but the first child.
221

221

00:11:00,827  -->  00:11:03,555
So it works just as intended, right?
222

222

00:11:03,555  -->  00:11:05,534
However, we can do better than this
223

223

00:11:05,534  -->  00:11:08,473
because we are repeating the li here.
224

224

00:11:08,473  -->  00:11:11,226
So we could actually nest this even deeper.
225

225

00:11:11,226  -->  00:11:13,752
There's no limit to how far you can nest.
226

226

00:11:13,752  -->  00:11:16,192
You can put a nested selector inside a nested selector
227

227

00:11:16,192  -->  00:11:18,869
inside a nested and so on and so forth.
228

228

00:11:18,869  -->  00:11:22,030
So you could go really deep with your nesting.
229

229

00:11:22,030  -->  00:11:23,975
But getting back to what we were doing,
230

230

00:11:23,975  -->  00:11:25,291
what we can do here in order
231

231

00:11:25,291  -->  00:11:27,806
to avoid the repetition here of this li
232

232

00:11:27,806  -->  00:11:30,639
is to simply nest this inside here
233

233

00:11:34,006  -->  00:11:36,501
and remove this li from here, like this,
234

234

00:11:36,501  -->  00:11:39,771
and then finally replace it with the ampersand.
235

235

00:11:39,771  -->  00:11:42,933
What does this ampersand symbol here actually do?
236

236

00:11:42,933  -->  00:11:46,812
Well, what it does is to actually write the selector path
237

237

00:11:46,812  -->  00:11:48,247
up until this point.
238

238

00:11:48,247  -->  00:11:50,072
So in this case, this here will be replaced
239

239

00:11:50,072  -->  00:11:51,655
with navigation li.
240

240

00:11:52,805  -->  00:11:55,186
Let me actually write it out for you
241

241

00:11:55,186  -->  00:11:59,172
because I know it can seem a bit complicated.
242

242

00:11:59,172  -->  00:12:03,089
What we have here in practice is navigation li,
243

243

00:12:05,023  -->  00:12:06,773
and then first-child.
244

244

00:12:08,265  -->  00:12:11,232
Right? This is what we have.
245

245

00:12:11,232  -->  00:12:13,834
Now in here, you didn't need the ampersand symbol
246

246

00:12:13,834  -->  00:12:16,350
because in the markup, the li is actually
247

247

00:12:16,350  -->  00:12:18,133
inside the navigation.
248

248

00:12:18,133  -->  00:12:20,724
So here, this li is inside this ul
249

249

00:12:20,724  -->  00:12:22,765
with the navigation class.
250

250

00:12:22,765  -->  00:12:25,312
So you don't need to use the ampersand in here.
251

251

00:12:25,312  -->  00:12:28,365
But here in this case, this first-child pseudoclass
252

252

00:12:28,365  -->  00:12:31,417
is actually attached to the li, as you can see here.
253

253

00:12:31,417  -->  00:12:32,765
So there's no space here.
254

254

00:12:32,765  -->  00:12:35,824
If you would do it like this, without the ampersand,
255

255

00:12:35,824  -->  00:12:38,122
then it would do like this.
256

256

00:12:38,122  -->  00:12:39,914
And you see that it no longer works, then,
257

257

00:12:39,914  -->  00:12:41,156
here in the code.
258

258

00:12:41,156  -->  00:12:42,505
Because this is not what we want.
259

259

00:12:42,505  -->  00:12:44,158
To want it to be like this.
260

260

00:12:44,158  -->  00:12:47,969
So we have to repeat like this piece of code here,
261

261

00:12:47,969  -->  00:12:50,830
which is exactly the ampersand.
262

262

00:12:50,830  -->  00:12:54,545
So again, this ampersand basically writes out the selector
263

263

00:12:54,545  -->  00:12:56,479
at this current point here.
264

264

00:12:56,479  -->  00:12:58,219
So in here what we have at this point
265

265

00:12:58,219  -->  00:13:02,386
is navigation li and then from here, the first-child.
266

266

00:13:03,293  -->  00:13:07,138
Let's take a look at the compiled code again.
267

267

00:13:07,138  -->  00:13:09,750
This is exactly what I was telling you.
268

268

00:13:09,750  -->  00:13:12,071
It converts then to this code,
269

269

00:13:12,071  -->  00:13:14,425
which is exactly what I showed you and what we want
270

270

00:13:14,425  -->  00:13:16,153
in order for this to work.
271

271

00:13:16,153  -->  00:13:19,068
Usually when we have a pseudoclass like this one,
272

272

00:13:19,068  -->  00:13:21,280
we have to use this ampersand
273

273

00:13:21,280  -->  00:13:24,395
operator, let's call it like that.
274

274

00:13:24,395  -->  00:13:27,261
Next up, we want to style the links here.
275

275

00:13:27,261  -->  00:13:31,096
Now they are inside actually of the li elements.
276

276

00:13:31,096  -->  00:13:32,923
So where do we put it?
277

277

00:13:32,923  -->  00:13:37,090
That's right, we put it here, inside this li selector.
278

278

00:13:38,680  -->  00:13:40,879
This is again in the third level already.
279

279

00:13:40,879  -->  00:13:42,561
You shouldn't go deeper than this.
280

280

00:13:42,561  -->  00:13:46,504
In here we have .navigation and then li and then a.
281

281

00:13:46,504  -->  00:13:50,337
This is gonna translate to this selector here.
282

282

00:13:52,583  -->  00:13:53,780
So what we're writing in here
283

283

00:13:53,780  -->  00:13:57,863
will be equivalent to writing this piece of code.
284

284

00:13:59,926  -->  00:14:04,009
Let's just say that we want text-decoration: none
285

285

00:14:05,566  -->  00:14:08,233
and text-transform to uppercase.
286

286

00:14:11,858  -->  00:14:14,441
And you saw that it applied these styles, right?
287

287

00:14:14,441  -->  00:14:15,865
So really cool.
288

288

00:14:15,865  -->  00:14:18,282
We can also set a color here.
289

289

00:14:20,272  -->  00:14:21,979
Since we're talking about colors,
290

290

00:14:21,979  -->  00:14:24,979
let's actually add another variable.
291

291

00:14:27,022  -->  00:14:29,855
Let's say we want color-text-dark.
292

292

00:14:33,652  -->  00:14:35,962
So we're gonna put a dark gray here,
293

293

00:14:35,962  -->  00:14:39,295
and then in here we say color-text-dark.
294

294

00:14:43,337  -->  00:14:45,712
Then hopefully our links will turn gray.
295

295

00:14:45,712  -->  00:14:47,859
And yeah, so here they are.
296

296

00:14:47,859  -->  00:14:52,284
Actually we should use the link pseudoclass here.
297

297

00:14:52,284  -->  00:14:56,196
Doesn't make much of a difference but it's just better.
298

298

00:14:56,196  -->  00:14:59,598
As a next step, let's get these buttons here,
299

299

00:14:59,598  -->  00:15:01,757
so this button element here,
300

300

00:15:01,757  -->  00:15:03,332
so that they put the class button
301

301

00:15:03,332  -->  00:15:06,247
floating to the right side here.
302

302

00:15:06,247  -->  00:15:07,830
Let's just do that.
303

303

00:15:08,852  -->  00:15:13,019
Buttons, I can actually call it buttons, float: right.
304

304

00:15:14,227  -->  00:15:15,547
Let's change it here as well.
305

305

00:15:15,547  -->  00:15:18,058
Let's call it buttons.
306

306

00:15:18,058  -->  00:15:19,657
So now they are here.
307

307

00:15:19,657  -->  00:15:23,112
Now I should also then float this part here to the left.
308

308

00:15:23,112  -->  00:15:25,843
So navigation, where is it?
309

309

00:15:25,843  -->  00:15:27,176
And float: left.
310

310

00:15:29,482  -->  00:15:31,351
Now what's going to happen?
311

311

00:15:31,351  -->  00:15:32,475
Yeah, that's right.
312

312

00:15:32,475  -->  00:15:34,881
The background color here disappeared.
313

313

00:15:34,881  -->  00:15:36,922
That's because all of the child elements
314

314

00:15:36,922  -->  00:15:40,054
of this container, of this nav container here,
315

315

00:15:40,054  -->  00:15:42,332
are floating and so the element collapses
316

316

00:15:42,332  -->  00:15:44,471
and it loses all its height.
317

317

00:15:44,471  -->  00:15:47,971
We can actually see this in the inspector.
318

318

00:15:49,167  -->  00:15:51,167
Actually, where is this?
319

319

00:15:56,315  -->  00:15:57,771
So yeah, here.
320

320

00:15:57,771  -->  00:16:01,578
Here we can see up there, well, you will see it here.
321

321

00:16:01,578  -->  00:16:04,542
It says that there's a height of zero pixels.
322

322

00:16:04,542  -->  00:16:07,457
So again, this happens because all the child elements
323

323

00:16:07,457  -->  00:16:11,659
of this nav element are currently floated.
324

324

00:16:11,659  -->  00:16:13,008
What do we have to do here?
325

325

00:16:13,008  -->  00:16:15,112
We can use the clearfix method.
326

326

00:16:15,112  -->  00:16:17,463
I'm sure you're already familiar with that one as well.
327

327

00:16:17,463  -->  00:16:19,671
I showed it to you in my other course.
328

328

00:16:19,671  -->  00:16:22,884
So every CSS developer which uses floats
329

329

00:16:22,884  -->  00:16:26,511
also uses clearfix in order to fix this problem.
330

330

00:16:26,511  -->  00:16:28,929
Do you remember how we used to do that?
331

331

00:16:28,929  -->  00:16:31,822
We usually created a class called a clearfix
332

332

00:16:31,822  -->  00:16:33,746
and then added it to that element,
333

333

00:16:33,746  -->  00:16:37,240
so just like adding class, clearfix, in here.
334

334

00:16:37,240  -->  00:16:40,110
And we can actually do that right now.
335

335

00:16:40,110  -->  00:16:42,955
I will then show you another way.
336

336

00:16:42,955  -->  00:16:44,975
So class clearfix, and then in here,
337

337

00:16:44,975  -->  00:16:47,392
we create this class as well,
338

338

00:16:49,241  -->  00:16:51,767
or we select element.
339

339

00:16:51,767  -->  00:16:54,964
So the clearfix works like this.
340

340

00:16:54,964  -->  00:16:56,714
The content is empty.
341

341

00:16:58,709  -->  00:17:01,938
Of course I forgot that what this actually does
342

342

00:17:01,938  -->  00:17:06,384
is to add a pseudoelement after the collapsed element.
343

343

00:17:06,384  -->  00:17:08,510
Basically it's this pseudoelement,
344

344

00:17:08,510  -->  00:17:09,980
this clearfix pseudoelement,
345

345

00:17:09,980  -->  00:17:13,235
that is then going to clear this float.
346

346

00:17:13,235  -->  00:17:16,818
It will do so with the clear both property.
347

347

00:17:18,683  -->  00:17:22,016
Also we should set the display to table.
348

348

00:17:24,935  -->  00:17:25,768
So here we go.
349

349

00:17:25,768  -->  00:17:27,537
The clearfix class worked.
350

350

00:17:27,537  -->  00:17:30,149
It fixed this collapsed element.
351

351

00:17:30,149  -->  00:17:32,223
Now instead of writing this separate class,
352

352

00:17:32,223  -->  00:17:35,960
we could simply add it here to the nav.
353

353

00:17:35,960  -->  00:17:38,669
This would actually be the exact same thing
354

354

00:17:38,669  -->  00:17:40,002
as writing this.
355

355

00:17:41,681  -->  00:17:43,001
Because it's to the nav element
356

356

00:17:43,001  -->  00:17:46,399
that we actually want to attach this pseudoelement
357

357

00:17:46,399  -->  00:17:47,792
which then clears the float.
358

358

00:17:47,792  -->  00:17:50,174
We can do even better with this.
359

359

00:17:50,174  -->  00:17:52,824
Do you already see the solution, what we can do?
360

360

00:17:52,824  -->  00:17:55,015
That's right, we can put it in here.
361

361

00:17:55,015  -->  00:17:58,098
We can once again nest the selectors.
362

362

00:17:59,400  -->  00:18:01,515
And then here, what do we put here?
363

363

00:18:01,515  -->  00:18:04,364
Exactly, we put the ampersand operator.
364

364

00:18:04,364  -->  00:18:05,652
And that's it.
365

365

00:18:05,652  -->  00:18:07,357
It's back to working here.
366

366

00:18:07,357  -->  00:18:10,626
So this here will be replaced with nav,
367

367

00:18:10,626  -->  00:18:13,381
and then from there, we add the pseudoelement.
368

368

00:18:13,381  -->  00:18:15,953
Let's just check that just to make sure.
369

369

00:18:15,953  -->  00:18:17,595
So here we go.
370

370

00:18:17,595  -->  00:18:19,450
Again, we have to use this ampersand
371

371

00:18:19,450  -->  00:18:21,942
because if we wouldn't use it,
372

372

00:18:21,942  -->  00:18:24,110
then this is what it would look like.
373

373

00:18:24,110  -->  00:18:25,861
So nav and then the space,
374

374

00:18:25,861  -->  00:18:27,532
as I was telling you in the beginning,
375

375

00:18:27,532  -->  00:18:28,365
and then the after.
376

376

00:18:28,365  -->  00:18:31,065
But that's not what we want.
377

377

00:18:31,065  -->  00:18:35,124
So we need to attach the ampersand operator in here.
378

378

00:18:35,124  -->  00:18:37,089
All right, and just to finish this lecture,
379

379

00:18:37,089  -->  00:18:40,837
let's now very quickly style these two buttons here, as well
380

380

00:18:40,837  -->  00:18:43,493
so that we can use these other color variables
381

381

00:18:43,493  -->  00:18:46,076
that we already defined before.
382

382

00:18:47,627  -->  00:18:48,566
We have two buttons here.
383

383

00:18:48,566  -->  00:18:51,072
We have the button main and the button hot.
384

384

00:18:51,072  -->  00:18:53,988
Some of their aspects will actually be pretty similar,
385

385

00:18:53,988  -->  00:18:56,654
so let's group them together here.
386

386

00:18:56,654  -->  00:18:57,904
The main button
387

387

00:19:00,024  -->  00:19:01,607
and the hot button,
388

388

00:19:02,913  -->  00:19:05,606
both with the link pseudoclass.
389

389

00:19:05,606  -->  00:19:10,551
All right, we want them to have a padding of 10 pixels.
390

390

00:19:10,551  -->  00:19:14,384
We want them to be displayed as inline-blocks.
391

391

00:19:17,527  -->  00:19:19,816
And now you see that their padding is actually
392

392

00:19:19,816  -->  00:19:22,721
applied here on all the entire element,
393

393

00:19:22,721  -->  00:19:24,503
not just on the left and right.
394

394

00:19:24,503  -->  00:19:26,155
So now the box model works on them
395

395

00:19:26,155  -->  00:19:27,904
as if they were block elements,
396

396

00:19:27,904  -->  00:19:31,448
as I was explaining you in one of the theory lectures.
397

397

00:19:31,448  -->  00:19:34,281
We want their text to be centered.
398

398

00:19:37,838  -->  00:19:41,413
We want a border radius of 100 pixels,
399

399

00:19:41,413  -->  00:19:42,757
so again a really huge number
400

400

00:19:42,757  -->  00:19:46,163
just to give them these rounded corners.
401

401

00:19:46,163  -->  00:19:50,330
Of course we also wanna get rid of the underlining.
402

402

00:19:52,241  -->  00:19:53,765
So text-decoration: none.
403

403

00:19:53,765  -->  00:19:56,432
And also to make them uppercase.
404

404

00:20:00,794  -->  00:20:03,127
We can also set their width.
405

405

00:20:04,540  -->  00:20:07,845
I think this is a good time to use another variable.
406

406

00:20:07,845  -->  00:20:10,782
Variables don't just have to be colors, of course.
407

407

00:20:10,782  -->  00:20:13,785
We can use everything for variables.
408

408

00:20:13,785  -->  00:20:15,178
Let's create another variable here
409

409

00:20:15,178  -->  00:20:17,928
and call it width for the button.
410

410

00:20:19,929  -->  00:20:23,135
Let's say we want 150 pixels here for the width.
411

411

00:20:23,135  -->  00:20:24,854
If we then later wanted to, for example,
412

412

00:20:24,854  -->  00:20:26,321
change this design aspect,
413

413

00:20:26,321  -->  00:20:28,728
then instead of having to go down there to the button,
414

414

00:20:28,728  -->  00:20:30,870
we could just change the settings here,
415

415

00:20:30,870  -->  00:20:32,032
this variable setting.
416

416

00:20:32,032  -->  00:20:36,814
So this variable here could act, like, as a setting.
417

417

00:20:36,814  -->  00:20:39,647
Our variable name is width-button.
418

418

00:20:43,018  -->  00:20:44,532
So you saw the effect here.
419

419

00:20:44,532  -->  00:20:47,166
They are now larger than they were before.
420

420

00:20:47,166  -->  00:20:48,709
Okay, so these are the main definitions.
421

421

00:20:48,709  -->  00:20:52,876
Now let's give each of them a different background color.
422

422

00:20:53,804  -->  00:20:57,758
So button main, and we actually want one background color
423

423

00:20:57,758  -->  00:20:59,235
on the normal link state,
424

424

00:20:59,235  -->  00:21:01,752
and then a different one for the hover state.
425

425

00:21:01,752  -->  00:21:03,730
How could we do that using nesting?
426

426

00:21:03,730  -->  00:21:05,153
Do you have any idea?
427

427

00:21:05,153  -->  00:21:06,547
Well, I will give you a hint.
428

428

00:21:06,547  -->  00:21:09,183
We don't need to write 'em here in the first selector,
429

429

00:21:09,183  -->  00:21:10,606
so in the beginning of the selector.
430

430

00:21:10,606  -->  00:21:13,214
We can use nesting for both of these states.
431

431

00:21:13,214  -->  00:21:15,085
So how are we gonna do that?
432

432

00:21:15,085  -->  00:21:16,544
We do it like this.
433

433

00:21:16,544  -->  00:21:19,711
Use again the ampersand and then link.
434

434

00:21:21,878  -->  00:21:22,741
And that's it.
435

435

00:21:22,741  -->  00:21:24,447
So it doesn't just work, of course,
436

436

00:21:24,447  -->  00:21:27,028
for the after pseudoclass or for the
437

437

00:21:27,028  -->  00:21:29,071
first or last child pseudoclasses.
438

438

00:21:29,071  -->  00:21:30,710
It works for all of these as well,
439

439

00:21:30,710  -->  00:21:32,960
like link or hover as well.
440

440

00:21:34,998  -->  00:21:35,831
So, hover.
441

441

00:21:37,053  -->  00:21:39,134
This will translate into button main link
442

442

00:21:39,134  -->  00:21:40,967
and button main hover.
443

443

00:21:41,865  -->  00:21:43,532
So background-color.
444

444

00:21:45,730  -->  00:21:48,980
And here let's use our color-secondary.
445

445

00:21:50,058  -->  00:21:50,891
Let's see it.
446

446

00:21:50,891  -->  00:21:53,168
Yeah, here it goes, great.
447

447

00:21:53,168  -->  00:21:55,532
There's a cool trick, a cool thing, I can show you,
448

448

00:21:55,532  -->  00:21:57,782
which is also part of SASS,
449

449

00:21:58,673  -->  00:22:02,205
background-color, which is to use a color function.
450

450

00:22:02,205  -->  00:22:05,832
SASS comes in with a couple of built-in color function
451

451

00:22:05,832  -->  00:22:07,821
which can make life a fit easier.
452

452

00:22:07,821  -->  00:22:10,627
Instead of having to calculate another color,
453

453

00:22:10,627  -->  00:22:12,615
for example imagine we want this button
454

454

00:22:12,615  -->  00:22:15,942
to become a bit darker as soon as we hover it.
455

455

00:22:15,942  -->  00:22:18,188
Instead of having to calculate or to figure out
456

456

00:22:18,188  -->  00:22:19,538
another color for this,
457

457

00:22:19,538  -->  00:22:22,581
we can simply use one of the built-in color functions,
458

458

00:22:22,581  -->  00:22:24,741
which is called darken.
459

459

00:22:24,741  -->  00:22:26,978
So we say darken and then we put our color.
460

460

00:22:26,978  -->  00:22:31,145
Again, we can use our variable here, so color-secondary.
461

461

00:22:32,177  -->  00:22:33,239
And now it's already paying off
462

462

00:22:33,239  -->  00:22:35,374
to having this color stored in a variable,
463

463

00:22:35,374  -->  00:22:38,082
'cause then we don't have to write it all over again.
464

464

00:22:38,082  -->  00:22:41,224
Now let's say we wanted to make just 15% darker.
465

465

00:22:41,224  -->  00:22:43,391
And that's what this does.
466

466

00:22:44,453  -->  00:22:45,672
Let's now test it.
467

467

00:22:45,672  -->  00:22:48,429
And yeah, it's a bit darker.
468

468

00:22:48,429  -->  00:22:50,716
Can put it only 5% darker.
469

469

00:22:50,716  -->  00:22:52,884
Let's see how that looks like.
470

470

00:22:52,884  -->  00:22:55,509
Now you see it's only getting slightly darker.
471

471

00:22:55,509  -->  00:22:59,862
But let's get back to our 15% as we had it.
472

472

00:22:59,862  -->  00:23:03,760
Let's take again a look at the compiled CSS.
473

473

00:23:03,760  -->  00:23:06,762
We have the link and the hover state, as we specified.
474

474

00:23:06,762  -->  00:23:09,796
Then here this is the color that SASS calculated,
475

475

00:23:09,796  -->  00:23:13,463
which is like 15% darker than this one.
476

476

00:23:15,215  -->  00:23:16,890
All right, cool.
477

477

00:23:16,890  -->  00:23:19,499
Now we can just do the same thing here
478

478

00:23:19,499  -->  00:23:21,916
for the other button as well.
479

479

00:23:24,090  -->  00:23:28,233
This is very similar so I can just copy the code, so hot.
480

480

00:23:28,233  -->  00:23:30,233
Then here, the tertiary.
481

481

00:23:31,906  -->  00:23:33,341
Yep, that's right.
482

482

00:23:33,341  -->  00:23:34,841
Then copy it here.
483

483

00:23:36,236  -->  00:23:38,756
And so it gets also darker as we hover it.
484

484

00:23:38,756  -->  00:23:39,977
Now just to show you another one,
485

485

00:23:39,977  -->  00:23:41,727
there's also lighten.
486

486

00:23:43,536  -->  00:23:45,865
As you can imagine, this will do the opposite.
487

487

00:23:45,865  -->  00:23:48,434
So it will turn the color lighter.
488

488

00:23:48,434  -->  00:23:49,884
And yeah, so it works.
489

489

00:23:49,884  -->  00:23:50,719
Maybe that's a bit too much.
490

490

00:23:50,719  -->  00:23:53,386
We can just put, like, 10%.
491

491

00:23:54,714  -->  00:23:56,822
And yeah, great.
492

492

00:23:56,822  -->  00:23:59,443
Now we want also a color in here
493

493

00:23:59,443  -->  00:24:01,452
for these two buttons.
494

494

00:24:01,452  -->  00:24:02,869
That's say color.
495

495

00:24:04,173  -->  00:24:05,396
And actually we want, like,
496

496

00:24:05,396  -->  00:24:07,660
a white color or something like that.
497

497

00:24:07,660  -->  00:24:11,418
So let's just define another variable here.
498

498

00:24:11,418  -->  00:24:12,835
Color-text-light.
499

499

00:24:16,043  -->  00:24:18,370
We can make it maybe not completely white,
500

500

00:24:18,370  -->  00:24:19,696
but something similar.
501

501

00:24:19,696  -->  00:24:22,529
So instead of fff, we can use eee.
502

502

00:24:23,492  -->  00:24:26,159
Take a look how this looks like.
503

503

00:24:27,509  -->  00:24:29,842
We call it color-text-light.
504

504

00:24:33,180  -->  00:24:34,316
Let's see, oh yeah.
505

505

00:24:34,316  -->  00:24:36,066
It looks good, right?
506

506

00:24:36,905  -->  00:24:39,759
I think this small example was a great use case
507

507

00:24:39,759  -->  00:24:42,967
of using variables and nesting for the first time.
508

508

00:24:42,967  -->  00:24:45,104
I hope that you really grasped these concepts
509

509

00:24:45,104  -->  00:24:46,755
and that you fully understood them
510

510

00:24:46,755  -->  00:24:48,059
and that you're now ready to use them
511

511

00:24:48,059  -->  00:24:49,425
in the real world.
512

512

00:24:49,425  -->  00:24:52,127
What I want you to do now is to again
513

513

00:24:52,127  -->  00:24:53,831
take a look at the compile CSS
514

514

00:24:53,831  -->  00:24:57,560
and carefully compare it with the code that we just wrote.
515

515

00:24:57,560  -->  00:24:59,328
So just so you make really sure
516

516

00:24:59,328  -->  00:25:01,192
that you understood what happens here
517

517

00:25:01,192  -->  00:25:02,919
behind the scenes of SASS,
518

518

00:25:02,919  -->  00:25:05,683
so what exactly it does with these variables
519

519

00:25:05,683  -->  00:25:07,265
and with all this nesting.
520

520

00:25:07,265  -->  00:25:08,196
Okay?
521

521

00:25:08,196  -->  00:25:10,535
In the next lecture, we're gonna be back to this example
522

522

00:25:10,535  -->  00:25:12,037
and then I'm gonna introduce you
523

523

00:25:12,037  -->  00:25:15,473
to mix-ins, functions, and extends.
524

524

00:25:15,473  -->  00:25:17,723
So keep tuned for that one.
