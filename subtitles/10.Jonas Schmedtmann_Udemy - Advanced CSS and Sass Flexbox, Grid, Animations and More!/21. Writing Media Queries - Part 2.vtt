00:00:01.469  -->  00:00:03.165
<v Instructor>All right, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.165  -->  00:00:06.832
Let's have some more fun with media queries.
3

3

00:00:07.820  -->  00:00:09.978
So, we had already decided that 600
4

4

00:00:09.978  -->  00:00:12.693
would be our next breakpoint, right?
5

5

00:00:12.693  -->  00:00:15.372
So what should we change at this width?
6

6

00:00:15.372  -->  00:00:18.867
Well, first of all, I want make both the description here
7

7

00:00:18.867  -->  00:00:21.789
and reviews go from side to side.
8

8

00:00:21.789  -->  00:00:25.525
So I want them to occupy 100% of the available width
9

9

00:00:25.525  -->  00:00:28.710
because we really don't have anymore space here right now.
10

10

00:00:28.710  -->  00:00:30.522
And if we decrease this even more,
11

11

00:00:30.522  -->  00:00:33.292
then the effect of course becomes more dramatic.
12

12

00:00:33.292  -->  00:00:35.542
And so, I want to fix that.
13

13

00:00:36.587  -->  00:00:39.475
So, going back to our CSS, let's start by creating
14

14

00:00:39.475  -->  00:00:41.142
a new variable here.
15

15

00:00:43.449  -->  00:00:44.850
And I'm gonna call it small.
16

16

00:00:44.850  -->  00:00:46.926
And we want 600 pixels.
17

17

00:00:46.926  -->  00:00:49.676
So 600 divided by 16 is 37.5 rem.
18

18

00:00:55.544  -->  00:00:56.794
Or m, actually.
19

19

00:00:58.438  -->  00:01:01.776
Okay, and so, let's now use that,
20

20

00:01:01.776  -->  00:01:04.517
and I'm just gonna copy this media query here.
21

21

00:01:04.517  -->  00:01:06.619
And where we want this media query to be
22

22

00:01:06.619  -->  00:01:07.905
is on the detail.
23

23

00:01:07.905  -->  00:01:11.049
So let me show that to you again.
24

24

00:01:11.049  -->  00:01:12.208
So right here.
25

25

00:01:12.208  -->  00:01:16.083
So we basically want the description and the
26

26

00:01:16.083  -->  00:01:18.937
user reviews to be one below the other.
27

27

00:01:18.937  -->  00:01:21.874
So, all we have to do on this flex container here,
28

28

00:01:21.874  -->  00:01:25.541
the detail, is to change the flex direction.
29

29

00:01:26.631  -->  00:01:28.131
So, let's do that.
30

30

00:01:34.266  -->  00:01:37.433
So, flex direction from row to column.
31

31

00:01:38.637  -->  00:01:41.493
And here, of course, it has to be smaller.
32

32

00:01:41.493  -->  00:01:43.475
So remember when we have two media queries,
33

33

00:01:43.475  -->  00:01:46.158
we first put the one for the largest screen
34

34

00:01:46.158  -->  00:01:48.840
and after that the one for the smaller screen.
35

35

00:01:48.840  -->  00:01:51.035
And that's because both of these will apply
36

36

00:01:51.035  -->  00:01:54.549
because the screen at 600 pixels is also smaller
37

37

00:01:54.549  -->  00:01:57.761
than 900 pixels, which is this media query here.
38

38

00:01:57.761  -->  00:02:00.329
And so, both apply, but in this case, if there is
39

39

00:02:00.329  -->  00:02:02.235
some conflicting declarations,
40

40

00:02:02.235  -->  00:02:03.711
we want the last one to apply.
41

41

00:02:03.711  -->  00:02:05.339
In this case, there's nothing conflicting,
42

42

00:02:05.339  -->  00:02:08.205
so one has padding, one has flex direction.
43

43

00:02:08.205  -->  00:02:10.263
And so, there is nothing conflicting here.
44

44

00:02:10.263  -->  00:02:13.190
But if we had a padding in this media query here as well,
45

45

00:02:13.190  -->  00:02:15.384
then we would want this padding to apply
46

46

00:02:15.384  -->  00:02:17.394
and not the one for the larger screen.
47

47

00:02:17.394  -->  00:02:19.061
So let's check that.
48

48

00:02:20.363  -->  00:02:23.534
So moving below 600 and here we go.
49

49

00:02:23.534  -->  00:02:25.242
Now, of course there are some small fixes
50

50

00:02:25.242  -->  00:02:27.175
we have to perform, but the main goal
51

51

00:02:27.175  -->  00:02:28.706
is already accomplished.
52

52

00:02:28.706  -->  00:02:31.506
So one below the other right here.
53

53

00:02:31.506  -->  00:02:33.868
Now, we have to remove this margin here from the right
54

54

00:02:33.868  -->  00:02:36.718
and actually add some margin here at the bottom
55

55

00:02:36.718  -->  00:02:39.472
so to create some space here.
56

56

00:02:39.472  -->  00:02:42.555
Okay, and that is in the description.
57

57

00:02:44.177  -->  00:02:47.357
So, getting that from here, again, making this the second
58

58

00:02:47.357  -->  00:02:51.240
media query, we want the margin right to be zero.
59

59

00:02:51.240  -->  00:02:53.945
And so, right now we have these conflicting declarations
60

60

00:02:53.945  -->  00:02:55.804
that I was talking about earlier.
61

61

00:02:55.804  -->  00:02:57.564
And so, of course we want this one to apply
62

62

00:02:57.564  -->  00:02:59.833
and not the three.
63

63

00:02:59.833  -->  00:03:01.766
Okay, and then some margin at the bottom
64

64

00:03:01.766  -->  00:03:03.516
of three rem as well.
65

65

00:03:04.444  -->  00:03:06.535
And that should be good.
66

66

00:03:06.535  -->  00:03:09.702
All right, so, that looks a lot better
67

67

00:03:11.504  -->  00:03:14.027
and also future proof.
68

68

00:03:14.027  -->  00:03:17.487
Okay so, so for all these smaller width coming down here,
69

69

00:03:17.487  -->  00:03:19.517
this is still okay at all times.
70

70

00:03:19.517  -->  00:03:23.100
Okay, so we never have to touch this again.
71

71

00:03:25.226  -->  00:03:27.076
Now, the next thing that I am concerned about
72

72

00:03:27.076  -->  00:03:29.506
is this navigation here.
73

73

00:03:29.506  -->  00:03:32.503
So, for example, at this width here,
74

74

00:03:32.503  -->  00:03:36.670
so, at this 535, for example, there's already no more space
75

75

00:03:38.159  -->  00:03:40.874
to fit this entire text here.
76

76

00:03:40.874  -->  00:03:42.068
So car rental.
77

77

00:03:42.068  -->  00:03:44.301
So what we should do here in this media query
78

78

00:03:44.301  -->  00:03:46.698
which covers this part, which is the one we're
79

79

00:03:46.698  -->  00:03:49.404
working on right now, is to actually put
80

80

00:03:49.404  -->  00:03:52.509
the symbol here on top of the text.
81

81

00:03:52.509  -->  00:03:55.429
And so, we already know how to do that of course.
82

82

00:03:55.429  -->  00:03:57.000
That's not hard at all,
83

83

00:03:57.000  -->  00:03:59.450
because these two elements are inside of the link
84

84

00:03:59.450  -->  00:04:01.625
which is already a flexbox container
85

85

00:04:01.625  -->  00:04:03.331
Let me show that to you.
86

86

00:04:03.331  -->  00:04:06.081
So, this side nav link is already
87

87

00:04:07.347  -->  00:04:10.826
a flexbox container, yeah, here, so display flex.
88

88

00:04:10.826  -->  00:04:12.368
And so, all we have to do now is to change
89

89

00:04:12.368  -->  00:04:14.353
the flex direction once again.
90

90

00:04:14.353  -->  00:04:17.484
So, you see that when we're building a smaller version
91

91

00:04:17.484  -->  00:04:19.436
of the interface, a lot of times we change
92

92

00:04:19.436  -->  00:04:22.167
the flex direction from row to column.
93

93

00:04:22.167  -->  00:04:23.777
So that is probably the biggest advantage
94

94

00:04:23.777  -->  00:04:26.635
of using flexbox for responsive design.
95

95

00:04:26.635  -->  00:04:28.885
Okay, so let's now do that.
96

96

00:04:34.531  -->  00:04:35.948
So where is that?
97

97

00:04:37.427  -->  00:04:38.844
Yeah, here we go.
98

98

00:04:41.271  -->  00:04:43.121
So right here in the link,
99

99

00:04:43.121  -->  00:04:46.871
such as I showed you in the inspector before.
100

100

00:04:47.873  -->  00:04:50.123
So, flex direction, column.
101

101

00:04:51.667  -->  00:04:54.619
Now taking a look at this, well, it occupies
102

102

00:04:54.619  -->  00:04:56.518
way too much space now.
103

103

00:04:56.518  -->  00:04:59.268
So we should remove some padding.
104

104

00:05:02.875  -->  00:05:05.625
So, let's put it at one rem only.
105

105

00:05:09.350  -->  00:05:10.812
That's maybe a bit too less.
106

106

00:05:10.812  -->  00:05:13.619
Actually we could maybe leave it as it was.
107

107

00:05:13.619  -->  00:05:16.596
But now another thing here is this, this icon.
108

108

00:05:16.596  -->  00:05:20.586
So it's not really centered, even though we have
109

109

00:05:20.586  -->  00:05:22.785
a line item set to center here.
110

110

00:05:22.785  -->  00:05:24.437
So the problem actually is this margin
111

111

00:05:24.437  -->  00:05:28.163
that we have on the right side, so this right margin.
112

112

00:05:28.163  -->  00:05:31.520
So let's remove that and also slightly decrease here
113

113

00:05:31.520  -->  00:05:33.270
the size of the icon.
114

114

00:05:34.327  -->  00:05:36.732
So let's put this one back to 1.5.
115

115

00:05:36.732  -->  00:05:38.515
And what I actually wanted to decrease
116

116

00:05:38.515  -->  00:05:41.125
was the sides because otherwise there will not be
117

117

00:05:41.125  -->  00:05:44.657
enough space to actually fit the content
118

118

00:05:44.657  -->  00:05:46.849
when we first decrease the view port width.
119

119

00:05:46.849  -->  00:05:50.182
And so, now let's do these other changes
120

120

00:05:51.475  -->  00:05:53.120
that I was talking about.
121

121

00:05:53.120  -->  00:05:57.340
So the margin right of course needs to disappear.
122

122

00:05:57.340  -->  00:06:00.089
So we want no margin at all.
123

123

00:06:00.089  -->  00:06:03.372
And then let's slightly decrease the size
124

124

00:06:03.372  -->  00:06:05.789
like to 1.5 rem, for example,
125

125

00:06:06.899  -->  00:06:08.982
width and height as well.
126

126

00:06:10.424  -->  00:06:12.007
Let's check it out.
127

127

00:06:13.270  -->  00:06:15.441
And so, yeah, that looks a lot better.
128

128

00:06:15.441  -->  00:06:17.166
Just give it a couple of space
129

129

00:06:17.166  -->  00:06:19.249
between the icon and the text,
130

130

00:06:19.249  -->  00:06:21.311
and then it's already perfect after that.
131

131

00:06:21.311  -->  00:06:24.280
So just some small margin at the bottom.
132

132

00:06:24.280  -->  00:06:26.049
So let's just say margin right zero
133

133

00:06:26.049  -->  00:06:27.882
and then margin bottom
134

134

00:06:31.314  -->  00:06:33.421
is like seven pixels.
135

135

00:06:33.421  -->  00:06:36.666
All right, and so, yeah, that's perfect now.
136

136

00:06:36.666  -->  00:06:38.867
Now, next up, what is still way too huge
137

137

00:06:38.867  -->  00:06:41.888
is some parts here in this hotel overview.
138

138

00:06:41.888  -->  00:06:44.293
So this text is a bit too much.
139

139

00:06:44.293  -->  00:06:46.601
There's overall a bit too much space
140

140

00:06:46.601  -->  00:06:48.174
and also this is here too big.
141

141

00:06:48.174  -->  00:06:49.884
And so, it doesn't really look so natural here
142

142

00:06:49.884  -->  00:06:52.462
compared to the size of the rest of the elements
143

143

00:06:52.462  -->  00:06:54.492
on the page, but those should be
144

144

00:06:54.492  -->  00:06:56.357
a couple of very easy fixes.
145

145

00:06:56.357  -->  00:07:00.524
So, let's quickly do that and write some more media queries.
146

146

00:07:01.977  -->  00:07:04.128
So, legal, and here overview.
147

147

00:07:04.128  -->  00:07:06.238
So, first of all, I want to change the font size
148

148

00:07:06.238  -->  00:07:07.905
of this heading here
149

149

00:07:11.685  -->  00:07:14.372
to 1.8 rem, and then also the padding
150

150

00:07:14.372  -->  00:07:17.832
is a bit too much because this padding here is actually
151

151

00:07:17.832  -->  00:07:21.344
what defines the height of this entire overview element.
152

152

00:07:21.344  -->  00:07:23.907
And so, if we decrease the padding on top and bottom,
153

153

00:07:23.907  -->  00:07:27.657
like to 125 rem, then it all decreases a bit.
154

154

00:07:28.659  -->  00:07:31.256
Okay, and then the sides we can put two rem.
155

155

00:07:31.256  -->  00:07:32.874
And so, that should be better.
156

156

00:07:32.874  -->  00:07:34.391
Well, let's take a look at what else
157

157

00:07:34.391  -->  00:07:36.299
we can change here.
158

158

00:07:36.299  -->  00:07:38.498
So I was talking about the rating.
159

159

00:07:38.498  -->  00:07:41.915
So let's change the padding here as well.
160

160

00:07:43.349  -->  00:07:47.450
So, remember that rating is that pink container,
161

161

00:07:47.450  -->  00:07:50.261
okay, which contains both the average and account.
162

162

00:07:50.261  -->  00:07:53.291
And it has a lot of padding, so let's change that to zero
163

163

00:07:53.291  -->  00:07:54.291
and 1.5 rem.
164

164

00:07:55.828  -->  00:07:59.995
Then down here we can change the font size of this one
165

165

00:08:03.072  -->  00:08:04.405
to like 1.8 rem.
166

166

00:08:05.727  -->  00:08:09.831
And then also decrease this font size here further down
167

167

00:08:09.831  -->  00:08:13.664
to 0.8, or 0.5 actually, so just really small.
168

168

00:08:16.574  -->  00:08:18.896
Let's check that out.
169

169

00:08:18.896  -->  00:08:21.700
And, okay, so I think that looks a lot more natural
170

170

00:08:21.700  -->  00:08:24.417
right now, especially compared with this lower part
171

171

00:08:24.417  -->  00:08:26.105
that we have here.
172

172

00:08:26.105  -->  00:08:28.807
Okay, so, let's take a look at this.
173

173

00:08:28.807  -->  00:08:31.161
Decrease maybe the width a little bit.
174

174

00:08:31.161  -->  00:08:34.059
And I think it looks pretty good still.
175

175

00:08:34.059  -->  00:08:37.908
Well, maybe except here in the top, so here in the header.
176

176

00:08:37.908  -->  00:08:40.844
That starts looking a bit too cramped.
177

177

00:08:40.844  -->  00:08:43.319
Now, we could of course leave it like this.
178

178

00:08:43.319  -->  00:08:46.003
But there is something else that I want to show you.
179

179

00:08:46.003  -->  00:08:48.651
Okay, I want to show you some more flexbox
180

180

00:08:48.651  -->  00:08:51.847
because, as you've seen probably, I really like it.
181

181

00:08:51.847  -->  00:08:53.752
And so, I keep wanting to show you more and more
182

182

00:08:53.752  -->  00:08:55.075
and more of it.
183

183

00:08:55.075  -->  00:08:57.506
Okay, so let's just create a new breakpoint here
184

184

00:08:57.506  -->  00:08:59.861
at let's say 500 pixels.
185

185

00:08:59.861  -->  00:09:02.782
And then we can move the search bar down here.
186

186

00:09:02.782  -->  00:09:05.696
Okay, so like below these two.
187

187

00:09:05.696  -->  00:09:08.126
So we have the logo, then we have this user nav,
188

188

00:09:08.126  -->  00:09:10.772
and then after that, let's put the search bar.
189

189

00:09:10.772  -->  00:09:12.544
And this way, we can use something
190

190

00:09:12.544  -->  00:09:14.886
that I showed you in the intro lectures
191

191

00:09:14.886  -->  00:09:17.247
but that we haven't used in the project yet,
192

192

00:09:17.247  -->  00:09:19.480
and that is the order property.
193

193

00:09:19.480  -->  00:09:20.754
Remember that one?
194

194

00:09:20.754  -->  00:09:22.352
So let's create a new breakpoint here
195

195

00:09:22.352  -->  00:09:24.781
at 500 pixels, which is where this starts
196

196

00:09:24.781  -->  00:09:27.114
to look a bit weird up here.
197

197

00:09:31.995  -->  00:09:34.995
So, 500 pixels, which equals 31.25m.
198

198

00:09:42.203  -->  00:09:45.192
Okay, so that's 500 pixels, and I'm gonna call this one
199

199

00:09:45.192  -->  00:09:49.890
the smallest, so we have the largest and the smallest.
200

200

00:09:49.890  -->  00:09:51.946
So let's copy a media query from here.
201

201

00:09:51.946  -->  00:09:54.395
So you see I really like to always copy this.
202

202

00:09:54.395  -->  00:09:58.478
It makes it a bit easier and faster to write out.
203

203

00:09:58.478  -->  00:10:02.645
So, smallest, and then actually on the search bar as well.
204

204

00:10:05.860  -->  00:10:07.614
This is not what we want.
205

205

00:10:07.614  -->  00:10:09.565
What I wanted to show you was the search bar.
206

206

00:10:09.565  -->  00:10:11.805
And, yeah, that's in the components of course.
207

207

00:10:11.805  -->  00:10:15.222
So let's move over there, and here it is.
208

208

00:10:17.058  -->  00:10:19.129
So, as I was saying, we want to move the search bar
209

209

00:10:19.129  -->  00:10:22.191
to the third position, so to the last position.
210

210

00:10:22.191  -->  00:10:24.827
Now, do you remember what I told you in the intro lectures
211

211

00:10:24.827  -->  00:10:27.368
about the default value for the order?
212

212

00:10:27.368  -->  00:10:29.063
Well, it's usually zero.
213

213

00:10:29.063  -->  00:10:31.282
And that means that right now the logo and the search
214

214

00:10:31.282  -->  00:10:34.815
and the user nav all have a order of zero.
215

215

00:10:34.815  -->  00:10:37.398
So if I set the search to order
216

216

00:10:39.797  -->  00:10:43.102
of one, then it will be the last one, right?
217

217

00:10:43.102  -->  00:10:46.171
And so it will move all the way to the end.
218

218

00:10:46.171  -->  00:10:48.612
And of course this has to be the smallest.
219

219

00:10:48.612  -->  00:10:50.695
But now that should work.
220

220

00:10:51.963  -->  00:10:53.629
And, yeah, actually, it is working.
221

221

00:10:53.629  -->  00:10:56.464
So, now it's the last element and we can confirm that.
222

222

00:10:56.464  -->  00:10:58.224
So on the larger screen, that's not happening,
223

223

00:10:58.224  -->  00:11:02.313
and as soon as we hit 500, it moves, so great.
224

224

00:11:02.313  -->  00:11:03.911
But remember what we wanted to do here
225

225

00:11:03.911  -->  00:11:06.731
was to actually move this one down a bit.
226

226

00:11:06.731  -->  00:11:09.622
So basically move it to a new row.
227

227

00:11:09.622  -->  00:11:12.019
And how can we do that with flexbox?
228

228

00:11:12.019  -->  00:11:14.684
Well, it's actually very simple.
229

229

00:11:14.684  -->  00:11:19.161
It is just flex wrap and then set it to wrap.
230

230

00:11:19.161  -->  00:11:20.807
So now we are allowing the flex items
231

231

00:11:20.807  -->  00:11:23.665
to wrap into a new line if they don't have enough space
232

232

00:11:23.665  -->  00:11:25.233
in the flex container.
233

233

00:11:25.233  -->  00:11:27.793
Okay, so let's check it.
234

234

00:11:27.793  -->  00:11:29.755
And, actually, it's not really happening anything right now,
235

235

00:11:29.755  -->  00:11:32.483
because for now it looks like there's still enough space.
236

236

00:11:32.483  -->  00:11:35.303
So we have to wait a bit until it moves down.
237

237

00:11:35.303  -->  00:11:38.145
Okay, so starting at this width,
238

238

00:11:38.145  -->  00:11:40.627
that's exactly what happens.
239

239

00:11:40.627  -->  00:11:44.794
Okay, but we want this to start right at 500 pixels.
240

240

00:11:45.764  -->  00:11:48.045
Okay, and so, what do we have to do?
241

241

00:11:48.045  -->  00:11:49.784
Well, we just have to make the search bar
242

242

00:11:49.784  -->  00:11:50.784
a bit wider.
243

243

00:11:52.184  -->  00:11:54.180
So, let's do that.
244

244

00:11:54.180  -->  00:11:55.964
Back to our component.
245

245

00:11:55.964  -->  00:11:57.797
And all we have to say
246

246

00:11:59.108  -->  00:12:02.288
is that we want it to have a flex basis of 100%.
247

247

00:12:02.288  -->  00:12:04.284
So, basically the width of the element
248

248

00:12:04.284  -->  00:12:05.925
should be 100%.
249

249

00:12:05.925  -->  00:12:07.985
It shouldn't shrink, and it shouldn't grow.
250

250

00:12:07.985  -->  00:12:12.152
And so, right now, it should probably already be working.
251

251

00:12:13.289  -->  00:12:16.202
And, yeah, indeed, it's not occupying this entire width here
252

252

00:12:16.202  -->  00:12:18.451
at least all the here until the side,
253

253

00:12:18.451  -->  00:12:21.833
which then expands as soon as we focus the input field.
254

254

00:12:21.833  -->  00:12:24.484
All right, now we just have some spacing issues here
255

255

00:12:24.484  -->  00:12:27.170
to solve because the header is no longer tall enough
256

256

00:12:27.170  -->  00:12:29.198
to fit all this content.
257

257

00:12:29.198  -->  00:12:33.365
So, let's come back here and simply increase the height
258

258

00:12:34.692  -->  00:12:37.609
of the element to let's say 11 rem,
259

259

00:12:38.956  -->  00:12:41.124
or we can even do a bit more so we can see
260

260

00:12:41.124  -->  00:12:42.405
the effect even more.
261

261

00:12:42.405  -->  00:12:45.822
So let's see what is going to happen now.
262

262

00:12:47.274  -->  00:12:49.756
And, all right, so that gives a lot more space.
263

263

00:12:49.756  -->  00:12:52.577
Now, do you still remember from the flexbox intro lectures
264

264

00:12:52.577  -->  00:12:55.514
how we could control the space between the rows
265

265

00:12:55.514  -->  00:12:57.376
of the container?
266

266

00:12:57.376  -->  00:12:59.281
There was a property just for that.
267

267

00:12:59.281  -->  00:13:01.781
And it's called align content.
268

268

00:13:03.901  -->  00:13:06.231
So let's experiment with that.
269

269

00:13:06.231  -->  00:13:08.336
And first set it to center.
270

270

00:13:08.336  -->  00:13:11.169
So let's take a look what happens.
271

271

00:13:12.456  -->  00:13:15.268
And, okay, so they are now really together here,
272

272

00:13:15.268  -->  00:13:17.289
these two rows, so this row first one here,
273

273

00:13:17.289  -->  00:13:19.503
which is first two flex items, and this one,
274

274

00:13:19.503  -->  00:13:22.672
they are basically vertically centered now.
275

275

00:13:22.672  -->  00:13:26.839
Okay, but what we want here is really just space around.
276

276

00:13:27.752  -->  00:13:29.731
Okay, so you can experiment with this a bit
277

277

00:13:29.731  -->  00:13:32.053
to see the different possibilities, but I think
278

278

00:13:32.053  -->  00:13:33.925
that this one is the best.
279

279

00:13:33.925  -->  00:13:37.139
Well, actually, let's experiment with that right now.
280

280

00:13:37.139  -->  00:13:40.306
So, we could space between, of course.
281

281

00:13:42.064  -->  00:13:44.813
And what do you think this will do?
282

282

00:13:44.813  -->  00:13:47.682
Ah, you already see it, so pushes both to the edges.
283

283

00:13:47.682  -->  00:13:50.702
So that space between, but that's not really ideal here
284

284

00:13:50.702  -->  00:13:52.420
in this case.
285

285

00:13:52.420  -->  00:13:54.025
Then we also have flex.
286

286

00:13:54.025  -->  00:13:57.442
And as always, so pushing both rows down to the end
287

287

00:13:57.442  -->  00:13:58.650
of the container.
288

288

00:13:58.650  -->  00:14:02.160
And flex start of course, but both are not really
289

289

00:14:02.160  -->  00:14:03.090
what we want.
290

290

00:14:03.090  -->  00:14:05.994
What we want is space between.
291

291

00:14:05.994  -->  00:14:09.305
We want space around, not space between.
292

292

00:14:09.305  -->  00:14:13.472
Okay, and actually, this is probably a bit too high.
293

293

00:14:14.409  -->  00:14:16.492
So, let's make it 11 ram.
294

294

00:14:17.427  -->  00:14:19.332
And, yeah, that's a bit better.
295

295

00:14:19.332  -->  00:14:21.776
Now, just to fix this a bit weird looking
296

296

00:14:21.776  -->  00:14:25.562
input element here with these rounded corners,
297

297

00:14:25.562  -->  00:14:27.592
which is also not really centered,
298

298

00:14:27.592  -->  00:14:31.025
let's just fix that, okay, and we're gonna do that
299

299

00:14:31.025  -->  00:14:33.549
by simply setting a background color here
300

300

00:14:33.549  -->  00:14:35.792
on the entire search.
301

301

00:14:35.792  -->  00:14:37.869
Okay, right now we have this background color
302

302

00:14:37.869  -->  00:14:40.193
on the input only, but we can also put it
303

303

00:14:40.193  -->  00:14:42.425
on the entire search element.
304

304

00:14:42.425  -->  00:14:44.675
And so, that should fix it.
305

305

00:14:46.306  -->  00:14:49.191
Okay, so I think that looks a bit more natural.
306

306

00:14:49.191  -->  00:14:51.129
All right, so let's just take a look
307

307

00:14:51.129  -->  00:14:53.901
at a couple of different devices here.
308

308

00:14:53.901  -->  00:14:57.637
So that's the design on the iPad in portrait mode,
309

309

00:14:57.637  -->  00:15:00.536
then in landscape mode it looks like this.
310

310

00:15:00.536  -->  00:15:02.602
It looks pretty good, if you ask me.
311

311

00:15:02.602  -->  00:15:04.870
Then we have the iPad Pro, for example,
312

312

00:15:04.870  -->  00:15:07.839
and that's not really ideal with all the space down here.
313

313

00:15:07.839  -->  00:15:11.279
But I think we can live with that.
314

314

00:15:11.279  -->  00:15:12.763
Then this is in the landscape version.
315

315

00:15:12.763  -->  00:15:13.784
And that's a huge screen.
316

316

00:15:13.784  -->  00:15:17.985
And so, it looks almost like a normal computer.
317

317

00:15:17.985  -->  00:15:20.859
And then there is this iPhone here.
318

318

00:15:20.859  -->  00:15:23.261
And here things are not really perfect, as you can see.
319

319

00:15:23.261  -->  00:15:26.006
But I think we've written enough media queries.
320

320

00:15:26.006  -->  00:15:28.248
And so, if you want to fix that for yourself,
321

321

00:15:28.248  -->  00:15:30.108
then please go ahead and do that,
322

322

00:15:30.108  -->  00:15:31.843
it would be a great exercise.
323

323

00:15:31.843  -->  00:15:34.155
But I think I already showed you more than enough
324

324

00:15:34.155  -->  00:15:37.117
how media queries work, and so that would be a great job
325

325

00:15:37.117  -->  00:15:39.910
to do for yourself and to just train a bit
326

326

00:15:39.910  -->  00:15:42.789
more with the media queries.
327

327

00:15:42.789  -->  00:15:45.456
So we also have the Galaxy here.
328

328

00:15:46.487  -->  00:15:50.029
And so, for phones, it's not really 100% perfect,
329

329

00:15:50.029  -->  00:15:53.370
as you can see, but again, please feel free
330

330

00:15:53.370  -->  00:15:56.735
to fix these smaller issues by yourself.
331

331

00:15:56.735  -->  00:15:58.993
Because for now, this is actually all that I
332

332

00:15:58.993  -->  00:16:00.491
had to show you.
333

333

00:16:00.491  -->  00:16:04.374
So, flexbox is once again perfect for responsive design
334

334

00:16:04.374  -->  00:16:07.584
and especially deflects direction properties set to column.
335

335

00:16:07.584  -->  00:16:09.733
So that's like a real life saver.
336

336

00:16:09.733  -->  00:16:12.185
Saves us a lot of work, a lot of time.
337

337

00:16:12.185  -->  00:16:15.470
All right, so we're practically done here with the project.
338

338

00:16:15.470  -->  00:16:18.136
Let's just jump into the next and final video,
339

339

00:16:18.136  -->  00:16:20.406
where I just want to make some final considerations
340

340

00:16:20.406  -->  00:16:22.573
and wrap up this project.
