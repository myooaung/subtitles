<v ->In this lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.421  -->  00:00:04.768
we are gonna be building the overall layout
3

3

00:00:04.768  -->  00:00:06.587
of our website.
4

4

00:00:06.587  -->  00:00:07.910
And so, in this lecture,
5

5

00:00:07.910  -->  00:00:11.038
you're gonna learn how to build a complex and modern layout
6

6

00:00:11.038  -->  00:00:13.990
using advanced CSS Grid techniques.
7

7

00:00:13.990  -->  00:00:15.250
And so, what this means is
8

8

00:00:15.250  -->  00:00:17.369
that you now will actually apply the concepts
9

9

00:00:17.369  -->  00:00:19.180
that you learned in our last section
10

10

00:00:19.180  -->  00:00:21.368
to a real-world project,
11

11

00:00:21.368  -->  00:00:23.911
and you're gonna learn how to choose different row
12

12

00:00:23.911  -->  00:00:27.349
and column track sizes for different types of content
13

13

00:00:27.349  -->  00:00:29.312
in a real-world context.
14

14

00:00:29.312  -->  00:00:32.202
So this is actually gonna be a rather complex lecture,
15

15

00:00:32.202  -->  00:00:34.763
and so, let's get started.
16

16

00:00:34.763  -->  00:00:37.516
And we start by analyzing the overall layout
17

17

00:00:37.516  -->  00:00:39.069
that we want to build.
18

18

00:00:39.069  -->  00:00:40.932
So the first thing that you notice right away
19

19

00:00:40.932  -->  00:00:42.978
is this sidebar here on the left side,
20

20

00:00:42.978  -->  00:00:45.371
which goes all the way from the top of the page
21

21

00:00:45.371  -->  00:00:48.535
to the beginning, so all the way until down there,
22

22

00:00:48.535  -->  00:00:50.833
so that is the first part of the layout.
23

23

00:00:50.833  -->  00:00:53.632
Then, we have this part here, which is the header,
24

24

00:00:53.632  -->  00:00:55.046
and then, here on the right side,
25

25

00:00:55.046  -->  00:00:58.716
the top three realtors that work for the Nexter company.
26

26

00:00:58.716  -->  00:00:59.549
Okay?
27

27

00:00:59.549  -->  00:01:01.698
So this is another part of the layout.
28

28

00:01:01.698  -->  00:01:04.579
Then, down here, we have this features here
29

29

00:01:04.579  -->  00:01:07.268
of the company, so basically describing
30

30

00:01:07.268  -->  00:01:09.002
how the company works, and so,
31

31

00:01:09.002  -->  00:01:11.231
that is another part of the layout.
32

32

00:01:11.231  -->  00:01:12.434
Then, coming down here,
33

33

00:01:12.434  -->  00:01:15.218
we have this testimonial section here
34

34

00:01:15.218  -->  00:01:16.693
with this part on the left side,
35

35

00:01:16.693  -->  00:01:18.359
and then, this part on the right side.
36

36

00:01:18.359  -->  00:01:20.823
And so, this basically is like a testimonial
37

37

00:01:20.823  -->  00:01:23.300
of some people who found their perfect home,
38

38

00:01:23.300  -->  00:01:25.246
and so, I call this one here a story.
39

39

00:01:25.246  -->  00:01:27.265
And so, this here is one part of the layout,
40

40

00:01:27.265  -->  00:01:29.728
which is like the gallery, like the pictures,
41

41

00:01:29.728  -->  00:01:31.701
and then, this here is the content of the story,
42

42

00:01:31.701  -->  00:01:32.962
on the right side.
43

43

00:01:32.962  -->  00:01:34.753
You see that they have this different background,
44

44

00:01:34.753  -->  00:01:38.258
of course, and so, we can treat them as two parts
45

45

00:01:38.258  -->  00:01:39.420
of the layout.
46

46

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:42.017
Then, down here, we have the next section of the page,
47

47

00:01:42.017  -->  00:01:43.280
and that's these homes,
48

48

00:01:43.280  -->  00:01:47.344
so different homes that we can buy at this company.
49

49

00:01:47.344  -->  00:01:49.440
Then, next up, we have this section here,
50

50

00:01:49.440  -->  00:01:51.696
which is a typical application of Grid,
51

51

00:01:51.696  -->  00:01:53.502
which is this gallery,
52

52

00:01:53.502  -->  00:01:55.517
and then, finally, the footer.
53

53

00:01:55.517  -->  00:01:56.350
All right?
54

54

00:01:56.350  -->  00:01:59.348
So we have a total of eight parts in our layout.
55

55

00:01:59.348  -->  00:02:00.906
So the first one here, the side part,
56

56

00:02:00.906  -->  00:02:04.073
and with the footer, two, three, four,
57

57

00:02:04.908  -->  00:02:07.330
and then, we can treat this here as one,
58

58

00:02:07.330  -->  00:02:08.997
so five, six, seven,
59

59

00:02:10.893  -->  00:02:12.939
and then, here, on the side,
60

60

00:02:12.939  -->  00:02:13.890
number eight.
61

61

00:02:13.890  -->  00:02:15.401
So let's now go to a markup
62

62

00:02:15.401  -->  00:02:17.818
and put all of them in there.
63

63

00:02:19.458  -->  00:02:22.179
So this is our HTML, and you see
64

64

00:02:22.179  -->  00:02:24.828
that I already put the container class here
65

65

00:02:24.828  -->  00:02:26.968
on the body tag, and so, that is going
66

66

00:02:26.968  -->  00:02:29.478
to be our Grid container, and all of these parts
67

67

00:02:29.478  -->  00:02:33.112
of the layout that we just saw are then the Grid items,
68

68

00:02:33.112  -->  00:02:35.304
which we're then gonna place on the Grid,
69

69

00:02:35.304  -->  00:02:37.971
so let's start with the sidebar.
70

70

00:02:39.139  -->  00:02:40.639
So we're using a div for that.
71

71

00:02:40.639  -->  00:02:43.848
For now, I'm just gonna put the name of each part
72

72

00:02:43.848  -->  00:02:47.365
of each module, let's say, in here.
73

73

00:02:47.365  -->  00:02:49.243
So the sidebar, then the header,
74

74

00:02:49.243  -->  00:02:52.410
and let's use the header HTML5 element
75

75

00:02:53.443  -->  00:02:56.610
with the class header, and, of course,
76

76

00:02:57.778  -->  00:03:00.002
rewrite header in here.
77

77

00:03:00.002  -->  00:03:03.169
Then, we have a div with the realtors.
78

78

00:03:05.905  -->  00:03:08.238
Okay, so top three realtors.
79

79

00:03:10.168  -->  00:03:12.403
Then, we have the features section,
80

80

00:03:12.403  -->  00:03:15.581
so I may actually call this a section,
81

81

00:03:15.581  -->  00:03:17.248
so section features.
82

82

00:03:19.957  -->  00:03:21.035
All right.
83

83

00:03:21.035  -->  00:03:25.421
Then, next up, we have the story, remember?
84

84

00:03:25.421  -->  00:03:27.432
So let me show that to you again.
85

85

00:03:27.432  -->  00:03:31.042
So the story is basically these two things.
86

86

00:03:31.042  -->  00:03:33.156
Now, in order for these to be Grid items,
87

87

00:03:33.156  -->  00:03:36.621
each of the sides has to be a different element, right?
88

88

00:03:36.621  -->  00:03:39.719
And so, we say that these two are part of a story,
89

89

00:03:39.719  -->  00:03:42.684
but this left side here is the pictures,
90

90

00:03:42.684  -->  00:03:45.608
and this right side here is the content,
91

91

00:03:45.608  -->  00:03:48.434
and so, each of these will be a different Grid item.
92

92

00:03:48.434  -->  00:03:49.319
Okay?
93

93

00:03:49.319  -->  00:03:53.486
And so, let's use a div for that, and then, story,
94

94

00:03:54.682  -->  00:03:56.459
so that is like the blog,
95

95

00:03:56.459  -->  00:04:00.759
and then, we use the element pictures, okay?
96

96

00:04:00.759  -->  00:04:03.320
And it's perfectly legal to do it like this,
97

97

00:04:03.320  -->  00:04:06.644
so it's no problem having to block anti-element
98

98

00:04:06.644  -->  00:04:08.770
without having a parent blog.
99

99

00:04:08.770  -->  00:04:11.705
So we know that these two are part of the story blog,
100

100

00:04:11.705  -->  00:04:13.606
but there's not really an element for that,
101

101

00:04:13.606  -->  00:04:17.091
because we want both of these elements to be Grid items.
102

102

00:04:17.091  -->  00:04:17.924
Okay?
103

103

00:04:17.924  -->  00:04:19.168
Does that make sense?
104

104

00:04:19.168  -->  00:04:23.335
So we have the story pictures and the story content,
105

105

00:04:27.619  -->  00:04:30.619
so story content and story pictures.
106

106

00:04:33.777  -->  00:04:37.694
Next up, we have then a section with the homes.
107

107

00:04:40.563  -->  00:04:43.326
Then, we have the gallery,
108

108

00:04:43.326  -->  00:04:44.909
so section gallery,
109

109

00:04:47.890  -->  00:04:50.390
and then, finally, the footer.
110

110

00:04:55.216  -->  00:04:57.994
Okay, and so, that's our markup structure.
111

111

00:04:57.994  -->  00:04:59.419
Let's take a look at that if it's already
112

112

00:04:59.419  -->  00:05:02.928
in our HTML or in our page, actually, and so, yeah.
113

113

00:05:02.928  -->  00:05:04.139
So here we go.
114

114

00:05:04.139  -->  00:05:07.107
That is the content of our page for now.
115

115

00:05:07.107  -->  00:05:08.583
Let's now go ahead and actually give each
116

116

00:05:08.583  -->  00:05:10.455
of them here a background color
117

117

00:05:10.455  -->  00:05:15.262
so that we can better see what's actually going on here.
118

118

00:05:15.262  -->  00:05:17.258
So remember that if you already have a file for each
119

119

00:05:17.258  -->  00:05:20.092
of them here in the Sass folder,
120

120

00:05:20.092  -->  00:05:22.969
and so, let's open up each of them one-by-one.
121

121

00:05:22.969  -->  00:05:25.886
Okay, so sidebar, background color,
122

122

00:05:27.915  -->  00:05:29.385
and I'm actually gonna use the primary color
123

123

00:05:29.385  -->  00:05:32.835
for this one, because that will be the final color,
124

124

00:05:32.835  -->  00:05:35.796
actually, so color, primary.
125

125

00:05:35.796  -->  00:05:37.820
Let's take a look if that works already,
126

126

00:05:37.820  -->  00:05:41.496
and, yeah, so that's our primary color.
127

127

00:05:41.496  -->  00:05:43.829
Next up, we have the header.
128

128

00:05:49.632  -->  00:05:51.034
And so, let's use another color here
129

129

00:05:51.034  -->  00:05:55.201
from our variables here, so let's use this gray color,
130

130

00:05:57.833  -->  00:05:58.666
right?
131

131

00:05:59.720  -->  00:06:01.828
So we're gonna change most of this later,
132

132

00:06:01.828  -->  00:06:04.468
but that's just so we can see what's going on.
133

133

00:06:04.468  -->  00:06:06.659
Next is the realtors,
134

134

00:06:06.659  -->  00:06:08.076
and so, realtors,
135

135

00:06:13.332  -->  00:06:14.749
background color,
136

136

00:06:17.196  -->  00:06:18.928
and, here, I actually used the definitive color,
137

137

00:06:18.928  -->  00:06:23.095
so this is color secondary, and it is this dark blue, right?
138

138

00:06:25.191  -->  00:06:26.639
So let's see.
139

139

00:06:26.639  -->  00:06:28.355
And it's actually not really there,
140

140

00:06:28.355  -->  00:06:33.156
so this is here, the dark blue color that I mean, okay?
141

141

00:06:33.156  -->  00:06:36.117
So let's see what's going on here.
142

142

00:06:36.117  -->  00:06:39.145
Yeah, it's just a small typo over here,
143

143

00:06:39.145  -->  00:06:41.496
so let's save and close.
144

144

00:06:41.496  -->  00:06:43.756
Now, it should be there, and, of course, it is.
145

145

00:06:43.756  -->  00:06:46.721
So, now, the features, and let's use, for example,
146

146

00:06:46.721  -->  00:06:51.259
this color here as the background color in here,
147

147

00:06:51.259  -->  00:06:52.259
so features.
148

148

00:06:59.684  -->  00:07:01.186
Save it and close it.
149

149

00:07:01.186  -->  00:07:03.436
Next up, we have the story.
150

150

00:07:06.084  -->  00:07:09.211
So the story is the name of the blog, remember that,
151

151

00:07:09.211  -->  00:07:12.246
but we actually don't even have an element called story,
152

152

00:07:12.246  -->  00:07:15.120
but what we do have is an element called story pictures
153

153

00:07:15.120  -->  00:07:17.135
and one called story content, right?
154

154

00:07:17.135  -->  00:07:19.298
And so, we're gonna build these selectors,
155

155

00:07:19.298  -->  00:07:21.698
like we've been doing throughout all the other projects
156

156

00:07:21.698  -->  00:07:24.350
in the course, so using this Sass way.
157

157

00:07:24.350  -->  00:07:28.517
So the and, and then, underscore, underscore, pictures,
158

158

00:07:29.761  -->  00:07:33.928
and this, of course, will translate into story pictures.
159

159

00:07:36.673  -->  00:07:40.486
So let's use color primary here again,
160

160

00:07:40.486  -->  00:07:44.584
and, again, this doesn't really matter at this point.
161

161

00:07:44.584  -->  00:07:48.751
It's just so that we can see the boxes a bit better, okay?
162

162

00:07:49.850  -->  00:07:52.662
Now, in this case, let's actually use the real color,
163

163

00:07:52.662  -->  00:07:54.995
which will be this one here,
164

164

00:08:00.785  -->  00:08:02.574
so with this light gray,
165

165

00:08:02.574  -->  00:08:05.725
close it, let's check it out, and yeah.
166

166

00:08:05.725  -->  00:08:08.915
So you see that all of the colors are here, and so,
167

167

00:08:08.915  -->  00:08:11.915
now, next up is the homes, so homes.
168

168

00:08:24.087  -->  00:08:27.062
So let's use the blue color again.
169

169

00:08:27.062  -->  00:08:29.200
And, actually, the same for the footer,
170

170

00:08:29.200  -->  00:08:33.283
so let's just copy this code here for the footer,
171

171

00:08:35.227  -->  00:08:38.360
because that's actually also the definitive final color,
172

172

00:08:38.360  -->  00:08:40.527
and then, for the gallery,
173

173

00:08:47.737  -->  00:08:51.820
the background color, let's, again, use this one.
174

174

00:08:54.773  -->  00:08:56.702
Give it a save and close,
175

175

00:08:56.702  -->  00:08:58.925
and this one, we can close, as well,
176

176

00:08:58.925  -->  00:09:00.587
and so, let's check it out.
177

177

00:09:00.587  -->  00:09:02.550
And so, yep, each of them now has
178

178

00:09:02.550  -->  00:09:04.662
their own background color.
179

179

00:09:04.662  -->  00:09:07.840
Okay, and so, let's now actually start with the Grid part
180

180

00:09:07.840  -->  00:09:08.790
of building this layout.
181

181

00:09:08.790  -->  00:09:12.652
So that's the most exciting part, right?
182

182

00:09:12.652  -->  00:09:17.454
So remember that this element here had this container class,
183

183

00:09:17.454  -->  00:09:20.731
so this body element, and this body element is
184

184

00:09:20.731  -->  00:09:23.891
what actually will be our overall Grid container, right?
185

185

00:09:23.891  -->  00:09:25.991
And so, I gave it a class container so
186

186

00:09:25.991  -->  00:09:27.490
that we can now style it.
187

187

00:09:27.490  -->  00:09:30.077
I could've done it directly in the body here, of course,
188

188

00:09:30.077  -->  00:09:31.800
but I think it's a bit more cleaner
189

189

00:09:31.800  -->  00:09:34.137
to actually use this container class.
190

190

00:09:34.137  -->  00:09:36.074
So it is a great container, and so, we start
191

191

00:09:36.074  -->  00:09:38.487
by saying display Grid,
192

192

00:09:38.487  -->  00:09:40.784
so nothing new here at this point.
193

193

00:09:40.784  -->  00:09:43.439
And so, let's now start with the rows,
194

194

00:09:43.439  -->  00:09:47.606
so Grid, template rows, and so, let's take a look now
195

195

00:09:50.173  -->  00:09:52.340
at our final design again.
196

196

00:09:53.238  -->  00:09:56.174
So let's check out how many rows we actually want,
197

197

00:09:56.174  -->  00:09:58.835
so the first row is this one here, right?
198

198

00:09:58.835  -->  00:10:00.437
And let me show you that the height
199

199

00:10:00.437  -->  00:10:02.781
of this row here is actually a percentage
200

200

00:10:02.781  -->  00:10:04.859
of the viewport height, okay?
201

201

00:10:04.859  -->  00:10:07.491
So if I decreased this here, then you will see
202

202

00:10:07.491  -->  00:10:10.893
that the height of the container adapts as well, right?
203

203

00:10:10.893  -->  00:10:14.840
And so, the size of this row here is in viewport hide units,
204

204

00:10:14.840  -->  00:10:19.042
so let's actually go over there and define that already.
205

205

00:10:19.042  -->  00:10:21.569
So the first row check should have a height
206

206

00:10:21.569  -->  00:10:23.486
of 80 viewport heights.
207

207

00:10:24.719  -->  00:10:27.383
Okay, so, right now, we have an explicit Grid
208

208

00:10:27.383  -->  00:10:29.480
with only one row, right?
209

209

00:10:29.480  -->  00:10:31.417
And all the other items that will be added
210

210

00:10:31.417  -->  00:10:33.378
in the implicit Grid, so the items
211

211

00:10:33.378  -->  00:10:37.044
that don't have any space here in this one by one Grid.
212

212

00:10:37.044  -->  00:10:40.644
Okay, so, right now, we only defined one row.
213

213

00:10:40.644  -->  00:10:43.680
So let's take a look at that, and yeah.
214

214

00:10:43.680  -->  00:10:45.161
So that's the first one.
215

215

00:10:45.161  -->  00:10:47.193
Right now, it says here that it's the sidebar,
216

216

00:10:47.193  -->  00:10:49.522
but, of course, we're gonna change that in a second.
217

217

00:10:49.522  -->  00:10:51.520
What matters here is that the first row
218

218

00:10:51.520  -->  00:10:53.759
now has this 80 viewport.
219

219

00:10:53.759  -->  00:10:55.680
Let's actually decrease that, and so,
220

220

00:10:55.680  -->  00:10:58.233
you can see that it's actually working.
221

221

00:10:58.233  -->  00:10:59.883
Actually, let's go back here and take a look
222

222

00:10:59.883  -->  00:11:03.371
at the second row, so the second row is this one here,
223

223

00:11:03.371  -->  00:11:07.960
so all of this, and so, this one will contain this part
224

224

00:11:07.960  -->  00:11:09.411
of the features.
225

225

00:11:09.411  -->  00:11:12.172
Now, how do we want this row here to be sized?
226

226

00:11:12.172  -->  00:11:13.536
Well, actually, we simply wanted
227

227

00:11:13.536  -->  00:11:15.673
to contain here this content,
228

228

00:11:15.673  -->  00:11:17.487
and if we increase this content, we, of course,
229

229

00:11:17.487  -->  00:11:20.411
want this row here to grow with it,
230

230

00:11:20.411  -->  00:11:23.187
so let's say that the content grows like this,
231

231

00:11:23.187  -->  00:11:25.552
and it's a bit larger now, and so, of course,
232

232

00:11:25.552  -->  00:11:29.427
we want the row to grow with it, right?
233

233

00:11:29.427  -->  00:11:30.839
So how do we do that?
234

234

00:11:30.839  -->  00:11:32.678
Well, we actually already did it in one
235

235

00:11:32.678  -->  00:11:35.951
of the intro lectures, and so, what we can see here is
236

236

00:11:35.951  -->  00:11:39.185
that we wanted to have the min content.
237

237

00:11:39.185  -->  00:11:40.018
Okay?
238

238

00:11:40.018  -->  00:11:43.170
Now, we could also put auto here, like this,
239

239

00:11:43.170  -->  00:11:45.971
and auto is actually the default
240

240

00:11:45.971  -->  00:11:48.397
if you do not specify anything, so auto, basically,
241

241

00:11:48.397  -->  00:11:52.308
also means that it adapts to the content, okay?
242

242

00:11:52.308  -->  00:11:53.831
And, in this case, it really is the same,
243

243

00:11:53.831  -->  00:11:56.257
so we can write min content or auto here.
244

244

00:11:56.257  -->  00:11:58.518
It really doesn't matter, because, either way,
245

245

00:11:58.518  -->  00:12:00.858
it's gonna mean that there will be enough space
246

246

00:12:00.858  -->  00:12:03.259
to fit all the content, okay?
247

247

00:12:03.259  -->  00:12:06.507
So min content, and that's not gonna change anything here,
248

248

00:12:06.507  -->  00:12:08.321
so it just looks the same, because, right now,
249

249

00:12:08.321  -->  00:12:12.488
the content is just this text in the second row, okay?
250

250

00:12:13.821  -->  00:12:15.820
So let's go over to the third row,
251

251

00:12:15.820  -->  00:12:18.425
and this row here is actually not a function
252

252

00:12:18.425  -->  00:12:21.683
of the viewport height, but the viewport width,
253

253

00:12:21.683  -->  00:12:23.747
so let me show that to you again,
254

254

00:12:23.747  -->  00:12:27.096
and you see that, as we decrease the viewport width,
255

255

00:12:27.096  -->  00:12:31.508
the size of these boxes decrease, so of this row here,
256

256

00:12:31.508  -->  00:12:33.576
is increasing and decreasing, and so, basically,
257

257

00:12:33.576  -->  00:12:35.789
adapting here to the viewport,
258

258

00:12:35.789  -->  00:12:38.694
and so, that means that we're using the viewport width unit,
259

259

00:12:38.694  -->  00:12:40.171
so let's actually do that,
260

260

00:12:40.171  -->  00:12:44.338
and what I did here is to use 40% of the viewport width.
261

261

00:12:45.631  -->  00:12:48.058
And so, by now, you're seeing how important it is
262

262

00:12:48.058  -->  00:12:50.583
to really think about responsiveness,
263

263

00:12:50.583  -->  00:12:53.732
so right from the beginning of defining our Grid tracks
264

264

00:12:53.732  -->  00:12:56.668
and columns, as well, so you see that,
265

265

00:12:56.668  -->  00:12:57.531
in this real-world scenario,
266

266

00:12:57.531  -->  00:12:59.719
we're not just using pixels here, but, instead,
267

267

00:12:59.719  -->  00:13:02.581
we're using real units that make sense for the content
268

268

00:13:02.581  -->  00:13:04.505
that we're putting in here, and so,
269

269

00:13:04.505  -->  00:13:07.381
units like viewport height or viewport width
270

270

00:13:07.381  -->  00:13:10.346
are really important units to use in a real-world scenario
271

271

00:13:10.346  -->  00:13:11.526
like this one here.
272

272

00:13:11.526  -->  00:13:14.340
So, in the Grid examples that you see online
273

273

00:13:14.340  -->  00:13:17.017
or even that we did in the last section,
274

274

00:13:17.017  -->  00:13:20.278
we always use some fixed size for the columns
275

275

00:13:20.278  -->  00:13:21.353
and for the rows, right?
276

276

00:13:21.353  -->  00:13:23.330
But, in here, we don't always do that,
277

277

00:13:23.330  -->  00:13:27.202
so we use units like this, and we also simply want the rows
278

278

00:13:27.202  -->  00:13:29.489
to adapt to the content, especially in the rows.
279

279

00:13:29.489  -->  00:13:31.417
Not so much in the columns, but in the rows,
280

280

00:13:31.417  -->  00:13:33.338
it's sometimes really useful to simply
281

281

00:13:33.338  -->  00:13:36.954
let them have the height of the content, okay?
282

282

00:13:36.954  -->  00:13:39.566
And, actually, the next one will be exactly that,
283

283

00:13:39.566  -->  00:13:42.106
so the fourth row is this one here,
284

284

00:13:42.106  -->  00:13:43.905
and it's similar to the features row,
285

285

00:13:43.905  -->  00:13:47.155
in that we simply wanted to have the height
286

286

00:13:47.155  -->  00:13:49.231
of its content, okay?
287

287

00:13:49.231  -->  00:13:52.314
And so, let's use main content again,
288

288

00:13:53.259  -->  00:13:56.295
and the same thing, actually, for this one here, okay?
289

289

00:13:56.295  -->  00:13:59.020
So this one should also simply be the height
290

290

00:13:59.020  -->  00:14:00.859
of all of these images here together,
291

291

00:14:00.859  -->  00:14:03.483
and then, the same also for the footer,
292

292

00:14:03.483  -->  00:14:05.957
so we're not gonna define any static value
293

293

00:14:05.957  -->  00:14:10.020
for any of this, and so, all we have to do now is
294

294

00:14:10.020  -->  00:14:11.980
to say min content again,
295

295

00:14:11.980  -->  00:14:16.947
and, actually, instead of that, let's do repeat, okay?
296

296

00:14:16.947  -->  00:14:18.668
Because you want it three times now,
297

297

00:14:18.668  -->  00:14:21.130
and so, instead of writing it out three times,
298

298

00:14:21.130  -->  00:14:23.845
let's simply use the repeat function, okay?
299

299

00:14:23.845  -->  00:14:25.558
So I hope that makes sense,
300

300

00:14:25.558  -->  00:14:27.321
and if it doesn't, then just try to imagine
301

301

00:14:27.321  -->  00:14:30.391
that we put fixed pixel values here
302

302

00:14:30.391  -->  00:14:31.947
in all of these rows,
303

303

00:14:31.947  -->  00:14:35.020
so imagine this will be a hard-coded 1,000 pixels
304

304

00:14:35.020  -->  00:14:38.608
and here as well, on tier, let's say, 800 pixels,
305

305

00:14:38.608  -->  00:14:39.784
something like that,
306

306

00:14:39.784  -->  00:14:42.244
and imagine what would happen if we then started
307

307

00:14:42.244  -->  00:14:43.586
to resize our window,
308

308

00:14:43.586  -->  00:14:47.308
so if users viewed the page from a phone or from a tablet.
309

309

00:14:47.308  -->  00:14:49.496
We could, of course, use media queries to adapt
310

310

00:14:49.496  -->  00:14:51.757
in that situation, but it's far easier
311

311

00:14:51.757  -->  00:14:53.806
to think responsive right from the beginning
312

312

00:14:53.806  -->  00:14:56.742
and size the rows and the columns in a responsive
313

313

00:14:56.742  -->  00:14:59.971
and flexible way right from the start, okay?
314

314

00:14:59.971  -->  00:15:03.029
So always, always think about that when you're designing
315

315

00:15:03.029  -->  00:15:05.975
and building content with CSS Grids.
316

316

00:15:05.975  -->  00:15:08.224
So we have the rows now, and the next thing we have
317

317

00:15:08.224  -->  00:15:10.987
to do is to define our column tracks,
318

318

00:15:10.987  -->  00:15:13.522
but, actually, I'm gonna leave that to the next lecture,
319

319

00:15:13.522  -->  00:15:15.513
because that's even more complex,
320

320

00:15:15.513  -->  00:15:16.987
and, actually, a lot more complex
321

321

00:15:16.987  -->  00:15:19.015
than defining our row tracks, okay?
322

322

00:15:19.015  -->  00:15:21.340
So I'm gonna leave that to the next lecture
323

323

00:15:21.340  -->  00:15:23.848
as well as the placement of all our Grid items
324

324

00:15:23.848  -->  00:15:26.202
in the correct position, so that it, in the end,
325

325

00:15:26.202  -->  00:15:29.952
looks like the layout that we're gonna built.
