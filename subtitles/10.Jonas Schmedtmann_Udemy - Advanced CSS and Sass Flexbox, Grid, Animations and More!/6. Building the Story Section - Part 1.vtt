00:00:00.670  -->  00:00:04.524
<v ->Hey there, welcome back to building or project.</v>
2

2

00:00:04.524  -->  00:00:07.343
At this time, let's build the story section.
3

3

00:00:07.343  -->  00:00:10.650
And so, by building this section, you're going to learn
4

4

00:00:10.650  -->  00:00:13.169
how to deal with overlapping grid items,
5

5

00:00:13.169  -->  00:00:15.759
why images are special and behave different
6

6

00:00:15.759  -->  00:00:17.598
than the other grid items,
7

7

00:00:17.598  -->  00:00:20.360
and also how to decide if Flexbox is
8

8

00:00:20.360  -->  00:00:24.074
a better tool than CSS Grid in certain situations.
9

9

00:00:24.074  -->  00:00:27.538
Okay, so this is the final result
10

10

00:00:27.538  -->  00:00:30.054
that we're looking for for this section.
11

11

00:00:30.054  -->  00:00:32.790
And so let's start with this right side here,
12

12

00:00:32.790  -->  00:00:34.995
where we put these two headings,
13

13

00:00:34.995  -->  00:00:37.514
then the text, and finally the button.
14

14

00:00:37.514  -->  00:00:40.349
And we then, by the end, also center this
15

15

00:00:40.349  -->  00:00:43.569
vertically here in this container element.
16

16

00:00:43.569  -->  00:00:46.230
Okay, so before, I already said that
17

17

00:00:46.230  -->  00:00:48.643
this one here is an h2 element,
18

18

00:00:48.643  -->  00:00:51.985
and this is an h3 element, right?
19

19

00:00:51.985  -->  00:00:54.540
And so let's now go to our markup
20

20

00:00:54.540  -->  00:00:57.623
and code up this part of the website.
21

21

00:00:58.511  -->  00:01:00.737
So, we start with the story content
22

22

00:01:00.737  -->  00:01:03.414
and leave the pictures here for the next video.
23

23

00:01:03.414  -->  00:01:07.081
Okay, so we start with the heading-3, so h3,
24

24

00:01:09.697  -->  00:01:12.114
and I'm calling it heading-3,
25

25

00:01:14.843  -->  00:01:18.093
and in here it says, "Happy Customers."
26

26

00:01:20.833  -->  00:01:23.833
Then we have an h2 called heading-2,
27

27

00:01:25.030  -->  00:01:28.863
and it says, "The best decision of our lives."
28

28

00:01:31.301  -->  00:01:35.479
Then we also have this special symbol here,
29

29

00:01:35.479  -->  00:01:37.240
so let me show it to you.
30

30

00:01:37.240  -->  00:01:39.533
So, this one here, to opening the quote,
31

31

00:01:39.533  -->  00:01:42.366
and this one to closing the quote.
32

32

00:01:43.355  -->  00:01:46.391
And so the first one is this special entity,
33

33

00:01:46.391  -->  00:01:49.308
so &amp;ldquo; and this one is &amp;rdquo;.
34

34

00:01:54.810  -->  00:01:58.977
Okay, now, the paragraph, which is the story text,
35

35

00:02:01.651  -->  00:02:04.910
and so right now we're using actually the name of the block,
36

36

00:02:04.910  -->  00:02:07.332
okay, which up here, we did not,
37

37

00:02:07.332  -->  00:02:10.903
because these styles here, again, they are reusable.
38

38

00:02:10.903  -->  00:02:13.599
Then, for this text, let's go back here
39

39

00:02:13.599  -->  00:02:16.766
to this file that we have and copy it,
40

40

00:02:17.989  -->  00:02:19.800
and we can also close it,
41

41

00:02:19.800  -->  00:02:24.032
because we're not going to need it ever again.
42

42

00:02:24.032  -->  00:02:27.217
So let's paste it here, and then just to finish,
43

43

00:02:27.217  -->  00:02:31.170
we need a button with the class "btn".
44

44

00:02:31.170  -->  00:02:33.171
So, just as we've been doing.
45

45

00:02:33.171  -->  00:02:36.504
And this one says, "Find your own home."
46

46

00:02:37.353  -->  00:02:40.270
Okay, so let's take a look at that.
47

47

00:02:42.884  -->  00:02:45.588
And so here we go, all right.
48

48

00:02:45.588  -->  00:02:47.583
So that's what it looks like right now.
49

49

00:02:47.583  -->  00:02:51.451
And so let's first add some padding here to this box,
50

50

00:02:51.451  -->  00:02:55.704
and then start by styling the h2 and the h3,
51

51

00:02:55.704  -->  00:02:58.501
or, actually, the h2 and the h3, okay.
52

52

00:02:58.501  -->  00:03:01.668
So, let's open up the story file here,
53

53

00:03:02.921  -->  00:03:07.398
and we see that we already have some code here, of course.
54

54

00:03:07.398  -->  00:03:10.486
That's because of the placement of these two grid items
55

55

00:03:10.486  -->  00:03:12.914
in our overall layout grid, all right?
56

56

00:03:12.914  -->  00:03:15.147
So the content has this background color,
57

57

00:03:15.147  -->  00:03:17.741
which is actually already the one that we want in the end,
58

58

00:03:17.741  -->  00:03:19.955
and so let's just add some padding here very quickly,
59

59

00:03:19.955  -->  00:03:24.122
so 6 top and bottom, and 12 on the left and right side.
60

60

00:03:25.511  -->  00:03:28.378
Okay, let's open up the typography now,
61

61

00:03:28.378  -->  00:03:32.720
and so we're going to start styling the h2 and then the h3.
62

62

00:03:32.720  -->  00:03:36.215
So for this one, we want a font-size of 4 rem,
63

63

00:03:36.215  -->  00:03:39.715
a font-style of italic, and we can do that
64

64

00:03:42.634  -->  00:03:45.130
because we included the italic style
65

65

00:03:45.130  -->  00:03:47.686
here in the beginning of our HTML,
66

66

00:03:47.686  -->  00:03:51.519
so this one here, so 400i for the italic text.
67

67

00:03:52.880  -->  00:03:55.085
And then, actually, for this one,
68

68

00:03:55.085  -->  00:03:57.582
we also, just as for the h4,
69

69

00:03:57.582  -->  00:04:00.820
we want a light and a dark version, okay?
70

70

00:04:00.820  -->  00:04:02.427
Because we're going to reuse it
71

71

00:04:02.427  -->  00:04:05.406
somewhere else on the page with a light version.
72

72

00:04:05.406  -->  00:04:07.274
So right now here, we want the dark one,
73

73

00:04:07.274  -->  00:04:09.589
so let's go add that here, actually.
74

74

00:04:09.589  -->  00:04:13.089
So we want a heading-2--dark in this case.
75

75

00:04:21.171  -->  00:04:25.088
Right, so that's the h2, and now as for the h3,
76

76

00:04:28.374  -->  00:04:30.874
the font-size is just 1.6 rem,
77

77

00:04:36.282  -->  00:04:40.449
the color is our primary color, so the gold color,
78

78

00:04:42.967  -->  00:04:46.884
and then we also want the text to be uppercase.
79

79

00:04:50.245  -->  00:04:52.809
Okay, let's just check it out,
80

80

00:04:52.809  -->  00:04:55.309
and now here we see a problem,
81

81

00:04:56.176  -->  00:04:58.788
and that's because of this huge line-height that we defined
82

82

00:04:58.788  -->  00:05:02.010
of 1.6, and so let's put that to 1 here,
83

83

00:05:02.010  -->  00:05:05.006
so that we don't have all of this space in there.
84

84

00:05:05.006  -->  00:05:09.089
So that's the h2, and so line-height 1, and yeah,
85

85

00:05:13.474  -->  00:05:15.069
that looks a lot more natural.
86

86

00:05:15.069  -->  00:05:17.012
We also need some spacing here,
87

87

00:05:17.012  -->  00:05:19.160
but let's take care of that a bit later.
88

88

00:05:19.160  -->  00:05:21.174
For now, I'm going to style the button here first,
89

89

00:05:21.174  -->  00:05:22.731
and I'm also going to do that
90

90

00:05:22.731  -->  00:05:24.778
in the typography here, actually.
91

91

00:05:24.778  -->  00:05:28.997
So down here, let me just add a button class here.
92

92

00:05:28.997  -->  00:05:33.164
So the background color is, again, the primary color,
93

93

00:05:35.530  -->  00:05:38.179
the text color should then be white,
94

94

00:05:38.179  -->  00:05:40.343
and since it is a button element,
95

95

00:05:40.343  -->  00:05:42.856
we need to also get rid of the border,
96

96

00:05:42.856  -->  00:05:46.781
so border: none; and also of the border radius,
97

97

00:05:46.781  -->  00:05:49.981
because by default, it has some,
98

98

00:05:49.981  -->  00:05:52.513
and we don't need that, okay?
99

99

00:05:52.513  -->  00:05:54.028
So as for the font-family,
100

100

00:05:54.028  -->  00:05:56.919
it should be also the display font,
101

101

00:05:56.919  -->  00:06:01.086
so $font-display; the font-size should be 1.5 rem,
102

102

00:06:04.501  -->  00:06:08.662
and we want it to be transformed to uppercase.
103

103

00:06:08.662  -->  00:06:11.363
So this is nothing new here, maybe just
104

104

00:06:11.363  -->  00:06:13.602
to get some practice for you.
105

105

00:06:13.602  -->  00:06:15.413
Maybe for that it's good.
106

106

00:06:15.413  -->  00:06:18.080
Okay, then also let's add some padding,
107

107

00:06:18.080  -->  00:06:21.747
1.8 to top and bottom, and 3 left and right.
108

108

00:06:24.249  -->  00:06:26.505
And again, I played around with these values,
109

109

00:06:26.505  -->  00:06:29.261
and these are the ones that I like the most, okay?
110

110

00:06:29.261  -->  00:06:32.465
So if you want to take a look at different values,
111

111

00:06:32.465  -->  00:06:34.833
of course you can do that.
112

112

00:06:34.833  -->  00:06:37.883
So we also defined a pointer as a cursor,
113

113

00:06:37.883  -->  00:06:42.028
because otherwise the button doesn't have this hand cursor.
114

114

00:06:42.028  -->  00:06:45.837
Now, we also want a small and subtle hover effect,
115

115

00:06:45.837  -->  00:06:48.944
so nothing crazy here in this case.
116

116

00:06:48.944  -->  00:06:53.111
And all that's going to change is just the background color
117

117

00:06:54.845  -->  00:06:57.928
to color primary in the dark version.
118

118

00:07:00.895  -->  00:07:04.478
Okay, then some transition here, of course,
119

119

00:07:07.604  -->  00:07:09.790
and again, nothing all too crazy.
120

120

00:07:09.790  -->  00:07:12.957
So let's check that one out, and yeah,
121

121

00:07:14.483  -->  00:07:17.189
well, the transition doesn't look right.
122

122

00:07:17.189  -->  00:07:19.702
Now, that's because I'm missing the second here.
123

123

00:07:19.702  -->  00:07:23.536
All right, yeah, so that looks a lot better.
124

124

00:07:23.536  -->  00:07:26.586
So now let's just quickly style this text,
125

125

00:07:26.586  -->  00:07:28.466
and it should look like this,
126

126

00:07:28.466  -->  00:07:31.064
so of course bigger, and also italic.
127

127

00:07:31.064  -->  00:07:33.394
So where do we do that?
128

128

00:07:33.394  -->  00:07:35.209
Well, right here in the story,
129

129

00:07:35.209  -->  00:07:37.202
and we can do it then down here,
130

130

00:07:37.202  -->  00:07:40.752
because, remember, it's called story text.
131

131

00:07:40.752  -->  00:07:43.085
Okay, so font-size: 1.5 rem,
132

132

00:07:46.745  -->  00:07:49.745
and the font-style should be italic.
133

133

00:07:52.208  -->  00:07:54.551
Okay, that's better also.
134

134

00:07:54.551  -->  00:07:56.905
Now, about the spacing that I was mentioning,
135

135

00:07:56.905  -->  00:07:59.047
we really shouldn't hard-code
136

136

00:07:59.047  -->  00:08:01.990
the margin-bottoms here into these headings,
137

137

00:08:01.990  -->  00:08:03.934
because, again, we're going to reuse them
138

138

00:08:03.934  -->  00:08:06.484
throughout the page, and so if we add some margin here
139

139

00:08:06.484  -->  00:08:08.280
that's good for these situations,
140

140

00:08:08.280  -->  00:08:10.456
then that margin might not be good
141

141

00:08:10.456  -->  00:08:13.710
for other situations in other places of our page.
142

142

00:08:13.710  -->  00:08:16.540
And so, just like we did with other projects in this course,
143

143

00:08:16.540  -->  00:08:18.943
we're going to use some helper classes here, okay?
144

144

00:08:18.943  -->  00:08:22.237
So I'm actually going to add them here
145

145

00:08:22.237  -->  00:08:25.935
also to typography file, because I don't want
146

146

00:08:25.935  -->  00:08:27.971
to just create another file just for this.
147

147

00:08:27.971  -->  00:08:29.915
Okay, so right now I'm being
148

148

00:08:29.915  -->  00:08:32.638
a bit lazy here for that, but it's no problem.
149

149

00:08:32.638  -->  00:08:34.225
If you have a bigger project,
150

150

00:08:34.225  -->  00:08:35.634
then of course you cannot do it like this,
151

151

00:08:35.634  -->  00:08:39.001
but I'm just going to put some margin-bottom classes here,
152

152

00:08:39.001  -->  00:08:40.922
and so it's no big deal.
153

153

00:08:40.922  -->  00:08:43.200
So I'm simply going to call these mb,
154

154

00:08:43.200  -->  00:08:44.569
which stands for margin-bottom,
155

155

00:08:44.569  -->  00:08:48.065
and then sm, which stands for small, okay,
156

156

00:08:48.065  -->  00:08:50.782
so that we don't have to write out these huge class names.
157

157

00:08:50.782  -->  00:08:54.949
So margin-bottom, and let's set this one to just 2 rem.
158

158

00:08:55.963  -->  00:08:57.993
Okay, and so we're going to use
159

159

00:08:57.993  -->  00:08:59.792
that one for the first heading.
160

160

00:08:59.792  -->  00:09:03.051
Then let's simply copy this and paste it a couple of times,
161

161

00:09:03.051  -->  00:09:05.884
so small, medium, large, and huge.
162

162

00:09:11.057  -->  00:09:13.521
So 2, 3, and I'm not sure if
163

163

00:09:13.521  -->  00:09:15.149
I'm going to use the other ones here as well,
164

164

00:09:15.149  -->  00:09:16.701
but let's just fill them out.
165

165

00:09:16.701  -->  00:09:18.108
Okay, we always have to assume
166

166

00:09:18.108  -->  00:09:20.605
that our project might grow sometime in the future,
167

167

00:09:20.605  -->  00:09:22.602
and we have to be prepared for that.
168

168

00:09:22.602  -->  00:09:25.378
And so these helper classes, they are very useful for that.
169

169

00:09:25.378  -->  00:09:29.040
In effect, there is something happening in CSS right now
170

170

00:09:29.040  -->  00:09:32.686
where people are starting to style their entire pages
171

171

00:09:32.686  -->  00:09:35.754
using only these small and unique classes.
172

172

00:09:35.754  -->  00:09:39.012
That's called Atomic CSS, and if you want to look into that,
173

173

00:09:39.012  -->  00:09:40.748
it's also quite interesting.
174

174

00:09:40.748  -->  00:09:44.096
I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of that right now,
175

175

00:09:44.096  -->  00:09:46.169
but I can definitely see how it's useful
176

176

00:09:46.169  -->  00:09:49.278
to use these classes here in some points.
177

177

00:09:49.278  -->  00:09:51.699
Okay, so sometimes it's really useful.
178

178

00:09:51.699  -->  00:09:54.083
Maybe it's a bit too much to style
179

179

00:09:54.083  -->  00:09:55.974
all of the elements on your page
180

180

00:09:55.974  -->  00:09:57.635
just using these helper classes
181

181

00:09:57.635  -->  00:09:59.228
like some people are doing,
182

182

00:09:59.228  -->  00:10:02.745
but definitely they have a place in CSS development.
183

183

00:10:02.745  -->  00:10:04.463
Okay, and so right now,
184

184

00:10:04.463  -->  00:10:06.777
let me go ahead and actually use them.
185

185

00:10:06.777  -->  00:10:10.458
Okay, so the first one here, I want it to have
186

186

00:10:10.458  -->  00:10:14.373
a margin-bottom of small, and this one
187

187

00:10:14.373  -->  00:10:16.540
a margin-bottom of medium.
188

188

00:10:18.004  -->  00:10:20.649
And let me take a look.
189

189

00:10:20.649  -->  00:10:22.884
So this one is 4 rem here,
190

190

00:10:22.884  -->  00:10:25.718
so let's actually use this one here for the paragraph.
191

191

00:10:25.718  -->  00:10:28.468
Okay, so margin-bottom and large,
192

192

00:10:29.807  -->  00:10:34.006
or I could actually put these 4 rem margin-bottom
193

193

00:10:34.006  -->  00:10:36.675
directly on this element here, right,
194

194

00:10:36.675  -->  00:10:38.502
because it's not a reusable one.
195

195

00:10:38.502  -->  00:10:41.094
So let me come here to the story text,
196

196

00:10:41.094  -->  00:10:45.261
and simply add a margin-bottom of 4 rem here in this case.
197

197

00:10:47.350  -->  00:10:49.250
Okay, so instead of using a helper class here,
198

198

00:10:49.250  -->  00:10:51.715
it's not really necessary because it is not
199

199

00:10:51.715  -->  00:10:53.804
a reusable element that I want to reuse
200

200

00:10:53.804  -->  00:10:55.377
somewhere else on the page.
201

201

00:10:55.377  -->  00:10:59.462
Okay, and so yeah, that's what it looks like,
202

202

00:10:59.462  -->  00:11:02.422
and the spacing looks good like this,
203

203

00:11:02.422  -->  00:11:05.548
and so we're ready to move on to the next step,
204

204

00:11:05.548  -->  00:11:07.937
which is to actually vertically center all of this
205

205

00:11:07.937  -->  00:11:10.562
here in this parent container.
206

206

00:11:10.562  -->  00:11:12.952
Now, how are we actually going to do that?
207

207

00:11:12.952  -->  00:11:15.128
Well, we could, of course, use CSS Grid once more,
208

208

00:11:15.128  -->  00:11:17.559
and it wouldn't be all too difficult to do that.
209

209

00:11:17.559  -->  00:11:21.849
However, this is just a one-dimensional layout, in fact.
210

210

00:11:21.849  -->  00:11:24.239
Right, so you have this element here,
211

211

00:11:24.239  -->  00:11:27.342
then this, then this, and then this, all after another.
212

212

00:11:27.342  -->  00:11:29.211
But on the sides, you don't have anything else,
213

213

00:11:29.211  -->  00:11:31.538
and so it's just a one-dimensional layout,
214

214

00:11:31.538  -->  00:11:33.985
like it's going in this direction, from here to here.
215

215

00:11:33.985  -->  00:11:38.543
So we could use, instead of CSS Grid, Flexbox here, right?
216

216

00:11:38.543  -->  00:11:41.418
And remember that I said that in modern web development,
217

217

00:11:41.418  -->  00:11:44.718
CSS Grid is sometimes, or actually many times,
218

218

00:11:44.718  -->  00:11:47.414
used together with Flexbox, and in this case,
219

219

00:11:47.414  -->  00:11:49.911
Flexbox is clearly a good solution
220

220

00:11:49.911  -->  00:11:52.004
to do exactly what we want to do here.
221

221

00:11:52.004  -->  00:11:54.797
Okay, and so you can also practice some Flexbox here,
222

222

00:11:54.797  -->  00:11:57.649
and so that's a great opportunity as well.
223

223

00:11:57.649  -->  00:11:59.979
So how are we going to do that?
224

224

00:11:59.979  -->  00:12:04.828
Well, first of all, we need to say that this content here,
225

225

00:12:04.828  -->  00:12:07.915
which is the parent element, should be the flex container.
226

226

00:12:07.915  -->  00:12:10.415
So display: flex; and so let's
227

227

00:12:12.265  -->  00:12:13.779
take a look at what happens here.
228

228

00:12:13.779  -->  00:12:16.222
And of course, I hope that's what you expected.
229

229

00:12:16.222  -->  00:12:20.174
Okay, so all of these flex items are now side by side.
230

230

00:12:20.174  -->  00:12:22.600
But that's not what we want, right?
231

231

00:12:22.600  -->  00:12:24.287
We want them one below the other,
232

232

00:12:24.287  -->  00:12:28.454
and so we need to change the flex-direction to column.
233

233

00:12:30.519  -->  00:12:33.830
Okay, and so with that, remember we also change the axis.
234

234

00:12:33.830  -->  00:12:36.456
So this is now the main axis going from the top down,
235

235

00:12:36.456  -->  00:12:40.785
and the cross axis is now going from the left to the right.
236

236

00:12:40.785  -->  00:12:45.151
Okay, so how do we now center all of these items here
237

237

00:12:45.151  -->  00:12:48.040
across the main axis, so this axis here?
238

238

00:12:48.040  -->  00:12:49.576
How do we do that?
239

239

00:12:49.576  -->  00:12:53.743
Well, we simply use justify-content, set it to center,
240

240

00:12:55.951  -->  00:12:57.868
and that's actually it.
241

241

00:12:59.258  -->  00:13:01.016
So yeah, that's it.
242

242

00:13:01.016  -->  00:13:03.991
So you see, when we now change the size of this,
243

243

00:13:03.991  -->  00:13:06.339
you see that it always
244

244

00:13:06.339  -->  00:13:10.172
stays here nicely vertically centered, right?
245

245

00:13:11.079  -->  00:13:14.129
There's just one small problem with that,
246

246

00:13:14.129  -->  00:13:19.011
and that is that this button here is now ranging all the way
247

247

00:13:19.011  -->  00:13:21.346
from this side to the other side.
248

248

00:13:21.346  -->  00:13:23.343
And so you remember why that is happening?
249

249

00:13:23.343  -->  00:13:25.695
It is because the align-items property
250

250

00:13:25.695  -->  00:13:28.112
in Flexbox is set to stretch.
251

251

00:13:28.987  -->  00:13:31.688
Okay, so align-items aligns the items
252

252

00:13:31.688  -->  00:13:33.718
along the cross axis in Flexbox,
253

253

00:13:33.718  -->  00:13:37.218
so in this direction here, and it's set to stretch,
254

254

00:13:37.218  -->  00:13:39.866
but we don't want that; instead we want it
255

255

00:13:39.866  -->  00:13:43.116
to set to flex-start, so let's do that.
256

256

00:13:47.330  -->  00:13:51.010
Flex-start, let's check it out, and that's it.
257

257

00:13:51.010  -->  00:13:53.097
So that is the solution of this problem.
258

258

00:13:53.097  -->  00:13:55.937
So, I know that maybe it's a bit confusing for you
259

259

00:13:55.937  -->  00:13:59.562
to now use Flexbox all together here with CSS Grid,
260

260

00:13:59.562  -->  00:14:02.146
but that's just so that you know that
261

261

00:14:02.146  -->  00:14:04.206
this is how it works in the real world,
262

262

00:14:04.206  -->  00:14:06.995
and also that you don't forget Flexbox
263

263

00:14:06.995  -->  00:14:09.362
just because you'll know CSS Grid now.
264

264

00:14:09.362  -->  00:14:11.769
Okay, so of course we could have done it
265

265

00:14:11.769  -->  00:14:15.842
with CSS Grid as well, so let me show that to you as well,
266

266

00:14:15.842  -->  00:14:20.217
and actually it would have been even easier than this.
267

267

00:14:20.217  -->  00:14:24.109
So let's take this part out of the code,
268

268

00:14:24.109  -->  00:14:26.031
and so instead of a Flexbox container,
269

269

00:14:26.031  -->  00:14:28.083
let's set it to grid now,
270

270

00:14:28.083  -->  00:14:31.524
and so now what property do we actually use
271

271

00:14:31.524  -->  00:14:34.424
to align all of our grid tracks in a vertical direction?
272

272

00:14:34.424  -->  00:14:37.257
That's the align-content property,
273

273

00:14:40.142  -->  00:14:42.800
and we just have to set it to center, okay?
274

274

00:14:42.800  -->  00:14:45.614
So let's take a look at that, and yeah,
275

275

00:14:45.614  -->  00:14:48.519
it works just the same, so let's actually inspect this here,
276

276

00:14:48.519  -->  00:14:53.084
so story content, and so these are the grid items here,
277

277

00:14:53.084  -->  00:14:55.641
of course, one, two, three, and four,
278

278

00:14:55.641  -->  00:14:57.658
and they are now vertically centered as well,
279

279

00:14:57.658  -->  00:15:01.325
because of this align-content set to center.
280

280

00:15:02.357  -->  00:15:06.985
Okay, now the same thing here happens as we had before
281

281

00:15:06.985  -->  00:15:09.053
with the Flexbox, which is that this here
282

282

00:15:09.053  -->  00:15:12.607
now spans all the way across this grid track,
283

283

00:15:12.607  -->  00:15:15.512
and that is, once more, because the grid items,
284

284

00:15:15.512  -->  00:15:19.452
by default, stretch all across their grid cells.
285

285

00:15:19.452  -->  00:15:22.450
Okay, so how do we stop them from doing that,
286

286

00:15:22.450  -->  00:15:24.478
and instead put them here just all the way
287

287

00:15:24.478  -->  00:15:26.529
to the start, or to the the left side?
288

288

00:15:26.529  -->  00:15:29.917
Well, we're looking at the row axis here, right,
289

289

00:15:29.917  -->  00:15:32.576
and to align the items in the row axis,
290

290

00:15:32.576  -->  00:15:34.374
we use justify-items.
291

291

00:15:34.374  -->  00:15:36.041
Okay, remember that?
292

292

00:15:37.777  -->  00:15:41.777
So justify-items: start; and that should fix it.
293

293

00:15:43.619  -->  00:15:46.268
And indeed, it does, so everything works
294

294

00:15:46.268  -->  00:15:50.653
just the same as with the Flexbox solution, okay?
295

295

00:15:50.653  -->  00:15:53.926
It's just that we're now using CSS Grid here
296

296

00:15:53.926  -->  00:15:55.611
for a one-dimensional layout,
297

297

00:15:55.611  -->  00:15:57.534
and that's, I think, a bit weird,
298

298

00:15:57.534  -->  00:15:58.812
so it's a bit counter-intuitive,
299

299

00:15:58.812  -->  00:16:01.142
because for that, we have Flexbox.
300

300

00:16:01.142  -->  00:16:03.064
But of course, it's not a problem at all,
301

301

00:16:03.064  -->  00:16:05.527
and so I'm actually going to leave it as it is,
302

302

00:16:05.527  -->  00:16:07.885
and we have, instead of four lines of CSS,
303

303

00:16:07.885  -->  00:16:09.685
we have only three.
304

304

00:16:09.685  -->  00:16:13.084
So we actually even have to write a bit less code.
305

305

00:16:13.084  -->  00:16:17.323
Okay, so you can go with whatever makes more sense to you,
306

306

00:16:17.323  -->  00:16:19.895
but it's also good to see that we can use
307

307

00:16:19.895  -->  00:16:21.968
these two different technologies
308

308

00:16:21.968  -->  00:16:23.949
to achieve the exact same thing.
309

309

00:16:23.949  -->  00:16:26.704
Okay, now another thing that I just noticed
310

310

00:16:26.704  -->  00:16:29.537
when I was resizing this page here
311

311

00:16:31.474  -->  00:16:34.291
is that at some point there's not enough space here,
312

312

00:16:34.291  -->  00:16:37.008
and we have a bit too much space here
313

313

00:16:37.008  -->  00:16:38.506
on the left and on the right side.
314

314

00:16:38.506  -->  00:16:40.821
And so we can also, instead of
315

315

00:16:40.821  -->  00:16:43.205
having it hard-coded like this here,
316

316

00:16:43.205  -->  00:16:44.945
so the left and right paddings,
317

317

00:16:44.945  -->  00:16:47.849
they're hard-coded to being 12 rem,
318

318

00:16:47.849  -->  00:16:50.771
we can also set them as a percentage of the viewport.
319

319

00:16:50.771  -->  00:16:54.862
Okay, so let's go with 10 viewport width units,
320

320

00:16:54.862  -->  00:16:58.320
and let's see if that changes it.
321

321

00:16:58.320  -->  00:17:00.967
Ow, and that's actually a bit too much.
322

322

00:17:00.967  -->  00:17:05.134
Let's move it down to eight, and that looks much better.
323

323

00:17:07.739  -->  00:17:10.772
And so, if we resize it now, ah, that's much nicer.
324

324

00:17:10.772  -->  00:17:13.323
Okay, so you see that now, this padding
325

325

00:17:13.323  -->  00:17:17.490
really changes as the width of the viewport changes.
326

326

00:17:20.003  -->  00:17:23.020
Right, so that's a bit more natural.
327

327

00:17:23.020  -->  00:17:27.107
And yeah, so this viewport width unit is getting
328

328

00:17:27.107  -->  00:17:29.473
more and more used for building these
329

329

00:17:29.473  -->  00:17:31.623
really, truly responsive layouts.
330

330

00:17:31.623  -->  00:17:33.724
And it's actually an amazing unit.
331

331

00:17:33.724  -->  00:17:35.526
It's really helpful for this kind of stuff,
332

332

00:17:35.526  -->  00:17:38.190
and I hope you can see that and you can use it
333

333

00:17:38.190  -->  00:17:40.815
more and more in your designs whenever you see fit.
334

334

00:17:40.815  -->  00:17:45.294
So this first part here of the stories is not done.
335

335

00:17:45.294  -->  00:17:48.951
Next up, we're going to then place these two images here,
336

336

00:17:48.951  -->  00:17:51.745
and for that, again, we're going to use CSS Grid,
337

337

00:17:51.745  -->  00:17:55.912
so right in the next video is where we're going to do that.
