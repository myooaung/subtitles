00:00:01,420  -->  00:00:02,459
<v Jonas>Let's now continue</v>
2

2

00:00:02,459  -->  00:00:04,965
building the tours section.
3

3

00:00:04,965  -->  00:00:07,705
And this is where we left off after the last lecture.
4

4

00:00:07,705  -->  00:00:10,231
And in this small break, I actually noticed some problem
5

5

00:00:10,231  -->  00:00:12,725
with this card so with this movement here,
6

6

00:00:12,725  -->  00:00:14,826
and let me show you what happens.
7

7

00:00:14,826  -->  00:00:18,076
So I'm gonna make this here really slow.
8

8

00:00:18,076  -->  00:00:21,339
So, like, eight seconds, let's say.
9

9

00:00:21,339  -->  00:00:25,083
And so let's take a look at what happens here.
10

10

00:00:25,083  -->  00:00:28,385
It actually moves in the wrong direction.
11

11

00:00:28,385  -->  00:00:30,135
You see that?
12

12

00:00:32,361  -->  00:00:34,633
We want it to move in the opposite direction
13

13

00:00:34,633  -->  00:00:37,571
so that then it seems that the card's continuous moving
14

14

00:00:37,571  -->  00:00:40,010
while the orange sides moves to the front.
15

15

00:00:40,010  -->  00:00:43,052
And right now, that's not really what's happening.
16

16

00:00:43,052  -->  00:00:44,635
You see that?
17

17

00:00:48,954  -->  00:00:52,892
So this should move in the opposite direction, okay?
18

18

00:00:52,892  -->  00:00:55,655
And so what we want to happen
19

19

00:00:55,655  -->  00:00:58,015
is to not rotate to 180 degrees
20

20

00:00:58,015  -->  00:00:59,983
but minus 180 degrees.
21

21

00:00:59,983  -->  00:01:02,224
So basically just in the other direction.
22

22

00:01:02,224  -->  00:01:05,045
And once again, that's what the minus symbol does here.
23

23

00:01:05,045  -->  00:01:07,067
It moves the element in the other direction.
24

24

00:01:07,067  -->  00:01:10,824
Just like as if we're setting a margin to negative value,
25

25

00:01:10,824  -->  00:01:13,762
it also moves the element to the other direction,
26

26

00:01:13,762  -->  00:01:15,014
so the opposite direction.
27

27

00:01:15,014  -->  00:01:17,181
So let's check it out now.
28

28

00:01:18,370  -->  00:01:21,994
And so this is what we want, right?
29

29

00:01:21,994  -->  00:01:24,049
So now it's really a moving card.
30

30

00:01:24,049  -->  00:01:26,306
So I had a small mistake in the code.
31

31

00:01:26,306  -->  00:01:27,490
You see that?
32

32

00:01:27,490  -->  00:01:29,523
Now it is actually perfect.
33

33

00:01:29,523  -->  00:01:33,180
Once again, just to make sure, and yep.
34

34

00:01:33,180  -->  00:01:35,275
So in this transition, there's a small moment
35

35

00:01:35,275  -->  00:01:36,923
where you don't see any card.
36

36

00:01:36,923  -->  00:01:40,020
And so in there we can see that it's perfect now this way.
37

37

00:01:40,020  -->  00:01:41,603
Right now.
38

38

00:01:42,551  -->  00:01:46,452
All right, so let's put it back to 0.8,
39

39

00:01:46,452  -->  00:01:47,702
give it a save.
40

40

00:01:49,440  -->  00:01:51,735
And yep, so this looks natural now.
41

41

00:01:51,735  -->  00:01:53,378
All right, so just a small mistake.
42

42

00:01:53,378  -->  00:01:54,591
But again, that's completely normal
43

43

00:01:54,591  -->  00:01:56,559
to happen for everyone.
44

44

00:01:56,559  -->  00:01:58,892
As long as we fixed these before we ship a product,
45

45

00:01:58,892  -->  00:02:00,135
it's no problem.
46

46

00:02:00,135  -->  00:02:04,291
Now let's move on and start styling the card some more.
47

47

00:02:04,291  -->  00:02:06,193
And so basically you have three elements
48

48

00:02:06,193  -->  00:02:07,913
on the front side of the card.
49

49

00:02:07,913  -->  00:02:10,055
So let's take a look at them.
50

50

00:02:10,055  -->  00:02:12,109
So we have the background image in the first place,
51

51

00:02:12,109  -->  00:02:14,078
so this image, then the textbox,
52

52

00:02:14,078  -->  00:02:16,174
and then the list down there.
53

53

00:02:16,174  -->  00:02:19,997
So three parts I am going to put here in the markup now.
54

54

00:02:19,997  -->  00:02:22,747
So first one is the card heading.
55

55

00:02:27,509  -->  00:02:30,580
Card heading, next we have a card picture.
56

56

00:02:30,580  -->  00:02:34,580
And actually it'll let me put the picture first.
57

57

00:02:41,172  -->  00:02:42,922
So card picture.
58

58

00:02:45,498  -->  00:02:47,748
Oh, something's wrong here.
59

59

00:02:50,967  -->  00:02:53,747
Oh, something weird here going on with my editor.
60

60

00:02:53,747  -->  00:02:55,048
But nevermind.
61

61

00:02:55,048  -->  00:02:59,215
Last thing is the card details.
62

62

00:03:00,196  -->  00:03:03,218
Now one thing about the BEM methodology
63

63

00:03:03,218  -->  00:03:05,349
is that we do not nest the element names.
64

64

00:03:05,349  -->  00:03:06,182
Okay?
65

65

00:03:06,182  -->  00:03:08,901
So this here is not a card side picture, okay?
66

66

00:03:08,901  -->  00:03:12,135
So card, then card side, and card side picture.
67

67

00:03:12,135  -->  00:03:14,187
That could make sense, but that's not how
68

68

00:03:14,187  -->  00:03:16,889
the BEM methodology says we should do it.
69

69

00:03:16,889  -->  00:03:18,723
So these are elements that are not,
70

70

00:03:18,723  -->  00:03:22,401
they should not be dependent here on the side, okay?
71

71

00:03:22,401  -->  00:03:25,347
So we keep the block which is card in this case,
72

72

00:03:25,347  -->  00:03:26,527
so the block is kept in the name,
73

73

00:03:26,527  -->  00:03:30,004
but then it's a complete, new element down here, okay?
74

74

00:03:30,004  -->  00:03:31,222
And so we have the picture,
75

75

00:03:31,222  -->  00:03:34,716
the heading, and the details, so.
76

76

00:03:34,716  -->  00:03:36,049
Details,
77

77

00:03:38,697  -->  00:03:42,997
heading, and the image.
78

78

00:03:42,997  -->  00:03:46,068
Now as for the image, I'm gonna use a background image
79

79

00:03:46,068  -->  00:03:49,619
in CSS actually, another img element in the HTML.
80

80

00:03:49,619  -->  00:03:52,125
And I'm gonna do that because I wanna show you
81

81

00:03:52,125  -->  00:03:54,052
some background blend modes, okay?
82

82

00:03:54,052  -->  00:03:56,125
So some great effects that we can apply
83

83

00:03:56,125  -->  00:03:59,187
on background images, but not on normal images.
84

84

00:03:59,187  -->  00:04:00,841
And so I'm gonna just leave this one empty,
85

85

00:04:00,841  -->  00:04:02,583
so no image in here.
86

86

00:04:02,583  -->  00:04:04,623
Well actually, we should put something in here,
87

87

00:04:04,623  -->  00:04:06,606
and so I'll just put a space,
88

88

00:04:06,606  -->  00:04:10,143
and so I'm putting the HTML special symbol for space,
89

89

00:04:10,143  -->  00:04:13,484
which is nbsp.
90

90

00:04:13,484  -->  00:04:15,560
I'm not really sure why that is,
91

91

00:04:15,560  -->  00:04:19,937
but this basically means like an empty space in HTML, okay?
92

92

00:04:19,937  -->  00:04:21,349
So instead of just leaving the div empty,
93

93

00:04:21,349  -->  00:04:22,662
I put this in here.
94

94

00:04:22,662  -->  00:04:24,647
It looks the same, but at least then it's
95

95

00:04:24,647  -->  00:04:27,192
not completely just empty sitting there.
96

96

00:04:27,192  -->  00:04:29,775
Okay, and let's actually start with our picture.
97

97

00:04:29,775  -->  00:04:31,569
And keep in mind that we have three cards,
98

98

00:04:31,569  -->  00:04:33,901
so we're gonna have three different pictures.
99

99

00:04:33,901  -->  00:04:36,984
And so I need to add here a modifier.
100

100

00:04:40,038  -->  00:04:40,918
Right?
101

101

00:04:40,918  -->  00:04:43,051
So picture one here in this case.
102

102

00:04:43,051  -->  00:04:45,681
And then later we will have two and three.
103

103

00:04:45,681  -->  00:04:49,848
So, back to our CSS, or SASS actually.
104

104

00:04:51,323  -->  00:04:54,156
Let's now come down here and write
105

105

00:04:58,359  -->  00:04:59,768
"picture."
106

106

00:04:59,768  -->  00:05:01,741
And so let's add some comments here.
107

107

00:05:01,741  -->  00:05:05,908
Maybe you've been adding comments before to your SASS.
108

108

00:05:07,789  -->  00:05:09,357
So let me just right here that
109

109

00:05:09,357  -->  00:05:12,357
this is basically for functionality.
110

110

00:05:13,199  -->  00:05:15,461
So functionality.
111

111

00:05:15,461  -->  00:05:16,794
And this now is,
112

112

00:05:19,461  -->  00:05:22,544
front side styling.
113

113

00:05:23,785  -->  00:05:25,495
So the picture's of course on the front side,
114

114

00:05:25,495  -->  00:05:27,495
and so let's style that.
115

115

00:05:33,463  -->  00:05:37,503
And so we select the very first one, so.
116

116

00:05:37,503  -->  00:05:39,627
This card picture one here, right?
117

117

00:05:39,627  -->  00:05:42,358
And so now let's give it to start,
118

118

00:05:42,358  -->  00:05:44,525
a simple background image.
119

119

00:05:46,381  -->  00:05:47,214
Okay?
120

120

00:05:47,214  -->  00:05:49,632
And so now we have to move up one level.
121

121

00:05:49,632  -->  00:05:52,044
And so now img, and the image
122

122

00:05:52,044  -->  00:05:54,794
that I want here is called nat-5.
123

123

00:05:58,828  -->  00:06:02,420
Now why do I actually have to move up only one level?
124

124

00:06:02,420  -->  00:06:04,916
Well, I do, because I have to assume
125

125

00:06:04,916  -->  00:06:07,029
that this code will be written later
126

126

00:06:07,029  -->  00:06:09,492
in the style of the CSS file, right?
127

127

00:06:09,492  -->  00:06:11,370
So after the SASS code is compiled,
128

128

00:06:11,370  -->  00:06:13,930
it will be written into the style that CSS file
129

129

00:06:13,930  -->  00:06:15,971
and so from there, I have to move up one level
130

130

00:06:15,971  -->  00:06:20,004
out of the CSS folder and into the product folder,
131

131

00:06:20,004  -->  00:06:21,358
which is this NATO folder.
132

132

00:06:21,358  -->  00:06:25,041
And then from there, I move to the img folder.
133

133

00:06:25,041  -->  00:06:27,349
And then in there, we have this nat-5.
134

134

00:06:27,349  -->  00:06:28,932
So this image here.
135

135

00:06:30,823  -->  00:06:31,656
All right?
136

136

00:06:31,656  -->  00:06:34,927
By the way, I got most, or maybe all, of these images
137

137

00:06:34,927  -->  00:06:37,069
at a very nice website
138

138

00:06:37,069  -->  00:06:41,236
which is called unsplash.com, I think.
139

139

00:06:44,789  -->  00:06:45,717
And yeah, right.
140

140

00:06:45,717  -->  00:06:49,055
So here you have a lot of great, free images
141

141

00:06:49,055  -->  00:06:51,589
that you can get for free.
142

142

00:06:51,589  -->  00:06:52,910
And there's a lot to explore here.
143

143

00:06:52,910  -->  00:06:54,944
But once again, you have a link to this one
144

144

00:06:54,944  -->  00:06:58,584
and to other similar websites on my resources page.
145

145

00:06:58,584  -->  00:07:00,888
All right, so we have a background image here,
146

146

00:07:00,888  -->  00:07:03,756
and we want to set it background size
147

147

00:07:03,756  -->  00:07:05,423
to cover here, okay?
148

148

00:07:10,310  -->  00:07:12,162
And I'm doing that outside of this selector here,
149

149

00:07:12,162  -->  00:07:13,474
because of course I want this
150

150

00:07:13,474  -->  00:07:15,236
to happen for all of the images.
151

151

00:07:15,236  -->  00:07:16,432
And so instead of repeating it then,
152

152

00:07:16,432  -->  00:07:20,599
for the two and three, when I put them here already.
153

153

00:07:23,002  -->  00:07:26,387
So two and three.
154

154

00:07:26,387  -->  00:07:28,620
So if I were to write this in here,
155

155

00:07:28,620  -->  00:07:31,053
then I would have to repeat it for this one and for this one
156

156

00:07:31,053  -->  00:07:32,627
and that doesn't make much sense.
157

157

00:07:32,627  -->  00:07:34,509
And so I'm applying it just
158

158

00:07:34,509  -->  00:07:36,954
on the more general selector here.
159

159

00:07:36,954  -->  00:07:39,502
All right, let's just take a look.
160

160

00:07:39,502  -->  00:07:41,900
And well, for some reason, it's not there.
161

161

00:07:41,900  -->  00:07:43,067
Let's inspect.
162

162

00:07:45,162  -->  00:07:48,162
So the picture, and okay, of course.
163

163

00:07:49,336  -->  00:07:53,003
Well, another small mistake.
164

164

00:07:55,373  -->  00:07:56,949
And now here we go.
165

165

00:07:56,949  -->  00:07:59,039
Now the element is just really small,
166

166

00:07:59,039  -->  00:08:02,820
because there are no content at all in it, okay?
167

167

00:08:02,820  -->  00:08:05,906
So that's a reason why we only have this very small picture.
168

168

00:08:05,906  -->  00:08:09,989
So once again, we have to define the height here.
169

169

00:08:10,976  -->  00:08:14,417
And I'm setting it to 23 rem and I came
170

170

00:08:14,417  -->  00:08:17,689
to this number here by experimentation once again.
171

171

00:08:17,689  -->  00:08:21,411
So now it should look better, okay.
172

172

00:08:21,411  -->  00:08:24,532
That's actually how it's supposed to be.
173

173

00:08:24,532  -->  00:08:26,428
Now about this background blend modes
174

174

00:08:26,428  -->  00:08:28,679
that I talked to you about earlier.
175

175

00:08:28,679  -->  00:08:30,183
What actually is that?
176

176

00:08:30,183  -->  00:08:32,758
Well, the background blend mode property describes
177

177

00:08:32,758  -->  00:08:35,820
how the elements, background images, should blend.
178

178

00:08:35,820  -->  00:08:37,107
And that's basically it.
179

179

00:08:37,107  -->  00:08:38,904
So imagine we have multiple backgrounds,
180

180

00:08:38,904  -->  00:08:40,145
and we want them to blend.
181

181

00:08:40,145  -->  00:08:43,408
And so we can use that property to do that.
182

182

00:08:43,408  -->  00:08:45,121
Now just blending two images
183

183

00:08:45,121  -->  00:08:46,740
wouldn't make much sense, right?
184

184

00:08:46,740  -->  00:08:49,433
and so what we're doing here is to blend the image
185

185

00:08:49,433  -->  00:08:51,035
with a linear gradient,
186

186

00:08:51,035  -->  00:08:53,924
which is also defined a background image in CSS.
187

187

00:08:53,924  -->  00:08:56,054
And so let's try that out.
188

188

00:08:56,054  -->  00:08:57,499
Okay, so the background image
189

189

00:08:57,499  -->  00:08:59,971
is not just the actual image here,
190

190

00:08:59,971  -->  00:09:02,893
but it also contains a gradient.
191

191

00:09:02,893  -->  00:09:05,830
And I can actually get that one from up here,
192

192

00:09:05,830  -->  00:09:08,785
because it's the exact same one.
193

193

00:09:08,785  -->  00:09:10,531
So it's also to the right button
194

194

00:09:10,531  -->  00:09:13,281
and with these two yellow colors.
195

195

00:09:15,455  -->  00:09:18,694
So, one background and then a comma
196

196

00:09:18,694  -->  00:09:20,789
and the second background, okay?
197

197

00:09:20,789  -->  00:09:22,247
And if we now take a look,
198

198

00:09:22,247  -->  00:09:23,946
you'll only see the one that's on top
199

199

00:09:23,946  -->  00:09:25,660
which is the gradient,
200

200

00:09:25,660  -->  00:09:29,860
but that's because we didn't actually blend them, not yet.
201

201

00:09:29,860  -->  00:09:31,860
So.
202

202

00:09:33,322  -->  00:09:35,492
Background blend mode.
203

203

00:09:35,492  -->  00:09:38,204
And once again, this is a brand new CSS property
204

204

00:09:38,204  -->  00:09:40,787
and so it doesn't work at all in Internet Explorer
205

205

00:09:40,787  -->  00:09:43,481
and neither on Microsoft Etch, okay?
206

206

00:09:43,481  -->  00:09:47,655
So only Safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome of course.
207

207

00:09:47,655  -->  00:09:49,587
So there are many different options here,
208

208

00:09:49,587  -->  00:09:53,360
and I'm going to use screen, okay?
209

209

00:09:53,360  -->  00:09:56,075
And I'm gonna show you all the different possibilities
210

210

00:09:56,075  -->  00:09:58,416
in the def tools.
211

211

00:09:58,416  -->  00:10:00,774
All right, and that's what it looks like.
212

212

00:10:00,774  -->  00:10:02,357
Let's inspect.
213

213

00:10:04,654  -->  00:10:07,620
So, well.
214

214

00:10:07,620  -->  00:10:09,513
For some reason, it doesn't work.
215

215

00:10:09,513  -->  00:10:11,932
All right, so now, after refreshing,
216

216

00:10:11,932  -->  00:10:13,501
sometimes that's necessary.
217

217

00:10:13,501  -->  00:10:16,640
So let's delete it and then in here can see
218

218

00:10:16,640  -->  00:10:18,973
the different possibilities.
219

219

00:10:19,898  -->  00:10:21,157
Well, okay, so.
220

220

00:10:21,157  -->  00:10:23,555
Color, color burn, color dodge,
221

221

00:10:23,555  -->  00:10:25,961
and so these are all the different blend modes
222

222

00:10:25,961  -->  00:10:28,500
that we have available in CSS.
223

223

00:10:28,500  -->  00:10:30,217
Maybe you are familiar with blend modes
224

224

00:10:30,217  -->  00:10:33,522
from a graphical program like Photoshop
225

225

00:10:33,522  -->  00:10:34,727
or something like that.
226

226

00:10:34,727  -->  00:10:36,152
And so before if you wanted to have
227

227

00:10:36,152  -->  00:10:38,033
some background blending going on like this,
228

228

00:10:38,033  -->  00:10:41,282
you would have to do it in Photoshop, then export it,
229

229

00:10:41,282  -->  00:10:44,899
and use it in CSS, but now with this modern CSS properties,
230

230

00:10:44,899  -->  00:10:46,803
you can do it right in CSS.
231

231

00:10:46,803  -->  00:10:50,694
So it's getting more and more powerful, okay?
232

232

00:10:50,694  -->  00:10:51,999
So we have all of these effects going on.
233

233

00:10:51,999  -->  00:10:55,953
Multiply also looks quite dramatic, I think.
234

234

00:10:55,953  -->  00:10:58,408
Then overlay, saturation.
235

235

00:10:58,408  -->  00:10:59,895
Screen, that's the one that I'm using,
236

236

00:10:59,895  -->  00:11:02,904
because it looks, I think, the most normal here.
237

237

00:11:02,904  -->  00:11:06,546
Soft light and so we're back to the beginning,
238

238

00:11:06,546  -->  00:11:10,656
so color also looks dramatic and great, I think.
239

239

00:11:10,656  -->  00:11:13,277
But again, I'm going with green here.
240

240

00:11:13,277  -->  00:11:15,965
And so that's the one I'm looking for.
241

241

00:11:15,965  -->  00:11:16,798
Okay.
242

242

00:11:16,798  -->  00:11:18,928
Now maybe you're noticing up here
243

243

00:11:18,928  -->  00:11:20,612
in the corners of these images
244

244

00:11:20,612  -->  00:11:23,804
so I cannot touch it, but here in the corners
245

245

00:11:23,804  -->  00:11:26,155
that they are no longer around it, right?
246

246

00:11:26,155  -->  00:11:27,961
Well, if I zoom this up a little bit,
247

247

00:11:27,961  -->  00:11:29,917
now let me zoom it really high.
248

248

00:11:29,917  -->  00:11:31,546
So you can see they are no longer around it.
249

249

00:11:31,546  -->  00:11:32,918
And that's because the image
250

250

00:11:32,918  -->  00:11:36,585
is basically overlapping the parent element.
251

251

00:11:38,762  -->  00:11:40,749
But there's an easy fix.
252

252

00:11:40,749  -->  00:11:43,170
And so on the parent element, which is actually where
253

253

00:11:43,170  -->  00:11:45,646
the border radius is defined,
254

254

00:11:45,646  -->  00:11:50,273
we can see the property that's called overflow,
255

255

00:11:50,273  -->  00:11:52,690
and then hit it, okay?
256

256

00:11:52,690  -->  00:11:54,292
Because basically that's what's happening.
257

257

00:11:54,292  -->  00:11:56,068
So the image is overflowing
258

258

00:11:56,068  -->  00:11:58,691
the parent in these corners, okay?
259

259

00:11:58,691  -->  00:12:01,967
So where the corners are, the image should not be
260

260

00:12:01,967  -->  00:12:04,224
and so we can simply hide these parts.
261

261

00:12:04,224  -->  00:12:07,760
So overflow hidden does that for us.
262

262

00:12:07,760  -->  00:12:11,927
And so now if we zoom in, it should be back to normal.
263

263

00:12:13,256  -->  00:12:16,630
And yeah, we see that it actually works now.
264

264

00:12:16,630  -->  00:12:18,167
At least it looks like it.
265

265

00:12:18,167  -->  00:12:19,750
Let's check it out.
266

266

00:12:23,561  -->  00:12:26,811
So if we had some more moderators here.
267

267

00:12:29,325  -->  00:12:30,794
So you see that now it's working, okay?
268

268

00:12:30,794  -->  00:12:31,763
It's really dramatic.
269

269

00:12:31,763  -->  00:12:35,013
But just to show you that it works now.
270

270

00:12:37,191  -->  00:12:38,024
All right.
271

271

00:12:38,024  -->  00:12:41,348
Now what we also want to happen here on this picture
272

272

00:12:41,348  -->  00:12:45,269
is to have the similar effect that we have on the header.
273

273

00:12:45,269  -->  00:12:46,102
So take it out.
274

274

00:12:46,102  -->  00:12:48,492
So this line here, okay.
275

275

00:12:48,492  -->  00:12:49,374
I cannot hover it.
276

276

00:12:49,374  -->  00:12:53,681
But you see this cut out part just like here in the header,
277

277

00:12:53,681  -->  00:12:55,201
this part, right?
278

278

00:12:55,201  -->  00:12:58,451
So once again, let's use clip for that.
279

279

00:12:59,390  -->  00:13:02,261
So the clip path property.
280

280

00:13:02,261  -->  00:13:03,094
Clip path.
281

281

00:13:03,094  -->  00:13:06,712
And once again, we're defining a polygon here.
282

282

00:13:06,712  -->  00:13:09,085
And now that we can actually use other things
283

283

00:13:09,085  -->  00:13:10,345
different from polygon.
284

284

00:13:10,345  -->  00:13:12,989
For example, circle or ellipsis.
285

285

00:13:12,989  -->  00:13:15,020
And we're actually gonna do a circle
286

286

00:13:15,020  -->  00:13:16,501
in one of the next lectures.
287

287

00:13:16,501  -->  00:13:19,363
In order to clip a perfect circle.
288

288

00:13:19,363  -->  00:13:20,912
Now in this case, that's not what we want,
289

289

00:13:20,912  -->  00:13:21,906
so a polygon.
290

290

00:13:21,906  -->  00:13:23,811
And I hope we remember how it works.
291

291

00:13:23,811  -->  00:13:25,842
So we define a couple of coordinates,
292

292

00:13:25,842  -->  00:13:28,241
starting from the top left corner.
293

293

00:13:28,241  -->  00:13:31,276
And so we want (0,0) in there.
294

294

00:13:31,276  -->  00:13:35,443
Then the second one is 100% in the x direction.
295

295

00:13:36,960  -->  00:13:37,793
Okay?
296

296

00:13:37,793  -->  00:13:39,449
And zero in the y direction.
297

297

00:13:39,449  -->  00:13:40,461
Remember that?
298

298

00:13:40,461  -->  00:13:42,544
So let me show it to you.
299

299

00:13:44,239  -->  00:13:47,553
So (0,0) then 100% in the x direction
300

300

00:13:47,553  -->  00:13:49,795
but zero movement in the y direction,
301

301

00:13:49,795  -->  00:13:51,157
so up and down.
302

302

00:13:51,157  -->  00:13:53,620
And now here comes the third coordinate
303

303

00:13:53,620  -->  00:13:55,374
which will be somewhere here.
304

304

00:13:55,374  -->  00:13:58,444
So this is where they actually like, the cutting happens.
305

305

00:13:58,444  -->  00:14:00,463
So we will want 100% on the x.
306

306

00:14:00,463  -->  00:14:04,830
And then on the y axis, something like 80 or 85%.
307

307

00:14:04,830  -->  00:14:08,777
So, 100% in the x direction.
308

308

00:14:08,777  -->  00:14:12,455
And lets say 85% in the y direction.
309

309

00:14:12,455  -->  00:14:15,116
And then finally the last coordinate will be,
310

310

00:14:15,116  -->  00:14:17,605
again back to zero in the x direction
311

311

00:14:17,605  -->  00:14:19,438
because it's back to the beginning.
312

312

00:14:19,438  -->  00:14:22,188
And 100% in the y direction.
313

313

00:14:23,312  -->  00:14:26,221
Okay, let's check that one out.
314

314

00:14:26,221  -->  00:14:28,638
And yep, so, that looks good.
315

315

00:14:29,913  -->  00:14:32,363
Okay, so once again, this clip path here
316

316

00:14:32,363  -->  00:14:35,178
is very modern CSS property.
317

317

00:14:35,178  -->  00:14:37,193
And in order to actually make it work
318

318

00:14:37,193  -->  00:14:40,281
across all the browsers, we should actually prefix it
319

319

00:14:40,281  -->  00:14:42,198
with the webkit prefix.
320

320

00:14:43,130  -->  00:14:46,259
So then it works in all browsers like Chrome
321

321

00:14:46,259  -->  00:14:48,342
and Safari as well, okay?
322

322

00:14:49,499  -->  00:14:51,792
So the same thing here now.
323

323

00:14:51,792  -->  00:14:55,116
So clip path and webkit clip path.
324

324

00:14:55,116  -->  00:14:56,690
And actually it should be the other way around.
325

325

00:14:56,690  -->  00:14:58,607
So first, the prefixed.
326

326

00:15:01,736  -->  00:15:03,105
Then the official version.
327

327

00:15:03,105  -->  00:15:05,759
Because this is just a blender prefix.
328

328

00:15:05,759  -->  00:15:09,296
So prefix implemented by different browsers.
329

329

00:15:09,296  -->  00:15:10,557
And actually since we're doing that,
330

330

00:15:10,557  -->  00:15:14,312
let's also do the same thing here at the header
331

331

00:15:14,312  -->  00:15:17,393
where we also used a clip path, okay?
332

332

00:15:17,393  -->  00:15:20,726
So, let me copy that one.
333

333

00:15:23,645  -->  00:15:25,395
Clip path, all right.
334

334

00:15:26,641  -->  00:15:29,599
Okay, and such as the background blend mode,
335

335

00:15:29,599  -->  00:15:30,971
clip path is not going to work
336

336

00:15:30,971  -->  00:15:34,007
on Internet Explorer and Microsoft Etch.
337

337

00:15:34,007  -->  00:15:36,206
So if you need to develop for these ones,
338

338

00:15:36,206  -->  00:15:39,911
you can at this point, not use these properties, okay?
339

339

00:15:39,911  -->  00:15:41,680
Or you can use them with a fall back.
340

340

00:15:41,680  -->  00:15:43,485
And we're gonna take care of that later.
341

341

00:15:43,485  -->  00:15:44,999
So we actually will take care
342

342

00:15:44,999  -->  00:15:47,821
of supporting different browsers in different ways.
343

343

00:15:47,821  -->  00:15:50,092
But let's leave that for later.
344

344

00:15:50,092  -->  00:15:52,512
Okay, and with the picture done, let's now take care
345

345

00:15:52,512  -->  00:15:54,579
of the heading, okay?
346

346

00:15:54,579  -->  00:15:57,829
So it's called card heading here, okay?
347

347

00:15:59,171  -->  00:16:00,588
So let's do that.
348

348

00:16:08,320  -->  00:16:09,347
So how should it look?
349

349

00:16:09,347  -->  00:16:12,801
And where should it be positioned?
350

350

00:16:12,801  -->  00:16:14,551
So let's take a look.
351

351

00:16:15,912  -->  00:16:17,983
And so it's on top of the image.
352

352

00:16:17,983  -->  00:16:21,530
Basically, we want it to have this nice background.
353

353

00:16:21,530  -->  00:16:24,433
The wide, big text, and so, yeah.
354

354

00:16:24,433  -->  00:16:25,572
Let's do that then.
355

355

00:16:25,572  -->  00:16:27,656
Now notice once again that each of these titles
356

356

00:16:27,656  -->  00:16:29,501
have a different background color
357

357

00:16:29,501  -->  00:16:34,377
according to the image and of course to the backside.
358

358

00:16:34,377  -->  00:16:37,074
So let's start with the font size
359

359

00:16:37,074  -->  00:16:40,113
of 2.8 rem for example.
360

360

00:16:40,113  -->  00:16:41,863
A font weight of 300.
361

361

00:16:45,852  -->  00:16:49,435
Text transform to uppercase.
362

362

00:16:51,442  -->  00:16:54,254
And color, remember it was white.
363

363

00:16:54,254  -->  00:16:56,004
So color,
364

364

00:16:58,105  -->  00:17:00,598
white, all right.
365

365

00:17:00,598  -->  00:17:04,090
And I think I actually set the color somewhere up here, okay
366

366

00:17:04,090  -->  00:17:07,782
but remember this was just for testing and this as well.
367

367

00:17:07,782  -->  00:17:12,060
So let's remove that testing part we had set up before.
368

368

00:17:12,060  -->  00:17:14,060
So what should be here?
369

369

00:17:14,060  -->  00:17:16,475
And now actually I'm seeing that I have a div here.
370

370

00:17:16,475  -->  00:17:18,155
But that's not really semantic.
371

371

00:17:18,155  -->  00:17:20,530
So semantic means that we're using
372

372

00:17:20,530  -->  00:17:23,763
the right HTML tag for the right content.
373

373

00:17:23,763  -->  00:17:27,913
And so if it's a heading, we should actually use an h tag.
374

374

00:17:27,913  -->  00:17:31,128
So h4, so we used h1, 2, and 3.
375

375

00:17:31,128  -->  00:17:35,333
And now it's time to use h4 element on this one.
376

376

00:17:35,333  -->  00:17:39,500
And so it says the first one is "The Sea Explorer."
377

377

00:17:40,685  -->  00:17:43,123
Let's check that out.
378

378

00:17:43,123  -->  00:17:47,558
And well, it's hidden behind here because it's white.
379

379

00:17:47,558  -->  00:17:49,114
So here it is, actually.
380

380

00:17:49,114  -->  00:17:53,009
Now remember, we want this to be on top of the image, right?
381

381

00:17:53,009  -->  00:17:54,343
So what can we do?
382

382

00:17:54,343  -->  00:17:57,259
We will use absolute positioning once again.
383

383

00:17:57,259  -->  00:17:58,676
So let's do that.
384

384

00:18:01,641  -->  00:18:03,808
So down here.
385

385

00:18:06,022  -->  00:18:07,605
Position, absolute.
386

386

00:18:08,677  -->  00:18:12,322
And we want it from the top at 12 rem.
387

387

00:18:12,322  -->  00:18:15,072
And from the right side at 2 rem.
388

388

00:18:18,342  -->  00:18:19,647
And also since we're at it,
389

389

00:18:19,647  -->  00:18:22,480
let's align the text to the right.
390

390

00:18:24,992  -->  00:18:26,393
So we have everything nicely aligned
391

391

00:18:26,393  -->  00:18:29,081
to the right side of the card.
392

392

00:18:29,081  -->  00:18:31,228
So let's see that now.
393

393

00:18:31,228  -->  00:18:33,643
And so now it's almost the way that we want it.
394

394

00:18:33,643  -->  00:18:36,383
Well not perfectly, but we're gonna take care
395

395

00:18:36,383  -->  00:18:37,532
of that right now.
396

396

00:18:37,532  -->  00:18:40,319
Now in order to create this look that we have here,
397

397

00:18:40,319  -->  00:18:42,366
with these two lines and with basically
398

398

00:18:42,366  -->  00:18:45,067
the gradient applying on each of them,
399

399

00:18:45,067  -->  00:18:46,667
we need to use a new CSS property
400

400

00:18:46,667  -->  00:18:49,142
called "box decoration break."
401

401

00:18:49,142  -->  00:18:50,476
And in order for that to work,
402

402

00:18:50,476  -->  00:18:53,781
I need to create the new element inside of this h4.
403

403

00:18:53,781  -->  00:18:56,335
So again, this will make more sense a bit later.
404

404

00:18:56,335  -->  00:18:59,321
For now, let's just do it this way.
405

405

00:18:59,321  -->  00:19:01,154
So, in here,
406

406

00:19:02,796  -->  00:19:05,543
let me simply add a span element here, okay?
407

407

00:19:05,543  -->  00:19:09,710
So this is just something to wrap around the text card.
408

408

00:19:13,258  -->  00:19:16,954
We wanna call this one "heading span."
409

409

00:19:16,954  -->  00:19:20,704
And now "The Sea Explorer" text goes in here.
410

410

00:19:22,361  -->  00:19:25,524
Also, I'll need a modifier class here
411

411

00:19:25,524  -->  00:19:29,513
because I wanted three different gradients, right?
412

412

00:19:29,513  -->  00:19:32,285
So one yellow, one green, and one blue.
413

413

00:19:32,285  -->  00:19:34,168
And so this is the way I have to do it.
414

414

00:19:34,168  -->  00:19:36,084
So you see it's getting rather complex,
415

415

00:19:36,084  -->  00:19:38,876
such as I was saying in the beginning of the lecture.
416

416

00:19:38,876  -->  00:19:40,540
But since we're building it step by step
417

417

00:19:40,540  -->  00:19:42,925
and really explaining everything on the way,
418

418

00:19:42,925  -->  00:19:45,627
it should not really be a problem, right?
419

419

00:19:45,627  -->  00:19:47,467
So let's copy this one,
420

420

00:19:47,467  -->  00:19:52,122
or actually we don't need because our SASS nesting.
421

421

00:19:52,122  -->  00:19:56,326
So all we have to do is to add the span here now.
422

422

00:19:56,326  -->  00:20:01,311
Or actually, that's not really a good practice, okay?
423

423

00:20:01,311  -->  00:20:05,521
So let me add heading, span,
424

424

00:20:05,521  -->  00:20:08,910
because this is not really a child of the heading.
425

425

00:20:08,910  -->  00:20:11,726
This is a whole new element called "heading span."
426

426

00:20:11,726  -->  00:20:13,524
So it's not a modifier of heading,
427

427

00:20:13,524  -->  00:20:15,469
and it's not an element of heading,
428

428

00:20:15,469  -->  00:20:19,528
so it's a new element in the BEM system, okay?
429

429

00:20:19,528  -->  00:20:22,500
And so I will have a separate selector for that one.
430

430

00:20:22,500  -->  00:20:24,940
And now the next thing I wanna do
431

431

00:20:24,940  -->  00:20:29,107
is to give it this nice background gradient, okay?
432

432

00:20:30,645  -->  00:20:34,401
And so now I'm selecting one with the modifier one.
433

433

00:20:34,401  -->  00:20:37,112
So card heading span one.
434

434

00:20:37,112  -->  00:20:39,769
And so I want the background image here for the gradient
435

435

00:20:39,769  -->  00:20:43,936
background image, linear gradient to right bottom.
436

436

00:20:49,842  -->  00:20:52,947
Was writing it outside the parenthesis for some reason.
437

437

00:20:52,947  -->  00:20:56,277
So and now I want it to be slightly transparent.
438

438

00:20:56,277  -->  00:20:59,027
So I need to use some rgbas here.
439

439

00:20:59,955  -->  00:21:03,288
So that we can still see through the element.
440

440

00:21:03,288  -->  00:21:05,455
So this is the color here,
441

441

00:21:07,481  -->  00:21:08,892
for the number one as well.
442

442

00:21:08,892  -->  00:21:13,483
So all of the ones have the same yellow colors.
443

443

00:21:13,483  -->  00:21:16,229
And then 0.85 off value.
444

444

00:21:16,229  -->  00:21:18,979
And then in here, it is the dark.
445

445

00:21:22,269  -->  00:21:24,459
Also with 0.85.
446

446

00:21:24,459  -->  00:21:26,811
Okay, so this looks rather complex.
447

447

00:21:26,811  -->  00:21:30,608
Let's break it up a little bit here.
448

448

00:21:30,608  -->  00:21:32,139
All right.
449

449

00:21:32,139  -->  00:21:34,289
So let's take a look now.
450

450

00:21:34,289  -->  00:21:35,172
All right.
451

451

00:21:35,172  -->  00:21:39,005
Now, let me make this slightly narrower, okay?
452

452

00:21:40,875  -->  00:21:43,870
So give it a width of not 100%, what it has right now.
453

453

00:21:43,870  -->  00:21:48,503
Because it's a block element, but give it just 75%.
454

454

00:21:48,503  -->  00:21:50,197
Sorry about that.
455

455

00:21:50,197  -->  00:21:52,427
And well, that didn't change anything.
456

456

00:21:52,427  -->  00:21:53,927
Why is that?
457

457

00:21:55,788  -->  00:21:58,058
Let me see what happens if I decrease it even further.
458

458

00:21:58,058  -->  00:21:59,495
Ah, Okay.
459

459

00:21:59,495  -->  00:22:04,264
So it should simply be a smaller value here, okay.
460

460

00:22:04,264  -->  00:22:06,681
So if you go to 100,
461

461

00:22:08,223  -->  00:22:11,022
then it's back to occupying the entire width that it can.
462

462

00:22:11,022  -->  00:22:14,302
So you see that by the blue box.
463

463

00:22:14,302  -->  00:22:16,618
Now by just adding some padding here,
464

464

00:22:16,618  -->  00:22:18,435
let's say 10 pixels top, bottom,
465

465

00:22:18,435  -->  00:22:21,979
and 1.5 rem in here.
466

466

00:22:21,979  -->  00:22:23,658
Then that should actually fix it
467

467

00:22:23,658  -->  00:22:27,450
because this will create some more space
468

468

00:22:27,450  -->  00:22:28,812
and so yeah, so here we go.
469

469

00:22:28,812  -->  00:22:30,608
And so now this already looks pretty close
470

470

00:22:30,608  -->  00:22:33,035
to the end result that we want, right?
471

471

00:22:33,035  -->  00:22:37,012
Now you see that we edit the padding here, okay?
472

472

00:22:37,012  -->  00:22:40,148
So you see the padding going around on this entire element.
473

473

00:22:40,148  -->  00:22:42,927
But you see that here besides "a", we don't have any space
474

474

00:22:42,927  -->  00:22:45,507
like we have on the other side beside the "t."
475

475

00:22:45,507  -->  00:22:46,929
And down here at the "e,"
476

476

00:22:46,929  -->  00:22:48,567
at the beginning of "explorer,"
477

477

00:22:48,567  -->  00:22:51,227
we also don't have any padding.
478

478

00:22:51,227  -->  00:22:52,282
And that's because this element
479

479

00:22:52,282  -->  00:22:54,530
is treated as one line of text.
480

480

00:22:54,530  -->  00:22:56,858
And so basically acts as one element
481

481

00:22:56,858  -->  00:22:58,273
where the padding gets applied
482

482

00:22:58,273  -->  00:22:59,935
on the left and on the right side.
483

483

00:22:59,935  -->  00:23:02,025
And the left is left at the "the,"
484

484

00:23:02,025  -->  00:23:04,911
and the right side is right of the "explorer" word.
485

485

00:23:04,911  -->  00:23:06,442
So what we want is to exactly treat
486

486

00:23:06,442  -->  00:23:08,926
these two entities like these two lines
487

487

00:23:08,926  -->  00:23:11,881
as if they were two different elements, right?
488

488

00:23:11,881  -->  00:23:14,703
And there's actually a way of doing that.
489

489

00:23:14,703  -->  00:23:16,719
And so that magic happens when we use
490

490

00:23:16,719  -->  00:23:19,459
the box decoration break property.
491

491

00:23:19,459  -->  00:23:22,116
So box decoration break.
492

492

00:23:22,116  -->  00:23:24,595
And we're gonna set it to clone.
493

493

00:23:24,595  -->  00:23:27,836
And actually, this doesn't work right now
494

494

00:23:27,836  -->  00:23:31,919
at Google Chrome without the webkit prefix, okay?
495

495

00:23:33,577  -->  00:23:36,653
So we need this, this prefix here in order to make it work.
496

496

00:23:36,653  -->  00:23:37,754
And so let's take a look.
497

497

00:23:37,754  -->  00:23:38,607
And here we go.
498

498

00:23:38,607  -->  00:23:41,135
So that's how you want this to look like.
499

499

00:23:41,135  -->  00:23:44,656
Let me actually disable here this hover.
500

500

00:23:44,656  -->  00:23:47,845
In fact, we can do so by clicking here.
501

501

00:23:47,845  -->  00:23:49,451
Then we click here on hover.
502

502

00:23:49,451  -->  00:23:52,478
And so then we can see the styles.
503

503

00:23:52,478  -->  00:23:54,852
Which apply when we hover.
504

504

00:23:54,852  -->  00:23:58,602
They should be somewhere down here.
505

505

00:23:58,602  -->  00:24:01,992
Well actually, this is not where we want to hover of course.
506

506

00:24:01,992  -->  00:24:03,681
We hover the entire card.
507

507

00:24:03,681  -->  00:24:04,514
So sorry.
508

508

00:24:04,514  -->  00:24:06,085
Imagine that we hover this.
509

509

00:24:06,085  -->  00:24:10,226
And now we can disable the styles.
510

510

00:24:10,226  -->  00:24:13,143
Well at least we should be able to.
511

511

00:24:15,183  -->  00:24:16,600
Ah yeah, so here.
512

512

00:24:17,692  -->  00:24:19,293
Here we go, so.
513

513

00:24:19,293  -->  00:24:23,043
This part rotates and where is the other one?
514

514

00:24:24,539  -->  00:24:26,631
Yeah, it's the backside.
515

515

00:24:26,631  -->  00:24:30,131
And so, so now we should be able to touch it
516

516

00:24:30,131  -->  00:24:34,214
without it rotating all the time, you like crazy.
517

517

00:24:35,851  -->  00:24:40,018
So, let's take away this property here and see what happens.
518

518

00:24:43,222  -->  00:24:44,621
So this is what it looked like before.
519

519

00:24:44,621  -->  00:24:47,415
So we didn't have this space here that we wanted.
520

520

00:24:47,415  -->  00:24:48,248
And not here.
521

521

00:24:48,248  -->  00:24:51,716
But only here in the beginning and here at the end.
522

522

00:24:51,716  -->  00:24:55,222
And to fix that, we use this property.
523

523

00:24:55,222  -->  00:24:57,910
And for some reason, it doesn't work without checking
524

524

00:24:57,910  -->  00:24:59,865
and un-checking this one.
525

525

00:24:59,865  -->  00:25:01,177
But now, here we are, so.
526

526

00:25:01,177  -->  00:25:04,606
Now these are, like, two completely different entities.
527

527

00:25:04,606  -->  00:25:06,670
And that's what the clone does.
528

528

00:25:06,670  -->  00:25:09,564
So what clone does is to simply apply all the declarations
529

529

00:25:09,564  -->  00:25:12,040
that we have in the selector which in this case
530

530

00:25:12,040  -->  00:25:15,029
is only the padding to all of the boxes
531

531

00:25:15,029  -->  00:25:16,899
that I created by an element.
532

532

00:25:16,899  -->  00:25:18,219
Just like in this case.
533

533

00:25:18,219  -->  00:25:21,161
So one element, two boxes, both styled.
534

534

00:25:21,161  -->  00:25:22,288
Now in the same way.
535

535

00:25:22,288  -->  00:25:24,140
Both with the same padding.
536

536

00:25:24,140  -->  00:25:26,880
All right, and so we have that part as well.
537

537

00:25:26,880  -->  00:25:28,871
So two or three parts are done.
538

538

00:25:28,871  -->  00:25:32,836
And now the final one is just this list.
539

539

00:25:32,836  -->  00:25:34,507
And that should be the easiest part.
540

540

00:25:34,507  -->  00:25:36,777
So let's do that real quick before we end up
541

541

00:25:36,777  -->  00:25:39,272
with a one hour video here, okay?
542

542

00:25:39,272  -->  00:25:41,009
So simply a list.
543

543

00:25:41,009  -->  00:25:43,505
And so we create a ul element.
544

544

00:25:43,505  -->  00:25:45,746
Now I could go crazy here with the BEM notation
545

545

00:25:45,746  -->  00:25:49,784
and add card list now, and then to all of the items in there
546

546

00:25:49,784  -->  00:25:52,367
I could add card item and so we would end up
547

547

00:25:52,367  -->  00:25:55,078
with a bunch of different class names,
548

548

00:25:55,078  -->  00:25:56,753
but let's not do that.
549

549

00:25:56,753  -->  00:25:59,480
And that's very simply create an unordered list in here
550

550

00:25:59,480  -->  00:26:03,131
that we can then select with the card details selector.
551

551

00:26:03,131  -->  00:26:03,964
Okay?
552

552

00:26:03,964  -->  00:26:06,876
So ul, then remember that with Emmet,
553

553

00:26:06,876  -->  00:26:09,814
we can do it like this so we can create some child elements.
554

554

00:26:09,814  -->  00:26:12,751
And remember that we want five li elements in there.
555

555

00:26:12,751  -->  00:26:15,630
And so we can write li times five.
556

556

00:26:15,630  -->  00:26:17,970
Hit tab and here we go.
557

557

00:26:17,970  -->  00:26:20,887
So the first one says "3 day tour."
558

558

00:26:21,753  -->  00:26:25,336
Hitting tab moves me to the next one, okay?
559

559

00:26:27,391  -->  00:26:29,308
"Up to 30 people."
560

560

00:26:31,002  -->  00:26:32,835
"2 tour guides."
561

561

00:26:36,382  -->  00:26:38,299
"Sleep in cozy hotels."
562

562

00:26:39,546  -->  00:26:41,713
And finally the difficulty
563

563

00:26:44,645  -->  00:26:45,478
is easy.
564

564

00:26:45,478  -->  00:26:47,069
So an easy tour is this one.
565

565

00:26:47,069  -->  00:26:51,236
So card details and so let's now go style that one.
566

566

00:26:52,549  -->  00:26:56,052
So we have the picture, the heading,
567

567

00:26:56,052  -->  00:26:57,385
and now the card
568

568

00:27:00,870  -->  00:27:02,240
details.
569

569

00:27:02,240  -->  00:27:04,318
Okay, so in the details, we have the ul.
570

570

00:27:04,318  -->  00:27:07,389
So we simply have to write "ul" here.
571

571

00:27:07,389  -->  00:27:10,222
And then in here, we have the lis.
572

572

00:27:12,015  -->  00:27:13,348
Right?
573

573

00:27:14,570  -->  00:27:16,090
So list style, none.
574

574

00:27:16,090  -->  00:27:16,996
This is pretty standard.
575

575

00:27:16,996  -->  00:27:18,331
We basically do it all the time
576

576

00:27:18,331  -->  00:27:21,048
when we use an unordered list.
577

577

00:27:21,048  -->  00:27:24,798
We say we want it to have a width of 80%
578

578

00:27:25,773  -->  00:27:29,180
so that it doesn't occupy all of the space in here, okay?
579

579

00:27:29,180  -->  00:27:31,088
So remember this is what it looks like.
580

580

00:27:31,088  -->  00:27:32,983
And we want all of these items then
581

581

00:27:32,983  -->  00:27:34,723
to have a line under them.
582

582

00:27:34,723  -->  00:27:37,609
So they should be slightly underlined.
583

583

00:27:37,609  -->  00:27:39,525
But we don't want that to go completely
584

584

00:27:39,525  -->  00:27:41,139
from the left to the right side.
585

585

00:27:41,139  -->  00:27:45,133
And so this complete list should only have a width of 80%.
586

586

00:27:45,133  -->  00:27:48,265
And so this way we take care of that.
587

587

00:27:48,265  -->  00:27:49,098
Okay?
588

588

00:27:49,098  -->  00:27:52,856
And now just item, you saw that it had centered text.
589

589

00:27:52,856  -->  00:27:57,023
So text align, center.
590

590

00:27:58,805  -->  00:28:01,388
Font size, 1.5 rem.
591

591

00:28:02,306  -->  00:28:04,973
Let's give it also some padding.
592

592

00:28:08,709  -->  00:28:11,182
And then the border at the bottom of one pixels.
593

593

00:28:11,182  -->  00:28:13,549
Now we don't want it to happen on all of them.
594

594

00:28:13,549  -->  00:28:15,785
But on all of them except the last one.
595

595

00:28:15,785  -->  00:28:17,080
So how do we do that?
596

596

00:28:17,080  -->  00:28:21,247
We already learned it and used it multiple times by now.
597

597

00:28:22,188  -->  00:28:24,986
So we say that we want the li elements
598

598

00:28:24,986  -->  00:28:27,903
that are not the last child.
599

599

00:28:35,688  -->  00:28:38,430
I want them to be this solid gray.
600

600

00:28:38,430  -->  00:28:40,378
This "eee" gray.
601

601

00:28:40,378  -->  00:28:41,942
Okay, and since we're using a color,
602

602

00:28:41,942  -->  00:28:44,874
let's create a new variables.
603

603

00:28:44,874  -->  00:28:49,396
So, we have one light color already
604

604

00:28:49,396  -->  00:28:51,950
but this one is a little bit darker.
605

605

00:28:51,950  -->  00:28:54,435
So we use a new variable for that one.
606

606

00:28:54,435  -->  00:28:56,360
Let me copy it right away.
607

607

00:28:56,360  -->  00:28:58,549
So all we have to do now
608

608

00:28:58,549  -->  00:29:00,016
is to paste it in here.
609

609

00:29:00,016  -->  00:29:02,675
All right, let's take a look.
610

610

00:29:02,675  -->  00:29:06,149
Okay, so we see these 80% width going on,
611

611

00:29:06,149  -->  00:29:08,000
but of course, they should be in the center of the card,
612

612

00:29:08,000  -->  00:29:10,625
not pushed all the way to the left side.
613

613

00:29:10,625  -->  00:29:13,875
And we should also probably have some space here.
614

614

00:29:13,875  -->  00:29:17,707
Well, in the beginning basically off the list, okay?
615

615

00:29:17,707  -->  00:29:18,879
So let's take care of that.
616

616

00:29:18,879  -->  00:29:22,129
Basically, we can set a padding in here
617

617

00:29:23,941  -->  00:29:26,813
of 3 rem and that will take care of that.
618

618

00:29:26,813  -->  00:29:29,043
And then remember that we want this ul here
619

619

00:29:29,043  -->  00:29:33,317
which has this 80% width to be centered in the container.
620

620

00:29:33,317  -->  00:29:34,794
And so how do we do that?
621

621

00:29:34,794  -->  00:29:37,006
Do you know a good way of doing that?
622

622

00:29:37,006  -->  00:29:40,399
Well, whenever I can, I like to use the most simple methods.
623

623

00:29:40,399  -->  00:29:43,040
And so I'm not going to go with absolute positioning
624

624

00:29:43,040  -->  00:29:44,176
or stuff like that.
625

625

00:29:44,176  -->  00:29:45,948
I'm using a simple way.
626

626

00:29:45,948  -->  00:29:47,783
So we're centering a block element inside
627

627

00:29:47,783  -->  00:29:48,996
of a block element.
628

628

00:29:48,996  -->  00:29:50,589
And so the simplest way
629

629

00:29:50,589  -->  00:29:54,756
is to simply use margin: 0 auto.
630

630

00:29:56,487  -->  00:29:59,343
So 0, top and bottom, and left and right
631

631

00:29:59,343  -->  00:30:01,839
automatically calculated by the browser.
632

632

00:30:01,839  -->  00:30:03,191
So I already explained that to you
633

633

00:30:03,191  -->  00:30:05,995
when we did the rows in the grid system, all right?
634

634

00:30:05,995  -->  00:30:08,532
So let's take a look at it now.
635

635

00:30:08,532  -->  00:30:11,696
And that looks pretty good to me.
636

636

00:30:11,696  -->  00:30:13,524
Maybe we want some more space down there
637

637

00:30:13,524  -->  00:30:17,691
and we can do that by actually increasing the entire card.
638

638

00:30:19,265  -->  00:30:22,598
So let's add some 10 pixels for example.
639

639

00:30:26,133  -->  00:30:29,622
Maybe even some more 10 pixels.
640

640

00:30:29,622  -->  00:30:31,988
Remember we have to set it here in two places
641

641

00:30:31,988  -->  00:30:34,820
because one, we have the height of the entire card
642

642

00:30:34,820  -->  00:30:37,487
and then for both the sides.
643

643

00:30:38,901  -->  00:30:42,064
And so, yeah, now it looks good.
644

644

00:30:42,064  -->  00:30:44,845
It looks fantastic in fact.
645

645

00:30:44,845  -->  00:30:46,540
So the front part is ready.
646

646

00:30:46,540  -->  00:30:49,295
Now all we have to do is to style the back part.
647

647

00:30:49,295  -->  00:30:51,259
But that should be a lot more easy
648

648

00:30:51,259  -->  00:30:52,722
than the front part, okay?
649

649

00:30:52,722  -->  00:30:56,889
So that's what we're going to do in the next lecture.
