00:00:00,936  -->  00:00:03,080
<v Narrator>Now that we have our project all set up,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,080  -->  00:00:05,987
let's talk about three important and fundamental principles
3

3

00:00:05,987  -->  00:00:08,170
that we need to constantly keep in mind
4

4

00:00:08,170  -->  00:00:11,536
if we want to build good modern websites or web apps
5

5

00:00:11,536  -->  00:00:13,638
with HTML and CSS.
6

6

00:00:13,638  -->  00:00:15,310
And they call them the three pillars
7

7

00:00:15,310  -->  00:00:17,923
of writing good HTML and CSS.
8

8

00:00:17,923  -->  00:00:20,766
Now, this lecture is not exactly about coding,
9

9

00:00:20,766  -->  00:00:22,451
but it's absolutely crucial
10

10

00:00:22,451  -->  00:00:24,366
that we talk about these principles here
11

11

00:00:24,366  -->  00:00:26,375
right in the beginning of the course.
12

12

00:00:26,375  -->  00:00:29,728
So let me start off the project without making any mistakes
13

13

00:00:29,728  -->  00:00:33,269
you would later then have to fix down the road.
14

14

00:00:33,269  -->  00:00:36,418
Alright. So the three pillars are responsive design,
15

15

00:00:36,418  -->  00:00:39,069
writing maintainable and scalable code,
16

16

00:00:39,069  -->  00:00:41,851
and carrying about web performance.
17

17

00:00:41,851  -->  00:00:44,619
But let's look at them one by one.
18

18

00:00:44,619  -->  00:00:47,626
So, the first principle is responsive design,
19

19

00:00:47,626  -->  00:00:49,555
or responsive web design,
20

20

00:00:49,555  -->  00:00:52,009
which simply means that we build one website
21

21

00:00:52,009  -->  00:00:54,621
that works beautifully across all screen sizes
22

22

00:00:54,621  -->  00:00:56,288
on all devices.
23

23

00:00:56,288  -->  00:00:58,562
But I'm sure you already know that, right?
24

24

00:00:58,562  -->  00:01:02,041
So, responsive design is absolutely a standard today,
25

25

00:01:02,041  -->  00:01:04,210
and so there is no way you're going to build
26

26

00:01:04,210  -->  00:01:08,351
a non-responsive website in 2017 or even later.
27

27

00:01:08,351  -->  00:01:10,561
Now, if you're taking this advanced course,
28

28

00:01:10,561  -->  00:01:12,496
then I assume that you already know
29

29

00:01:12,496  -->  00:01:15,518
at least the fundamentals of responsive web design.
30

30

00:01:15,518  -->  00:01:19,352
Things like fluid layouts and media queries.
31

31

00:01:19,352  -->  00:01:22,409
But we're going to take it one step further in this course
32

32

00:01:22,409  -->  00:01:25,771
because modern responsive design also include stuff like
33

33

00:01:25,771  -->  00:01:29,510
responsive images, which is a huge topic itself,
34

34

00:01:29,510  -->  00:01:31,302
using correct units for things like
35

35

00:01:31,302  -->  00:01:33,676
font sizes or element dimensions,
36

36

00:01:33,676  -->  00:01:36,372
and it also includes either desktop-first
37

37

00:01:36,372  -->  00:01:38,344
or a mobile-first strategy.
38

38

00:01:38,344  -->  00:01:39,942
We're going to talk about all of that
39

39

00:01:39,942  -->  00:01:42,640
during the project of this course.
40

40

00:01:42,640  -->  00:01:44,851
Next up, we need to talk about
41

41

00:01:44,851  -->  00:01:47,881
writing maintainable and scalable code.
42

42

00:01:47,881  -->  00:01:50,043
Now, this is actually more important for you,
43

43

00:01:50,043  -->  00:01:53,595
the developer, than for the final user of the website.
44

44

00:01:53,595  -->  00:01:55,562
But it's still something we need to follow
45

45

00:01:55,562  -->  00:01:58,100
if we want to build a good website.
46

46

00:01:58,100  -->  00:02:00,462
So, writing maintainable and scalable code
47

47

00:02:00,462  -->  00:02:05,198
means to write code that is clean, easy to understand,
48

48

00:02:05,198  -->  00:02:08,159
that supports future growth, and above all,
49

49

00:02:08,159  -->  00:02:11,800
it is reusable for you, as well as for other developers
50

50

00:02:11,800  -->  00:02:14,969
who might take on your project in the future.
51

51

00:02:14,969  -->  00:02:18,353
So, if we want to write maintainable and scalable code,
52

52

00:02:18,353  -->  00:02:21,987
we need to care and think about our CSS architecture,
53

53

00:02:21,987  -->  00:02:24,396
which is the way we organize our files,
54

54

00:02:24,396  -->  00:02:25,906
how we name our classes,
55

55

00:02:25,906  -->  00:02:28,968
and how we structure our mark up in HTML.
56

56

00:02:28,968  -->  00:02:31,025
Now, don't worry if all these sound weird
57

57

00:02:31,025  -->  00:02:33,770
or complicated to you, because it's really not.
58

58

00:02:33,770  -->  00:02:36,295
And we'll talk about these stuff in a separate lecture
59

59

00:02:36,295  -->  00:02:38,334
a bit later in the section.
60

60

00:02:38,334  -->  00:02:40,247
What I want you to understand for now
61

61

00:02:40,247  -->  00:02:42,286
is that this stuff is really important
62

62

00:02:42,286  -->  00:02:43,884
if you want to step up your game
63

63

00:02:43,884  -->  00:02:45,798
and become a more professional CSS
64

64

00:02:45,798  -->  00:02:48,557
or front-end web developer in general.
65

65

00:02:48,557  -->  00:02:50,687
Writing maintainable code
66

66

00:02:50,687  -->  00:02:53,089
is something that all professional web developers
67

67

00:02:53,089  -->  00:02:55,312
care about a lot.
68

68

00:02:55,312  -->  00:02:57,241
Alright, and last but not least,
69

69

00:02:57,241  -->  00:02:59,308
let's talk web performance.
70

70

00:02:59,308  -->  00:03:01,943
Making a website or app more performant
71

71

00:03:01,943  -->  00:03:05,414
means to make it faster and to make it smaller in size,
72

72

00:03:05,414  -->  00:03:08,717
so that the user has to download less data.
73

73

00:03:08,717  -->  00:03:11,380
Now, there are many things that affect performance,
74

74

00:03:11,380  -->  00:03:14,348
and some factors don't have much to do with our code.
75

75

00:03:14,348  -->  00:03:16,698
But some of the things that we can do
76

76

00:03:16,698  -->  00:03:20,403
is to make as little HTTP requests as possible,
77

77

00:03:20,403  -->  00:03:23,338
meaning that we should include as little as possible files
78

78

00:03:23,338  -->  00:03:25,034
in our HTML document,
79

79

00:03:25,034  -->  00:03:27,839
write as little code as possible of course,
80

80

00:03:27,839  -->  00:03:32,005
compress our code, and use a preprocessor like Sass
81

81

00:03:32,005  -->  00:03:34,360
that we're going to explore later in this course.
82

82

00:03:34,360  -->  00:03:35,835
Now, this is all great,
83

83

00:03:35,835  -->  00:03:38,946
but maybe the biggest impact we can have on performance
84

84

00:03:38,946  -->  00:03:42,290
is to actually reduce the use of images
85

85

00:03:42,290  -->  00:03:45,268
because images are usually what makes up by far
86

86

00:03:45,268  -->  00:03:48,297
the biggest part of the size of a website.
87

87

00:03:48,297  -->  00:03:51,947
We can do so by using only images that are really necessary
88

88

00:03:51,947  -->  00:03:53,881
for a website or app.
89

89

00:03:53,881  -->  00:03:55,903
And also by compressing these images
90

90

00:03:55,903  -->  00:04:00,001
so that you use less bandwidth for the final user.
91

91

00:04:00,001  -->  00:04:02,450
Okay, so, these are the three pillars
92

92

00:04:02,450  -->  00:04:04,505
that we will have in mind all the time
93

93

00:04:04,505  -->  00:04:06,537
while building our project.
94

94

00:04:06,537  -->  00:04:08,239
We have to always ask ourselves
95

95

00:04:08,239  -->  00:04:10,520
if the code we are writing is responsive,
96

96

00:04:10,520  -->  00:04:12,458
if it is maintainable and scalable,
97

97

00:04:12,458  -->  00:04:15,291
and if it affects web performance.
