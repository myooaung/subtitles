00:00:01.379  -->  00:00:03.404
<v Instructor>Let's start our project by defining</v>
2

2

00:00:03.404  -->  00:00:05.967
the basic project settings just like we did
3

3

00:00:05.967  -->  00:00:08.755
in our previous project.
4

4

00:00:08.755  -->  00:00:11.739
And in order to do so you will learn how and when
5

5

00:00:11.739  -->  00:00:15.906
to use custom properties in CSS instead of SASS variables.
6

6

00:00:17.190  -->  00:00:19.133
Now before we start with the code itself,
7

7

00:00:19.133  -->  00:00:22.312
I want to first talk a bit about architecture here.
8

8

00:00:22.312  -->  00:00:24.328
In this project, I don't want to worry
9

9

00:00:24.328  -->  00:00:25.751
so much about architecture.
10

10

00:00:25.751  -->  00:00:27.235
I'm not going to create all these folders
11

11

00:00:27.235  -->  00:00:31.059
and all these files like I showed you in the last project
12

12

00:00:31.059  -->  00:00:33.056
because in the last project I really wanted to focus
13

13

00:00:33.056  -->  00:00:35.114
on that and make it like an important
14

14

00:00:35.114  -->  00:00:36.625
feature of the project.
15

15

00:00:36.625  -->  00:00:38.137
But this time, all we want to do here
16

16

00:00:38.137  -->  00:00:40.387
is really to learn Flexbox.
17

17

00:00:42.013  -->  00:00:43.296
All I'm gonna here is to just create three
18

18

00:00:43.296  -->  00:00:46.149
very simple files, one for the base settings,
19

19

00:00:46.149  -->  00:00:48.873
one for the overall layout of the app,
20

20

00:00:48.873  -->  00:00:51.832
and one for our smaller components.
21

21

00:00:51.832  -->  00:00:53.782
That way we don't have to jump back and forth
22

22

00:00:53.782  -->  00:00:55.941
between all these different files and can focus
23

23

00:00:55.941  -->  00:00:57.735
more on the code.
24

24

00:00:57.735  -->  00:00:59.453
But this doesn't mean that architecture
25

25

00:00:59.453  -->  00:01:01.372
is not important because it is.
26

26

00:01:01.372  -->  00:01:03.925
But again, the main focus of this project is just
27

27

00:01:03.925  -->  00:01:05.342
to learn Flexbox.
28

28

00:01:06.605  -->  00:01:09.296
Let's now just create these files.
29

29

00:01:09.296  -->  00:01:10.379
So base.scss,
30

30

00:01:13.347  -->  00:01:15.097
then I'm gonna create
31

31

00:01:16.971  -->  00:01:20.721
layout.scss and then finally components.scss.
32

32

00:01:27.706  -->  00:01:31.764
Actually we can copy all of this stuff here
33

33

00:01:31.764  -->  00:01:33.264
into the base file
34

34

00:01:34.877  -->  00:01:38.368
and then import these three files into this one,
35

35

00:01:38.368  -->  00:01:41.555
just as we did in the last project.
36

36

00:01:41.555  -->  00:01:44.525
These three files here are our partials
37

37

00:01:44.525  -->  00:01:46.901
and then we do three imports.
38

38

00:01:46.901  -->  00:01:47.734
So import
39

39

00:01:49.588  -->  00:01:50.421
base
40

40

00:01:52.151  -->  00:01:55.992
and then I'm just gonna copy this over.
41

41

00:01:55.992  -->  00:01:58.492
So base, layout and component.
42

42

00:02:02.896  -->  00:02:06.122
Let's give this a save and take a look at our page here.
43

43

00:02:06.122  -->  00:02:09.336
Everything is still working the same and so our imports
44

44

00:02:09.336  -->  00:02:12.277
here work and we have our very small
45

45

00:02:12.277  -->  00:02:15.995
and very simple architecture here all set up.
46

46

00:02:15.995  -->  00:02:18.497
We're not going to need the main file anymore,
47

47

00:02:18.497  -->  00:02:22.664
neither the component nor the layout files for now.
48

48

00:02:23.673  -->  00:02:27.497
Let's now start with these basic project settings.
49

49

00:02:27.497  -->  00:02:29.997
I want to start with the HTML,
50

50

00:02:31.523  -->  00:02:33.693
and the first thing I want to do is to set
51

51

00:02:33.693  -->  00:02:34.618
the box sizing.
52

52

00:02:34.618  -->  00:02:36.030
I'm going to do it exactly the same way
53

53

00:02:36.030  -->  00:02:38.209
as I did in the other project.
54

54

00:02:38.209  -->  00:02:40.953
So I set it to border box here in HTML
55

55

00:02:40.953  -->  00:02:45.274
and then I make everything inherit this property.
56

56

00:02:45.274  -->  00:02:49.107
So the universal selector, and also the after,
57

57

00:02:49.998  -->  00:02:52.498
and the before pseudo element.
58

58

00:02:55.702  -->  00:02:58.159
So all the elements as well as all the before and after
59

59

00:02:58.159  -->  00:03:01.737
pseudo elements should then inherit the box sizing
60

60

00:03:01.737  -->  00:03:04.475
properties attached to border box.
61

61

00:03:04.475  -->  00:03:06.308
So box sizing inherit.
62

62

00:03:09.297  -->  00:03:13.463
And with that we have our global like reset here set up.
63

63

00:03:13.463  -->  00:03:15.658
So the margin to zero, padding to zero
64

64

00:03:15.658  -->  00:03:18.971
and all the elements inheriting the border box
65

65

00:03:18.971  -->  00:03:20.868
for box sizing.
66

66

00:03:20.868  -->  00:03:23.014
Now the other thing that I need to do of course
67

67

00:03:23.014  -->  00:03:25.804
is to set the global font size.
68

68

00:03:25.804  -->  00:03:29.971
And once more, we're going to set it to 62.5%.
69

69

00:03:32.497  -->  00:03:34.376
And remember why that is,
70

70

00:03:34.376  -->  00:03:38.209
this is just so that one rem equals 10 pixels.
71

71

00:03:40.575  -->  00:03:43.479
So that makes it a lot easier for us to work with rems.
72

72

00:03:43.479  -->  00:03:46.073
And just as a reminder why it's 62.5%,
73

73

00:03:46.073  -->  00:03:49.511
that's just because 10 pixels which is our target
74

74

00:03:49.511  -->  00:03:52.905
so if we want divide it by 16 pixels
75

75

00:03:52.905  -->  00:03:55.637
which is the browser default,
76

76

00:03:55.637  -->  00:03:57.470
results in 62.5%.
77

77

00:03:59.505  -->  00:04:01.514
So this is just a reminder for you in case
78

78

00:04:01.514  -->  00:04:05.903
you have forgotten how we reach this 62.5%.
79

79

00:04:05.903  -->  00:04:08.194
So that is the HTML.
80

80

00:04:08.194  -->  00:04:10.878
Now we have the body here already but the spectrum color
81

81

00:04:10.878  -->  00:04:13.074
of course was just a test.
82

82

00:04:13.074  -->  00:04:18.050
So what I really want to set here is the font family.
83

83

00:04:18.050  -->  00:04:20.315
So font family, and as I mentioned, this time we're
84

84

00:04:20.315  -->  00:04:24.134
going to use Open Sans which once again is coming
85

85

00:04:24.134  -->  00:04:25.974
from Google Fonts.
86

86

00:04:25.974  -->  00:04:29.556
So you see that I already included this here.
87

87

00:04:29.556  -->  00:04:32.660
It's coming from Google Fonts.
88

88

00:04:32.660  -->  00:04:35.331
If that one fails, so if for some reason the browser
89

89

00:04:35.331  -->  00:04:38.006
cannot load Open Sans from Google Fonts
90

90

00:04:38.006  -->  00:04:39.724
then we simply tell the browser to use
91

91

00:04:39.724  -->  00:04:42.457
a Sans Serif font instead.
92

92

00:04:42.457  -->  00:04:44.483
So that's pretty standard.
93

93

00:04:44.483  -->  00:04:47.650
Now we also set the font weight to 400
94

94

00:04:49.482  -->  00:04:53.649
and then the line height of the overall document to 1.6.
95

95

00:04:54.853  -->  00:04:59.537
Now we also want that gradient that I showed you.
96

96

00:04:59.537  -->  00:05:01.907
So the color here is gone.
97

97

00:05:01.907  -->  00:05:03.565
And what we want for the background is basically
98

98

00:05:03.565  -->  00:05:06.648
this gradient going from this pink color here
99

99

00:05:06.648  -->  00:05:08.975
in the top left corner all the way to this
100

100

00:05:08.975  -->  00:05:12.433
darker pink here in the right bottom corner.
101

101

00:05:12.433  -->  00:05:14.577
So it's basically a gradient going from this side
102

102

00:05:14.577  -->  00:05:19.203
to this side, here to this corner with these two
103

103

00:05:19.203  -->  00:05:23.370
pink branding colors that we're using for this app.
104

104

00:05:24.425  -->  00:05:26.722
These are the colors that we're going to use,
105

105

00:05:26.722  -->  00:05:28.946
but of course we're not just going to add and copy
106

106

00:05:28.946  -->  00:05:31.346
these colors down here to the gradient,
107

107

00:05:31.346  -->  00:05:33.155
but instead we're going to use variables
108

108

00:05:33.155  -->  00:05:36.462
just like we did before with SASS variables.
109

109

00:05:36.462  -->  00:05:38.491
Now with this project we're not going to use
110

110

00:05:38.491  -->  00:05:40.950
SASS variables because I want to show you something else,
111

111

00:05:40.950  -->  00:05:42.906
something new in CSS.
112

112

00:05:42.906  -->  00:05:45.534
And that is CSS custom properties
113

113

00:05:45.534  -->  00:05:48.367
which are better as CSS variables.
114

114

00:05:49.534  -->  00:05:52.081
That means that we can actually right now use variables
115

115

00:05:52.081  -->  00:05:56.198
in CSS and don't have to rely on SASS variables.
116

116

00:05:56.198  -->  00:05:58.817
Now maybe you're wondering what's wrong with SASS variables?
117

117

00:05:58.817  -->  00:06:01.083
Why would we use CSS custom properties
118

118

00:06:01.083  -->  00:06:03.018
or CSS variables?
119

119

00:06:03.018  -->  00:06:05.993
Well the first thing is of course that with CSS variables
120

120

00:06:05.993  -->  00:06:07.992
you don't even need a pre-processor.
121

121

00:06:07.992  -->  00:06:10.702
So if you're just using SASS for the variables
122

122

00:06:10.702  -->  00:06:12.885
then you wouldn't need it anymore because CSS
123

123

00:06:12.885  -->  00:06:15.875
can now natively handle CSS variables.
124

124

00:06:15.875  -->  00:06:17.718
But that's of course not the only advantage
125

125

00:06:17.718  -->  00:06:18.972
of CSS variables.
126

126

00:06:18.972  -->  00:06:21.454
What's also very cool is that they can be manipulated
127

127

00:06:21.454  -->  00:06:25.459
in JavaScript and we can also edit them in our dev tools.
128

128

00:06:25.459  -->  00:06:29.142
Also it's easier to use CSS variables in the code function
129

129

00:06:29.142  -->  00:06:33.209
and also CSS variables cascade and they are inherited.
130

130

00:06:33.209  -->  00:06:35.496
So they are very different from SASS variables
131

131

00:06:35.496  -->  00:06:36.746
in that regard.
132

132

00:06:37.772  -->  00:06:40.755
Let's now actually use CSS variables
133

133

00:06:40.755  -->  00:06:42.443
for our custom properties.
134

134

00:06:42.443  -->  00:06:44.750
Now these custom properties, they have to be defined
135

135

00:06:44.750  -->  00:06:48.809
inside a scope and so within a declaration block.
136

136

00:06:48.809  -->  00:06:51.094
So just like something like this here.
137

137

00:06:51.094  -->  00:06:53.402
This is a declaration block, remember.
138

138

00:06:53.402  -->  00:06:56.024
Now we could put these variables just in any normal
139

139

00:06:56.024  -->  00:06:58.651
selector like any selector that we want
140

140

00:06:58.651  -->  00:07:02.065
but then these variables would only be available
141

141

00:07:02.065  -->  00:07:04.735
in that element and its children,
142

142

00:07:04.735  -->  00:07:07.806
and that's of course not what we want.
143

143

00:07:07.806  -->  00:07:10.703
Also, it's easier to just have one central place
144

144

00:07:10.703  -->  00:07:14.678
where we collect all the variables in one place.
145

145

00:07:14.678  -->  00:07:18.125
This one place is usually the root pseudo class.
146

146

00:07:18.125  -->  00:07:19.875
Let's write that out.
147

147

00:07:21.262  -->  00:07:22.523
So just like this.
148

148

00:07:22.523  -->  00:07:26.196
So this is the root pseudo class and this is essentially
149

149

00:07:26.196  -->  00:07:28.912
like the same thing as the HTML selector
150

150

00:07:28.912  -->  00:07:32.103
but with a higher specificity.
151

151

00:07:32.103  -->  00:07:34.461
By putting all of our variables in here,
152

152

00:07:34.461  -->  00:07:37.454
they will be accessible throughout the entire document,
153

153

00:07:37.454  -->  00:07:39.738
because that's what the root of the document is.
154

154

00:07:39.738  -->  00:07:41.632
It's like the global parent element.
155

155

00:07:41.632  -->  00:07:44.303
And therefore all the variables we're going to declare here
156

156

00:07:44.303  -->  00:07:47.064
will be available to all the child elements.
157

157

00:07:47.064  -->  00:07:49.598
And this is how we actually declare custom properties.
158

158

00:07:49.598  -->  00:07:54.552
We use double dash, so // and then the name of the property.
159

159

00:07:54.552  -->  00:07:58.719
So color primary and now we can copy this part here.
160

160

00:08:03.079  -->  00:08:04.053
And that's it.
161

161

00:08:04.053  -->  00:08:05.947
You see that it actually works very similar
162

162

00:08:05.947  -->  00:08:07.703
to a normal CSS property.
163

163

00:08:07.703  -->  00:08:11.295
So we have like margin, zero and up here we have
164

164

00:08:11.295  -->  00:08:13.789
our custom property which is color primary
165

165

00:08:13.789  -->  00:08:15.984
and then this part here.
166

166

00:08:15.984  -->  00:08:18.622
The only difference is that we use these dash, dash
167

167

00:08:18.622  -->  00:08:21.293
in order to distinguish between our custom properties
168

168

00:08:21.293  -->  00:08:25.276
and a normal like built-in CSS properties.
169

169

00:08:25.276  -->  00:08:29.178
Let's define the other two primary colors as well.
170

170

00:08:29.178  -->  00:08:30.011
So color,
171

171

00:08:32.147  -->  00:08:34.814
primary light which is this one.
172

172

00:08:40.230  -->  00:08:41.480
And then color,
173

173

00:08:44.834  -->  00:08:47.417
primary dark which is this one.
174

174

00:08:50.908  -->  00:08:53.939
And now we have our custom CSS variables
175

175

00:08:53.939  -->  00:08:55.689
or custom properties.
176

176

00:08:57.304  -->  00:09:01.649
And so now let's actually go use these properties.
177

177

00:09:01.649  -->  00:09:02.746
That's how it works.
178

178

00:09:02.746  -->  00:09:05.329
Remember we want that gradient.
179

179

00:09:06.803  -->  00:09:09.948
So background image, then your gradient,
180

180

00:09:09.948  -->  00:09:12.017
then the direction.
181

181

00:09:12.017  -->  00:09:15.600
Actually in here of course to right bottom,
182

182

00:09:18.297  -->  00:09:19.500
and then the colors.
183

183

00:09:19.500  -->  00:09:20.687
And this is how we use them.
184

184

00:09:20.687  -->  00:09:22.800
We use the var function and then in here
185

185

00:09:22.800  -->  00:09:25.553
we call our custom property.
186

186

00:09:25.553  -->  00:09:28.970
So color primary light is the first color
187

187

00:09:29.860  -->  00:09:30.693
and then,
188

188

00:09:33.035  -->  00:09:34.618
color primary dark.
189

189

00:09:37.236  -->  00:09:38.069
And that's it.
190

190

00:09:38.069  -->  00:09:40.819
And now just the background size.
191

191

00:09:43.238  -->  00:09:44.832
Let's add it to cover.
192

192

00:09:44.832  -->  00:09:48.015
Now let's take a look at this.
193

193

00:09:48.015  -->  00:09:50.220
And here we go, while it looks a little bit weird,
194

194

00:09:50.220  -->  00:09:52.475
but this is actually what we told it to do.
195

195

00:09:52.475  -->  00:09:55.367
We set this linear gradient on the body
196

196

00:09:55.367  -->  00:09:59.534
but right now the body's only really this element here.
197

197

00:10:00.957  -->  00:10:03.087
This small text that we have here.
198

198

00:10:03.087  -->  00:10:05.710
So the height of the body is just these 16 pixels,
199

199

00:10:05.710  -->  00:10:09.422
then from there the background simply repeats down here.
200

200

00:10:09.422  -->  00:10:11.413
This is simply the same background
201

201

00:10:11.413  -->  00:10:12.947
over and over again but repeated.
202

202

00:10:12.947  -->  00:10:17.182
That's actually the default in CSS but we can remove that
203

203

00:10:17.182  -->  00:10:21.349
by writing background repeat and set it to no repeat.
204

204

00:10:24.451  -->  00:10:27.157
And now it should be gone, and here we go.
205

205

00:10:27.157  -->  00:10:29.503
So now the background is only really on the body
206

206

00:10:29.503  -->  00:10:32.204
element itself just as we specified.
207

207

00:10:32.204  -->  00:10:35.287
Just for now let's increase this body
208

208

00:10:37.047  -->  00:10:39.524
to cover the entire view port height.
209

209

00:10:39.524  -->  00:10:43.353
So 100vh but later we're going to remove this one
210

210

00:10:43.353  -->  00:10:47.284
when our element becomes larger, then 100 view port height.
211

211

00:10:47.284  -->  00:10:48.920
Actually we can do it differently.
212

212

00:10:48.920  -->  00:10:52.055
We can just say min height and then it happens
213

213

00:10:52.055  -->  00:10:54.837
exactly the way we want.
214

214

00:10:54.837  -->  00:10:57.392
The minimum height will be 100vh but if the height
215

215

00:10:57.392  -->  00:10:58.832
can be bigger than that,
216

216

00:10:58.832  -->  00:11:00.706
well then it will simply be bigger.
217

217

00:11:00.706  -->  00:11:04.873
So this 100vh is not really like strictly enforced.
218

218

00:11:05.763  -->  00:11:08.433
Let's take a look at that now and here we go.
219

219

00:11:08.433  -->  00:11:10.648
So now it's covering the entire view port height
220

220

00:11:10.648  -->  00:11:13.578
because we said that the body should be all of this
221

221

00:11:13.578  -->  00:11:16.586
so 600 pixels in this case.
222

222

00:11:16.586  -->  00:11:19.069
And the last thing I want to define here
223

223

00:11:19.069  -->  00:11:21.718
is the overall text color.
224

224

00:11:21.718  -->  00:11:23.922
Let's actually go up here and create
225

225

00:11:23.922  -->  00:11:26.129
some more variables with these.
226

226

00:11:26.129  -->  00:11:30.296
I'm actually just going to go ahead and copy these here,
227

227

00:11:32.098  -->  00:11:33.877
and then just put the dashes here.
228

228

00:11:33.877  -->  00:11:37.377
So I'm going to use multiple cursors here.
229

229

00:11:38.441  -->  00:11:40.191
Dash, dash gray light
230

230

00:11:43.635  -->  00:11:47.353
and then the number here of course.
231

231

00:11:47.353  -->  00:11:49.186
Now adjust these ones.
232

232

00:11:52.889  -->  00:11:55.755
These are our primary colors.
233

233

00:11:55.755  -->  00:11:58.058
These are a couple of light gray colors
234

234

00:11:58.058  -->  00:12:00.600
and then the darker gray colors.
235

235

00:12:00.600  -->  00:12:05.116
This is here is the one we're going to use for text.
236

236

00:12:05.116  -->  00:12:06.438
Gray dark two.
237

237

00:12:06.438  -->  00:12:09.418
Let me add color here as well just as we had
238

238

00:12:09.418  -->  00:12:11.585
before the primary colors.
239

239

00:12:18.726  -->  00:12:19.559
Color,
240

240

00:12:21.570  -->  00:12:22.403
var color,
241

241

00:12:24.014  -->  00:12:26.437
well where are the other ones?
242

242

00:12:26.437  -->  00:12:27.770
I want gray dark
243

243

00:12:31.123  -->  00:12:32.786
two I think.
244

244

00:12:32.786  -->  00:12:35.022
Maybe something is wrong here.
245

245

00:12:35.022  -->  00:12:36.626
Yes actually it is.
246

246

00:12:36.626  -->  00:12:38.747
So we're missing the semi colons here
247

247

00:12:38.747  -->  00:12:40.664
at the end of the code.
248

248

00:12:43.631  -->  00:12:45.886
So that's better now.
249

249

00:12:45.886  -->  00:12:47.977
So hopefully it works now,
250

250

00:12:47.977  -->  00:12:49.266
and yes here we go.
251

251

00:12:49.266  -->  00:12:51.936
So it's now this gray color here.
252

252

00:12:51.936  -->  00:12:55.107
These are our basic settings for this project.
253

253

00:12:55.107  -->  00:12:58.732
We defined some custom CSS properties which behaved
254

254

00:12:58.732  -->  00:13:00.399
just like variables.
255

255

00:13:02.320  -->  00:13:06.371
Then we defined our global resets like with this
256

256

00:13:06.371  -->  00:13:09.062
global box sizing set to border box,
257

257

00:13:09.062  -->  00:13:11.585
and we did our margin and padding set to zero.
258

258

00:13:11.585  -->  00:13:13.893
We defined our global font size so that
259

259

00:13:13.893  -->  00:13:17.192
one rem equals 10 pixels to make our life easier.
260

260

00:13:17.192  -->  00:13:20.631
And then we just set these font definitions here,
261

261

00:13:20.631  -->  00:13:23.381
and then our background gradient.
262

262

00:13:25.430  -->  00:13:26.705
We're not going to need this file anymore.
263

263

00:13:26.705  -->  00:13:29.388
Let me just close it and then in the next lecture,
264

264

00:13:29.388  -->  00:13:31.527
it's time to actually start building
265

265

00:13:31.527  -->  00:13:34.102
the over layout of this project.
266

266

00:13:34.102  -->  00:13:35.602
Let's move on now.
