00:00:01.199  -->  00:00:02.558
<v Instructor>Let's now move on</v>
2

2

00:00:02.558  -->  00:00:05.885
with building our description section.
3

3

00:00:05.885  -->  00:00:07.280
This is where we left off.
4

4

00:00:07.280  -->  00:00:09.030
And the first thing that I wanna do
5

5

00:00:09.030  -->  00:00:11.438
is to simply format these paragraphs,
6

6

00:00:11.438  -->  00:00:13.810
but they actually don't need much formatting.
7

7

00:00:13.810  -->  00:00:15.949
All we want to do here is to give them
8

8

00:00:15.949  -->  00:00:18.862
a little margin to the bottom.
9

9

00:00:18.862  -->  00:00:20.279
So let's do that.
10

10

00:00:22.228  -->  00:00:25.145
And I would like to copy this here.
11

11

00:00:28.749  -->  00:00:32.822
So, PARAGRAPH, and since we're doing that,
12

12

00:00:32.822  -->  00:00:35.322
let me also put the LIST here.
13

13

00:00:39.478  -->  00:00:41.395
And also the RECOMMEND.
14

14

00:00:45.308  -->  00:00:47.709
All right, so paragraph...
15

15

00:00:47.709  -->  00:00:49.598
And actually all we want is to give them a margin
16

16

00:00:49.598  -->  00:00:52.408
at the bottom, because the last one shouldn't have any.
17

17

00:00:52.408  -->  00:00:54.349
And so we can do that, we did it
18

18

00:00:54.349  -->  00:00:58.099
a lot of times before, so not the last-child.
19

19

00:01:03.028  -->  00:01:04.197
And that's actually it.
20

20

00:01:04.197  -->  00:01:05.913
So when we have multiple paragraphs,
21

21

00:01:05.913  -->  00:01:08.206
we want them to have a margin at the bottom,
22

22

00:01:08.206  -->  00:01:10.352
but not the last one, okay?
23

23

00:01:10.352  -->  00:01:13.108
And so that's what we have here.
24

24

00:01:13.108  -->  00:01:14.135
And so here we go.
25

25

00:01:14.135  -->  00:01:16.838
Well, actually it has a margin here, this last one,
26

26

00:01:16.838  -->  00:01:18.829
and that's actually because it's not the last-child
27

27

00:01:18.829  -->  00:01:20.118
of this container,
28

28

00:01:20.118  -->  00:01:23.785
we should put here instead, is last-of-type.
29

29

00:01:25.645  -->  00:01:27.103
Now there are only two paragraphs,
30

30

00:01:27.103  -->  00:01:31.630
and the last one of them will not have the margin.
31

31

00:01:31.630  -->  00:01:33.747
Now the margin is gone here, all right.
32

32

00:01:33.747  -->  00:01:36.197
So last-child applies to all of the children
33

33

00:01:36.197  -->  00:01:39.150
of the current element, while last-of-type applies only
34

34

00:01:39.150  -->  00:01:41.837
to all of the same type of element.
35

35

00:01:41.837  -->  00:01:43.397
Okay, and now arrow list.
36

36

00:01:43.397  -->  00:01:46.168
So let's take a look at how it looks like.
37

37

00:01:46.168  -->  00:01:49.467
It has this margin here on top and at the bottom,
38

38

00:01:49.467  -->  00:01:52.652
and it also has this gray line again, okay.
39

39

00:01:52.652  -->  00:01:55.627
And then it has four of these items on each side,
40

40

00:01:55.627  -->  00:01:57.696
and also this small icon here,
41

41

00:01:57.696  -->  00:02:00.074
but that's the last thing that we're gonna take care of.
42

42

00:02:00.074  -->  00:02:02.056
So let's start with these lines
43

43

00:02:02.056  -->  00:02:05.223
and by putting them here side-by-side.
44

44

00:02:08.709  -->  00:02:09.542
So, list.
45

45

00:02:11.318  -->  00:02:12.666
We want it to have a margin
46

46

00:02:12.666  -->  00:02:16.367
at the top and the bottom of 3rem, and zero,
47

47

00:02:16.367  -->  00:02:17.776
of course, on the side.
48

48

00:02:17.776  -->  00:02:18.774
And the first thing actually
49

49

00:02:18.774  -->  00:02:21.815
is we don't want it to have any list-style,
50

50

00:02:21.815  -->  00:02:24.322
so these small bullets are gone.
51

51

00:02:24.322  -->  00:02:25.738
So that is the margin,
52

52

00:02:25.738  -->  00:02:28.426
and then we also want some inner whitespace,
53

53

00:02:28.426  -->  00:02:30.593
so padding, 3rem, as well.
54

54

00:02:32.467  -->  00:02:35.255
And now we want the border.
55

55

00:02:35.255  -->  00:02:38.384
And actually a border-top, and border-bottom.
56

56

00:02:38.384  -->  00:02:40.633
And now here we can use the variable
57

57

00:02:40.633  -->  00:02:42.473
that we defined before.
58

58

00:02:42.473  -->  00:02:46.588
Very simple, instead of having it to write out all again,
59

59

00:02:46.588  -->  00:02:48.838
it's now as simple as that.
60

60

00:02:52.142  -->  00:02:54.809
Okay, let's take a look at that.
61

61

00:02:57.323  -->  00:02:58.797
That's a lot better already.
62

62

00:02:58.797  -->  00:03:00.948
So we gave it some whitespace here inside,
63

63

00:03:00.948  -->  00:03:03.897
so padding, then the border, and then the margin
64

64

00:03:03.897  -->  00:03:07.837
to create the margin here, and down here as well.
65

65

00:03:07.837  -->  00:03:08.670
Now, next step, we want to put
66

66

00:03:08.670  -->  00:03:11.420
these elements here side-by-side.
67

67

00:03:13.009  -->  00:03:17.176
What we gonna do here is, once again, to use flex-box.
68

68

00:03:18.505  -->  00:03:20.525
So, display, flex.
69

69

00:03:20.525  -->  00:03:22.127
So how is that gonna look like?
70

70

00:03:22.127  -->  00:03:24.685
Well, it simply tries to cram all
71

71

00:03:24.685  -->  00:03:27.027
of these elements beside one another,
72

72

00:03:27.027  -->  00:03:29.915
but there's actually not really enough space here.
73

73

00:03:29.915  -->  00:03:31.840
So this really looks kind of terrible,
74

74

00:03:31.840  -->  00:03:34.126
but we have a solution for that, remember?
75

75

00:03:34.126  -->  00:03:36.434
So what we can say
76

76

00:03:36.434  -->  00:03:38.326
is flex-wrap,
77

77

00:03:38.326  -->  00:03:42.493
and then allow these elements to wrap to new lines.
78

78

00:03:43.389  -->  00:03:45.025
All we have to say is wrap,
79

79

00:03:45.025  -->  00:03:48.746
and then this is going to happen like this.
80

80

00:03:48.746  -->  00:03:50.406
It's still not perfect of course,
81

81

00:03:50.406  -->  00:03:53.492
but you see here that we have one element here,
82

82

00:03:53.492  -->  00:03:55.936
then it finishes, and then the next one starts,
83

83

00:03:55.936  -->  00:03:57.985
and the then it finishes, and the next one starts.
84

84

00:03:57.985  -->  00:04:01.357
We can actually take a look at that in the Inspector.
85

85

00:04:01.357  -->  00:04:04.777
Here you see how these elements are now side-by-side,
86

86

00:04:04.777  -->  00:04:08.237
but in different lines, in different rows.
87

87

00:04:08.237  -->  00:04:11.125
Now there's actually an easy fix for that
88

88

00:04:11.125  -->  00:04:13.626
Can you think of how we can fix this?
89

89

00:04:13.626  -->  00:04:14.967
Well, all we have to do really
90

90

00:04:14.967  -->  00:04:19.293
is to give each of these list items a fixed width, right?
91

91

00:04:19.293  -->  00:04:21.695
And then, like that, they will all look the same
92

92

00:04:21.695  -->  00:04:23.567
because they will all have the same width.
93

93

00:04:23.567  -->  00:04:25.817
So, let's actually do that.
94

94

00:04:28.676  -->  00:04:30.926
And so, it's our list item.
95

95

00:04:32.086  -->  00:04:34.455
And, again, we're not using the width property here,
96

96

00:04:34.455  -->  00:04:36.347
but instead the flex.
97

97

00:04:36.347  -->  00:04:38.063
So don't grow, don't shrink,
98

98

00:04:38.063  -->  00:04:40.756
and the width should be 50 percent.
99

99

00:04:40.756  -->  00:04:41.863
And why is that?
100

100

00:04:41.863  -->  00:04:43.121
Well, it's because we want to have
101

101

00:04:43.121  -->  00:04:45.255
two elements side-by-side.
102

102

00:04:45.255  -->  00:04:47.987
And so 100 percent of width divided by two
103

103

00:04:47.987  -->  00:04:51.237
gives us 50 percent, so let's check it.
104

104

00:04:52.900  -->  00:04:55.528
So this is what we want, right?
105

105

00:04:55.528  -->  00:04:56.886
We can actually inspect it,
106

106

00:04:56.886  -->  00:04:58.323
and now we see that each of these
107

107

00:04:58.323  -->  00:04:59.781
has the same width,
108

108

00:04:59.781  -->  00:05:02.209
which is exactly 50 percent of the containers,
109

109

00:05:02.209  -->  00:05:05.875
so of the flex container of all of these elements.
110

110

00:05:05.875  -->  00:05:08.742
This was the first time that we use flex-wrap here
111

111

00:05:08.742  -->  00:05:10.653
and I hope you see how useful it can be
112

112

00:05:10.653  -->  00:05:13.264
in a real-life situation here.
113

113

00:05:13.264  -->  00:05:17.431
Now let's just give these a small margin at the bottom.
114

114

00:05:19.425  -->  00:05:21.758
Like seven pixels, so .7rem.
115

115

00:05:22.903  -->  00:05:25.785
And then, after that, all that's really left to do
116

116

00:05:25.785  -->  00:05:28.624
is to add these icons here.
117

117

00:05:28.624  -->  00:05:30.441
So these ones here.
118

118

00:05:30.441  -->  00:05:34.346
This icon here is actually one of our SVG icons.
119

119

00:05:34.346  -->  00:05:37.542
Now this time I don't wanna use them in HTML,
120

120

00:05:37.542  -->  00:05:38.845
because I don't wanna have to use
121

121

00:05:38.845  -->  00:05:41.920
like eight SVG elements in the HTML,
122

122

00:05:41.920  -->  00:05:44.107
and then mess around with all that.
123

123

00:05:44.107  -->  00:05:45.626
So, instead, what I'm gonna do
124

124

00:05:45.626  -->  00:05:49.031
is to use this icon right in CSS.
125

125

00:05:49.031  -->  00:05:52.818
Now, in CSS it's really difficult to use a sprite image
126

126

00:05:52.818  -->  00:05:55.189
like we did in the HTML, remember?
127

127

00:05:55.189  -->  00:05:57.900
So this sprite file here, which has all of our icons,
128

128

00:05:57.900  -->  00:06:00.179
is what we used in HTML.
129

129

00:06:00.179  -->  00:06:02.318
But here in CSS, it's actually much easier
130

130

00:06:02.318  -->  00:06:04.895
to use this single icon itself.
131

131

00:06:04.895  -->  00:06:08.288
And since we're only using one icon here, so one SVG file,
132

132

00:06:08.288  -->  00:06:11.287
it's really no difference to include just the icon itself
133

133

00:06:11.287  -->  00:06:12.886
or just the sprite image,
134

134

00:06:12.886  -->  00:06:15.219
because we're only using one icon anyway.
135

135

00:06:15.219  -->  00:06:18.912
So the one that we want is called the chevron-right.
136

136

00:06:18.912  -->  00:06:21.128
And it comes here from this folder
137

137

00:06:21.128  -->  00:06:22.957
that we copied here.
138

138

00:06:22.957  -->  00:06:26.286
So it's this: "chevron-thin-right.SVG".
139

139

00:06:26.286  -->  00:06:28.866
I copied it in here so that we can use it directly
140

140

00:06:28.866  -->  00:06:31.017
from this folder, and then we can delete actually
141

141

00:06:31.017  -->  00:06:34.509
this SVG folder because we don't need this anymore.
142

142

00:06:34.509  -->  00:06:38.529
Actually let's look at the code here of our sprite file.
143

143

00:06:38.529  -->  00:06:40.497
Because remember that I said that SVG
144

144

00:06:40.497  -->  00:06:43.559
is basically just a way to write vector icons,
145

145

00:06:43.559  -->  00:06:46.534
or any vector image in code.
146

146

00:06:46.534  -->  00:06:50.201
So this is the code for all of our 10 icons.
147

147

00:06:51.685  -->  00:06:53.726
I don't wanna go deep into this.
148

148

00:06:53.726  -->  00:06:56.648
I just wanted to show you that it is indeed code,
149

149

00:06:56.648  -->  00:06:59.023
and a lot of numbers, as you can see.
150

150

00:06:59.023  -->  00:07:00.995
All right, so how do we actually include
151

151

00:07:00.995  -->  00:07:03.728
an SVG file in our CSS?
152

152

00:07:03.728  -->  00:07:07.310
Well, it's very similar to just any other regular image.
153

153

00:07:07.310  -->  00:07:10.270
So the easiest way is to use a background-image.
154

154

00:07:10.270  -->  00:07:11.678
So let's do that.
155

155

00:07:11.678  -->  00:07:16.420
And we're going to do that in a before pseudo-element.
156

156

00:07:16.420  -->  00:07:17.253
So,
157

157

00:07:18.403  -->  00:07:19.236
item.
158

158

00:07:21.112  -->  00:07:22.113
Before.
159

159

00:07:22.113  -->  00:07:24.949
Basically, before each of these item elements
160

160

00:07:24.949  -->  00:07:27.228
we create a small pseudo-element,
161

161

00:07:27.228  -->  00:07:29.561
which then will have this background image.
162

162

00:07:29.561  -->  00:07:31.318
And that's a better and cleaner practice
163

163

00:07:31.318  -->  00:07:34.886
than putting it directly on the item.
164

164

00:07:34.886  -->  00:07:36.803
We use background-image
165

165

00:07:38.429  -->  00:07:40.096
to include the icon.
166

166

00:07:41.708  -->  00:07:45.244
And now we actually have to go up one level,
167

167

00:07:45.244  -->  00:07:48.331
because we're in the sass file, or in the CSS file,
168

168

00:07:48.331  -->  00:07:51.043
so, technically, we're gonna be in the CSS file
169

169

00:07:51.043  -->  00:07:54.457
because that's where the compiled file lives.
170

170

00:07:54.457  -->  00:07:56.000
So we are in the CSS folder,
171

171

00:07:56.000  -->  00:07:57.695
then we have to move up one level
172

172

00:07:57.695  -->  00:07:58.944
to the main project folder,
173

173

00:07:58.944  -->  00:08:01.327
and then go into img,
174

174

00:08:01.327  -->  00:08:03.244
and chevron-thin-right.
175

175

00:08:05.065  -->  00:08:10.033
So, img, and for some reason it's not recognizing the path.
176

176

00:08:10.033  -->  00:08:12.808
So to write it out here,
177

177

00:08:12.808  -->  00:08:14.058
thin-right.SVG,
178

178

00:08:17.936  -->  00:08:18.967
I hope that's correct.
179

179

00:08:18.967  -->  00:08:20.158
Yeah, it looks so.
180

180

00:08:20.158  -->  00:08:22.991
Now this is the easiest way and...
181

181

00:08:25.499  -->  00:08:27.318
Well, it's not really working.
182

182

00:08:27.318  -->  00:08:29.349
And, yeah, of course it's not,
183

183

00:08:29.349  -->  00:08:31.635
because remember we always have to specify
184

184

00:08:31.635  -->  00:08:33.385
the content property.
185

185

00:08:34.437  -->  00:08:35.899
So setting it to empty.
186

186

00:08:35.899  -->  00:08:37.340
And also, since we're at it,
187

187

00:08:37.340  -->  00:08:40.007
let's put it as an inline-block,
188

188

00:08:42.307  -->  00:08:45.500
and give it a height and a width.
189

189

00:08:45.500  -->  00:08:47.187
So let's say one rem,
190

190

00:08:47.187  -->  00:08:51.448
or we can make it a bit bigger here actually for starters,
191

191

00:08:51.448  -->  00:08:53.635
just to see it better what's going on,
192

192

00:08:53.635  -->  00:08:55.623
and I'm gonna reduce it down later.
193

193

00:08:55.623  -->  00:08:59.790
So 2rem, and then just a small margin on the right.
194

194

00:09:01.384  -->  00:09:02.817
Like seven pixels,
195

195

00:09:02.817  -->  00:09:06.004
so to create a margin between the icon and the text.
196

196

00:09:06.004  -->  00:09:08.441
so let's check that out now.
197

197

00:09:08.441  -->  00:09:09.642
And yeah, here we go.
198

198

00:09:09.642  -->  00:09:11.993
So these arrow icons a little bit too big,
199

199

00:09:11.993  -->  00:09:13.403
but you see that it works.
200

200

00:09:13.403  -->  00:09:18.077
So this arrow before elements, so you see here it is.
201

201

00:09:18.077  -->  00:09:20.360
Now there is actually a problem with this approach,
202

202

00:09:20.360  -->  00:09:23.222
because if we include it as a background image,
203

203

00:09:23.222  -->  00:09:25.951
then we have no way of actually changing the color.
204

204

00:09:25.951  -->  00:09:28.162
Now if that's not a problem, then we can of course
205

205

00:09:28.162  -->  00:09:30.139
go ahead and make it like this.
206

206

00:09:30.139  -->  00:09:32.739
But in our case, we really want it to be
207

207

00:09:32.739  -->  00:09:34.989
this pink color, like this.
208

208

00:09:36.057  -->  00:09:39.338
And so what we have to do is to use a different approach,
209

209

00:09:39.338  -->  00:09:42.421
and that approach will include masks.
210

210

00:09:43.491  -->  00:09:47.408
So this here is the approach for older browsers
211

211

00:09:48.695  -->  00:09:52.000
because the masks do only work in really modern browsers,
212

212

00:09:52.000  -->  00:09:55.579
so for older browsers we can use the background-image.
213

213

00:09:55.579  -->  00:09:57.579
And since we're at it, we should also set
214

214

00:09:57.579  -->  00:10:00.412
the background-size then to cover.
215

215

00:10:02.499  -->  00:10:04.499
But, for newer browsers,
216

216

00:10:07.513  -->  00:10:08.596
we use masks.
217

217

00:10:10.398  -->  00:10:13.315
So I'm gonna remove this part here,
218

218

00:10:14.188  -->  00:10:16.879
and a little bit later in, another lecture,
219

219

00:10:16.879  -->  00:10:19.055
I'm gonna add a feature query saying that
220

220

00:10:19.055  -->  00:10:20.790
if the mask property is supported,
221

221

00:10:20.790  -->  00:10:22.617
then use the mask, and if not,
222

222

00:10:22.617  -->  00:10:24.578
then use the background-image.
223

223

00:10:24.578  -->  00:10:26.968
But for now, let's just comment it out
224

224

00:10:26.968  -->  00:10:28.147
and do it here with the masks
225

225

00:10:28.147  -->  00:10:29.876
because that's the best approach.
226

226

00:10:29.876  -->  00:10:32.305
Now, what is actually a mask?
227

227

00:10:32.305  -->  00:10:35.156
Well, basically a mask defines an area
228

228

00:10:35.156  -->  00:10:37.208
where we can look through the element
229

229

00:10:37.208  -->  00:10:40.070
and see what's behind that element.
230

230

00:10:40.070  -->  00:10:41.797
So, basically, what we're gonna do
231

231

00:10:41.797  -->  00:10:44.717
is to set the background-color of this element
232

232

00:10:44.717  -->  00:10:48.008
to a solid color, and then use the icon as the mask.
233

233

00:10:48.008  -->  00:10:50.536
And so we can then look through that mask, basically,
234

234

00:10:50.536  -->  00:10:53.947
and see the background color in the area where the icon is
235

235

00:10:53.947  -->  00:10:55.587
and everything else is covered,
236

236

00:10:55.587  -->  00:10:57.222
and so it's just gonna be white.
237

237

00:10:57.222  -->  00:10:58.055
Okay?
238

238

00:10:58.055  -->  00:10:59.427
Does it make sense?
239

239

00:10:59.427  -->  00:11:03.344
So let's start by adding that background-color.
240

240

00:11:08.198  -->  00:11:12.181
Actually it's missing the color part here.
241

241

00:11:12.181  -->  00:11:14.860
And so that's going to look like in that case.
242

242

00:11:14.860  -->  00:11:17.805
Now we're going to put our mask on top of this,
243

243

00:11:17.805  -->  00:11:20.064
and only in the positions where the icon is.
244

244

00:11:20.064  -->  00:11:22.712
We will then be able to look through that mask
245

245

00:11:22.712  -->  00:11:25.468
and see that pink background color,
246

246

00:11:25.468  -->  00:11:26.867
and the rest will be covered.
247

247

00:11:26.867  -->  00:11:29.057
So it's basically a bit like clipping
248

248

00:11:29.057  -->  00:11:32.231
that we did before in the other project.
249

249

00:11:32.231  -->  00:11:34.599
So, let's try that out.
250

250

00:11:34.599  -->  00:11:37.739
Right now it only works in WebKit browsers,
251

251

00:11:37.739  -->  00:11:41.692
so we have to use the "webKit" prefix.
252

252

00:11:41.692  -->  00:11:43.264
So, mask-image.
253

253

00:11:43.264  -->  00:11:45.151
And then it's just the exact same way as before.
254

254

00:11:45.151  -->  00:11:49.240
So all we have to do is to include this file.
255

255

00:11:49.240  -->  00:11:50.073
And that's it.
256

256

00:11:50.073  -->  00:11:52.208
And then another thing that we can do
257

257

00:11:52.208  -->  00:11:53.041
is to say
258

258

00:11:53.916  -->  00:11:54.749
webkit
259

259

00:11:55.668  -->  00:11:56.768
mask-size.
260

260

00:11:56.768  -->  00:11:59.945
And that's also very similar to background-size.
261

261

00:11:59.945  -->  00:12:01.143
So we can use cover here
262

262

00:12:01.143  -->  00:12:04.353
so that the icon covers the entire element.
263

263

00:12:04.353  -->  00:12:08.821
And as you'll see, this is already enough to make this work.
264

264

00:12:08.821  -->  00:12:10.351
All right, here we go.
265

265

00:12:10.351  -->  00:12:12.052
So, once again, this entire square
266

266

00:12:12.052  -->  00:12:14.722
that we had before is still here, this pink square,
267

267

00:12:14.722  -->  00:12:17.050
but we now can only see it in the places
268

268

00:12:17.050  -->  00:12:19.789
where the mask allows us to see through.
269

269

00:12:19.789  -->  00:12:23.539
And that's exactly where the icon is located.
270

270

00:12:24.453  -->  00:12:26.953
Let's now decrease the square,
271

271

00:12:27.858  -->  00:12:30.360
and then it all should decrease.
272

272

00:12:30.360  -->  00:12:34.110
And that's because of the mask size property.
273

273

00:12:35.632  -->  00:12:37.049
let's check that.
274

274

00:12:38.006  -->  00:12:41.155
Without the mask size it would look like this,
275

275

00:12:41.155  -->  00:12:45.956
because the icon is actually larger than the one rem here,
276

276

00:12:45.956  -->  00:12:49.343
but with mask-size, which behaves like background-size,
277

277

00:12:49.343  -->  00:12:52.426
we can unuse cover and that fixes it.
278

278

00:12:54.052  -->  00:12:56.410
And so that's a great solution to the problem
279

279

00:12:56.410  -->  00:12:59.034
that with background-image we cannot change
280

280

00:12:59.034  -->  00:13:00.651
the color in CSS.
281

281

00:13:00.651  -->  00:13:02.849
So masks can be a great tool to have
282

282

00:13:02.849  -->  00:13:04.400
in your in your toolset.
283

283

00:13:04.400  -->  00:13:07.480
And actually I'm gonna put it here also,
284

284

00:13:07.480  -->  00:13:09.863
without the prefix,
285

285

00:13:09.863  -->  00:13:11.702
so, basically for the future when all
286

286

00:13:11.702  -->  00:13:15.058
the other browsers start implementing this as well.
287

287

00:13:15.058  -->  00:13:18.745
And with that, we're actually done with the list.
288

288

00:13:18.745  -->  00:13:20.615
So that's our code for the list.
289

289

00:13:20.615  -->  00:13:23.153
Again we're gonna use a feature query here later
290

290

00:13:23.153  -->  00:13:25.963
to make this part here active for the older browsers
291

291

00:13:25.963  -->  00:13:28.002
who do not support the masks.
292

292

00:13:28.002  -->  00:13:29.401
But let's leave that for later
293

293

00:13:29.401  -->  00:13:32.984
and move on now to the RECOMMEND component.
294

294

00:13:35.234  -->  00:13:36.158
First of all, let's give it
295

295

00:13:36.158  -->  00:13:40.125
a slightly smaller font-size of 1.3rem,
296

296

00:13:40.125  -->  00:13:43.163
and also another text color,
297

297

00:13:43.163  -->  00:13:46.032
so to make it a little bit lighter.
298

298

00:13:46.032  -->  00:13:48.699
The one that I want is this one.
299

299

00:13:54.979  -->  00:13:58.714
Now, as for the photos, let's actually format them
300

300

00:13:58.714  -->  00:14:00.183
before we format anything else
301

301

00:14:00.183  -->  00:14:03.123
because they're these huge looking images,
302

302

00:14:03.123  -->  00:14:05.434
which are like way too big.
303

303

00:14:05.434  -->  00:14:09.903
So let's just give them a height of only 4rem,
304

304

00:14:09.903  -->  00:14:12.236
and a width of 4rem as well,
305

305

00:14:13.353  -->  00:14:16.297
and a border-radius of 50 percent
306

306

00:14:16.297  -->  00:14:19.052
in order to make them round.
307

307

00:14:19.052  -->  00:14:23.669
And then the other selectors that we have here are...
308

308

00:14:23.669  -->  00:14:24.944
Let's see.
309

309

00:14:24.944  -->  00:14:29.385
So we have recommend__count, friends, and photo.
310

310

00:14:29.385  -->  00:14:32.468
So we have count and friends missing.
311

311

00:14:41.462  -->  00:14:44.173
Okay, so let's check that out.
312

312

00:14:44.173  -->  00:14:45.922
And here we go, here we have the text
313

313

00:14:45.922  -->  00:14:49.423
and it's way too light, so I'm gonna change it in a second,
314

314

00:14:49.423  -->  00:14:51.055
And then you have these images.
315

315

00:14:51.055  -->  00:14:54.161
And they're of course on different lines
316

316

00:14:54.161  -->  00:14:55.652
because they're both block elements.
317

317

00:14:55.652  -->  00:14:58.023
So this one here, and then this box,
318

318

00:14:58.023  -->  00:14:59.891
so they should be side-by-side.
319

319

00:14:59.891  -->  00:15:04.058
Let's once again get help from our friend, flex-box.
320

320

00:15:06.224  -->  00:15:08.026
Display, flex.
321

321

00:15:08.026  -->  00:15:12.193
This one here should actually be dark and not light.
322

322

00:15:13.203  -->  00:15:15.620
So let's take a look at that.
323

323

00:15:17.445  -->  00:15:20.173
All right, they're side-by-side now already.
324

324

00:15:20.173  -->  00:15:21.853
Now these images they're also here
325

325

00:15:21.853  -->  00:15:24.439
like on top of each other, like this,
326

326

00:15:24.439  -->  00:15:26.483
so, slightly overlapping.
327

327

00:15:26.483  -->  00:15:28.622
And we can simply do that by giving them
328

328

00:15:28.622  -->  00:15:30.764
a negative right margin.
329

329

00:15:30.764  -->  00:15:32.777
So by giving, like this image here imagine
330

330

00:15:32.777  -->  00:15:35.631
a right margin it then moves to the right
331

331

00:15:35.631  -->  00:15:38.228
in this direction overlapping with this one.
332

332

00:15:38.228  -->  00:15:40.952
So all of them should have a negative right margin,
333

333

00:15:40.952  -->  00:15:42.089
except the last one here
334

334

00:15:42.089  -->  00:15:46.070
because we want this one right at this side.
335

335

00:15:46.070  -->  00:15:50.237
So, photo, I'd select all of them except the last one.
336

336

00:15:51.940  -->  00:15:53.773
So not the last-child.
337

337

00:16:01.219  -->  00:16:02.769
So margin-right,
338

338

00:16:02.769  -->  00:16:03.602
minus 1.5
339

339

00:16:05.202  -->  00:16:06.359
rem.
340

340

00:16:06.359  -->  00:16:07.526
And actually..
341

341

00:16:09.282  -->  00:16:11.532
Yeah, this is what we want.
342

342

00:16:13.008  -->  00:16:15.848
Okay, that looks good, but not perfect.
343

343

00:16:15.848  -->  00:16:18.997
Because here we also have this white border here,
344

344

00:16:18.997  -->  00:16:20.767
so that's just a white border
345

345

00:16:20.767  -->  00:16:23.409
that's going around of all of these images,
346

346

00:16:23.409  -->  00:16:24.848
and so that creates this effect
347

347

00:16:24.848  -->  00:16:28.896
looking like they are all on top of each other.
348

348

00:16:28.896  -->  00:16:31.063
So let's add that as well.
349

349

00:16:32.427  -->  00:16:36.818
So, border, three pixel solid, and just white,
350

350

00:16:36.818  -->  00:16:37.651
because that's the background color
351

351

00:16:37.651  -->  00:16:39.734
of the container as well.
352

352

00:16:42.206  -->  00:16:43.439
All right, so here we go.
353

353

00:16:43.439  -->  00:16:47.258
Now, actually we saw that now these images are,
354

354

00:16:47.258  -->  00:16:49.686
they look like they are smaller, right?
355

355

00:16:49.686  -->  00:16:51.436
Let's check that out.
356

356

00:16:52.526  -->  00:16:53.776
But this is the border,
357

357

00:16:53.776  -->  00:16:57.171
and the border actually goes into these images.
358

358

00:16:57.171  -->  00:16:58.979
So you see that when the border is active
359

359

00:16:58.979  -->  00:17:01.765
the image basically shrinks.
360

360

00:17:01.765  -->  00:17:04.479
And so we have now two options to fix that,
361

361

00:17:04.479  -->  00:17:06.463
we could either add these three pixels here
362

362

00:17:06.463  -->  00:17:11.297
on the height and width, or we can do it automatically.
363

363

00:17:11.297  -->  00:17:12.569
Let's do that automatically
364

364

00:17:12.569  -->  00:17:15.565
by using the box-sizing property.
365

365

00:17:15.565  -->  00:17:17.389
Remember, we set the box-sizing
366

366

00:17:17.389  -->  00:17:20.347
to all the elements to border-box,
367

367

00:17:20.347  -->  00:17:23.125
and what border-box does is that it includes the padding
368

368

00:17:23.125  -->  00:17:26.487
and the border into the width and height of the element.
369

369

00:17:26.487  -->  00:17:28.578
And that's usually exactly what we want.
370

370

00:17:28.578  -->  00:17:30.787
But in this situation, it's not what we want.
371

371

00:17:30.787  -->  00:17:32.267
In this situation we want the border
372

372

00:17:32.267  -->  00:17:35.431
to be added on top of our height and the width.
373

373

00:17:35.431  -->  00:17:37.831
And so we can set it back to the default, basically.
374

374

00:17:37.831  -->  00:17:42.798
So, box-sizing, content-box, which is the default.
375

375

00:17:42.798  -->  00:17:45.538
So if we check it out now,
376

376

00:17:45.538  -->  00:17:46.888
you see that it looks different.
377

377

00:17:46.888  -->  00:17:50.187
And so let me take out the border here,
378

378

00:17:50.187  -->  00:17:53.841
And so you see that the images stayed the exact same size.
379

379

00:17:53.841  -->  00:17:55.168
So, great.
380

380

00:17:55.168  -->  00:17:57.848
Now, next step we should probably vertically center
381

381

00:17:57.848  -->  00:18:01.126
these two elements here, and then push this box here
382

382

00:18:01.126  -->  00:18:03.851
all the way to the right side.
383

383

00:18:03.851  -->  00:18:05.775
So that's pretty easy right now,
384

384

00:18:05.775  -->  00:18:08.129
since we are already using flex-box here,
385

385

00:18:08.129  -->  00:18:11.462
and so all we have to do is align-items,
386

386

00:18:12.620  -->  00:18:13.729
set it to center,
387

387

00:18:13.729  -->  00:18:16.667
and then we want to create that space between them.
388

388

00:18:16.667  -->  00:18:17.926
Now, how do we do that?
389

389

00:18:17.926  -->  00:18:19.719
Well, we already did it before,
390

390

00:18:19.719  -->  00:18:22.309
and so I really hope you remember this amazing trick
391

391

00:18:22.309  -->  00:18:25.771
that I showed you, and what helps us doing exactly that.
392

392

00:18:25.771  -->  00:18:27.438
So, do you remember it?
393

393

00:18:27.438  -->  00:18:31.458
Well, we just have to say margin-right,
394

394

00:18:31.458  -->  00:18:33.680
on the count, because that's the element
395

395

00:18:33.680  -->  00:18:35.150
which holds the text.
396

396

00:18:35.150  -->  00:18:37.000
So, margin-right,
397

397

00:18:37.000  -->  00:18:38.383
auto.
398

398

00:18:38.383  -->  00:18:40.622
And that is actually it.
399

399

00:18:40.622  -->  00:18:43.185
So if you check it out now here on the count
400

400

00:18:43.185  -->  00:18:45.587
you see, with the orange color there,
401

401

00:18:45.587  -->  00:18:48.381
the margin which was automatically calculated
402

402

00:18:48.381  -->  00:18:50.709
to push the recommend__friends box
403

403

00:18:50.709  -->  00:18:52.720
all the way to the right side.
404

404

00:18:52.720  -->  00:18:54.061
So, great, right?
405

405

00:18:54.061  -->  00:18:56.430
So really a cool tool, once again.
406

406

00:18:56.430  -->  00:18:58.271
And with that, we actually finished
407

407

00:18:58.271  -->  00:19:02.672
this section of the website, so it's now ready.
408

408

00:19:02.672  -->  00:19:05.360
Let's take a look at the original,
409

409

00:19:05.360  -->  00:19:08.335
and you see that it's exactly the same.
410

410

00:19:08.335  -->  00:19:10.333
So, great job, once again,
411

411

00:19:10.333  -->  00:19:13.151
I hope you're getting better and better at flex-box,
412

412

00:19:13.151  -->  00:19:16.263
and see how all these flex-box properties come together
413

413

00:19:16.263  -->  00:19:19.148
in different situations in order to create the layouts
414

414

00:19:19.148  -->  00:19:21.043
and components that we want.
415

415

00:19:21.043  -->  00:19:22.789
Okay, so, that's it.
416

416

00:19:22.789  -->  00:19:26.752
If you wanna now remove this ugly green element here,
417

417

00:19:26.752  -->  00:19:29.562
then you can just come with me right to the next lecture
418

418

00:19:29.562  -->  00:19:31.733
and create the reviews here that we want
419

419

00:19:31.733  -->  00:19:33.733
to have in this section.
