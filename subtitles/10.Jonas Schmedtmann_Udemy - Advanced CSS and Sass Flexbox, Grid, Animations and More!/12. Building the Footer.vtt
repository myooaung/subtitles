00:00:01.699  -->  00:00:03.387
<v Instructor>Alright, let's now build</v>
2

2

00:00:03.387  -->  00:00:06.449
the very simple footer of our page.
3

3

00:00:06.449  -->  00:00:10.212
In this section you're not gonna learn any new stuff,
4

4

00:00:10.212  -->  00:00:12.406
but you will apply all the concepts,
5

5

00:00:12.406  -->  00:00:15.226
that we already learned to a new situation.
6

6

00:00:15.226  -->  00:00:18.685
That's also helpful to practice.
7

7

00:00:18.685  -->  00:00:22.205
What we will do is just this very simple footer
8

8

00:00:22.205  -->  00:00:25.558
navigation here and then this text down here.
9

9

00:00:25.558  -->  00:00:27.391
Something very simple.
10

10

00:00:29.460  -->  00:00:32.039
This is where our footer is
11

11

00:00:32.039  -->  00:00:34.626
and let's use a nav element
12

12

00:00:34.626  -->  00:00:36.811
and I'm also gonna call it nav.
13

13

00:00:36.811  -->  00:00:38.394
Nav for navigation.
14

14

00:00:39.235  -->  00:00:40.712
Then in there, as always,
15

15

00:00:40.712  -->  00:00:43.295
we have a bunch of LI elements,
16

16

00:00:45.658  -->  00:00:47.839
nav item, and then in there,
17

17

00:00:47.839  -->  00:00:49.931
we have a couple of links.
18

18

00:00:49.931  -->  00:00:52.764
A dot nav link pointing to nowhere
19

19

00:00:57.198  -->  00:00:58.777
and then the text in the first one
20

20

00:00:58.777  -->  00:01:00.777
is find your dream home.
21

21

00:01:07.137  -->  00:01:10.720
So let's copy that and create a bunch more.
22

22

00:01:13.487  -->  00:01:14.320
Request
23

23

00:01:16.123  -->  00:01:16.956
proposal,
24

24

00:01:24.458  -->  00:01:26.004
download the home planner,
25

25

00:01:26.004  -->  00:01:29.496
this is just a couple of link items,
26

26

00:01:29.496  -->  00:01:31.321
that don't really matter,
27

27

00:01:31.321  -->  00:01:34.404
it's just some placeholder text here.
28

28

00:01:35.359  -->  00:01:37.026
Submit your property
29

29

00:01:42.200  -->  00:01:44.700
and finally come work with us.
30

30

00:01:47.204  -->  00:01:49.537
Let's now style all of this.
31

31

00:01:50.754  -->  00:01:53.171
The first thing, that we want here in the footer
32

32

00:01:53.171  -->  00:01:54.504
is some padding.
33

33

00:01:57.030  -->  00:02:01.050
Okay, that we can see what's going on here
34

34

00:02:01.050  -->  00:02:03.050
and then our navigation.
35

35

00:02:04.723  -->  00:02:08.890
Actually this should be not a nav element, but an UL.
36

36

00:02:10.319  -->  00:02:12.154
If we have an LI element,
37

37

00:02:12.154  -->  00:02:15.987
that one should always be inside a UL element.
38

38

00:02:18.063  -->  00:02:20.056
Now that we have the UL, we can then say,
39

39

00:02:20.056  -->  00:02:22.389
that we want list style none
40

40

00:02:24.414  -->  00:02:27.664
and let's just take a look at that now.
41

41

00:02:30.068  -->  00:02:30.985
Here we go.
42

42

00:02:31.991  -->  00:02:35.234
How do we put these items here side by side?
43

43

00:02:35.234  -->  00:02:38.044
We can use flex box and we can use grid.
44

44

00:02:38.044  -->  00:02:40.772
In this case, we have a one dimensional layout
45

45

00:02:40.772  -->  00:02:43.837
and flex box would seem like the best choice,
46

46

00:02:43.837  -->  00:02:45.754
but we'll use CSS grid.
47

47

00:02:46.737  -->  00:02:49.294
That's because I find it easier to work with grids,
48

48

00:02:49.294  -->  00:02:53.076
when we want some space between the elements.
49

49

00:02:53.076  -->  00:02:56.318
With flex box we would have to use margin right
50

50

00:02:56.318  -->  00:02:57.562
and then on the last element,
51

51

00:02:57.562  -->  00:03:01.089
we would have to say, that we want no margin at all.
52

52

00:03:01.089  -->  00:03:03.074
With CSS grid, it's just more natural,
53

53

00:03:03.074  -->  00:03:05.265
we just have to define a grid gap
54

54

00:03:05.265  -->  00:03:08.191
and it just happens like between the elements.
55

55

00:03:08.191  -->  00:03:10.888
Until there is something like that in flex box,
56

56

00:03:10.888  -->  00:03:15.318
I find it easier to work in these situations with CSS grid.
57

57

00:03:15.318  -->  00:03:17.111
Let's define our simple grid
58

58

00:03:17.111  -->  00:03:20.194
and it's simply gonna be six columns.
59

59

00:03:23.824  -->  00:03:27.991
Not actually here, but here in the nav, of course.
60

60

00:03:29.074  -->  00:03:30.157
Display, grid
61

61

00:03:33.988  -->  00:03:36.905
and the template columns should be.
62

62

00:03:38.188  -->  00:03:40.438
Now let's think about this, once more,
63

63

00:03:40.438  -->  00:03:43.167
we want this to be automatically responsive
64

64

00:03:43.167  -->  00:03:45.479
without writing the media queries.
65

65

00:03:45.479  -->  00:03:48.562
Instead of just writing six, one F R,
66

66

00:03:49.554  -->  00:03:51.527
what would get the job done,
67

67

00:03:51.527  -->  00:03:53.837
we can make it better.
68

68

00:03:53.837  -->  00:03:58.004
Instead we use our old trick, where we use auto fit here
69

69

00:03:59.527  -->  00:04:01.419
as the number of columns and that one
70

70

00:04:01.419  -->  00:04:03.590
will automatically figure out how many tracks
71

71

00:04:03.590  -->  00:04:07.757
there should be and the size should always stay behind,
72

72

00:04:09.035  -->  00:04:12.202
let's say, for now 20 rem and one F R.
73

73

00:04:13.935  -->  00:04:16.747
As soon as one of these tracks gets narrower,
74

74

00:04:16.747  -->  00:04:20.594
than 20 rem, one of the column tracks will disappear.
75

75

00:04:20.594  -->  00:04:23.125
That's what we've always been doing.
76

76

00:04:23.125  -->  00:04:25.457
Let's now style these links,
77

77

00:04:25.457  -->  00:04:29.290
that we can then take a look at if that works.
78

78

00:04:31.751  -->  00:04:33.251
Let's style a link
79

79

00:04:34.561  -->  00:04:38.478
and aport the link state and the visited state,
80

80

00:04:40.674  -->  00:04:44.757
and that's not correct, of course, but that's it.
81

81

00:04:46.728  -->  00:04:48.470
That's the way we've been always doing it.
82

82

00:04:48.470  -->  00:04:52.858
Select the link and the visited state here at the same time.
83

83

00:04:52.858  -->  00:04:55.275
Font size one point four rem,
84

84

00:04:56.559  -->  00:04:58.726
the color should be white.
85

85

00:05:03.505  -->  00:05:08.283
No text decoration in order to get rid of the underlining,
86

86

00:05:08.283  -->  00:05:12.033
add a font family should be our display font.
87

87

00:05:18.830  -->  00:05:21.012
I also want to text an uppercase
88

88

00:05:21.012  -->  00:05:24.179
and the text we aligned at the center.
89

89

00:05:25.088  -->  00:05:29.174
Finally, just, that we can see these items,
90

90

00:05:29.174  -->  00:05:33.091
let's change the background color a little bit.
91

91

00:05:34.535  -->  00:05:38.695
What I'm gonna do here is to set it to a white color
92

92

00:05:38.695  -->  00:05:41.152
with only very very small alpha.
93

93

00:05:41.152  -->  00:05:44.402
It's basically going to be transparent,
94

94

00:05:46.520  -->  00:05:50.055
meaning that it will be a slightly lighter blue.
95

95

00:05:50.055  -->  00:05:52.661
Let's just take a look at that now.
96

96

00:05:52.661  -->  00:05:55.599
Okay, that doesn't look perfect yet,
97

97

00:05:55.599  -->  00:05:58.349
let's just add some padding here.
98

98

00:06:02.224  -->  00:06:05.997
Padding one point five rem and in order for this
99

99

00:06:05.997  -->  00:06:09.251
to be applied, let's set this to a block.
100

100

00:06:09.251  -->  00:06:11.251
Let's say display block.
101

101

00:06:13.629  -->  00:06:15.684
How's that going to look?
102

102

00:06:15.684  -->  00:06:19.851
Alright, now the thing, that I was telling in the beginning,
103

103

00:06:20.897  -->  00:06:24.368
that we need here, of course, just a gap.
104

104

00:06:24.368  -->  00:06:25.201
Grid gap
105

105

00:06:27.735  -->  00:06:28.734
two rem.
106

106

00:06:28.734  -->  00:06:32.344
It's really great with grid to add spacing.
107

107

00:06:32.344  -->  00:06:34.812
All we have to do is to use this gap property
108

108

00:06:34.812  -->  00:06:36.512
and it's really easy to work with this.
109

109

00:06:36.512  -->  00:06:38.405
Because again, this doesn't add any space
110

110

00:06:38.405  -->  00:06:40.479
at the end of the container,
111

111

00:06:40.479  -->  00:06:42.677
like margin right would do,
112

112

00:06:42.677  -->  00:06:44.779
if we used flex box here instead.
113

113

00:06:44.779  -->  00:06:48.709
Like this, it's going to be just perfect.
114

114

00:06:48.709  -->  00:06:51.126
We have this nice spacing here going on now
115

115

00:06:51.126  -->  00:06:53.834
on all of them, except in the last one.
116

116

00:06:53.834  -->  00:06:55.083
Let's now take a look what happens,
117

117

00:06:55.083  -->  00:06:58.117
when we decrease the view port
118

118

00:06:58.117  -->  00:07:02.284
and you already see, that it starts a new column here.
119

119

00:07:04.039  -->  00:07:08.206
That's very soon, let's change that minimum limit here
120

120

00:07:10.831  -->  00:07:12.863
to something a bit smaller.
121

121

00:07:12.863  -->  00:07:15.197
It hit these 20 rem pretty soon
122

122

00:07:15.197  -->  00:07:18.697
and went from six columns to five columns,
123

123

00:07:20.224  -->  00:07:22.348
but if we change that to something smaller, of course,
124

124

00:07:22.348  -->  00:07:25.348
then that limit happens a bit later.
125

125

00:07:26.699  -->  00:07:28.782
Let's take a look at that
126

126

00:07:32.280  -->  00:07:34.197
and it's happening now.
127

127

00:07:35.642  -->  00:07:38.309
That's perfectly fine like this.
128

128

00:07:40.720  -->  00:07:44.135
Three by two and now at some point it will become
129

129

00:07:44.135  -->  00:07:48.217
three by two and then just like this in the end.
130

130

00:07:48.217  -->  00:07:49.467
That's perfect.
131

131

00:07:51.070  -->  00:07:55.848
Now we want these to be aligned in the vertical direction
132

132

00:07:55.848  -->  00:07:57.626
and that's very easy to do.
133

133

00:07:57.626  -->  00:08:01.632
By now, you're already familiar with this.
134

134

00:08:01.632  -->  00:08:03.215
Align items center.
135

135

00:08:05.425  -->  00:08:07.216
Aligning all of the grid items
136

136

00:08:07.216  -->  00:08:10.325
inside their grid cells along the column axis,
137

137

00:08:10.325  -->  00:08:12.825
so vertically, and here we go.
138

138

00:08:14.704  -->  00:08:16.771
Of course, as we start decreasing,
139

139

00:08:16.771  -->  00:08:20.938
then these here change and automatically align as well.
140

140

00:08:22.477  -->  00:08:26.141
That part is done, let's just add some nice hover
141

141

00:08:26.141  -->  00:08:27.391
animation here.
142

142

00:08:29.864  -->  00:08:32.531
Transition all point two seconds
143

143

00:08:34.692  -->  00:08:36.519
and then let's add this, this part,
144

144

00:08:36.519  -->  00:08:40.352
this background color here only when we hover.
145

145

00:08:45.375  -->  00:08:46.208
On hover
146

146

00:08:48.106  -->  00:08:49.273
and on active.
147

147

00:08:59.653  -->  00:09:02.804
Alright, great, I think I also had this effect,
148

148

00:09:02.804  -->  00:09:06.156
where I moved it up a little bit,
149

149

00:09:06.156  -->  00:09:08.482
so just a small translate.
150

150

00:09:08.482  -->  00:09:11.149
Again, nothing new here for you,
151

151

00:09:12.019  -->  00:09:14.936
just to make it a little bit nicer.
152

152

00:09:16.868  -->  00:09:18.765
Now, all that's left to do
153

153

00:09:18.765  -->  00:09:21.515
is the small copyright text here.
154

154

00:09:23.902  -->  00:09:26.269
Let's put that there as well.
155

155

00:09:26.269  -->  00:09:30.436
After this UL element, a paragraph with copyright,
156

156

00:09:33.401  -->  00:09:36.651
just let me write some text here again.

158

00:09:45.731  -->  00:09:47.441
and that's me of course.
159

159

00:09:47.441  -->  00:09:49.358
Again, please feel free
160

160

00:09:51.158  -->  00:09:54.658
to use this project for your own purposes.
161

161

00:09:57.578  -->  00:09:59.161
This does not apply
162

162

00:10:02.153  -->  00:10:05.820
if you plan to produce your own video course
163

163

00:10:08.643  -->  00:10:11.560
or tutorials based on this project.
164

164

00:10:13.879  -->  00:10:15.655
I am saying that, because, unfortunately,
165

165

00:10:15.655  -->  00:10:17.810
I had people trying to do that.
166

166

00:10:17.810  -->  00:10:20.577
Some people, they take my project
167

167

00:10:20.577  -->  00:10:22.980
and then they do their own video courses with that.
168

168

00:10:22.980  -->  00:10:27.145
That's not allowed, okay, just adding that here
169

169

00:10:27.145  -->  00:10:29.935
to make it crystal clear.
170

170

00:10:29.935  -->  00:10:32.435
Let's get this copyright class
171

171

00:10:36.785  -->  00:10:38.368
and edit down here.
172

172

00:10:39.602  -->  00:10:41.935
Font size one point four rem
173

173

00:10:43.542  -->  00:10:47.125
and color, that we want here is, let's see,
174

174

00:10:48.592  -->  00:10:49.759
it's this one.
175

175

00:10:50.967  -->  00:10:52.634
The color light two.
176

176

00:10:56.569  -->  00:11:00.319
Let's add some margin from the top of six rem
177

177

00:11:01.875  -->  00:11:04.692
and text the line center.
178

178

00:11:04.692  -->  00:11:07.275
Let's just take a look at that.
179

179

00:11:09.585  -->  00:11:12.085
That looks quite good already.
180

180

00:11:14.160  -->  00:11:17.993
Now let's just make this a bit shorter, maybe,
181

181

00:11:20.070  -->  00:11:22.320
width, let's say, 70%.
182

182

00:11:25.973  -->  00:11:27.812
What's happening now?
183

183

00:11:27.812  -->  00:11:30.862
Okay, I see, that now, it's, of course, not centered here
184

184

00:11:30.862  -->  00:11:32.395
inside transparent element.
185

185

00:11:32.395  -->  00:11:36.641
We can use the trick, where we make the right margin
186

186

00:11:36.641  -->  00:11:37.641
set to auto.
187

187

00:11:39.013  -->  00:11:40.013
Margin right
188

188

00:11:41.288  -->  00:11:42.121
auto,
189

189

00:11:43.562  -->  00:11:47.729
add margin left, auto and that is going to fix that.
190

190

00:11:49.060  -->  00:11:52.364
That's it, that's the very small footer here
191

191

00:11:52.364  -->  00:11:55.801
and we practice some more with CSS grid
192

192

00:11:55.801  -->  00:11:58.552
with making this responsive here.
193

193

00:11:58.552  -->  00:12:00.688
Basically without writing the media query,
194

194

00:12:00.688  -->  00:12:03.605
having it adapt to the screen size.
195

195

00:12:05.198  -->  00:12:08.123
We're already getting close to the end here,
196

196

00:12:08.123  -->  00:12:10.619
in the next video we're just going to finish
197

197

00:12:10.619  -->  00:12:13.266
the sidebar and there's not a lot to do,
198

198

00:12:13.266  -->  00:12:15.528
it's just adding a small button here,
199

199

00:12:15.528  -->  00:12:17.907
which is not doing anything at all.
200

200

00:12:17.907  -->  00:12:21.819
Then after that, we have just this header
201

201

00:12:21.819  -->  00:12:24.410
and this realtors part here.
202

202

00:12:24.410  -->  00:12:26.095
We're getting close to the end
203

203

00:12:26.095  -->  00:12:29.262
and next up we have this sidebar here.
