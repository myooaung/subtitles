00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.115
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:06.405
If you can take just one thing from this entire course, then take this,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.420
build an audience no matter what kind of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.525
fan if you decide to release now and in the future,

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:16.620
it will be so much easier for you to make this NFT as success if you

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.015
release it to an existing audience who already likes what you do.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.640
So astonished suggests that while you create and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.790
publish NFT is following the steps in this course,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.460
you will also take some time and start creating a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.985
following on one or the social media platforms.

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:35.250
You can create a social media account on one of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.045
the social media platforms, like the most.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:40.940
And then each time that you list an NFT on any of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.945
the NFT marketplaces listed on the social media account,

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.040
along with a link to your NFT marketplace listing.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.480
So for example, let's say that you love to create soil and FTEs.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.330
If that's you, then you can create an Instagram account,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.660
will self people who like socialism out and including

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.780
a link in your Instagram bio that will direct people to your open sea account.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.935
For example, if you decide to list your soil and FTEs deal,

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.790
then you can list soil and FTEs can be videos, audios,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.115
photos, and illustrations on the open sea that i o marketplace.

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:23.570
And then once your NFT listing is life on the open sea mother place,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.060
publish a new post on your Instagram account that will show an image of your NFT.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.100
Some of the people who will see your post,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.780
we want to know more about you so that you will check out your Instagram bio,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.120
check the open ceiling inside it,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.360
and then there will be directed to your open sea

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.930
listing for where they can buy obeyed on your NFP.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.240
Once you start publishing Instagram posts that promote your NFA listings on open See

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.655
you will no longer need to rely on the general visitors or found you on open sea.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:59.915
But you might also get views from people will find you on Instagram.

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.180
The moment if tissue least on open sea.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.939
And the more images you post on Instagram,

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.580
the more views your NFT is we'll get.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.960
And as a result,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.410
the greater your chances of selling your NFT is.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.255
Not to mention that the more LFTs and Instagram posts you create,

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:19.190
the better you will become at it.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.820
And then you have a much better chance to sell your LFTs.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.890
By being persistent, you will have a great chance of building a loyal audience,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.100
will wait for your new NFT creations.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.880
Now, I mentioned Instagram in this specific example.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.125
But again, you can create a social media account on another social media platform.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.185
You might like to use YouTube, for example.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:44.135
You can create a YouTube channel,

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:47.435
upload videos can be as Crenshaw video for example,

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:50.870
with or without you speaking in the background that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.859
shows your NFT and in the YouTube video description,

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.410
put a link to your open sea account.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.585
You can also create a TikTok account,

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.200
put a link to your open sea account in your bio area

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.145
and then publish videos on TikTok that shows your LFTs.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:11.285
The amazing benefits of using Tiktok is TikToks amazing,

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:13.250
organic traffic rich 0.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.805
In other words, you can have no following at all on tiktok,

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:18.485
not pay for ads,

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:20.735
but still get a lot of traffic,

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:23.914
even if you just open your Tik Tok account yesterday.

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:27.290
Now saying this, it is extremely important that no matter which

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.770
social media platform you decide to use to grow your audience,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.645
that you will be persistent.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:37.340
Again, continue listing new nFET is on open sea and continue

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.190
posting new posts that will promote your LFTs on your social media account demo,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.500
you keep repeating those two steps.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.675
The greater your chances will be to sell you LFTs and to sell many of them.

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:52.370
So that's it for this lesson,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.950
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.700
Goodbye.
