00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.390
In this lesson I want
to show you how to

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.895
navigate inside the central end.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:07.500
Now before we continue,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.710
I just want to say that if
for some reason you feel that

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.010
TO experience inside
this mold is slow,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.705
meaning legging,
not smooth enough,

00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:18.560
then try to close any program on

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.050
your computer that you
don't currently need.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.520
The speed of the world will

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.620
depend on your
computer out will,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.510
you will graphic
art, for example,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.010
your Internet speed, the speed
of the central and silver,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.310
and also the activities that
you do inside this world.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.590
And the quickest way
that you can improve

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.020
the smoothness of
this world is again,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.190
by closing programs on

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.665
your computer that you
don't go on to use.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:44.870
For example, I am
currently using

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.850
the Camtasia screen recording

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.055
software to a
quote, this lesson.

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:52.595
And the software takes a lot
of my computer resources,

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:55.880
but I have to use the software
to encode this lesson.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.625
It, if I wasn't recording
this lesson and I felt

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.565
that the world was not
running smooth enough.

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:04.144
I would close the
container software

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:06.050
if it was open, of course.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.820
So let's continue.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.545
When you first enter the world,

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.030
you will see all out battle at

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.920
the upper right-hand
corner of the screen.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.190
Now the central and works very
much like a computer game,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.570
which means, for example,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.640
that the controls are similar.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.530
So let's press the C key on

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.990
our keyboard to see
the control panel.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.630
So the first keyboard key
that we place the sea.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.170
And as we can see by pressing
the key on our keyboard,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.850
we'll be able to see the rest of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.740
the mouse and key contours.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.115
Let's go over the rest of
the controls one by one.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:41.990
On the left side of the screen,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.765
we can see that we
can open and close

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:48.455
the world map by placing
the m or Tab key.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:51.245
Now, if you're familiar
with computer games,

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:55.070
you will recognize
the WASD buttons and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.810
those keyboard buttons control

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.195
your movement inside the world.

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:02.030
You will use the W
button to go forward,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.085
the a button to go to the left,

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:06.020
the D button to go to the right,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.795
and the S button
to go backwards.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.820
You use the space
button to jump.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.905
If you prefer to
switch this view,

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:20.010
you can by placing the V
button on your keyboard.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.875
If you want to add the UI,

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.470
meaning the interface
that is on the screen,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.930
just place the New
button on your keyboard.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.405
Next is the button
I on the right,

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:33.295
which stands for inventory.

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:35.020
By pressing the I button,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.915
you will be able to open
and close your backpack.

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:39.910
And if you decide
to open your big,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.055
big, you will access
your inventory.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:44.050
And if you want to
close your backpack,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.900
you would just want to
press the button again.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.255
Now as you can see at
the top of the screen,

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:52.525
we can always click day
the central world to

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:56.665
local mouse cursor and
control our avatars view.

00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:58.510
And we can press
the Escape button

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.550
on the keyboard to unlock it.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.940
Now at the bottom left
side of the screen,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.925
we can see that T
keyboard button,

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:07.490
and this button controls
the token function.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.295
So if you press this button
while you are in this world

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:13.610
and you have a microphone
plugged into your computer,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.445
you would be able to
talk inside this world.

00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:19.460
The Enter button is
for in-game chat.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.420
L is forcing your list of
bodies inside the world.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.715
The big keyboard
button is for opening

00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:28.505
and the closing, the emote menu.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:30.410
And you can click
at each ear mode by

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.495
pressing the noumenal keys.

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:35.300
Next we have the x
keyboard button,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.585
and we use this button to
move around the world.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.460
And lastly, we would want to use

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.080
the peak keyboard key to

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.945
open and close the
settings window.

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:47.330
Now, there is a keyboard
key which is not

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.880
mentioned in the Contoso window.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.910
And it is the alt button
on your keyboard.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.530
And if you press the alphabet

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.165
10 while spinning your mouse,

00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:59.540
you'll be able to rotate the
world around you o'clock

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.980
till let's click the X to
close the contours window.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.680
We also have the free
options inside the test

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.365
valid the bottom right side
of the screen to choose from.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.315
For example, we have an option

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:14.030
to tell now commode on and off.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.070
So if we prefer to experience

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.515
this fold in the dock, we can.

00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:20.030
And then option for example,

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.455
is the explorer icon.

00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:22.820
And if we click on it,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.330
we'll be able to jump in to
different areas of the world.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.890
We can also open this window by

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.215
pressing our keyboard X button.

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:32.390
Now you don't have to
explore the central and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.760
food explore and play window.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.060
You can also explore the
different areas in the world.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.355
For the decentralized world pub,

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:44.180
which we can open by pressing
the button on our keyboard.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.014
The small surface
around us represent

00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:50.735
other people will also
inside the Genesis Plaza.

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:53.420
Now in order to explore
different areas of the map,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.460
you just need to move
your mouse cursor

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.125
to the place you
want to explore.

00:04:57.125 --> 00:05:00.020
Then click the left mouse
button and then drag

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.185
your mouse while clicking
the left mouse button.

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:04.340
So in this case,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.725
I wanted to move up to
the top of the map.

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:08.375
So I was letting my mouse

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:11.255
up while clicking the
left mouse button.

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:12.800
Now, if you want to live

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.250
the Genesis plaza and expel
another area on the map,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.260
you will simply need
to click on the area

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.405
that you want to
explore and just

00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:22.610
click the jump in button inside

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.100
the window to jump
into that area.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.770
So you can explore any
area that you like.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.160
And in this lesson we
will explore an NFT out

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.840
getting me and I will write on

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.820
the screen the location
of the kidney.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.900
Once you've see the image of
the location, then again,

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.080
just press the jump in
button to jump to the Salia.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.110
It make take some time
for the area to load.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.834
But in a few seconds,

00:06:03.834 --> 00:06:05.740
we should be inside the area

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.080
where the gallery is located.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.820
Okay, So we've been developed
inside this new area.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.520
So I will now go inside
the art gallery.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.950
And last UL, inside the NFP.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.990
You can simply click on one of

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.000
the digital paintings in order

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.540
to see the marketplace website.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.345
Okay, so that's it
for this lesson,

00:07:56.345 --> 00:08:00.420
and I will see you in the
next lesson. Goodbye.
