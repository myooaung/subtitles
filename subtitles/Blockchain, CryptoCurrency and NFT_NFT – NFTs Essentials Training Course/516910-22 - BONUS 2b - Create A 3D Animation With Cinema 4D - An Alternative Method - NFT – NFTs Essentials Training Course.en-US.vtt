00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.530
Hi everyone. In this lesson
I want to show you how to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.295
create a board slicing
animation in Cinema 4D.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:15.869
Now, if you haven't seen

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.540
my first Cinema 4D lesson

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.525
about how to create an
image with cinema 4D.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:23.085
Then please watch it first.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:24.765
Because in that video,

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.604
I also explained how to download
the Cinema 4D software,

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:30.660
how to access for a cinema

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.234
4D tutorials and a very
brief explanation on

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:36.140
how to use some
of the cinema for

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.059
the features that I'm going to

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.534
use extensively in this lesson.

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:42.529
Okay, so let's start the lesson.

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:45.290
The first thing we would
want to do after we open

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.890
the Cinema 4D software is
to create a plane shape.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.360
To create a plane shape,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.445
just move your mouse over to

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.504
the blue cube icon at
the top of the software.

00:00:55.504 --> 00:00:57.260
Click it all.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.855
And then you will
see all the shapes,

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.400
which are also
called the primitive

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.659
objects that are available
for you to choose from.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.059
In this case, you
would want to avail

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:09.890
other the plane object
and the release your

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.194
mouse to add the plane to
your viewport, a small icon.

00:01:14.194 --> 00:01:15.890
It will also appear inside

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.764
the object manager at

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.089
the upper right side
of the software.

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:22.250
We can rename the new object

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.260
inside the object
manager by simply

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.150
averaging over it and then by

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.045
double-clicking the
text of the object,

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:32.254
this will bring up
the edit text field.

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.030
And then I will just
rename the default text,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.874
the ground, for example,

00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:40.669
and then press the Enter
button on my keyboard to click

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:43.040
outside the text field in order

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.294
to apply the change
that I have just made.

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:48.649
Now, we would want to change

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.470
the plane object
dimensions when want to

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.570
change its width to 6000
and it's ICT to 600.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.335
Do is damage change for
the attributes window,

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:04.529
which is located at the bottom
I upside of the software.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.680
I will now want to change

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.304
the color of our plane to white.

00:02:09.304 --> 00:02:10.669
And to do that,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.519
I will simply double-click
the material manager.

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.750
It is the box that is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.329
located at the bottom
left side of the sofa.

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.969
And this action will
create a new material.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.314
This new material is
currently named met,

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:26.944
as we can see inside the
text area below the circle.

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:28.880
But we can rename it as well.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.444
So let's double-click
the text area

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:34.174
and change the name
format to ground.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:37.909
For example, and press
Enter to apply the change.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.449
Then you'll want to
click the circle, old,

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.534
move it until you
reach the plane,

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:45.260
and then release the mouse to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.374
apply the color on the plane.

00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:48.334
Great.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.149
Next we will add a new object,

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.044
poem viewport,
this time as Phil.

00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:55.730
And again, we will
do that by moving

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.054
our mouse over the
blue cube icon

00:02:58.054 --> 00:02:59.839
at the top of the software.

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:03.709
We will then click the
cube on the mouse button,

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.850
either order this fill

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.324
object and then release
the mouse button.

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:10.340
Let's rename this field now
in the object manager from

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.654
sphere to bone and placental.

00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:15.469
Now let's create
the new material

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:16.684
in the material manager.

00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:19.259
I will name it bull.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.019
Okay, I don't want to keep

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.790
the white column
which is applied to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.389
every new material that is
added to Cinema 4D by default.

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.519
So I will change
its color inside

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.669
the material editor and the
right side of the software,

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.080
I will choose a yellow column.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.164
And then again move the
ball to the viewport.

00:03:41.164 --> 00:03:42.980
This time I will drop it on

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.439
the sphere and not on the plane.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.720
Okay? Now again, we will

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.479
want to change this
fill object attributes.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:55.679
But bought and then change
this fill segments to 100.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.060
And after I do that, I would
change the y position from

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.225
0 centimeters to
100 centimeters.

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:07.250
We have the y position filled at

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.275
the very bottom of the
software. To do so.

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.959
So are we move my mouse
to the Y position,

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.000
insert one under the wild thing,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.130
and then press the
Enter button on

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.305
my keyboard to apply the change.

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.149
Now we would want
to create a cube.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.660
And because the cube is the
Cinema 4D default shape,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.210
we can quickly
create one by simply

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.084
clicking on the blue cube icon

00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:29.615
at the top of the software.

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:31.024
You say quick and easy,

00:04:31.024 --> 00:04:33.019
we don't need to choose
the shape from within

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:35.149
the shapes menu as
we did previously.

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:38.150
Let's now change the
cube z position to

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.040
ten centimeters and then plus

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.565
our keyboards Enter button
to apply the change.

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:46.250
Next, we want to
create a cloner.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.684
And the purpose of the cloner
object is to clone objects.

00:04:49.684 --> 00:04:51.679
We will create a
cloner by clicking

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:54.334
the MoGraph menu at the
top of the salt fell,

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:56.869
othering our mouse over
the cloner object.

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:00.019
And then by clicking
the cloner object.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:04.115
Now let's make our cube
shape a child of the cloner.

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:06.320
Let's do it first and
then I will explain what

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.005
a child means in cinema 4D.

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:11.989
So we can create a
child-parent relationship in

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:15.185
Cinema 4D by simply
clicking on our cubed.

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:19.339
In this case, inside the
object manager or the other,

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.425
our mouse over the
cloner object.

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:24.410
And when you see a tiny
arrow next to your mouse,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.659
cursor points down
not to the left,

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.060
butt down, release the mouse.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.714
Now our cube is a
child of our cloner.

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:35.539
And now for the explanation
by making an object,

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.205
the child of another object,

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:41.465
move objects from now on
will act as a unified group.

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:43.384
Meaning that from now on,

00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:46.010
if we will move
the parent object,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.994
for example, the child
object will move as well.

00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:51.139
If we voted the parent object,

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.239
the child object
will rotate as well.

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:55.549
And also if we scale
the parent object,

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:57.890
the child would be
scaled as well.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.510
Let's now click the Clone of

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.369
object inside the
object manager.

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:03.650
And then once we click
it, we will again see

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.009
attributes inside the
attributes window.

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.919
Now under the cloner object tab,

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.010
we will want to click the
dropdown list next to

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.370
the mode caption and
select the lid of a.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.320
We will use the
grid array mode to

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.690
create clones in
three-dimensions.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.729
Next, under the mode field,

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.144
we have a few other
fields and then

00:06:25.144 --> 00:06:28.340
account kitchen with free
fields right next to it.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.590
Let's type the number
1 in the first field,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.885
type number 1 the
second field as well.

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:38.480
And lastly, next we want to

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.910
click on the mortgage
menu at the top of

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.675
the software and then select
the Varney flex your option.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:47.929
Yvonne fracture object
can shuttle are

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:51.290
the objects which is a feature
that we will use shortly.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.330
Then, as we did previously,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.039
we will combine two objects to

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.245
create a child-parent
relationship.

00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:58.489
So in this case,

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:00.110
we'll click on the
bull object in

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.825
the object manager
all the other,

00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:04.880
although the volume
flux your object.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.989
And then once you see an
arrow next to your mouse,

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:10.789
cursor points down again,

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.955
not to the left butt
down, release your mouse.

00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:16.609
Then let's click the
volume fracture object

00:07:16.609 --> 00:07:18.334
at the object manager.

00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:20.825
And this time let's
click the Sources tab.

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:22.579
Then below the Sources tab,

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:25.399
click the point
generator distribution

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:26.975
captured inside the box.

00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:30.439
So the caption would be
highlighted and then click

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:34.220
your keyboard del key to delete
the line inside the box.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.869
The Del button on your keyboard

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:37.130
can be found right next to

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.930
the Enter button on

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.035
your keyboard and above
your keyboards, ALL keys.

00:07:42.035 --> 00:07:43.745
Okay, now that the point

00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:46.069
generator distribution
caption is gone,

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:48.259
we will click the
colonial object inside

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.689
the object panel
all and then move

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:52.640
the cloner object to where

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.709
the point generator
distribution caption

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:56.839
was and the release the mouse.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.039
And we will now see

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.114
the colonial inside
the sources books.

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:04.069
Now when we want to add
one more clonal, again,

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:05.959
we will click the MoGraph menu

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.435
and then click the
cloner object.

00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:09.890
And now we want to make

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.129
the voting factual a child
of the new colonial,

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:16.654
which is called by
default cloner one.

00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:19.564
Now let's expand
what we have done.

00:08:19.564 --> 00:08:23.704
We made at the bony fracture
a child of the new cloner.

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:26.720
Because number one, we
want to create two skills,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.764
meaning tuples and as
I said previously,

00:08:29.764 --> 00:08:32.060
a colonial clones objects.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.240
So by making this feel
a child of the cloner,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.430
it will make for us to skills.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.309
And nonetheless, 80 by
adding the two spheres,

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:43.085
child's of the volume
fraction object,

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:47.239
both objects can now be shuttled
as explained previously,

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:50.675
Ivana Fletcher, object
shutters are the objects.

00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:53.690
Now let's add our mouse
over the attributes window.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.369
And as we did previously,

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:57.305
click the drop-down menu next to

00:08:57.305 --> 00:09:00.484
the mode caption and
choose grid array.

00:09:00.484 --> 00:09:02.420
Then again in the count field,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.590
I will add values.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.544
This time I will type the
number two in the first field,

00:09:06.544 --> 00:09:08.959
which will create the
sphere that I mentioned.

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:11.240
And let's type the
number one in both the

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.430
second and the third field.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.885
Now in the first size field
below the account fields,

00:09:23.885 --> 00:09:26.524
I will type 1500 centimeters

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.954
to create a space
between the balls.

00:09:28.954 --> 00:09:30.200
And then I will press

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.090
the Enter button to
apply the change.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.455
And then I will change

00:09:35.455 --> 00:09:37.405
its x position at

00:09:37.405 --> 00:09:40.910
the bottom of the
software to minus 500.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.819
I will now click on each of
the two tiny boxes next to

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:49.045
the cloner object inside
the object manager twice.

00:09:49.045 --> 00:09:52.734
And this section will either
cube in the Viewport.

00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:55.104
Next, I want to
create a null object.

00:09:55.104 --> 00:09:57.504
Again, I will create
one and then explain

00:09:57.504 --> 00:10:00.519
what a null object
means in cinema 4D.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:02.170
So to create a null object,

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.944
I will move my mouse to
the top of the salt well,

00:10:04.944 --> 00:10:07.029
click on the blue cube icon,

00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:08.859
hold and then other over

00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:10.150
the null object and

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.129
the release the mouse
to create the null.

00:10:12.129 --> 00:10:13.989
And now for explaining what

00:10:13.989 --> 00:10:16.839
a null object is in Cinema 4D.

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:18.759
And nano object
looks very much like

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.665
a folder in your computer,

00:10:20.665 --> 00:10:21.879
which means that in

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:23.860
the same way that you
will create a folder on

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.145
your computer together and
organize your files battle.

00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:30.489
You will create another object
in cinema 4D together and

00:10:30.489 --> 00:10:33.970
organize objects inside
the object manager better.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.470
Now let's click on one of

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.660
the colonials on the
right side of the salt.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.809
Well, then let's click at
the keyboard Control button,

00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:42.940
and then let's click
the cloner one object.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.990
While we keep pressing the
button on our keyboard,

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.004
in this way, we'd be able to
select the both colonials.

00:10:50.004 --> 00:10:53.470
And once we see that the
two colonials are selected,

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.664
we can remove the finger will
form the control button,

00:10:56.664 --> 00:10:59.324
click one of the
cloners and nag them.

00:10:59.324 --> 00:11:02.660
A child of the null that
we have just created.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.130
Then inside the viewport,

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.529
Let's click the sphere
icon that is closest to

00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:09.365
us and change its x position.

00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:10.550
Again, the exposition is

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.980
located at the bottom
of the software.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.894
Let's change it to minus 1500.

00:11:16.894 --> 00:11:19.549
Now when we want to create
the blades that will

00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:22.339
cut the two balls once the item.

00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:25.114
And to do that, we will
need to create a cube,

00:11:25.114 --> 00:11:27.020
increase the width of the cube,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.375
and it's ICT until the cube

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:32.910
will almost reach the
edges of the plane.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.390
Now we will want to make
the cube of phenol.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.460
And let's click the green arrow

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.440
to move the cube a little bit.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:56.469
I'll now click the cube if
it is not already selected,

00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:59.800
and then press the Control
button on your keyboard,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.540
then click the left mouse button

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.520
and move the mouse down very

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.260
slowly until you see

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.049
an arrow that points to
the left under the cube.

00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:09.415
When you see the cell,

00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:11.574
release your hold on
the left mouse button,

00:12:11.574 --> 00:12:14.770
and this section will
duplicate the cube.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.359
Now, we want to make sure that

00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:18.790
Q1 is highlighted
and then make it

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.939
smaller by clicking into
tiny box at the end of

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:25.440
the blue L and then move
the mouse to the left,

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.999
then click the event L and
push it towards you like this.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.069
Next, we want to
create a null object,

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:40.505
and we can do that by
clicking the instance icon at

00:12:40.505 --> 00:12:42.199
the top of the
software and then by

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:44.165
clicking the booth option.

00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:47.180
The purpose of a bull
object in cinema 4D is to

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.370
subtract the objects I

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.980
will show to use it and
you'll see what it does.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.860
Let's now press the Control
button and then click

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.285
the two cubes at the upper

00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:58.204
right window to highlight them,

00:12:58.204 --> 00:13:01.950
and then make them a child
of the Boole object.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.930
Now let's create a
new plane object.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.509
And then in the
properties window,

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:28.925
changing the width
of the plane to

00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:36.364
20 centimeters and its
orientation two minuses.

00:13:36.364 --> 00:13:39.604
Now let's create a new
cloner and the plane,

00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:42.270
a child of the cloner.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.089
Inside the cloner, Let's change
its smoke to grid array.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:07.500
And let's change the count
fields to 1, 1, and 10.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.645
Now let's click
the cloner object,

00:14:11.645 --> 00:14:14.569
then click it's cooling
L in the viewport and

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:18.004
then raise the plates up
with the green arrow.

00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:20.044
Let's now create a new pupil and

00:14:20.044 --> 00:14:22.009
move it to the edge
of the plan by the,

00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:24.420
again it's blue L.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.799
Then we will make the
cube phenyl by dragging

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:34.460
the tiny yellow dot inside
the blue L to the left.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.989
We also have a tiny yellow dot

00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:38.269
located inside the green arrow.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:40.115
Let's smooth the ClO tiny dots

00:14:40.115 --> 00:14:42.694
down to make the cube shelter.

00:14:42.694 --> 00:14:46.789
Let's now click the blue
arrow and use it to drag

00:14:46.789 --> 00:14:48.679
the cube to the left until it is

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.975
managed with the plane object.

00:14:50.975 --> 00:14:54.020
Now we will want to click
the tiny yellow dots inside

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.439
the red L and move the tiny
yellow dot to the left.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.289
This will extend the cube and

00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:07.820
we will want to
continue extending

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.809
it until it reaches the two
extreme ends of the plane.

00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:13.235
Now, let's, albeit

00:15:13.235 --> 00:15:15.409
our viewport camera by
pressing the number of

00:15:15.409 --> 00:15:17.420
free button on our
keyboard while

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.330
spinning our mouse. Like this.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.790
Great. Now let's
duplicate the cube that

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.414
we have placed at the
edge of the plane.

00:15:25.414 --> 00:15:27.109
We can do that by clicking

00:15:27.109 --> 00:15:29.120
the cube inside the
object manager,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.190
duplicated by placing
our keyboards

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.050
control button and then moving

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.850
our mouse down a bit until we

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.265
see a tiny URL
points to the left.

00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:40.040
Once you've see the tiny
arrow pointing to the left to

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.934
release the mouse button to
create the duplicate cube,

00:15:42.934 --> 00:15:45.200
which will be called coupon.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.680
Now let's click the new cube
inside the viewport and then

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.625
clicking L to move it to the
opposite side of the plane.

00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:54.980
Once Q1 reaches its new position

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.539
on the left edge of the plan,

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.609
we can release the mouse button.

00:15:58.609 --> 00:16:01.519
Now, let's create the animation.

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.930
First. We would want to increase

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.194
the number of flames
for this animation.

00:16:05.194 --> 00:16:07.279
And we can do that by
deleting the number

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.680
90 at the bottom
of the software,

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.440
and we will simply
type 220 instead.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.189
Then we want to double

00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:21.230
left-click the tiny
URL that points

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.850
right on the screen bell to

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.579
extend the scrolling
back up to the end.

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:27.950
Then let's select the
null object inside

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.919
the object manager and
the animation key.

00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:32.479
The key is right under

00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:34.655
the timeline at the
bottom of the software.

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:36.425
At the beginning
of the timeline,

00:16:36.425 --> 00:16:38.989
there is a tiny green box
and we would want to move

00:16:38.989 --> 00:16:40.729
this tiny green box to

00:16:40.729 --> 00:16:43.249
the right until we
reach flame to 100.

00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:46.744
Just click the tiny
green box, All the end.

00:16:46.744 --> 00:16:50.734
Move the mouse to frame 200
and then release the mouse.

00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:52.489
Then inside the viewport,

00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:55.445
click the two spheres
and then change

00:16:55.445 --> 00:17:00.409
the x position at the bottom
of the software to 3500.

00:17:00.409 --> 00:17:04.709
So one of the spheres will be
over the edge of the plane.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.645
And after you do that,

00:17:10.645 --> 00:17:13.159
then just click the animation I,

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.434
left tail, which is
under the timeline,

00:17:19.434 --> 00:17:23.185
you can find the lift, the
left to the green play button.

00:17:23.185 --> 00:17:25.870
This will move to the flame,

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.995
will have an animation.

00:17:26.995 --> 00:17:28.164
We shall stop.

00:17:28.164 --> 00:17:30.640
And after we click the
left and let's click

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.279
the Play button to
run the animation.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.424
Looks great. Now the Galeano
has become a pause button.

00:17:56.424 --> 00:17:59.890
Let's click the browse button
to pause the animation.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.409
And let's click the left
arrow again to move

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:05.184
the playhead to the
first frame again.

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:06.909
Now inside the object manager,

00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:08.439
let's click the plane object.

00:18:08.439 --> 00:18:11.799
Then we want to right-click
this plane object,

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.139
click on Simulation tags,

00:18:14.139 --> 00:18:17.209
and then click on collider body.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.380
Then inside the object manager,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.599
I'd click the voting
flip to Object,

00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:24.984
click the simulation
tags option,

00:18:24.984 --> 00:18:27.444
and then click the
rigid body option.

00:18:27.444 --> 00:18:29.379
Then at the bottom of
the software under

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:31.689
the dynamic Bobby, that caption,

00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:34.270
click the dynamics
tab and then click

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:39.790
the drop-down list and
click on all collision.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.769
Now like next to the dynamics

00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:43.614
tamper with the collision tab,

00:18:43.614 --> 00:18:45.099
click on it and change

00:18:45.099 --> 00:18:48.649
the bounds and
friction values to 0.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.739
Then inside the object manager
at the top of the soft,

00:18:53.739 --> 00:18:55.764
well, I'll right-click
the plane.

00:18:55.764 --> 00:18:58.540
Then again click the
simulation tags option,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.789
and then click the
collider body option.

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:03.265
And again at the bottom
of the software,

00:19:03.265 --> 00:19:07.614
change the bounds and the
friction values to 0.

00:19:07.614 --> 00:19:09.820
Let's now play the animation.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.589
We will click the left toe under

00:19:11.589 --> 00:19:13.734
the timeline at the
bottom of the software,

00:19:13.734 --> 00:19:16.120
and then we will click
the green play button

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.400
right next to it to
play the animation.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.600
Now let's right-click the
cube in our object manager,

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.325
then click Simulation tags,

00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:13.710
and then let's click
collider button.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.020
And I will repeat the
same actions for cube1.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.875
I will right-click on cube1
in the object manager,

00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:31.760
then click Simulation tags
and then click collider body.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.619
Let's click the
left arrow button

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:34.999
under the timeline to set

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:36.770
the animation and then click

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.839
the green play button
right next to the left,

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:41.520
it will button to plate.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.419
That's it.

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:22.610
Now that the animation
is on indefinitely,

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.800
you can just create
new materials and

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.665
change the other objects.

00:21:27.665 --> 00:21:30.900
As you wish. I will do it now.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:53.610
Lastly, we want to export it.

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:06.409
Let's close this window by
clicking over the window.

00:53:06.409 --> 00:53:10.159
Then we will end our project
by clicking the render to

00:53:10.159 --> 00:53:14.089
picture viewer button at
the top of the software.

00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:15.979
Now, the rendering process will

00:53:15.979 --> 00:53:18.589
start depending on
your computer out.

00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:21.170
Well, this can be a
very long process.

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:24.930
So I suggested you do something
else in the meantime.

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.585
Greg, you a new animation is
now saved on your computer.

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:43.055
So that's it for this lesson,

00:53:43.055 --> 00:53:45.529
and I will see you
in the next lesson.

00:53:45.529 --> 00:53:47.369
Goodbye.
