00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.295
Hi everyone. In this lesson I want to show you how to list an NFT on open sea.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:08.010
So let's first go to Open, see that i, o,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.310
and login to our open sea account by othering

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.705
our mouse over the profile icon at the upper right side of the screen.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.290
And then by clicking the profile option,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.080
then we will click the Sign in blue button.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.545
And if you are presented with a request to provide your password,

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:29.470
just insert it and you'd be able to login.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.060
Now we are on the profile page.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.505
And first let's change the banner image,

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:51.205
which is located at the top of this site.

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:57.835
The banner image dimensions should be around 1400 by 400 pixels and without text.

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:00.190
So the banner will display nicely whether your bios

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.240
will view your profile of who their desktop or mobile device.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.970
Now, if you already did the FA 4000 by 4000 pixels banner image

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.120
and the profile image on your computer that you want to

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.270
upload and you have rights to upload, then that's great.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.590
Yet if you don't have them,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.240
you can create them for free for a site like canva.com.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.850
We will have a separate lesson in this course,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.320
which I will show you how to use Canvas.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.285
So feel free to check this lesson if you're not sure how to create the images.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.610
So once you have the binary image,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.480
you can click the pencil icon to upload it from your computer.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.540
And once the benevolent displays,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.050
I will either my mouse over the profile image and click

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.980
the Edit option to upload my profile picture from my computer.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.840
So once the binary image and profile image are displayed on the profile page,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.000
I can change my profile page name,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.820
which currently shows the word unnamed.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.210
We can do that through the settings page and we can reach

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.525
the settings page by clicking the cogwheel icon,

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.945
which is located at the right side of the screen.

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:44.630
So once we are on the Settings page,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.989
and this is the page where we can change our username.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.540
But we'll pick a username like about myself in the blank box under the bio caption.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.940
Insert my email address and then click

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.980
the blue Save button under the email address line to save the changes.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.350
I will then get a confirmation email from

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.370
open sea in which opens C will ask me to verify my e-mail.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.410
I will open the email and click the Verify my e-mail blue button to verify my e-mail.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.925
That's it.

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:23.120
If you will now go to your profile page again,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.965
you will see that your username,

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:28.640
as it changed and he's no longer are named,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.180
but the new username that you picked on your profile.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.925
You can also see at the bottom of the page or the NFT is that you own.

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:42.575
I will now create a new collection of LFTs in the odd category.

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:48.410
Now is the NFT out that I've created and that I am now going to list on Open.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.120
See, I have created this out by downloading a free non copyrighted image

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.950
from pixabay.com and then by changing it With the side,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.990
go out to make it unique.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.020
If you don't want to use pixabay.com for images,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:10.490
then the other websites that offer free images such as Unsplash.com and Pexels.com.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.490
There are also alternatives for changing the image.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.610
You can modify your image by using the website canva.com or photo mania, that net.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.800
Now if you don't know how to use the sites that I have just mentioned, then, don't worry,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.125
we have a separate lesson in this course in which I will go through the entire process.

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:33.560
Okay, so let me show you now how you can list your NFT

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.055
on open sea after you have finished creating it.

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:40.490
The first thing you would want to do to other you now score.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.460
So although you open sea profile image and then click on the my collections option.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.385
Now if you've never created a collection before,

00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:54.080
then this page is going to be empty and you will only see the blue Create button.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.825
So let's click on the blue Create button

00:04:56.825 --> 00:05:02.450
now on the window that appeals so we can right away see that we need to add a logo.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.595
So let's click on the box under the logo caption to add the logo form our computer.

00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:08.960
And if you don't have a logo,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.480
then watch the lesson in this course in which I

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.300
show you how to create a logo with kind of

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.450
the recommended size for your logo should be 350 by 350 pixels.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.340
We should now give a name to our collection.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.270
And we can also write a description.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.000
So we just write down my full name and

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.120
write a little bit about myself and about my stole.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.225
The kind of NFT is that they plan to sell on open z.

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:51.330
And you can do the same or write something different.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.735
Once we're done, we can just click

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:13.445
the blue Create button at the bottom of the window to create the collection.

00:06:13.445 --> 00:06:20.610
And we get a new window that opens and confirms the creation of our collection.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.155
If we scroll down further,

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:26.420
we would be able to see the area.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.850
Will all our items will be displayed.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.930
The Alia, which currently says no items to display.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.920
And there is a search function above the area in which

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.820
we can search for specific items inside our collection.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.310
There is even a drop-down list right next to the search function,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.385
which we can use to sort the results we will get

00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:58.415
in different ways and we will now need to

00:06:58.415 --> 00:07:05.195
click the blue Add Item button to insert our first NFT into our new collection.

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:09.500
Once we do that, a MetaMask notification window will appeal,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.860
which will ask us to login into our MetaMask wallet.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.845
And let's do it now by clicking the login button

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:19.190
at the bottom of the MetaMask notification window.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.000
This is just a way for MetaMask to confirm that I'm in

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.635
fact the owner of the NFT that I'm about to upload.

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:34.670
Now, we have been directed to the page in which we are going to list our item, DFT.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:41.360
Okay, so what do we need to do now is to simply drag our NFT and drop it inside the box.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.850
Simply locate the image on your device and upload it as I'm doing now.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:56.660
And the image will be uploaded to open C. Now in this example,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.120
I'm showing you how to upload an NFT image.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.665
But as you can see above,

00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:04.325
you have many other files that you can upload to open sea.

00:08:04.325 --> 00:08:08.135
Open SEA accepts different forms of digital files,

00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:10.355
not just digital images.

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.935
You have JPEG, PNG,

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:16.415
GIF, SVG, which are digital image files.

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:19.219
But there are also MP4 WebAIM,

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:24.215
which are digital video files and MP3 or OGG,

00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:28.550
GLB, GTF, which are digital audio files.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.815
Regardless of the type of file will choose,

00:08:30.815 --> 00:08:33.305
it should not exceed 40 megabyte.

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:35.870
The max size is 40 megabyte.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.345
So you now want to give you an item and name,

00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:44.070
and you should type the name of your item inside the blank line under the name caption.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.845
Under the name line,

00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:55.970
I have the option to include an external link to a website on which I

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:01.440
can tell the open sea visitors more about the item of about me.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.320
And in the blank box under the description caption,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:12.150
I can add details about the image that I uploaded if I want.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.930
Now below the description box,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.580
you can add additional things,

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.000
properties, levels, and stats.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.250
You may consider adding those if you are creating different characters, for example,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.875
different monsters, each one of the monsters as different characteristics.

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:41.210
There is also a feature under the stats option to add on lockable content,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.395
which means that if you want to give additional content to your NFT buyer,

00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:46.760
then you can do that.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.410
The buyer will save access to

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.700
the lockable content after he or she will pay for your item.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.195
It is important to notice that just a biofuel NFT

00:09:56.195 --> 00:10:00.020
will receive access to this content and can unlock it.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.875
No one else will be able to do it, just the bio.

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:08.900
Now the applicable content can be really any content that you can think of.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.245
Maybe a special thank you message in text, audio,

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:17.825
video or anything that you fink can be nice to give to your bio.

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:20.810
You just need to click the toggle button right next to

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:27.300
the allocable content text to activate the allocable content option.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.900
I don't want to do this,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.680
so I will click the lockable content option to turn

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.105
this option of under the lockable content toggle button,

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:41.825
there is an additional toggle button right next to the text,

00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:44.705
explicit and sensitive content,

00:10:44.705 --> 00:10:49.805
which I will keep turned off because my NFT is not explicit or sensitive.

00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:56.419
And you should turn that toggle button on if you NFT is explicit and or sensitive.

00:10:56.419 --> 00:10:59.420
Now I will just try to sell one copy of my NFT.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.935
So I will leave the default number one under the supply caption.

00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:10.295
You can find the supply text under the explicit and sensitive content toggle button.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:13.325
But of course, if you want to sell to and FTEs, for example,

00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:16.595
then you need to replace the one with two.

00:11:16.595 --> 00:11:18.545
And if you want to sell F3 and FTEs,

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:21.710
then change it to three and so on.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.775
That's it.

00:11:22.775 --> 00:11:28.530
Let's now just click the blue Create button at the bottom of the page to create our NFT.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.480
We can now see a page where we can see our art piece ended notification from Open.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.990
See that our NFT has been created and we can

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.665
now either click the Edit button to edit our listing.

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:57.940
If we want to change something in our listing before we put it for sale,

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.415
it is currently in draft mode.

00:12:00.415 --> 00:12:04.960
So here is my listing and we can see all the details of my NFT.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.220
And if we scroll down,

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:13.120
you can see under the trading is to we caption the event that just a code on the left.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.375
This event is the creation of our listing.

00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:20.380
So for me I can again make changes to my listing by clicking

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.590
the white edit button at the upper right side of the page,

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:29.870
or click the blue cell button right next to it to make my listing live.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.510
So I will click the cell button. Now.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.570
Now there are different methods that you can sell your item.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.810
Now if you have a few items which you want to group with this item,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.540
you can choose to click on the bundle option.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.660
You may want to do that if you have items that you

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.930
want to sell and they are all related to each other.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.040
But for this example, I prefer to use the default set by sorption.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.255
I will now set the price in the blank line right next to the peice caption.

00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:05.750
The amount I will set in the blank line will be 0.009.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.290
So just click the blue button to post my listing.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.210
I will now need to pay a onetime guess fee.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.385
In order to list my item.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:27.740
It is important to know that you will not need to pay for every NFT that you list.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.950
You just need to pay this onetime fee and

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.460
you'll be able to list unlimited LFTs in your collection.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.770
Now we can see that the Confirm button is not

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.250
clickable and that there is a red alert message

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.310
above the Confirm button that says that we

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.910
have insufficient funds in our MetaMask wallet.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:53.315
This just means that we now need to fund our MetaMask account to pay for our listing.

00:13:53.315 --> 00:13:58.970
Now, we could deposit money in our MetaMask wallet after we've created it.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.560
But because the listing fee,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.735
which is also called a guess phi,

00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:08.375
constantly changes, then we couldn't have known how much we will be charged in advance.

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:10.760
So now that we know the listing fee,

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.620
let's deposit money to our MetaMask wallet so we can make the payment.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.305
We will do that in the next lesson.

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:20.285
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:22.685
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:14:22.685 --> 00:14:24.390
Goodbye.
