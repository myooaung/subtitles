00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
In this lesson, I want to explain what a blockchain is.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.574
I felt that the best way to explain what a blockchain is is by using an example.

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:14.685
Let's say that these Google Docs spreadsheet is my bank account,

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:17.325
a BankAccount, which I've just opened.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:21.060
Now let's assume that I started my first mouth or fork in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.870
a job that pays me $3 thousand every month.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.905
So when their boss pays me my first $3 thousand salary,

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:33.360
this money goes into my bank account inside the income column.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.960
I will add few thousand dollars now to the cell inside

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.410
the income colon end to the cell inside the balance column.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:50.120
So now both me and my bank can see that my Cohen bank balance is 3000 dollars.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.285
Okay, so let's say that I now want to buy one hundred,

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.790
ten hundred dollar laptop, for example.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.810
And I don't remember if I have enough money in my bank account.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.920
In this case, I can view my account balance for an ATM machine,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.955
for example, and see that they have enough money to purchase the lepto.

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:11.060
My bank also has access to my spreadsheet,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.785
aka my bank account,

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:17.795
and will also view my account balance when the stone will try to charge my debit card,

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:19.280
meaning my bank out.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.885
The bank will then see that my account balance covers the laptop costs.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:29.750
So it will approve the transaction and update the bank records accordingly.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.830
So like in a Google Docs online world post assault that gives multiple

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.975
users the ability to view the same data on a specific spreadsheet.

00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:45.200
Both me and my bank can view the same data in my bank account.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.020
Now, due to the great financial crisis,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.285
the Internet becoming popular,

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:56.945
and the fact that many people didn't want to rely on banks for financial transactions.

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:59.000
And new concept as emerged,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.740
which is called blockchain.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.540
The blockchain system works in a very similar way to how the banking system works.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.260
Yet with block chain,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.470
there is no bank involved and all the transactions are recorded publicly on the Internet.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.600
With blockchain. There isn't any bank computer that stands between two parties.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.155
In our example, me and the laptops shop,

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:26.530
and decides whether to approve or disapprove a transaction.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.850
What there is is a public record and the people from around the world,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.755
we use the blockchain system.

00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:35.545
Every blockchain use it as a digital wallet,

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.645
which is similar to a bank account.

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:40.795
When we use Bitcoin to pay for an item or a service,

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:43.915
computers on the blockchain system monitored

00:02:43.915 --> 00:02:48.795
transaction and decide whether the transaction should be approved or not.

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:53.150
The approval decision is based on the payload digital wallet balance,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.910
and the computers that approve and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.930
disapprove transactions belong to people while called miners,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.700
like people walk in a mine.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.670
Those miners are people like you and me get

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.090
paid for using the computer's processing power to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.030
solve computational problems like validating

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.185
transactions and documenting those transactions.

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:19.790
So the blockchain is similar to a database. It is legible.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.300
The difference is that the block chain ledger is

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.290
not controlled by a central authority like Google,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.095
Apple, Microsoft, or any other company.

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:34.445
It is a network of computers that belonged to minors who constantly

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:39.140
monitor each and every transaction that a course on the blockchain network,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.245
decide whether each transaction should be approved or not,

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:47.045
and instantly update the block chain ledger accordingly.

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:50.599
It is also important to note that unlike a regular database,

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.565
the data inside the blockchain database can be edited or removed.

00:03:55.565 --> 00:04:00.740
Now the Bitcoin blockchain is not the only system for digital currency exchange,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.225
and Bitcoin is not the only digital coin that people use.

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:07.385
There is also the filename block chain.

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:09.275
And on the filename block chain,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:15.410
people exchange a digital coin that is called a fill and a digital asset that is

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.890
called NFT at each token that represents ownership of unique digital item.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.405
Let's now change our previous example which was about the Bitcoin block chain.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:31.640
And using Bitcoin to buy a physical lepto form a shop own l in a physical shop to

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.070
an example about the affiliate blockchain and about using EFL to buy an NFT.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.920
In this example, a digital image form and online seller on an NFT website.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.805
If I decide that I want to pay one a fail for an NFT image,

00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:50.150
then all the miners computers that are connected to

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.120
the aphelion blockchain will access my account and the NFA seller account.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.640
And we'll try to validate two things.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.115
Number one, that they have enough infill in my digital wallet to pay for the NFT.

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:07.010
And number 2 that the seller really as

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.405
the NFT that I want to buy in is oil digital wallet.

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:12.845
If both a tool,

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.230
then the transaction will be approved.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.565
The seller will get the fill and I will get the n if T

00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:24.650
and a token that proves that I am the owner of that NFT.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.675
Now before we end this lesson,

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:28.745
I will just summarizing a few words.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.320
What is a blockchain?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.620
Uh, blockchain is a shared digital ledger,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.825
a system which documents

00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:41.615
digital transactions that take place between the blockchain uses.

00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:44.465
The transactions are validated by minus,

00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:49.250
minus of people from around the world who get compensated for using

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:56.180
the computer's processing power for validating and documenting blockchain transactions.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.860
So that's it for this lesson,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.215
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:01.860
Goodbye.
