00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:06.075
In this lesson we will go over the history of LFTs.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:07.890
They still real fan of t is,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.745
goes back to the year 2012 with digital assets called colored coins.

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:17.175
Cannot coins are not LFTs.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:22.770
They are digital tokens that represent physical assets such as a boat,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.450
cow, or else on top of the Bitcoin block chain.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.465
The purpose of those digital tokens was to prove ownership of a physical asset.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.530
A colored coin was basically a Bitcoin which was

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.350
colored with specific information about the physical asset.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.600
People quoted them, just use Bitcoin to transfer assets because

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.845
bitcoin was about transferring none unique items.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:54.490
And thus, there was a need for a technology

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.585
which would enable people to transfer unique items,

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:01.119
colored coins, Evan Pantone.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.975
And the reason for that was that they'll value was

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:09.550
determined by the participants who took part in the transaction.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.070
So if one participant as decided to change the value of a colored coin,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.440
the transaction was affected.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.315
Cannot coins didn't last.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:24.765
But the concept of colored coins is an important part in the story.

00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:29.300
Lfts, because it shows the capabilities of Bitcoin.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.030
Later on in the year 2014,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.290
that technology has improved with the launch of counterparty,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.645
a peer-to-peer financial platform,

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:42.800
which was built on the Bitcoin blockchain and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.675
gave people the ability to trade names and card games.

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:52.580
There that really put NFT on the map was 2017,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.835
a hill that gave us crypto punks,

00:01:55.835 --> 00:02:01.625
crypto Katie's, and the new concept of digital scarcity.

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:05.435
Crypto punks and crypto kitties are two groups of

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:10.594
cartoon characters that were developed on the filename blockchain.

00:02:10.594 --> 00:02:11.210
Crypto.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.185
Katie's gave people the option to buy braided and exchange digital kids.

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:21.905
Now, like physical baseball counts for example,

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:28.580
the value of a crypto Katie is determined by the rarity of its characteristics.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.085
So a crypto Katie that is most skills and thus is in higher demand,

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:40.280
will cost more than a crypto kitty that is not scarce and in low demand.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.785
Crypto punks characters also proved the concept of digital scarcity,

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:47.120
similar to crypto key,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.485
it is crypto punks our characters with different attributes

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:56.584
and they are valued based on scarcity and demand.

00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:59.600
And other significant occurrence that happened in

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.670
2017 was the virtual reality world, the central end.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.820
A virtual world which also adds on the field and blockchain descending land gave players

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.980
the ability to buy land with LFTs and on it inside a virtual world in 2021.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.710
And if tears need much less introduction,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.250
do too many success stories of people making huge amounts of money by selling LFTs.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.700
And the statistics that show that they are currently

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.975
twice as many NFT bias then NFT cells.

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:37.730
So that's it for this lesson,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.460
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.150
Goodbye.
