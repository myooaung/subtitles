00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
Hi there.

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.210
In this lesson I want to show you how to get images that you can use to create an NFT.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.015
Let me start by saying that the best images,

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:11.475
the images that you will shoot yourself,

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:14.640
because images that you've taken yourself belong to

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.525
you and thus you will not encounter copyright issues.

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:21.810
Saying this, I do understand that for different reasons.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.410
Many of us will not want to shoot the images ourselves.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.400
And another one to download images from the Internet that adults have shot.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.750
Now, before I continue,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.140
I just want to say in advance that I'm not a copyright experts.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.920
So everything I say in this lesson is just based on common sense.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.505
Okay, let's continue.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:44.285
There are many websites on the Internet that we can take images form.

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.525
But before we download an image to our computer,

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:51.065
we need to make sure that this image is not copyrighted.

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:52.505
What do I mean by that?

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:56.254
When we do a search on Google for a specific word or sentence,

00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:59.645
and then we click the Images tab on the top of the page,

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:05.090
we will see many images that we can technically download to our computer.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.460
But the problem with that is that many of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.700
the images that we will see will be copyrighted.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.915
And thus we will have to go to the websites on which the images are on,

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:21.140
contact the website owner and ask for his oil permission to use the image.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.990
This is a very time-consuming task and thus it is

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.110
better to simply use a website that offers

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.380
images that are not copyrighted and they

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.710
don't require attribution by don't requiring retribution.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.199
I mean, that we don't give credit to the creator of the image in our artwork.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.260
Now again, there are many websites on the Internet that offer an

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.470
uncorrelated with no need for attributions images.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.835
And in this lesson I will mention the popular ones that I have.

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:51.860
Personally use myself.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.240
The websites I would recommend use our pixabay.com, unsplash.com, and pixels.com.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.419
In this lesson, I will show you how to get an image from Pixabay.

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:05.330
Yet the steps that I will outline will be extremely

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.495
similar to the other two websites that I mentioned.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:11.225
So let's pin our bosses at this line,

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:15.860
type pixabay.com, and then press Enter to go to the website.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.625
Then all we need to do is to type the world that we want to

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.390
search for in the blank line in the middle of the screen,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.640
click the drop-down list next to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.810
the search line to choose if we want to search for images or videos.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.245
In our example, I will choose the default images option.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:38.195
We can of course go even more specific and pick one of the images, subcategories,

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:44.360
photos, vector graphics, or illustrations if we just want to get one of those results.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.920
But again, for this example,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.100
I will go with the general images option,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.555
click the search line and press Enter to start the search.

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:57.440
Okay, so now we see all the images that are relevant to my search.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.235
And one of the things that I like about the Pixabay website so much,

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:07.295
besides the fact that it is such a simple and beautiful intuitive interface,

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:10.775
is that we can actually offer our mouse over the images,

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:12.605
meaning without clicking them.

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:15.110
See how many people have like them,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.095
favorably them and commented on them.

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:22.505
Also the images of sorted on Pixabay according to their popularity.

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:26.150
So the first image that we see on the first page on the left side of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.130
the search results will be more popular than the second image right next to him.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.100
And the second image will be more popular than

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.640
the filtered image in the first line and so on.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.910
The reason that I like that the images are sorted according

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.985
to the popularity is that when I create an Outlook,

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:47.915
I prefer not to experiment with images that people might like.

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:53.330
And thus I would prefer to see first the images that people resonate with the most.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.935
And that's how we'll click now.

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:59.015
First image on the left in the first line of the search results.

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:02.270
And Pixabay will directly to the image page.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.330
Now if you change your mind and you want to see another picture,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.525
then you can either conduct a search again by using

00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:12.005
the search function at the top of the website as we did before.

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:17.180
Or simply other your mouse over the image and click the tags on the top of

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.715
it to search images in a specific topic that relates to the image you now see.

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:24.530
But if I would like to use this image,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.670
then the next thing I would do is to double-check that the image that they see

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.500
is free for commercial use and doesn't require attribution.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.460
We can quickly confirm that just looking at the right side of

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.575
the screen and viewing the text Pixabay license caption.

00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:44.225
And as we can see,

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:49.160
the text says free for commercial use, no attribution required.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.525
Now many images on Pixabay will have this same message,

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:54.770
but not all of them.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.180
So it is important that you confirm that you see this exact message.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.605
Now to download an image,

00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:05.285
simply click the green Free Download button at the right side of the page.

00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:09.095
Now Pixabay will ask you to pick the image dimension that you want.

00:05:09.095 --> 00:05:11.825
You can click on any of the available dimensions.

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:15.110
I will click the 640 by 400 option,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.365
but you can click on any other option you like.

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:22.700
Then I'll click the green Download button under the dimensions option,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.044
and the image will now be downloaded to my computer.

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:27.755
So that's it for this lesson,

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:32.070
and I will see you in the next lesson. Goodbye.
