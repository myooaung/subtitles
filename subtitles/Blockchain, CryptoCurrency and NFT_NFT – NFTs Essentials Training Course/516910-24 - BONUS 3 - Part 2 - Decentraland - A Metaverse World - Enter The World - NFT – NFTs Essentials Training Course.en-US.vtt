00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.925
Hi everyone. In this lesson I want to show you

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:06.045
how you can visit the decentralized world.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:08.010
So in order to visit this world,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.575
we will first need to go to its official website.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:12.615
But before we visit the website,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.640
we will first need to make sure that we have

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.165
the MetaMask wallet installed on a Google Chrome browser.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:19.680
And if you don't,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.060
then just watch the lesson in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.950
this course in which I show you how to

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.690
get this extension and

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.535
how to install it on your bow cell.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:28.020
So the first thing we would want to

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.075
do is to go to google.com,

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:32.160
type the central end and then

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.890
percentile. Then just click on there.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.350
Welcome to the central and search result.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.140
It is an important that you double-check that you

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.260
are in fact on the central end.org,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.660
which is the official, the central and website,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.610
and not on any other website,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.830
which might not be safe to use.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.330
So once you have made sure

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.935
that you are on the right website,

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.440
the next thing you would want to do is to either click

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.150
the Start Exploring button

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.355
in the upper right-hand corner of the website,

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.050
or click the Get Started

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.480
button at the left side of the website.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.000
Both buttons for lead you to the same page.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.555
Now, because you have momentum is

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.660
insoluble in your book and you will want

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.940
to enter the decentralized world by

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.910
clicking on the play using your wallet books.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.320
On this page, we need to select the image.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.265
So we would want to click

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:43.500
on the momentum is valid option.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.800
Now I want to define your style and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.405
we can customize the avatar

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:01.545
that we want to use inside the vCenter.

00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:04.470
And let's do it now.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.685
Once we're done, we would want to click the Done button

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:47.075
and the button by the side of the page. To continue.

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:48.620
In this window, we need to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.195
give it a name until the manual.

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:55.400
And then I'll take the next button

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.275
at the bottom of the window to continue.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:00.200
Now you'd want to win the central theorem.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.895
So conditions and privacy policy scroll down to do so.

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:06.590
And once you scroll down to

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.600
the very bottom of the textbooks,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.730
the I agree button will be

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.210
enabled and you'll be able to click it to continue.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.125
Great, so that the central and world has been loaded.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.150
And I know that because I've just been

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.415
dropped inside the world,

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:28.070
which is called Genesis plaza.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.775
These Genesis Plaza is the out of this world,

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:35.195
basically the main hub of this virtual world.

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:36.815
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:40.890
and I will see you in the next lesson. Goodbye.
