00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
Hi there. In this lesson I want to show you how to buy an NFT.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.930
So the first thing you'll want to do is to login to open,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.445
see that i o,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.190
then before I will start exploring the different.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.560
And if T is on the open sea marketplace,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.560
our first login to my MetaMask wallet by

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.590
clicking the profile icon at the top of the website.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.970
In many websites on the Internet,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.425
we use a username and a password to login or an email with the password.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.065
But with the open sea NFT marketplace,

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:34.500
you are logging in for a MetaMask wallet because this is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.524
the service which will let us make transactions on the marketplace.

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:42.280
You can use other digital wallets to signing.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.700
But in this training,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.755
we are using MetaMask.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.215
Then in the window that appears on the right,

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.065
I will just insert my password inside

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:54.605
the blank line under the puzzled caption in the middle of the window.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:58.340
And then I will continue by clicking the blue Unlock button.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.305
That's it. I have finished

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:04.625
the login process and I will now be directed to my profile page.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.460
On my open sea profile page will be able to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.640
scroll down and see all the NFT is that they own.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.235
I will then click the open sea logo to return to the open sea on page.

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.880
Then I can simply click the blue Explore button to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.305
discover the different LFTs on the open sea NFT marketplace.

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:26.930
I can also scroll down the page to view the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.310
exclusive open sea drops and the trending NFT is.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.575
And I also have a drop-down menu next to the trending in caption,

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:41.720
which will let me see that trending LFTs inside a specific category.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.070
But in this example,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.140
I was caught up and just click

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.195
the blue Explore button to view all the LFTs in the open sea marketplace.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:51.650
Now, if this NFT,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.810
for example, looks interesting to me,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.240
I can simply click on it and then click

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.790
the blue button in the middle of the screen to place my bead on this NFT.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.645
If you see a Buy Now button instead of a place bid button.

00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:10.895
And you can actually buy the NFT right away by clicking on the button.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:15.290
Now regardless if you see a Buy Now button or a place bids button,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.210
the payment of DFT will be taken form our digital MetaMask wallet.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.575
And if you don't have enough money in your MetaMask wallet to pay for the NFT,

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:27.410
then you will need to add funds to your MetaMask wallet.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.215
As I show you how to do in another lesson,

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:32.600
it is important to know that you can use

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.325
the same MetaMask wallet in different NFT marketplaces.

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:38.480
And you don't need to create

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.960
a different MetaMask wallet for each marketplace that you use.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.915
So if you want to buy an NFT on NFT marketplaces like vulnerable, for example,

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:49.460
then you can simply go to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:58.595
Google.com and

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.425
click the MetaMask wallet option

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:04.550
in the middle of the screen to login to your MetaMask wallet.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.485
If you prefer to buy LFTs on another NFT marketplace such as Min double.

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.615
Then again, you just go to the site,

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:14.850
in this case, mean double.com.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.965
Click the blue connect a wallet button at the top of the site,

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:27.920
and then click the blue connect to Wallet button under

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.370
the MetaMask or web free wallet caption.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.660
So to sum it all up,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.345
there are different NFT marketplaces around the internet which you can use to buy an NFT.

00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:42.710
But what remains the same is the one MetaMask wallet that in each of

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.125
the marketplaces you will login into in order to pay for the transaction fees.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:50.195
So it mean double, for example,

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:54.050
I can go inside and NFT listing and then as I doing open

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.330
see I can use a buy button on the right side of the screen to buy DFT.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.110
The payment will be deducted from my MetaMask account.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.095
And then if I go to read a ball open sea and buy or sell an item,

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:15.845
I will say that my MetaMask wallet as less infill due to my main table payment deduction.

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:17.750
Again, the marketplace can change,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.010
but you should use the same MetaMask wallet for all your transactions,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.795
whether you buy or sell.

00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:25.685
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:28.130
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.790
Goodbye.
