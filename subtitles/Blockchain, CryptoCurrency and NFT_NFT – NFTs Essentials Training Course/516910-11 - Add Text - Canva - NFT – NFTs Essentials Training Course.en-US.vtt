00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.375
In this lesson I want to talk about Canva.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:08.205
Canva use and extremely popular Gothic design website that I constantly use.

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:11.235
And in this lesson I will show you how you can use it to,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.485
to add text to your images.

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:18.480
Okay, so that can vein Google and then click on

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.920
the canvas search result under the www.canva.com web it does to go to the Canvas website.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.415
Now, let's open a free account with Canva by clicking

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:33.780
the Sign Up button at the upper right-hand corner of the website.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.440
We are now given the option to either sign up with gingival,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.270
with Google, with Facebook,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.215
or with our email address.

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.840
In this example, I will use my email to sign up to Canada.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.400
So I will click the purpose,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.020
sign up with email button,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.815
insert my full name until the full name caption,

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.245
my email address under the e-mail caption,

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.600
my password under the password caption.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.250
And once I'm done, I will click

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.925
the purple button at the bottom of the create your account window.

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:03.005
To continue.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.360
I will now receive a code to the email address that I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.090
gave Canada doing during installation process.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.295
And I will insert the code in the small window that opened under the okay,

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:15.870
we send you a code caption.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.480
I will just copy the entire code,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.570
paste it as is inside the tiny squares.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.430
And then once done,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.380
I will click the purple Done button,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.080
which is located under the tiny square.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.770
To continue, we now see a pop-up screen and inside it,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.005
canva asks us the following question,

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.480
but we will be using Canva full.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.830
They say that they do so,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.140
so that they would be able to recommend designs and templates, especially for us.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.985
You can choose any option that you want.

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:48.455
There is no longer cancel.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:51.350
I will choose the personal option, for example.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.530
Then a window opens and inside it,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.495
canva asks me if I want to try out the poor version for 30 days for free,

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:02.825
and I don't, so I will just click them maybe later gray button,

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:06.275
the upper-right corner of the window to continue.

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:07.685
Another window opens.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.640
This time, Canva will ask me if I want to obtain to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.850
get different updates from them and I don't want to.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.290
So again, I will click them maybe

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.860
later gray button at the upper right hand corner of the window.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.265
To continue, I will now click the Refresh icon

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:25.909
that is located at the top of my Internet Basel,

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.260
to close the start your first design box that appears in the middle of the screen.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.790
I will also click the X icon at the upper right corner of the box.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.320
Create presentations.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.140
You are allowed to shale to close it as well.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.215
That's it.

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:48.275
We have finished setting up our flake Canva account,

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:51.785
and now we can start walking on our image.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:57.990
Let's start by clicking the small Custom Size button at the right side of the screen.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.645
I will now locate my image on my computer and

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:06.275
hover my mouse over it so I can see its dimensions.

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:10.220
I see that my image is 800 by 1100,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.390
meaning its width is 800 pixels and its height is 1100 pixels.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.250
So inside the Canvas website,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.660
I will type 800.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.745
Inside the width box,

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:26.540
I will type 1100 inside Item books.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.490
And then I will click the purple button,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.390
create new design under those two tiny boxes to continue.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.615
Great. So we have created a page that suits the dimensions of our image.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:45.920
And the next thing we will want to do is to upload the image that we have on

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.810
our computer into our Canvas page so we can add text to it.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.490
We can do that in two ways.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.840
We can either click the Upload option at the left side of the website,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.535
then click the Upload Media blue button at the top of the site,

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:03.725
click the gray device option,

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:06.890
locate the image on our computer, click on it,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.800
and then click the Open button at the bottom of the open window to upload the image.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.500
All we can just find the image on our computer,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.460
click it and then drag it until we reach the Canvas website

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.960
and then simply release our old on the mouse button in order to drop the image.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.480
We can dope the image wherever we want on the website and it will still upload.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.915
So no matter which of the two options who choose to upload the image,

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:34.460
the result will be the same.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.469
Once your image will be uploaded,

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.545
it will be on the left side of the Canvas website.

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.830
And then when we want to drag it into our blank page,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.075
so I will click it.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:47.495
And then without releasing my old on the left mouse button,

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:52.835
drag it to the white page and then release my old on the left mouse button to develop it.

00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:57.095
Then click on one of the tiny circles or lines around the image,

00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:00.980
and then move our mouse in order to change the image dimensions

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.030
until the image will feel our blank page completely.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.210
We can also click on the image itself and move our mouse to

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.390
change the position of the image too well, we want it to be.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.500
Once we are happy with the result,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.080
we can start walking on our image.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.765
In this lesson, we want to add text to our image.

00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:32.970
And to do that we want to click on the Text option at the left side of the website.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.610
Caravan.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.070
Now Gibbs free options that come in

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.495
three different sizes to insert simple white text to our image.

00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:46.100
So I will click on one of them and it will be added to my outlook.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.190
And now that the text is all my artwork,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.665
I can simply click it and again,

00:05:51.665 --> 00:05:54.275
without releasing my old on the left mouse button,

00:05:54.275 --> 00:06:00.320
drag it to wherever I want it to be on my image and then release my old to drop it.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.860
Will I want it to be once the text is clicked,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.000
I can also use the tiny circle and tiny line around it.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.815
And again, the rank them in order to change the text size.

00:06:12.815 --> 00:06:14.255
Once I'm happy with the size,

00:06:14.255 --> 00:06:17.390
I can just click inside the text to edit it.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.430
So we'll just type my name inside at the bottom on the left corner of the image,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.700
like a signature on there are also other ways to change your text.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.620
You can simply click on it and use

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.510
the different design options at the top of the website to change the text appearance.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.560
So I mentioned the free plain text options at the left side of the website.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.360
And below those free options you have

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.550
additional pre-made text options that you can click on and edit as well.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.460
Just noticed that in the free version of Canva,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.250
which is the version that I'm using for this example,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.190
not all the design options will be available.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.965
So once we are happy with the result,

00:06:56.965 --> 00:06:59.930
we can serve the outlook on our computer by clicking

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.290
the Download button at the upper right-hand corner of the website,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.465
then choosing the format that we want.

00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:08.090
In this case, I will choose PNG image,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.240
and then by clicking the purple Download button

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.125
at the bottom of the window to download the image to my computer.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:16.610
So that's it for this lesson,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.820
and I will see you in the next lesson. Goodbye.
