00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.570
In this lesson, I want to explain how you can protect your LFTs.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.630
In a previous lesson, we talked about MetaMask.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.975
Metamask is a digital wallet or so-called OT storage that is connected to the Internet.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.590
And this wallet lets us store our crypto and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.310
see when we first opened our MetaMask account,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.075
we are giving a private key that we shouldn't share with anyone.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.590
The reason for that is that anyone who all the key as access to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.675
our account and thus can move the digital assets out of it too easy oil account.

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:43.340
Now, because the MetaMask wallet is an extension that sits on our Internet browsers.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.385
It means that it is software like any other software that we have on our computers.

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:53.480
Which means that in the same way that echoes fdl ways to

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.695
act different softwares on our computers from far away.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:00.320
They can also act our MetaMask wallet,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.150
gain access to our MetaMask account and still our private key,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.660
which again grants access to our digital assets

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.934
such as Ethereum and Bitcoin into our LFTs.

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:17.540
Saying this, it is very rare that something like that will ever happen to you.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.195
But it is important that, you know,

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:22.370
this is a possibility, again,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.875
an extremely avail possibility.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:29.570
So if you do reach a May be because you started making a lot of money with

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.370
LFTs that you want to add a layer of protection to your LFTs business,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.660
then I would recommend that you purchase a hardware wallet.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.530
As I said, a digital wallet is called odd storage,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.310
yet a hardware wallet is called cold storage.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.765
There are two popular hardware wallets that are sold on the market today.

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:54.784
One is called 300 and the other is called legible.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:59.105
I will provide links for both websites in the resources area.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:04.085
Both hardware wallets can connect to your digital MetaMask wallet.

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:07.880
And in that way, you can then sell your digital assets to them.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.285
Now, if you do decide to buy a hardware wallet,

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:14.180
then R2 points to keep in mind.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.695
Number one, make sure that you buy the alcohol wallet

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:24.110
directly from the official website of the hardware wallet company,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.465
just to be extra sure that you are not buying a hardware wallet that was

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:34.850
tempered with number to contact the company before you make the purchase,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.995
just to make sure that the hardware wallet supports and FTEs.

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:42.080
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.615
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:46.260
Goodbye.
