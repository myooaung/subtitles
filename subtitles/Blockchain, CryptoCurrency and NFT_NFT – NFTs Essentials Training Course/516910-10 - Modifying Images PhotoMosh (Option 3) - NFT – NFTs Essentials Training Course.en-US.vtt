00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Idle, one of the great for the services that they found

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.825
online to modify an image is called photomask.

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:09.750
And the reason that I like the service so much is that it

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.990
lets you export your walk in various formats.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.974
Meaning you can upload an image to photomask,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.355
make changes to it,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.385
and then you can export your artwork as an image,

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.020
a gift, or even a video.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.555
Let me show you the photon motion website.

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.580
So I am now at Google.com.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.970
I will type photomask and press Enter to continue.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.865
Then just click on the photo image search result

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.850
under the photomask that come with habitus.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.580
Photon motion. Now present you with two options.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.200
You can either load an image from your computer if you already have an image saved,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.275
or you can create your artwork right now by clicking the US webcam button.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:57.860
For this example, I want to load the image from the computer,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.165
so I will just click the Upload File button in the middle of the screen.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:07.669
Then I will click the Choose File button that is again located

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:12.949
in the middle of the screen to choose the image that I want to upload from my computer.

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:16.550
There is also a small area right next to the Choose File button,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.995
which is called DHAP file ill.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:22.760
You can simply drag a file from your computer and drop it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.245
inside this area in order to upload your file to photomask.

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.020
Let's tie this option to upload our file.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.545
I will simply click on the image that I have on my desktop.

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:37.115
And then without releasing my old on the left mouse button,

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:41.900
I will derive the file until it is inside the drop file IO area.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.380
Notice that the dope file email text is bigger now.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.920
So once the file is in the dope file ill area,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.525
simply release my old on the left mouse button to drop the file.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:57.785
And this action will let me upload my file to photomask.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:01.400
Okay, So we will now see the file presented on

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.465
the website and we will also see a few additional options.

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:06.830
Let's go over them.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.985
We have three tabs at the upper left-hand corner of the website.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:14.345
And those tabs are called JPEG,

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:16.475
GIF and web them,

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:20.780
the default tab which is already clicked is the JPEG tab.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.520
And while this tab is clicked,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.110
everything that we create will be exported as an image file.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.115
If we click on the tab right next to the JPEG tab,

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:35.615
we will be able to export our creation as a GIF file,

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:40.535
which means that we can export our walk as a static image like before,

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:44.120
but we can also save our walk as an animation.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.730
Now let's click the last step where BEM ill. We can also record our outlook,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.360
but this time the output will be a video file,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.785
not a GIF file.

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:59.360
So I have explained about the different exploitation formats and now I'll show

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.130
you how you can use this tool to implement different effects on your image.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.280
So you have a manual way and an automatic way.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.840
If you prefer to manually choose the effects that you want to apply on your image,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.385
then you would want to click on the different effect on the right side of the screen.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:19.070
Simply click one of the effects that you want to try.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.190
For example, I'll click on the rainbow effect,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.970
then activate it by clicking the tiny toggle option under

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.605
the rainbow caption and the right next to the own caption.

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:34.520
And now I can click the ballast right next to the amount and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.705
the offset captions to apply the effect to my image.

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:41.750
We can also add more effects to our image by turning

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.740
on additional effect at the right side of the website.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.475
Remember that you have to turn on each effect before it can walk.

00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:54.980
And again, you do that by clicking the effector organ button next to the own caption.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.725
Once you are happy with your modified image,

00:03:57.725 --> 00:03:59.135
looks on the screen,

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:04.385
you can just click the record button under the image to record a video of your walk.

00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:07.715
And after the red recording fills,

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:10.774
the video will be downloaded to your computer.

00:04:10.774 --> 00:04:14.735
So we talked about the manual way of applying effects to your image.

00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:18.245
But there is also an automatic way to apply effects.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:21.095
And this is done by clicking the ambush button,

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.840
which is located next to the record button.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.075
Every time we click on the merge button,

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:30.890
the website will randomize and effect and apply it to our image.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.220
Again, you can click the More button to randomize and effect.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.190
If you don't want to use the control panel at

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.520
the right side of the screen to modify the parameters.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.570
And as before, once you are happy with the result of the modified image,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.630
simply click the Record button to record your walk and downloaded to your computer.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.620
The saying goes, if you are walking inside the gift Deb,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.330
inside the JPEG tab,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.730
everything operates exactly the same.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.585
But because your output will be an image and not a video,

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:06.455
the Export button will be called save, not record.

00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:08.450
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.760
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.480
Goodbye.
