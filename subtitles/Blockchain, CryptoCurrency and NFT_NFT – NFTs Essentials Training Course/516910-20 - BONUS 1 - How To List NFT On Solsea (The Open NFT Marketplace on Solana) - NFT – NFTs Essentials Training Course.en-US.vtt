00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Hi there. In this course a focused mainly on how to

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.050
sell your NFT on the open sea that they all marketplace.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.960
Yet, as I've explained in a previous video,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.810
open seas not the only NFT marketplace

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.955
that you can list your NFP zone.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.250
And other NFT marketplace where you can list

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.275
your LFTs is called sulci,

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:25.084
uses the Serrano block chain and not the Fnet blockchain.

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:27.470
And the coin that is exchanged on

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.145
that marketplace is called Soul, not a fill.

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.230
I will now show you how you can list

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.525
your LFTs on this marketplace.

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:38.210
So the first thing we want to do is to go

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.820
to the sulci marketplace website,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.075
which is located at sulci that i o.

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:46.040
Then the next thing we will want to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.545
do is to connect a digital wallet.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:52.040
Now, not all digital wallets are better.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.410
End for the sulci marketplace,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.895
I recommend you use

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.594
a digital wallet that is called phantom.

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:00.320
Let me show you how to install

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.450
this plugin on your browser.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.400
So to install the plug-in,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
we will click the Connect wallet blue button

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.795
at the top of the page,

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:12.005
and then we will click on the phantom button.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.030
After we click the button,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.045
will be directed to the fund on plugin website,

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:20.360
which is located on phantom that IP.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.720
Then we will just need to click the Add To

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.095
combat and at the top or at the center of the page.

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:28.955
And after we will do that,

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:32.285
we will be directed to the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:35.510
Then once you reach the Chrome Web Store,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.670
we will want to click the blue Add to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.175
Chrome button to install the plug-in.

00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:42.200
Click the Add Extension button once you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.450
see the notification. To do so.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.230
Now, if you already have an existing wallet,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.060
then you can restore it by clicking

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.135
the US Secret recovery phrase button.

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:01.330
But I want to create a new one in this video.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.825
So I will click the blue Create New Orleans button.

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:06.340
Now, you would want to copy

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.620
the words that you've seen these books.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.515
Install this phrase in a safe place.

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:14.410
This phrase is a phrase that you want to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.880
use if you want to recover

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.130
your frontal wall it in the future.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.110
In a nutshell, the second phase is

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.000
very much like an account password.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.995
And without this account password,

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.680
you will not be able to recover and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.565
access your digital phantom wallet.

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:32.180
So I this face down and keep it in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.180
a safe place because if someone sees this phase,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.530
he or she will have access to

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.240
your digital account and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.760
potentially can steal money from it.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.425
After you wrote down

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:46.085
the secret phrase and save it in a safe place,

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:48.485
you'll want to click the blue,

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:51.575
okay, I save it somewhere button to continue.

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:54.140
So as I said, the secret phrase purpose

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.565
is to estoy account.

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:59.660
If for whatever reason you deleted your computer or if,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.225
for example, you bought a new computer.

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:05.105
Now the purpose of the password that we are now about

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:08.435
set is the same purpose that any password is.

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:11.795
And it is just to give you access to your wallet.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:15.035
So I will just type a password in the puzzled field.

00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:18.830
Just type a password that you are going to remember and

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.420
then retype the same password

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.775
inside the confirm password field.

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:25.160
Then tick the tiny box next

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.710
to the I agree to the terms of service.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.540
You can lead a terms of service by

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.610
clicking on the terms of service link.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.410
And then I will simply click

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.785
the blue Save button to save my new password.

00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:38.420
Now we have a notification that

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.670
basically informs us that we can

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.290
access our wallet at anytime by simply pressing the Alt,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.550
Shift and peak keyboard keys together on our keyboard.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.170
So let's type now,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.930
let's press the alt on our keyboard.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.510
Without releasing our old on the button,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.070
you would want to press on

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.470
the Shift key with another finger.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.795
And then again without addressing the two fingers,

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:06.695
we will use another finger to place the peaky.

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:10.880
And is our digital wallet pops up.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.715
Let's now click the blue Continue button

00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:16.760
and then the blue Finish button to finish the process.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.475
Now the next thing we want to do is to make

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:23.030
the fundamental that icon visible on our browser.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.010
And to do that, we will want to click

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.110
the puzzle piece icon extension

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.005
top right side of our Basel,

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.355
and then just click

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:34.639
the Pin icon next to the word phantom.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.785
And now we can see the phantom icon

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:38.495
next to the puzzle icon.

00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:40.640
And if we click on that icon,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.865
we will be able to see how a digital wallet.

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:46.220
The next thing we want to do is to deposit

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.905
some crypto coins into our wallet.

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:51.395
So we can pay this website fees.

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:53.075
We can get crypto coins,

00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:56.765
which are called Solana soul from different companies.

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.030
And in this video, I will show you how to get

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.705
some salt coins from a company called Moon pay.

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:04.730
So to purchase all coins,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.890
you first need to move your mouse until you

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.230
reach the top of the phantom wallet window.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.150
And then click where you see

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.430
the message, Copy to Clipboard.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.430
This will save our digital wallet address

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.620
so we can paste it later.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.270
Then you'll want to click on

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.030
the deposit button inside your font wallet,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.570
and then simply click the buy width moon Pay button.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.690
Then let's click the link next to the amount caption.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.390
Insert the minimum amount, which is 0.53.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.545
And then click the Continue button,

00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:53.495

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:55.700
Then insert the email address that

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.440

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.790

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.465
the blue Continue button at the bottom of the window.

00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:05.210
Then I will copy diversification call

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.490
that won't pay as just sent to

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.785
my e-mail and paste it inside

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:13.085
the blank line under the verification code caption.

00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:15.860
Then you just need to read the terms of agreement and

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.845
privacy policy by clicking onto two links.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:22.940
And if you do them just among the tiny box next to them.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.760
Now, let's move to the next step by clicking

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.220
the blue Continue button at the bottom.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.600
Once we see the SOC 1s inside our phantom account,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.165
we will want to move to the next step,

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:05.015
which is to register to the sulci website.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:07.895
So now we will want to click on the Connect wall

00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:10.970
at the top of the website and then click on the phantom.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.980
But so we have created

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.935
excess details to access our phantom wallet,

00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:17.360
and we will now need to create

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.610
excess details to access the source.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.080
See that i o website.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.605
And we can do that by registering to the website.

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:27.485
Let's click on this still not registered link

00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:28.895
at the bottom of the page.

00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:31.820
Now you will want to insert your email address and

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.650
password and then repeat the Passover

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.035
under the retype password caption,

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:38.150
and then click the register button

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.460
at the bottom of the page. Once you are done.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.420
Now we will be directed to

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.050
our new profile page and we will now want to edit it.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.095
So I will first click the toggle button under the,

00:08:59.095 --> 00:09:01.495
do you want your profile to be public?

00:09:01.495 --> 00:09:03.340
Corruption? Because it tells me what

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.305
my profile details to be public.

00:09:05.305 --> 00:09:07.150
So marketplace visitors will be able

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.865
to know more about me.

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:11.560
I will then insert

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.230
my profile image and the air they'll image.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.745
And if you don't have those,

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:17.200
then check out the lesson in

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.420
this course in which I show you how to get

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:25.039
images from sites such as Pixabay and splash or pixels.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.240
Then I will write my full name under the name caption.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.950
And I will write a few words

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.560
about me inside the bio section.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.615
And just click the blue Submit button

00:09:49.615 --> 00:09:51.175
at the bottom of the website.

00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:52.840
Once you do that, you will see

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.215
the green Success notification at the top of the website.

00:09:56.215 --> 00:09:59.424
The next thing we want to do is to create a collection.

00:09:59.424 --> 00:10:03.145
Basically a page will all out pieces will be saved.

00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:05.275
And we will do that by othering our mouse

00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:07.980
over the Create menu at the top of the page.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.475
And then by clicking the collection option.

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:11.810
And all we need to do on

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.580
this Create Collection page is to

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.800
entail the details of our collection.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.464
So just as an example,

00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:21.230
if my plan is to create 20 images,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.239
then I can name my collection.

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:24.620
And inside this collection,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.710
I will upload 20 images of kids.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.740
Before I continue, I just want to mention that if you are

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.115
not sure what to type inside a specific field,

00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:38.075
then know that you have great text inside the lines

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:40.160
that gives you an example

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.560
of the kind of text you can insert.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.680
And you also have the blue question marks that when

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.100
other all will tell you exactly what you need to insult.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.795
Now if we scroll down,

00:10:56.795 --> 00:10:58.100
we will see that we need to

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.350
insert images to our collection page.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.360
And if you are not shoe out to a size,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.220
you'll images so they will suit

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.250
the specific dimensions that the website wants.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.940
Check out the lesson in this course in which I show

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.930
you how to use the Canvas website to resize your images.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.510
So I've inserted all the details that I

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.655
mentioned and I also insert

00:11:22.655 --> 00:11:24.875
tags that describe my outlook and

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:27.485
eight character collection symbol,

00:11:27.485 --> 00:11:29.780
you can write any characters that you want.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.790
And because my collection does not

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.460
include explicit and sensitive content,

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.380
I will not click the toggle button under the NSW caption.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.870
That's it. All I need to do now is to click

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.060
the blue Create Collection button

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.650
at the bottom of the page.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.744
That's it. Now that my collection has been created,

00:12:34.744 --> 00:12:38.105
I can start uploading my first image into it,

00:12:38.105 --> 00:12:39.680
and I can do that by putting

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.245
my mouse over the Create menu.

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:43.790
But this time I will click on

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.270
the NFT option instead of the collection option.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.570
And again, I will now just insert all the details that

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.490
the website asks as I

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.575
did previously to create my collection.

00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:56.870
The difference will be that this time the

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.465
details we know describe the entire collection,

00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:01.385
but only the specific image

00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:03.680
that I want to upload to my collection.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.550
As you can see,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.710
there is a preview window and the right side

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.770
of the page that shows us every change we make.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.895
Now before we continue,

00:13:19.895 --> 00:13:23.135
I will go over the most important fields on this page.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:26.075
The first one is royalties from secondary sales.

00:13:26.075 --> 00:13:29.210
Here we can set the percentage of revenue that we want

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.570
to receive from secondary sales of our NFT.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.380
Which means that if our NFT bio decides to sell

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.280
the NFT or she has bought from us to another bile,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.565
we will get a certain percentage from that sale.

00:13:43.565 --> 00:13:45.950
The only limitation is that the bio of

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.665
our NFT must sell the NFT

00:13:48.665 --> 00:13:50.150
on sulci because

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.930
not all NFT marketplaces support this feature.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.940
Now the most important field on

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.145
this page is the text field.

00:13:58.145 --> 00:13:59.900
And the reason that this field is so

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.330
important is that your outlook will be

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:07.500
searchable on the sulci marketplace based on these tags.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.515
And another very important field is the license.

00:14:15.515 --> 00:14:17.330
And you can choose the license that you

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.250
want based on your needs.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.600
And if you're not sure which

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.730
license you want to give with your NFT,

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.105
then just click the docs that sulci that i o

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:28.025
forward slash license link

00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:30.470
to compare between the different licenses,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.525
I would pick the public display

00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:36.065
forward slash non-commercial exploitation.

00:14:36.065 --> 00:14:38.915
The last important field is the collection field.

00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:40.910
You don't have to use a collection if you

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.205
just want to create specific entities.

00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:45.635
But if you do want to have a collection,

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.200
then just choose the collection that we have

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.825
previously created form the dropdown list.

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:53.960
The field below the collection field is the traits field.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.655
So if you, for example,

00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:58.790
uploading an image of a cat with blue eyes,

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.255
then you can type IS color inside the left field

00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:06.290
and look inside the second field right next to it.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.140
And you can insert multiple traits if you want.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.140
So once we have inserted all the details on this page,

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.900
we will just click the blue mint NFT button

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.790
at the bottom of the page to continue.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:35.190
Then I'm going to pay again for listing the NFL.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.395
And that's it. We will now see

00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:53.780
the congratulations message that

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.720
convinced that our NFT was created.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.580
We can now open our event them all,

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.070
and click the gallery icon at the bottom of

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.530
the wallet window to see our collection.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.840
We can also see our collections on the soar website.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.180
We can do that by hovering the mouse over

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.250
the maypole File menu and by

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.445
clicking on the My collections option.

00:16:24.445 --> 00:16:27.550
Now we will want to list our NFT.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.930
And to do that,

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.820
Let's avert our mouse over

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.865
the Blue Wallet button at the top of the page,

00:16:33.865 --> 00:16:37.190
click on the NFT is in my wallet option.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.400
And then list NFT button under the image. Our NFT.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.285
For example, I will list my NFT for 0.3,

00:16:53.285 --> 00:17:02.270
so I

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.680
will not click the toggle button.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.050
You will only want to turn this toggle button on if you

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.315
don't want you NFT to appear publicly

00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:10.640
on the marketplace and you just want to

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.805
share the link to the listing with specific people.

00:17:13.805 --> 00:17:15.890
Great, I will now just click the list

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.480
NFT blue button at the bottom of

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.340
the window to list the NFT.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.110
Approve the transaction inside my phantom wallet.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.540
And we now see the green success message at the top of

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.065
the page that says NFT listed successfully,

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:48.605
great, our NFT is now available for sale.

00:17:48.605 --> 00:17:50.480
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.540
and I will see you in the next lesson. Goodbye.
