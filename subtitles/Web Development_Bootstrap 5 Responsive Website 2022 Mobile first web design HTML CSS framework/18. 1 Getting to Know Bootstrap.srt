00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Hey,

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,930
what if I told you there was a way to create websites really quickly by linking to a style

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,790
library in a JavaScript library?

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,350
And then you can bring the power of those libraries into your projects to develop your

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,890
website.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,060
Just by applying different classes to your elements on the page,

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,480
you can make them look completely different.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,920
Well,

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,080
this is bootstrap,

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,800
and this is what bootstrapped does.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,560
It's a front end framework,

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,540
so that means that it's based on HTML,

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,410
CSS and JavaScript.

14
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,040
It's an open source,

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,290
and it's the most popular front end framework.

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:42,340
On line today is a responsive grid type system that has a lot of pre built components that

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,340
you can easily bring into your projects,

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,510
saving you a lot of time from styling and also applying the JavaScript in order to produce

19
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,870
that type of functionality.

20
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,580
This is rapid website development where you could build fast responsive sites all using

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,280
bootstrap,

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,610
so using the different components in bootstrap,

23
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,620
you could bring a lot of power quickly and easily to your projects.

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,130
They've got a number of examples of the main website is get bootstrap dot com,

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,240
and if you click the examples button.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,990
You can check out some of the really cool things that you can do with bootstrap by adding

27
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,850
in components and these air.

28
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,230
Also,

29
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,040
some of them are commonly used Web development and design components that you might be

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,610
using,

31
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,070
and it's all already done with bootstrap.

32
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,450
And in order to bring bootstrap into your project,

33
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,160
there's a number of ways to do that.

34
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,540
So if you're using the terminal,

35
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,770
you can do an install.

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,550
If you've got the node package manager,

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,720
there's also the boots dropped CD ends.

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,580
So what CD ends are their content delivery networks.

39
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,410
So these are libraries that you can link to so that you can add the source files to your

40
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,110
project directly without having to download them.

41
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,910
So if you want to bring the CSS in and there is also JavaScript libraries,

42
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,540
it is based on J Query the JavaScript.

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,630
So some of the functionality is based on JavaScript for the components.

44
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,900
So if you do need to make use of the components,

45
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,850
you need to bring in first the J Coury Library than the Popper Library and then,

46
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,620
lastly,

47
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,990
the bootstrap Js library.

48
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,450
So,

49
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,590
in order to get bootstrap onto your Web project.

50
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,390
You can copy the CSS link and then also the JavaScript and J query links.

51
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,820
And,

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,320
of course,

53
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,560
there's more information available if you explore the docks.

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,270
There's also a number of icons for bootstrap,

55
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,370
so this gives you the option to bring ah,

56
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,720
whole library of icons that you can utilize within your Web pages.

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,050
So going over to explore the documentation and give you an overview of how to set that up

58
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,480
and this is designed within a grid like format.

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,570
So for now,

60
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,510
when gonna hit the getting started,

61
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,540
and once again it's got the cdn for the C.

62
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,400
S s library,

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,860
so you can copy the CSS library and then bring it into your project.

64
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,640
So just put it within the head off your project.

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,560
And there's also an option to download the CSS file directly on your computer.

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,990
And then,

67
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,400
of course,

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,310
you could link to it,

69
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,880
just as you would with any other style sheet that you're producing on your system.

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,350
So now when I go over to the Web page and I refresh it,

71
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,380
we noticed already immediately that as I refresh that there are some styling changes now we

72
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,790
can bring bootstrap into our project by applying different classes.

73
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,060
So I'm gonna It's that a class class of Jumbotron And of course,

74
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,840
I am gonna be going through all of these throughout the upcoming lessons it's going.

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,120
Apply all of the styling directly to that element that have applied the class to the pre

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,010
defined classes have a Siris of properties and values for each one already in the library,

77
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,490
So go ahead and try it It bring the style sheet into your project using the cdn,

78
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,780
and then the next lesson.

79
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,260
I'll show you how you can download it,

80
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,560
and you can also bring the power of bootstrap.

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,300
Have the library directly on your computer,

82
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,000
and then you get access and you can look through the CSS file in order to get more familiar

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,640
with what's possible with bootstrap and all the various classes available and see what the

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,160
output is for the styling.

85
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,550
Try and you could be ready to move on to the next lesson
