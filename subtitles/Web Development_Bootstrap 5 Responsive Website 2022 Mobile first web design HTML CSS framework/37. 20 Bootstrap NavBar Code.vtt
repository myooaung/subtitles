00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
this lessons go be about the bootstrap nav bar,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.910
and almost every website is gonna need a navigation bar typically within.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.230
The header helps with the navigation branding and providing users some way to go through

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.100
the website and see all of the content.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.690
There's a number of options,

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.370
and this is going to function very similar to what we saw with now.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.450
But it's got a few more options as the knave bar,

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.620
because this is typical use for the knave bars to sit at the top.

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.390
So there's ways to position it and you also might have some more options,

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.510
such as the forms and the inputs.

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.360
And all of this,

12
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.840
of course,

13
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.870
is available just via the classes.

14
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.000
The color schemes are also another option that we have when it comes to the now bar,

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.530
and this is also something.

16
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.720
This is also something that we've seen before,

17
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.940
where we can set the background colors.

18
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.490
But in this case we have a specific class for the knave bar,

19
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.350
dark or in the knob or light,

20
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.150
and this will indicate how the text is handled and depending on what your background is.

21
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.610
So you set the background to whatever you want.

22
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.890
You can also style a background to any specific color,

23
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.730
and then you use the nav bar lighter than AP art.

24
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.460
Dark in orderto handle the colors of the text on top,

25
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.710
so it's a really nice effect.

26
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.930
There's also the different ways to expand,

27
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.780
so the different breaking points on LG and so on.

28
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.750
So where it's going to break when you're shrinking your page down.

29
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.060
So,

30
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.570
typically,

31
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.040
usually I use the M D.

32
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.120
But of course you can use other ones as needed,

33
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.660
the different breaking points.

34
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.700
So there's S M M,

35
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.060
D L G Excel,

36
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.250
and that's where when the pair persons shrinking the page down where it's gonna break,

37
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.900
there's the default one.

38
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.710
So this is just the regular default nav bar with the light in the background color.

39
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.150
It's a simple is that to have a navigation bar,

40
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.690
but you,

41
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.230
if you want it fixed to the top,

42
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.560
you can also apply.

43
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.700
Fix top class.

44
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.230
You can fix it to the bottom.

45
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.260
Some websites have it at the bottom as well.

46
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.800
And then there's sticky top.

47
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.180
So this is an interesting one,

48
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.860
and this one isn't always available across all the browsers so if you are to use that,

49
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.410
make sure that you do check it.

50
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.800
And this is an interesting one,

51
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.250
because once it hits where you've indicated the navigation bar,

52
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.480
it's going to stick to the top.

53
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.780
So if you keep it at the top of your HTML code is going to stick to the top of the HTML

54
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.950
cord as you navigate down.

55
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.280
If you have it in the middle of your HTML code,

56
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.870
only when you hit that part it's going to stick to the top and I'll show you what I mean,

57
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.480
as we go through this lesson,

58
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.270
let's open up that editor and we already have the knave from before,

59
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.350
and we can start fresh with a new navigation bar or we can just create a brand new one.

60
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.490
We can update the content contained within it,

61
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.280
so I'm gonna do a little bit of both.

62
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.770
We're going to create a brand new knave class and give it now bar as the class,

63
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.350
and I'm gonna set the now far too light.

64
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.320
And then the background can also be late.

65
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.250
That's our navigation bar,

66
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.270
and of course you're gonna have some items within the navigation bar so I can copy those

67
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.850
over.

68
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.590
And I'm going to get rid of some of this the Navajo item and the knave Lincare going to

69
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.660
come back because that's gonna be used within the Nath bar as well.

70
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.340
But for now,

71
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.280
we're going to remove them,

72
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.530
so we have a clean sleep.

73
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.180
But just keep in mind that we could easily transform the knave into the nav bar and then we

74
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.350
still have the same content down there.

75
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.620
I'm gonna get rid of that and we don't aren't putting it within the main container.

76
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.110
You can also put it in the main container.

77
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.460
You could have fluid container.

78
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.210
It depends on how you want your navigation bar handled.

79
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.080
So we did say we want to do a transformation and really it's similar,

80
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.940
but we're using nav bar a lot of the times.

81
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.120
So just to avoid the confusion,

82
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.680
we're gonna place the content in and we still need the list items for the content.

83
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.350
So we'll drop in a few more hyperlinks and then as we add the styling,

84
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.920
this is gonna take it shape and it's gonna look more like a navigation bar.

85
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.440
And then,

86
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.890
of course,

87
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.020
we also still have those options where we could go fixed top.

88
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:09.560
And for this I'm gonna add a custom style to this of height 2000 picks.

89
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.580
So this will allow us to scroll down so you can see that it sticks to the top.

90
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.090
And although it doesn't look like a navigation bar,

91
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.830
you can upload.

92
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.670
We supply those classes to any element and it will still take the stack.

93
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.690
You can do fixed bottom as well.

94
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.080
So if you want it sitting at the bottom of the page eso Even as I scroll,

95
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.820
you can see my school bar slightly here.

96
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.300
The side and we fixed the bottom.

97
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.360
We fix the top and so on.

98
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.700
And then there's also the sticky top,

99
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.790
and that one will look at a little bit more detail at the end of this lesson.

100
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.010
So let's create our navigation bar,

101
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.370
and we've got now far we've got some colors to it.

102
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.870
And maybe you want to do background primary,

103
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.820
and I'm gonna update now bar to be dark so that we can see the content.

104
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.350
Teoh,

105
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.750
put it back up to the top.

106
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:06.060
So let's take care of our own ordered list where we've got the content and updates now far

107
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.750
enough.

108
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.350
So as soon as we apply that,

109
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.590
that takes care of quite a bit of the styling,

110
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.380
and we still have it as typical hyperlinks.

111
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.850
That's why we can't see the content quite yet.

112
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:25.220
Eso if we update this to have item And this is where we've seen the knave items before,

113
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.880
where we saw it in the last lesson where they're referred to as now items.

114
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.350
And this is the same thing for the navigation more and these are also have links still,

115
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.390
So there is a lot of consistency in these classes because,

116
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.640
really,

117
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.590
the nav bar is just only slightly different than the regular now.

118
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.160
And I'm gonna update this to be late and copy the structure of the list items over so still

119
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.560
doesn't look much like a navigation bar.

120
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.430
And that's because we want to make this to be toggle.

121
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.690
And we wanna wrap all of the content that we want to collapse in a parent class and this is

122
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.180
naff bar collapse.

123
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.160
And this is where the collapsible content is gonna go.

124
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.130
So anything within here is part of the collapse.

125
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.540
And so we do need to add a few different attributes where we've got the knave bar and let's

126
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.380
added now,

127
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.680
bar expand and we're wanna have the break point.

128
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.630
So you have a MD so that automatically aligns it horizontally.

129
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.830
So it is starting to look more like a navigation bar,

130
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.960
and this is now four collapse,

131
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.370
and it's also got underclass of collapse.

132
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.850
And you also need tohave an I d or some way to identify this element.

133
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.250
So I'm just gonna call it now one,

134
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.760
as this is how we're gonna identify what were collapsing.

135
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.980
So let's see what happens when we collapse it and it disappears because we haven't added in

136
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.520
our collapse button yet.

137
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.890
Eso we do need to have a button that's gonna show up when the collapse happens.

138
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.050
So button.

139
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:07.910
And this has a class of naff bar toddler and give it a type of button and the data toddler

140
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.740
data toggle is going to be collapsed,

141
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.070
and we also,

142
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.010
most importantly,

143
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.410
need that data target.

144
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.570
So the target is always important because this is going to indicate what we want to

145
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.260
collapse.

146
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.630
So just add in the hash for the I.

147
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.890
D.

148
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.320
S and identify the element that's gonna be doing the collapse.

149
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.780
And for now,

150
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.280
just keeping X in there so it see what happens.

151
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.340
So we collapse it.

152
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.300
I click it.

153
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.140
There's our navigation menu again.

154
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:42.650
So it's collapsible and bootstrap already has a default class in order to have the Tata

155
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.510
Glor icon.

156
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:51.570
So you could just create an empty elements and provide a class of nav bar toddler I climbed

157
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:51.570
.

158
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.410
It's a rather long one,

159
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:59.170
but it will provide that toddler icons so that you typically see you can also collapse it

160
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.410
at different points.

161
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.850
So if I want to collapse it on sm,

162
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.250
that's gonna collapse it on a smaller screen.

163
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.620
If I wanted it collapsed on the larger screen.

164
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.350
So there,

165
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.890
right away it's already collapsed.

166
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.660
And I'm gonna actually change this to nab our dark.

167
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.330
And I'm gonna like thes two home about and contact.

168
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:24.330
So these could be sections on one page and add that into the main container.

169
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.450
So given an I D.

170
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.050
Of home,

171
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:32.050
then I'll just use the display four to output the word home.

172
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.590
So we have a title there and then paragraph,

173
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:42.720
and I'm also gonna apply a style height of 1000 picks and then we'll duplicate thes

174
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.450
sections for the other.

175
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.290
So we had a boat and we'll update the text.

176
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.610
Contained within is well,

177
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.050
and I'm also gonna just I'll update this toe empty so it's not collapsed,

178
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.700
so we click.

179
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.510
One would click to would Click three.

180
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.110
So it's bringing us to the pages and also notices,

181
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.390
well,

182
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.440
that it's slightly off.

183
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.160
And whenever we've got the fixed top,

184
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.600
there's always going to be some spacing issues.

185
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.850
There s O in orderto handle that we can add in a class into the section.

186
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.260
Cause was will use bootstrap to apply some additional styling.

187
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.630
And if you do padding top Dash five,

188
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:27.190
that will provide the perfect amount of padding for the section to be just below the

189
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.140
navigation bar.

190
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.020
And I'm gonna add that in all three of them and save.

191
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.180
So now when I click home,

192
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.450
I get to the home boat contact,

193
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:42.240
and it's automatically scrolling itself down and the reason the contact is still down is

194
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.740
that the height of it?

195
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.980
If the height of it was 1500 then the contact would be all the way up because it's where

196
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.940
the scroll bar ends and that's why it was sticking up a little bit there.

197
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.690
So also,

198
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.050
if we want to add in another naff bar and let's say within the home section,

199
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:04.890
we've got another now bar and this is gonna be class of nav bar and this is this one will

200
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:11.610
make sticky for the naff bar just to show you how the sticky works and sticky top and we'll

201
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.680
set a background color of danger.

202
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.330
And there's also branding class that you can add in for your navigation bar.

203
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.400
So just put sticky content there.

204
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.470
So refresh the navigation bar,

205
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.410
the sticky content.

206
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.820
And we also have to move this one because the stickies actually going to go underneath the

207
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.250
fixed top because that one's on top.

208
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.590
So now when we scroll down and we get to the sticky content,

209
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.500
watch out stays at the top.

210
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.380
And as I continue scrolling once that entire section is gone,

211
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.430
it's going to disappear,

212
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.450
and it's back whenever we're scrolling back to it.

213
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.690
So it's how sticky works,

214
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.610
and it will go underneath the main Nath bar if you have a fixed to the tops.

215
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.320
That's why we're not able to see it once fixed to the top.

216
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.850
That's if you want to use this sticky and also keep in mind once again that not all

217
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.290
browsers,

218
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.170
they're going to support it.
