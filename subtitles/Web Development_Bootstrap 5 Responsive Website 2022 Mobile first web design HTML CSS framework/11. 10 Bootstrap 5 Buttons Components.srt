1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Let's not like it's
showing you some of

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,345
the really cool things that
you can do with buttons,

3
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:06,374
buttons and Bootstrap, or one
of the most fun components.

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:09,210
As they give you this really
nice colorful buttons

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,475
when you hover over them,
they can highlight.

6
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:13,605
You can also do
buttons as outlines.

7
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:17,114
You can also add in the
loading spinner options,

8
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:18,990
set buttons within groups,

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,975
set buttons horizontally,
group them together,

10
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:24,345
and then also how you
can set and add in

11
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:27,570
a drop-down menu within
the button grouping.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,890
One of the most fun things about

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,644
bootstrap are the buttons.

14
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,550
And buttons can be applied to

15
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,920
any element just like any
other class can be done.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,090
So let's turn this
into a button,

17
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,920
will turn the div into a button.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,900
Of course, you can
apply button classes,

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,460
two buttons as well.

20
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,685
So this is just a
default button object

21
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,380
and we don't have any colors

22
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,135
or any properties applied to it.

23
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:52,820
So set this up as
a primary button.

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,370
So that gives you this
button type of effect.

25
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,200
Also of course, you can use

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,565
the button elements and set
these up as type of button.

27
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:04,205
And within here,
we'll set up a class.

28
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:07,080
And using the button class.

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,985
Give it a separate button.

30
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:13,235
By default, if you
just use button,

31
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:14,690
you're not going to see
any of the borders,

32
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,860
any of the colors.

33
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,950
So you do need to
set a color class.

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,500
So you always need to
have a secondary class.

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,049
And they do have all
of the primary colors.

36
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,600
We've got secondary as well.

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,385
The primary, the secondary.

38
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:30,830
So all of the typical
color classes

39
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,085
that we've looked at before
in the earlier lessons.

40
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:36,395
Let's create a few more buttons.

41
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:38,525
We've got the secondary,

42
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,895
we've got the info button.

43
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:42,530
We've also got the warning,

44
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,010
the danger, all of the ones
that you might expect.

45
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,440
There's also a success button.

46
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,975
There's the danger button.

47
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,255
You can add all of
these to your page.

48
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:54,740
They're all nice and colorful

49
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,330
buttons and they're really fun,

50
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,270
interactive components
that you can add in.

51
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,800
And this makes it just

52
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,690
adding in these
buttons really easily.

53
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,945
When you hover over the
buttons, they highlight.

54
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:08,345
There's also, if you want,

55
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:11,015
you can do the dark, you
can do the light as well.

56
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,935
So updating the button,

57
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:15,050
let's get onto dark.

58
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,585
And we can also set a button.

59
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:20,540
So turn a button into a link.

60
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,760
That will turn that
button actually

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,905
into a link like this.

62
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:27,830
So it's another option that
you have four buttons.

63
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,060
You also have options to do
the outlines of the buttons.

64
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,595
So let's copy the buttons
that we've just created.

65
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:39,399
And I'll bring those down
into the fluid class.

66
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:42,565
Instead of using the button,

67
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:45,895
we're going to set
the button outline

68
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:48,835
and that's another option
class for buttons.

69
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,015
So adding in the outline
option for the buttons,

70
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,620
what that will do
is essentially it's

71
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,405
going to reverse the button.

72
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,100
So creating a white button,

73
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,620
but using the same color scheme

74
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,275
for the text and for the
border of the button.

75
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,870
This is another
option that you have

76
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,030
four buttons on your setting up

77
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,325
these nice colorful
buttons and Bootstrap,

78
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,110
whatever your preference is.

79
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,405
And there's the eight
different effects.

80
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,505
These also have
the hover effects

81
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:18,150
where they fill in as
you hover over it.

82
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,185
There's also different buttons
sizes that you can apply.

83
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,274
And so you can do these in
a combination of classes.

84
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:26,690
There's a button large option,

85
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,865
so that makes the button larger.

86
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:31,460
There's also a button
small options.

87
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,290
So going into the class again,

88
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,630
and let's set this button.

89
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,730
This button is small,
so it makes it

90
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,800
slightly smaller than
the other buttons.

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,575
You can also do a button
that can go full width

92
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:45,515
across for the button.

93
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,300
Let's go over to here.

94
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,860
We've got the button danger.

95
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,400
And if we want this button
to take up the full block,

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,355
you've got an option
called btn block.

97
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:57,980
What button block does
is this allows us to

98
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,625
take the full block of available
content for the button.

99
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,455
And I'm going to turn this into

100
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:05,405
a div instead of a button.

101
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:07,790
By default, it's not taking

102
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,380
the full block as

103
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,185
the component does need
to have the full block.

104
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,115
We'll wrap the button
within another parent.

105
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:19,235
So that allows us to take
the full block of code.

106
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:21,560
The parent should be taking

107
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,905
the full available element span.

108
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:29,120
So let's add in to the
class and set it up as

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,310
the D grid that

110
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,175
will allow the button to take
the full available spacing.

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,560
That's a full width
button that you can

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,665
set using the button block.

113
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:42,530
You can also set buttons as

114
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,380
active and also
disabled as well.

115
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,140
So if we've got a
button class here,

116
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,960
and let's set this
one to active.

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,510
That's going to
highlight that gray one.

118
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,040
And essentially turn it to

119
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,125
similar to what we've
got within here.

120
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,705
But there's no
hover effect on it.

121
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:01,415
There's also for the button,

122
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:04,114
we can set the
button to disabled.

123
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,410
If the button is disabled,

124
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,790
then we can't hover over it.

125
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,295
Nothing will happen when
you try to click it.

126
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:14,765
There's also some new
options for spinner buttons,

127
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:19,280
where you can set the spinner
elements in the button.

128
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,515
So let's set this up as

129
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:25,099
a button and give it
a button primary.

130
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,040
The spinner is just going
to be a separate element

131
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,205
that's gonna be sitting
within a parent element.

132
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,710
You can set up the
class for this,

133
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,845
set the various spinner
clauses for it.

134
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,830
This one is just gonna
be using a border.

135
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,690
And let's save that.

136
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,195
So that's going to create
this type of effect.

137
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:47,615
You can also add in
some text after it.

138
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,255
So if you wanted to do
something like loading,

139
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:53,390
that will apply that
loading type effect to it.

140
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,130
There's a few different types of

141
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,500
spinner classes
that you can apply.

142
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,435
So this is the primary.

143
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:03,185
Let's set a few other colors
to make it more colorful.

144
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:06,080
And then for the spinner,

145
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,310
we can set a spinner border SM.

146
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,840
So that's the spinner
border dash SM.

147
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,020
So it's going to make
a smaller effect

148
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,735
for the spinner or
the smaller border.

149
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:23,735
There's also the grow.

150
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:29,255
Let's set that and
set the spinner grow.

151
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,730
And you can also set that as SM.

152
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,365
Let's set up this
says spinner grow.

153
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:38,165
So instead of spinner border,

154
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,415
we can set it as spinner grill.

155
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:43,115
You can also group
buttons together.

156
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,180
That's another option.

157
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,550
If you want to group a
bunch of buttons together,

158
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,075
there's an option to set up
a grouping of the buttons.

159
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,160
So let's set up another
set of buttons.

160
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,275
Give this one a parent.

161
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,390
And the parent will
be where we're going

162
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,100
to be grouping the
buttons together,

163
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,960
setup a button group,

164
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,430
and then all of
the buttons within

165
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,890
here are gonna be
grouped automatically.

166
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,795
So setting up some buttons,

167
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:09,090
you can use the divs
for the button.

168
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,440
Adding in several different
buttons there that group

169
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,030
them altogether within
a separate div chunk.

170
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,595
You can also, for the group,

171
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:24,640
you can apply button
clauses to the group.

172
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,995
So if you wanted
this to be large,

173
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:29,980
create a large group of buttons.

174
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,885
Let's create some different
colors for the buttons front.

175
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,015
So you can distinguish
between the buttons.

176
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,490
When you group them, there's
gonna be no spacing between

177
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,340
the buttons where we were
typically adding the buttons.

178
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,350
There is some spacing
between the buttons.

179
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,390
You can also group
them vertically.

180
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,240
So it's another option
for getting buttons.

181
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,860
Create a, another
group of buttons and

182
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,520
set this one as
group and vertical.

183
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,375
That's groups them vertically
like this for the buttons.

184
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,155
You can also have a
drop-down within a button.

185
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:06,635
So that's another nice option
to have within the button.

186
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:09,560
So let's convert this info into

187
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,145
a drop-down where we've got
it within a button group.

188
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:14,870
And then we're going
to wrap another parent

189
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,100
around it and give

190
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,475
this a class of button group.

191
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:21,800
This is grouping
the buttons that

192
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
are contained
within this parent.

193
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,260
Then here we can have

194
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,990
multiple items and
group those together.

195
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,490
So this can be click one,

196
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,140
and this can be clicked two.

197
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,615
And let's add one more
for the dropdown.

198
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,895
So we've got three
click options there.

199
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:38,480
Right now.

200
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,115
They're just grouped together.

201
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:44,870
But we can turn them into
a dropdown item that's

202
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,150
using the drop-down menu

203
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,345
in order to convert them
into a dropdown item.

204
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,190
And we might want to keep this,

205
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,730
the first one open there
just as a regular button and

206
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,600
have this to toggle to
open the other buttons.

207
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,090
So let's add that in and
set this up as a class.

208
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,370
That's our secondary button.

209
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:13,405
And it's gonna be a
dropdown toggle button.

210
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:19,630
And add in a data BS for
the toggle component.

211
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,045
That will allow us to toggle

212
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,075
the drop-down option
on the button,

213
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:27,949
set that as dropdown.

214
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,540
Rogers type in open into it.

215
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,880
That's going into
the first item.

216
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,875
And then the rest
of the buttons,

217
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,365
we're grouping these
in another element.

218
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:42,160
So pulling those altogether
within a, another grouping.

219
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,295
And this is where we're going
to have the drop-down menu.

220
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:51,070
Set this up as a class
and set up to drop down.

221
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,695
And that should be one word
dropped down, dash menu.

222
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,420
Then for each one of these,

223
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,890
these are not gonna be buttons,

224
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,870
they can be dropdown items and

225
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,000
the toggle should
actually be dropped down.

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
So click that and
that's going to

227
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,825
open up the drop-down menu.

228
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,730
That's how you can
create a sub menu

229
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,250
using the buttons and
the drop-down option.

230
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,110
Let's try to have some
fun with the buttons.
