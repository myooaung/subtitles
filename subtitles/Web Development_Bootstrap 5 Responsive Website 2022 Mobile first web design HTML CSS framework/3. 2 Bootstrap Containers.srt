1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
Exploring containers.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,090
So there's two types
of containers that you

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,965
can use for Bootstrap.

4
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:07,050
And one of them is
just container,

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,105
which is going to have
gutters on the side.

6
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,860
And it's going to
adjust depending

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,884
on what the screen sizes.

8
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:15,210
If you go on a really
small screen size,

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,755
then they're both going
to look the same.

10
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,575
The second one is the
container fluid class.

11
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:21,840
And what this does
is this allows us

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,465
to have the container
full width across.

13
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:28,935
That element is always going
to be full width across.

14
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,885
So it doesn't matter
what the screen size is,

15
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,865
it's going to be taking
up the full width

16
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,380
without any gutters or

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,570
any padding or margins around

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,895
the size of sides
of the element.

19
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,000
And these are both
added in as in

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,870
classes within your HTML
elements where you want to

21
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,840
apply that styling
into were linked

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,169
to the Bootstrap CSS and
the Bootstrap JavaScript.

23
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:53,420
So let's do a quick
overview of the page

24
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,300
we've got the
doctype has HTML and

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,150
Bootstrap five does use
the HTML elements and

26
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,250
CSS properties that
require the HTML5 doctype.

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,580
If you don't define this,

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,320
it's going to revert back to,

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,610
or it may revert back to

30
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,725
an older HTML format

31
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:11,870
so your pages might
not show up properly.

32
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,865
So do include the doctype,

33
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:18,320
as well as include
the character set.

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,600
So the UTF character set is

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,180
gonna be the character
set that's gonna be used.

36
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,564
And as well as the
language attribute

37
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:27,080
within the attributes of

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,760
the HTML tag and within

39
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,640
the meta bootstrap
five is mobile first,

40
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,600
and it's designed to be
responsive on mobile devices or

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,490
the proper rendering of

42
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,285
your content include
within the meta tag,

43
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:44,180
the viewport settings
faults are to

44
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,850
set the width to whatever
the device width.

45
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,340
This, and this sets the page to

46
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,100
the following screen
width of the device.

47
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,660
So that's going to
vary depending on

48
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,535
the device that's being used.

49
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:59,210
Also the initial scale
to set to equal one,

50
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,400
and that sets the
initial zoom level

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,070
when the page is first
loaded into the browser.

52
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,620
For Bootstrap, the main pieces

53
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,365
of bootstrap are gonna
be the containers.

54
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:10,610
There's two different types of

55
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,410
containers that you can set

56
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,055
within the HTML elements as
attributes with the class.

57
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:19,115
So the first-class that we're
gonna look at is container.

58
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,350
And you can just
create a div and

59
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,510
have the word
container in there.

60
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,060
And the second-class that we're
gonna look at is gonna be

61
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,285
the fluid container fluid class,

62
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,654
which provides a full
width container,

63
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:34,895
whereas the container
is going to be limited.

64
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,205
This one is going to
be container dash

65
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:39,395
fluid for the class.

66
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:41,705
Also within our CSS.

67
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm going to add in
a class called box.

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,630
So this is gonna be our
custom class that we're

69
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,960
gonna be adding borders
around the elements,

70
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,404
around the HTML elements

71
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:56,225
that we can actually
identify them on the page

72
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:57,740
simply by adding in

73
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,140
the box class to both of

74
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,660
those containers
will allow us to see

75
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,990
the pitch elements and we also
still need to link out to

76
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,255
the local style CSS file.

77
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,445
It's going to be using the H ref

78
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:16,595
and linking to style CSS.

79
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,800
And I'm placing that
after the link to

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,260
the Bootstrap source code

81
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,770
file as style sheet
and save that.

82
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,360
And that will add the borders

83
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,950
around both of the containers.

84
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,410
We'll set this up as
container one and

85
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,520
then container to save that,
expand the containers.

86
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,219
There's gonna be a difference
between the two containers.

87
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,540
On the small screen,

88
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,935
they're going to
both look the same.

89
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:41,330
But on the larger screens,

90
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,600
the container one is going
to have gutters around it,

91
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,490
whereas container two
is always gonna be

92
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,725
taking the whatever
the full width is.

93
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:51,005
Got it zoomed to 200%.

94
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:53,525
If we go back down to 100%,

95
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,155
we can see that the breakpoints
that the containers

96
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,390
do constantly adjust as

97
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,175
we're shrinking
down the page size.

98
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,935
And then once we get to a
really small page size,

99
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:05,090
both of the containers are

100
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,245
actually going to look the same.

101
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,210
So depending on what type of

102
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,265
properties you want
to the containers,

103
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:14,195
you can either use the container
or the container fluid,

104
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:16,055
which goes across the full page.

105
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,685
And that will affect how the
content is being displayed.

106
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,115
Typically, when you are
creating bootstrap,

107
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:24,335
you would wrap the
entire document

108
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,375
within a main container,

109
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,895
whether it be a fluid container

110
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,055
or just a regular
main container.

111
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:34,640
And then as you add in
different elements on the page,

112
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,880
you can set them as
separate divs and

113
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,330
then separate them as separate
containers on the page.

114
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,390
I'm just copying that
one and I'll update

115
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,690
the wording for
container to afterwards.

116
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,145
This way we've got two
different containers.

117
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:55,070
And we can see the difference
between the two containers.

118
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,040
One is going to be the top
container is going to be

119
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,935
just the regular container
with the gutters at the side,

120
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,630
which are going to
adjust depending on

121
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,655
the screen size and container.

122
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:06,800
Full fluid goes across

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,170
the full width of the
available page screen.

124
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,590
So go ahead and try that out
and add in some containers,

125
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,185
and then add some
regular HTML content

126
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:16,490
into those containers.

127
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,680
And you'll get ready to
move on to the next lesson.
