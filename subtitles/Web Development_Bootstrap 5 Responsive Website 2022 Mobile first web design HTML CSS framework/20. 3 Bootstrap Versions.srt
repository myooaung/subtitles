00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,810
this lesson,

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,250
we're gonna be covering the bootstrap versions.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,570
So you might have noticed that currently were using version 4.5 and before that was 4.44

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,390
point three and all of the way down.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,050
So there have been four major version updates with boots drop.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,800
Originally,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,620
Bootstraps started it with obviously version one,

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,650
and it went all the way to 1.4.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,370
Then it was updated to two,

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,780
and there was all the way through.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,160
And then with three,

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,850
that's where some of the major releases and the release changes were done.

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,270
So going between two and three was a major update and as well.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,850
Going between three and four has been a major update as well.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,900
So the upcoming lessons there gonna be a combination of the new version and on the

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,490
bootstrap site itself.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,990
So if you go to Doc's for it slash versions,

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,180
you can select and switch to any of the versions that you want.

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,700
All of the documentation is still updated and still online,

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,190
and you can also switch through the different versions by selecting here at the top right

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,550
hand corner on the website,

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,140
and that will allow you to go through the different versions that are available for boots.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,700
Drop also if you go to the home.

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,230
If you go to get bootstrap,

25
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,960
this is always gonna bring you to the most current version.

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,060
So if you are looking for previous versions of Bootstrap and if you are looking for a

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,380
particular themes,

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,890
some of them will be using older versions of Bootstrap as well.

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,080
So just keep that in mind that the version is important.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
For the most part,

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,750
a lot of the components are the same for the major version changes from 3 to 4.

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,810
Then there's gonna be a huge difference between the components and how they function.

33
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,540
So if you do find that your code is not working exactly the same as the code that's being

34
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,150
displayed,

35
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,980
check the version and make sure that you are using the same version that we are using

36
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,740
within the lesson.

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,400
In many of the upcoming lessons,

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,490
we are going to be using either 4.44 point five as those are the most current versions.

39
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,580
As of the time when we are creating this lessons and there will be updates if there are

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,520
some major changes for the components and the classes within the components.

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,490
And also,

42
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,670
if you are looking for themes or templates online as well,

43
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,190
pay attention to the version numbers because they will differ.

44
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,010
And there's a lot of different versions of bootstrap that have been covered over the past

45
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,570
few years.
