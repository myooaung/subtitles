1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Cards allow us to provide
some structured content and

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,935
display images heading,
footer, and text.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:10,170
We can also place text and

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,730
other components on top of

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,280
the image depending on how
we want to structure it.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,720
And it works really well when

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,400
it's presented within the grid.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,620
As an example here
where we've got

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,300
several different columns within

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,940
the grid and then we're
presenting the content.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,709
These are all the same cards.

12
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,300
They're just being
presented nice and

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,310
neatly within a unified format.

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,470
And the unified
structure all done

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,660
with the Bootstrap
classes and using

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,020
the cart classes card component

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,345
allows us to create some
structured content.

18
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,685
First, we create a
parent for the card

19
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:43,400
in order to create a
basic card object,

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,320
give it a class of card.

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,225
And then within the card,

22
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,265
let's add in a body.

23
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,650
So this is gonna be the
contents of the card.

24
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,790
So that's where all of

25
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,115
the card body constants
are going to go.

26
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:57,755
And of course you can just
like the other components,

27
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:00,755
you can set them up and
whatever properties you,

28
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:02,990
whatever class you
apply to the element,

29
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,960
it'll take those
properties of that class.

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,180
If we had some content there,

31
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,580
it provides this type
of structured content.

32
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,180
You cannot in a header and a
footer as well to the card.

33
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,630
So again, that gives us more
options For structure of

34
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,430
the content in order to present

35
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,890
the content in different
ways within the card,

36
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,260
setting up a card header.

37
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,810
And this allows us to prevent
that information within

38
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,900
a header type structure
that also we can set in and

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,215
set a footer that's
under the card footer.

40
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,670
And that can maybe contain

41
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,325
some contact information
about a person.

42
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,680
You can also set the
various backgrounds of

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,540
the cards using

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,940
the different background
colors that we've seen.

45
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,125
So if we want to apply,

46
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,700
we can mix and match.

47
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,024
So adding in a background

48
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:55,280
for primary that we'll
set that to blue,

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,255
consent the text to light
so you better see the text.

50
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:02,675
There's also images that
you can add to the card.

51
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:05,540
So adding an image to
the top of the card.

52
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,664
So let's add in an image
and give it a class.

53
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:13,835
This is going to
be card image top.

54
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,535
We need to set the
source for the image.

55
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:19,580
I do have the logo
for Bootstrap going

56
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,475
to use as the image for
the top of the card.

57
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,830
So that provides
this type of effect.

58
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,840
If you have multiple cards.

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,050
So if you have an
element and you've got

60
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,820
a grid structure
for the elements,

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,710
and then you've got a couple.

62
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,795
You've got across here.

63
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:40,594
These are just columns.

64
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,520
And you add in the
cards into the columns.

65
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,220
Select the entire card object.

66
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,975
And then for the column,

67
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:52,685
let's select a couple of
columns and duplicate those.

68
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:56,510
That gives us this type of
effects where we've got the

69
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,830
using the grid with

70
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,100
the three columns of
the card content.

71
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,435
You can also overlay text
within the cards as well.

72
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,800
On top of the image,

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,580
you can add in some
text over the image.

74
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,075
So that's within the image
just underneath there.

75
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,865
Let's add in another
div and give this one

76
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:20,405
called or should be
called cloths. Image.

77
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:26,045
Overlay allows us to place
some text over the image.

78
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:28,850
And I'll just use the class of

79
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,240
card text that allows us to
have the image over the text,

80
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,680
just like an example.

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,840
That's the far
right one that has

82
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,515
that option applied to it.

83
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,200
If you want it to have a button.

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,005
You can also add
in a button there.

85
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,945
That button will also
be over the image.

86
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,640
Just have to be
careful that you do

87
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,230
have enough spacing for

88
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,280
the image in order to
apply the card content.

89
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,320
You might want to adjust those

90
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,135
on different sized screens.

91
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,560
Let's keep it responsive,

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,350
but we're gonna break
that one on the MD.

93
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,560
That will break
the last column on

94
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,475
MD and provide this type of
effect for the page elements.

95
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:17,524
So that when that resizes
and it goes larger,

96
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,030
we still have enough
space there for

97
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,270
the text and for the button
that's over the image.

98
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,250
And then on the
smaller size screens,

99
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,230
we're letting it take
the full available

100
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,660
with the parent element.
