00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,610
hi and welcome to our bootstrap introduction course where we're going to be building out a

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,770
website project from scratch using bootstrap.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,860
And if you've never used boots dropped before,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,420
you're gonna be amazed at how easy it is to construct websites quickly and easily.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,970
And these websites are all fully responsive.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,890
As you're going to see an upcoming lessons,

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,560
there's a number of amazing components that you can really easily add to your project.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,550
My name is Lawrence.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,200
I'm gonna be instructor for this course.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,810
I come to you with many years of Web developer experience.

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,710
And using bootstrap is one of my favorite front end frameworks to develop websites really

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,670
quickly and rapidly and that are fully responsive.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,720
Takes all of the tweaking of styling out of the picture and allows you to focus on the

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,180
design of the site and out of the box.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,790
There's some really amazing things you can do with bootstrap.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,700
There's a guy be a step by step course,

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,770
introducing you to how boots drop works,

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,430
the concepts of bootstrap and why you should be using bootstrap in order to create websites

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,430
.

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,900
So I'm gonna be walking you through some of those in the upcoming lessons.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,460
We're also gonna be developing a website from scratch as we progress through the lessons

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,740
and I show you more and more about bootstrap.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,900
This is an example of the website that we are going to be creating and notice that it's got

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,520
a number of bootstrap components and silly structured website fully functional.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,990
It can also be adjusted and fully responsive.

26
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,450
So the navigation bar as we shrink it down,

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,320
it collapses and we can click and un collapse,

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,950
that the coating is going to be done on the left hand side and the editor,

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,450
and on the right hand side,

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,420
I'll have the window open,

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,870
that you can view the adjustments and how it's being presented within the content.

32
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,320
And what effect adding the various classes is gonna have on the project that you don't need

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,570
to know.

34
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,490
CSS JavaScript.

35
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,240
You do need to know HTML.

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,090
So you do need to have some basic understanding of HTML and start during the content of

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,660
your HTML elements and how to apply attributes because mainly with bootstrap it supplying

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,890
the right classes.

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,250
And then,

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:00,650
of course,

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,150
there are some attributes that needed to be applied in order to introduce the JavaScript

42
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,000
functionality.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,950
I'm gonna walk you through how to get boots drop how to get set up with bootstrap,

44
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,090
creating a basic bootstrap template,

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,280
and then how you can apply some customized styling if you wish to your website project.

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,080
Also the different compatibility for bootstrap and why we use bootstrap.

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,530
It's a lot of good reasons why we use bootstrap.

48
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm also gonna be encouraging you throughout the lessons to try out some of the code and to

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,380
challenge yourself and write the code.

50
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,670
And then I'll show you walk through the exercise in the latter part of the lessons he.

51
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,300
There's a lot of really cool classes that you can add that update the typography,

52
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,580
visibility and,

53
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,040
of course,

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,070
images and how images air handled and even tables and then Scott,

55
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,430
these components that are customized that help you lay out content in a nicely formatted

56
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:50,940
fashion.

57
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,790
You can use lists,

58
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,000
which we commonly do in website development,

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,690
how you can group those together and display them nascent neatly and then,

60
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,110
of course,

61
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,260
the navigation bar.

62
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,840
So often times developers air just looking for a bootstrap in order to use navigation bar

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,310
because it makes the knave bar responsiveness really easy where you can collapse the

64
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,250
navigation bar and still have access to all of the links and then adding in various colors

65
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,250
.

66
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,840
So making your website nice and colorful really stand out and with some stunning colors,

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,420
and then you can,

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,880
of course,

69
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,450
update thes default color schemes really easily,

70
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,260
and that updates the whole look and feel of your website.

71
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,220
If you have any questions or comments,

72
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,810

73
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,100
