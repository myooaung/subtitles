00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,450
Welcome to the Jumbotron.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,620
This lesson is going to be about how we can create a Jumbotron and adding this component

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,950
onto our Web pages.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,540
This is a common way to have some content that really stands out to highlight some content

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:14,540
.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,850
And it's a hero unit style content.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,800
So number a few different options.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,470
And really,

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,980
it is just having a parent rapper called Jumbotron.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,030
And then this is just regular bootstrap stuff within.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:33,300
There's also a Jumbotron fluid and that occupies the entire horizontal space of the parent

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,300
.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,280
There's not a whole lot of difference.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,950
That depends on how you're using it and where you're using it.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,390
A number of differences that you're going to see.

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,430
Let's go back into our project and we're gonna add in a jumbotron so creating a diff that's

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,520
going to contain a bunch of elements.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
And then these are gonna be what's going to be contained within the Jumbotron.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,360
So the Jumbotron is gonna have a default background kind of agree area.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,490
It's also got some padding around it.

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,060
Let's create another div here,

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,760
and I'm gonna add a class of display three.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,040
So this is something that you might typically encounter in a Jumbotron and will center the

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,240
text so text is centered.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,250
Or maybe you want to do the text centered on the entire Jumbotron.

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,960
So it's up to you again.

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,490
However you want to display it.

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:30,330
There's also maybe you wanna have a paragraph with a class of text muted.

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,950
So this could be like subtitle more in full.

30
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,250
Whatever.

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,500
That's a typical Jumbotron.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,520
A lot of times you might also find buttons in there.

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,450
There's more information for the users,

34
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,390
and I'll show you the difference between the fluid one.

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,370
So there was an option for Jumbotron fluid,

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,790
and in this case,

37
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,490
because it's taken up the full container,

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,190
we don't really see my name.

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,720
Much of a difference here between the Jumbotron fluid and just the regular Jumbotron.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,880
We'll get rid of the text center in order to see the difference,

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,600
and the fluid is just taking up the full width bits because we had the text centered,

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,010
so we didn't see a difference.

43
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,900
But there is some padding here by default on the regular Jumbotron,

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,640
and the fluid doesn't have that padding.

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,220
So it's just taking up that full available space that's available within the parent.

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,730
That's what the difference there is.
