1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,235
We're gonna be exploring
the accordions

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,920
and how you can add
accordions to the page.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,170
So it's basically
what an accordion is.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,180
It's a block of content

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,985
that can contain a
hidden elements,

6
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:13,740
so you can select them
and that's going to

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,555
open up the accordion items.

8
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:17,550
Selecting the other
headings within

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,310
the accordion are going to
open up those other pieces

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,275
of content you can set to start
out by having it visible.

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,480
If you do want the
accordion item visible,

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,850
you can set that value into

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,820
it where it starts out
where it's not collapsed.

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,750
So doing adding in show
will have it as opened.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,300
And then the accordion
functionality will still work the

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,795
same way if you
remove out the show,

17
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:45,005
that's gonna start by default
having all of them closed.

18
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,690
And where you need to click
the heading in order to open

19
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,140
up the related content
within the accordion.

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,480
This lesson, we're
going to be looking at

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,220
the accordion component that

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,775
allows you to collapse
content and open content up.

23
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,280
And this is going to
require some attributes.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,215
So let's create the elements.

25
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,810
And this is gonna be the
mean class where we're

26
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,660
going to set the accordion
within this class.

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,480
And then we'll add in the
components within here as well.

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,600
So this is just using the
accordion class and you

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,020
need to give this an ID so
that we can reference it.

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,670
So I'm gonna just give
it an ID of a CC1.

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,225
Then you can add in the
various accordion items

32
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:28,475
and set them up as a class.

33
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:33,000
And these are just listed
as accordion items.

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,500
That's gonna be accordion item.

35
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,344
Then within here, we need
to set some headings

36
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:47,270
for the accordion and
then also buttons so that

37
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,480
we can collapse the
accordion content.

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,490
The heading is the
one that the users

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,770
are going to be able to see.

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,530
Setup another div for that.

41
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,955
This is going to be using

42
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:07,320
the class accordion header
and give this one also.

43
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,990
And also give this one an ID
for the accordion header.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,590
Then contained within here,

45
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,500
use a button and we'll
set the class of

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,205
the button to be the
accordion button.

47
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,930
So this is gonna be the
one that's going to

48
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,540
activate the accordion
to open and close.

49
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,905
You can set it up
as a type button.

50
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:33,080
And then it uses the attributes.

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,605
So data BFS toggle,

52
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:39,230
which is going to allow
you to toggle open and

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,485
closing of the collapse object.

54
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:46,400
And it's also going to
require an attribute that's

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,315
gonna be the data dash bs.

56
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:53,300
And this is gonna be looking
for the target object.

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,170
Wherever you're gonna give
the ID of the target.

58
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,660
I'll just call it open one.

59
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,925
So it's gonna be the first
one that we're going to open.

60
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,880
And this is where that's
going to be targeted towards.

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,605
And then within the button,

62
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:10,590
you can add in some content
within the button object.

63
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,700
And I'll just call
it opened one.

64
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,365
We can save that.

65
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,930
So that's gonna give
us this open one.

66
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,820
Within that same object.

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,460
Let's set the
collapsible content.

68
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,885
So we did have the header.

69
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm actually going to set
this as an H2 so that

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,030
the header object is going to be

71
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,985
separate within the
accordion item.

72
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:34,310
So open up that and
set that as a header

73
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,815
to that will just update that.

74
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:38,480
And then just after
the header to

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,520
this is where we're going
to set the content.

76
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,710
We need to give this an ID.

77
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,900
The ID has to match with

78
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,570
the ID that we're
setting to open.

79
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,690
Here we had set as head
one is going to be

80
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,165
the collapsible button link

81
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,145
That's going to
open the content.

82
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:56,810
And the content that's going to

83
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,330
open is going to
be under open one.

84
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,130
Give this and make
sure that this

85
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,490
matches because this is how
it's going to get identified.

86
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,304
Let's set a class.

87
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,570
And the class that we're
setting is going to be

88
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,950
accordion, dash, COH, lops.

89
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,625
This is gonna be a
collapse object.

90
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,720
And then we have an option.

91
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,480
If we want to show
it as not collapsed,

92
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,800
then you can add in the show.

93
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,030
For the data BS
parent attribute.

94
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,120
We want to set it to the parent,

95
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,270
which is gonna be the
accordion one object.

96
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,385
So that's going to
tie it all together

97
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,755
within the same
accordion content.

98
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:42,320
You can add some content there.

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,359
Within the example.

100
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,130
Let's add in another div.

101
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,900
We're going to wrap the content

102
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,384
with accordion body class.

103
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:55,280
There's quite a few classes
that we need to add in here.

104
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,215
So go to, go over it again.

105
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,895
So for the accordion,

106
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:00,320
you need to give it an ID.

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,930
And then the elements
within the accordion are

108
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,660
gonna get tied to
that mean parent.

109
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,430
So the collapsible content is

110
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,350
gonna get tied to
the mean parent.

111
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,045
Then for the first item,

112
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,240
you need to give it a
class of accordion item

113
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,350
that's going to wrap

114
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,825
the content within
the accordion item.

115
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:21,140
And then you can set an
element that's gonna show,

116
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,140
that's gonna hide and
close the content.

117
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,480
And then this one
needs to a class of

118
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,900
accordion header and also

119
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,800
assign an ID to it so that we
can reference it if needed.

120
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,150
And then within there,

121
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,695
I've added in a button.

122
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:41,045
And this button is going to
toggle opening and closing

123
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,370
the accordion content and

124
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,835
using the button class
of accordion button.

125
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:49,040
And then also setting
a type within

126
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,440
the HTML element has
an attribute button.

127
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,275
And then using the data BS,

128
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,365
toggle is setting
it to collapse.

129
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:00,125
And then we also need
to set a target.

130
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,970
And this target needs to use

131
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,850
the hash in order to
identify the target.

132
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,855
To open.

133
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:08,120
It makes sure that
you identify it by

134
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,375
the ID using the
hash and set that.

135
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,135
And then this is the content
that you want to display.

136
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:16,490
The content that's
hidden is going to

137
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,130
be wrapped within
the Korean collapse.

138
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,440
You have an option to show it.

139
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,585
Or if you don't have the show,

140
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:24,950
that's going to automatically by

141
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,780
default height the content.

142
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,795
And it just says we're
tying to the other IDs,

143
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:33,650
the attribute of data bss
parent also needs to have

144
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,320
the hash and that
needs to correspond to

145
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,080
the main parent class for
the accordion itself.

146
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,850
And then for the body contents,

147
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,040
you can add it in
and wrap it within

148
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,505
an element with the
class of accordion body.

149
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,850
Having all of that will
allow you to open and

150
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,285
close toggling the
accordion content.

151
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:56,570
You can add additional
accordion items using

152
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,199
the same structure
into the elements.

153
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,435
Just give them separate IDs.

154
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,280
So this one will be two,

155
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,510
that will be two.

156
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,030
It's going to open the number
two and actually still

157
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,335
this is number one because

158
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:10,910
we're still going to the parent.

159
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,190
And then you can add
some different content.

160
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,245
And I still need to update this,

161
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:19,010
that this should update
and have an ID of two.

162
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,120
So that will distinguish the
two buttons so that whatever

163
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,010
one-year clicking
and it's going to

164
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,635
highlight the active
one, turning that blue.

165
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:29,600
Let's add one more
so it can create

166
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,045
a third accordion item.

167
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:35,585
So update this to be had three.

168
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:38,075
So it's different to open three.

169
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:39,980
And so this will provide us

170
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,230
another element
within the accordion.

171
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,760
The parent is still the same,

172
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,485
so it's tying it all together.

173
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:48,440
And then also let's update
the button to say three.

174
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,675
These are all accordion items

175
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,390
that you can open
and close as needed.

176
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,460
This is a really
useful component that

177
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,320
you can use and you will need to

178
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
have the JavaScript
library in order

179
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,385
for this to work
fully responsive.

180
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:03,380
And it will take up
whatever space is

181
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,645
available within the text area,

182
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:08,540
automatically opening
them, closing the content,

183
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,650
showing it and hiding it.
