1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Good to be covering
how you can update

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,770
the different properties
of the page elements,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,184
adding in padding and margins,

4
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:09,975
also styling them in
different formats.

5
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:12,240
So there's giving you some
examples of how we can

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,910
take up the horizontal spacing,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,860
the vertical spacing in addition

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,975
to how we can select text,

9
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,430
turn it to lowercase,

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,505
capitalize, update
the text sizes,

11
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:26,550
update some of the
properties for the text.

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,710
Let's look at some of
the utilities that

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,230
are available within Bootstrap.

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,155
Setup and create a class.

15
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:36,570
I'm going to add
in the box class.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,420
And this is coming
from our local CSS

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,770
where we've got the box

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,770
where we're applying
a border that we can

19
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,545
see the various elements
off from the page.

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,155
Just call it element one.

21
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:52,550
Then apply the different
utilities and properties to

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,160
the various elements so that
we can see a difference

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,550
in how they're being
displayed on the page.

24
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,255
Let's just over on the
right-hand side there.

25
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:05,780
And we can add in borders
around the elements.

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,725
So if for instance we have an
element with out-of-order,

27
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:13,385
we can add the border
in to that element.

28
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:15,650
Element five doesn't
have a border.

29
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,260
So we can set a border class

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,830
that's going to
automatically set

31
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,945
a border around the element.

32
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:27,230
We can specify
whether the border,

33
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,705
if it's just on the top or
the bottom or the start.

34
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:35,480
Setting the border start adds

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,255
the border only in on the
start of the element.

36
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:40,460
We can actually update
these instead of

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,010
the blocks border
so that we can see

38
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,350
the entire element using

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,570
the Bootstrap border clauses
can also set a border width.

40
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,120
These are options
here where we can

41
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,520
have border one and
going all the way

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,220
to border for changing these
values is going to change

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,660
the border width,
making them thicker.

44
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,015
As the increase.

45
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,580
We can also set border colors,

46
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,390
just as we've seen with the
color classes in Bootstrap.

47
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,180
These are also
available for borders.

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,820
So there's primary,
there's the secondary,

49
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,444
there's the success, danger.

50
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,755
So all of the typical
ones that we've seen

51
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:30,100
within the other elements
that we can apply.

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,664
These are all also available.

53
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:36,235
Just selecting some of
them that are available.

54
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:37,795
And let's set this as

55
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:41,650
info that can set the
different border.

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,980
You can also around elements.

57
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,540
That's another option with

58
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,590
the elements where we

59
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,260
can set them and
around the elements.

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,095
So let's create
another container.

61
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:57,020
And we'll just
simply use that one

62
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,740
as another example of what
we can do with the elements.

63
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,020
We already have the border here.

64
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,265
Let's get rid of that.

65
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:06,755
And we're going to
set the rounded,

66
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:09,230
the rounded we saw
already within

67
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,295
the images that we have the
rounded option for the image.

68
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,099
It's slightly
rounds the borders.

69
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,205
You can do a rounded
circle as well.

70
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:20,480
So that's another option

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,770
where that's going
to turn it all

72
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,609
into a circle, rounded circle.

73
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,085
It's going to create a so-called

74
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:29,690
circle within the element.

75
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,410
Let's set the background
of this to be primary.

76
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,150
And we'll also set a
background of this one to be

77
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,710
dangerous so that we can

78
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,530
see what we've got
for the element.

79
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,390
So the circle is going to have

80
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,475
only the contained contents.

81
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,560
So if you have multiple elements

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,845
here and just add in
some line breaks,

83
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,650
the bigger the higher

84
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,570
the more height that you
have for the element,

85
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,045
the larger it's going to appear.

86
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:02,660
There's also a rounded
pill option that one

87
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,250
is going to be more of
a flat type Circle.

88
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,830
And actually that's
rounded pill not pull.

89
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,840
Let's update that. And again,

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,175
it's looks better if you
update the size of it.

91
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,710
So that's the pill effect there.

92
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,810
And notice that the text
is always still going

93
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,015
to be aligning up
at the top left.

94
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,895
You can also set the
width of an element.

95
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:28,940
So if we want it to be
twenty-five percent of the width,

96
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,755
we can do a W 25,

97
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,485
that's going to make
the parent element 25.

98
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:38,030
We can also set to 50 to 75200.

99
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,460
So taking it to 50,

100
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,625
that's going to set
that element to be 50.

101
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,940
Let's update and add in a
background color so that

102
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,675
we can see the entire
contents of the element.

103
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,280
In addition to the width,

104
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,534
we can also set a height
for the elements.

105
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:58,265
So that way we don't have
to use the line breaks.

106
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:01,910
We can use the Bootstrap
classes in order to set

107
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,200
a height that's gonna
be using the H dash.

108
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,990
If we want it to be set to 50%,

109
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,840
that's gonna take
50% of the parent.

110
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
So let's hide a style to

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,125
the parent and set a
height for this parent.

112
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,120
So now we can see that.

113
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,160
What it's doing is
it's automatically

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,485
taking 50% of the height.

115
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:26,825
That's off of the
parent element.

116
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,930
So you do need to have a
height set for the parent in

117
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,350
order to be able to see it
on auto height as well.

118
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,140
So apply the auto height and
that's using the MH auto.

119
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,599
And that will
automatically include

120
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,495
the height to take this
to be an height value,

121
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,490
you can also take 25 of

122
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,740
the Ville percentage
of the height that's

123
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,170
available from the
parent element sizing.

124
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,870
There's also margins and
padding that you can set for

125
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,550
the elements that's using
the different sizes.

126
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,655
You can set the
margin and padding.

127
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:04,295
Top, bottom left, right,

128
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,950
just as it normally
would do with CSS.

129
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,440
You can also set
the padding across

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,220
the x-axis or across the y-axis.

131
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,940
And that's for both the
padding and for the margin.

132
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,635
So in order to set that,

133
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,614
let's say for this element,

134
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,195
we want to add in some padding.

135
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:26,600
I want to add in
padding at the top.

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,660
And the size of the padding
that we want to add.

137
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,780
We can set from 0 to five,

138
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,915
or we can also use an auto
for automatic padding.

139
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:38,945
So setting this element
up for padding,

140
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,285
and let's set it to be for,

141
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:42,725
for padding at the top.

142
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,480
That's going to
provide that padding

143
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,310
near the top of the element.

144
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,470
You can also center elements.

145
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,305
So we've got the pill elements.

146
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:56,525
We can use the margin on the
x-axis and set that to auto.

147
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:00,050
So that will center an
element on the x-axis.

148
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,575
So auto is the same
as if we're setting

149
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:07,550
the automatic whenever we're
applying the styling to it,

150
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,845
let's add in some more.

151
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:12,409
Or if we want a margin,

152
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:16,085
we want a margin of
five to that element.

153
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,170
That's going to apply
that in margin around

154
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,285
the element for
the size of five,

155
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:21,440
for the elements as well,

156
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,640
you can add in and have shadow
effects for the element.

157
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,890
I'm going to make this bigger.

158
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,570
That's just setting the height.

159
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,400
So that gives us more space to

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,290
work with within the element

161
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,910
as we're setting some that

162
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,205
are gonna be the different
heights and widths.

163
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,690
And when we're adjusting it,

164
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,825
we're actually running out of
space there on the pixels.

165
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,760
Let's update that.

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,435
And for the element number four,

167
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:52,175
let's apply shadow
effect for that element.

168
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,705
So apply some padding.

169
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,055
We'll do a padding of four,

170
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:59,540
adding in the shadow got a
small shadow fault saddle or

171
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,670
a large shadow side in

172
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,940
the large shadow
effect, default shadow.

173
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,770
So in this case it's by default,

174
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,690
it's just taking the
default property.

175
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,869
If we want to align all
of the texts within

176
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:16,025
the children text and we
can center align the text.

177
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,320
So that's gonna take for
all of the children,

178
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,315
you can select the
elements independently,

179
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:24,395
the alignment for those could
also do a text transform,

180
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:27,035
applying and it
transforming the text.

181
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:28,820
I think we already
have it capitalized.

182
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,060
So let's change
it to upper case,

183
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,835
and that's updating the
text to be uppercase.

184
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:37,295
There's also a text lowercase,

185
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:39,320
but converts the text all into

186
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,470
lowercase and apply
to this element.

187
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,480
Let's capitalize the text.

188
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,280
It capitalized the text.

189
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,220
Notice if you already have
the text as uppercase,

190
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,635
it's not going to apply
any changes to it.

191
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:54,245
So these all have
to be lowercase,

192
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,380
as it is case-sensitive in
order to capitalize it.

193
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,845
If you do have any letters
that are already uppercase,

194
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:02,030
it's not going to change

195
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,160
the letters that are
within the text.

196
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,885
It's only going to be updating

197
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:09,110
the first character
within the string values.

198
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,125
We can also update
the font size.

199
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,790
So setting the font size,

200
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,890
we can go from one,

201
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,960
fs dash one, which is
gonna be the largest size.

202
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,975
And then going all the
way down to FSC six,

203
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,555
which is gonna be the
smallest size for the texts.

204
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:28,640
So F0, F6. So you've got

205
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
some sizing options in

206
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,975
order to update the
sizing of the text.

207
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:35,524
And that's just going to
make the text smaller.

208
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,475
You can also make
the text larger.

209
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,565
It can also apply
bold to the text.

210
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:42,320
So let's go back up to here to

211
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,605
this example and
make this text bold.

212
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,455
And that's using the FW.

213
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,700
Fw bold is going to
bold the elements.

214
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,795
You can make it italic
using the class.

215
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,405
So taking element number three,

216
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:04,655
and we'll apply the
FST italic class.

217
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:07,700
So that makes the
element Italic also

218
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,985
adjust the line height
for the elements.

219
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,265
So let's update the line height.

220
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:16,250
And that's LH, the
line-height large.

221
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,154
So it gives us more spacing.

222
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:21,740
There's also a text
decoration that we can set to

223
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,110
underline text content that

224
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,440
the text decoration underline.

225
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,615
If it is already underlined,

226
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,145
you can remove that

227
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:33,935
underlining by doing
text-decoration, none.

228
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:35,540
You can also do a
strikethrough by

229
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,340
doing a line through it.

230
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,960
So those are some
of the options that

231
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,655
are available within
the utilities

232
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,665
in order to update

233
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:44,615
the way that the text
is being handled,

234
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,670
as well as how the
elements are going to be

235
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,770
appearing on the page. So
go ahead and try it out.
