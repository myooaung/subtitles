00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
We're gonna be looking at grids

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.120
in this lesson and how you can

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.860
construct a grid where you have

4
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.245
bootstrap automatically
sets the grid,

5
00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:10.980
or you can predefine
what grid columns you

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.450
want for your elements to

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.270
take in the construction
of the grid.

8
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.520
And you can also
have them behave

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.025
differently depending
on the screen size,

10
00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:21.600
where they're gonna go from the

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.645
horizontal to a
vertical stacking

12
00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:26.430
of the page elements on

13
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.735
the smaller sizes once
it hits the break point.

14
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.810
And in this case we're
using Excel and SM.

15
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.030
So the small size
screens are gonna

16
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.750
stack vertically once they
reach that breaking point.

17
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.970
And the larger ones
are only going to

18
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.480
stock whenever we
go less than 1200.

19
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.220
That's the screen
size and that's

20
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.055
the breakpoint for the
Excel size for the columns.

21
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:51.425
In addition, you
can get Bootstrap

22
00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:54.440
to set your columns using CLL.

23
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.720
I've got some examples of that
coming up in this lesson.

24
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.940
Bootstrap grid
system is built with

25
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.700
Flexbox and allows 12 columns.

26
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.610
So let's look at the
basic structure.

27
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.464
So we're going to add the
grid within the container.

28
00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:12.304
And the grid is constructed
using the classes.

29
00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:15.470
So the parent class for the
grid is going to be roll.

30
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.720
This is going to
be for each one of

31
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.120
the rows that we want
to add into the grid.

32
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.590
And then within the grid,

33
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.240
we're gonna have
number of columns.

34
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.135
So this is up to you how many
columns you want to set.

35
00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:27.695
And it will automatically

36
00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:30.620
resize itself depending
on the column.

37
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.964
So if you want to do
different column sizes,

38
00:01:33.964 --> 00:01:37.699
there's basically six
different classes of columns.

39
00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.725
And each one scales

40
00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:43.895
up depending on what the
size of the device is.

41
00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.070
Take a look at some
of those columns.

42
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.860
And one of the most
basic ones is call.

43
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.350
What this will do is this
is automatically going

44
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.185
to handle the build
of the layout.

45
00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:57.590
If we have any number
of elements that are

46
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.340
using call that are
contained within the role,

47
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.170
then bootstrap is
automatically going to

48
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.360
calculate the
number of elements.

49
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.045
I'm also going to add
in the box class,

50
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.680
and that's the one
that we've got as

51
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.600
a custom class so that we can

52
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.940
see the structure of
the page element.

53
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.280
Also within this element,

54
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.965
I'm going to add a custom style.

55
00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:22.835
We can have some spacing
between the two elements,

56
00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:24.950
Between the two main containers.

57
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.230
So again, this is the
fluid one and this

58
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.780
is just the regular one
that we have on the page.

59
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.960
I'll also add in some
padding at the top.

60
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.745
Obviously you don't
have to do this,

61
00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:37.100
but this is just so
it displays better

62
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.325
within the display area
as we're constructing it.

63
00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:42.830
Let's go ahead and we're going
to add in another column.

64
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.450
So we've got two columns.

65
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.910
Now we can have three columns.

66
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.190
What happens now is that

67
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.205
Bootstrap is automatically
constructing those columns.

68
00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.810
So as we resize,

69
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.825
those columns are also
going to re-size properly.

70
00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:59.839
If we add it within
the fluid container,

71
00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.615
it will take up the
full available space.

72
00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:06.035
There are also still going
to automatically resize.

73
00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:09.470
This is if you want
bootstrap to be able to

74
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.460
set the resizing
of your elements.

75
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.075
And this is the easiest way
to get that and create that.

76
00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:18.770
Also within the row.

77
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.460
Let's create a second row
that's going to automatically

78
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.750
stack them if the next
role has four columns,

79
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.595
adding in another one.

80
00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:30.470
And just letting
Bootstrap handled

81
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.035
the design and the
structure of that,

82
00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:36.710
that's automatically going to
re-size it nice and neatly.

83
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.710
So we can also set and specify

84
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.770
the columns on the
different sizes

85
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.035
and what their
breakpoints are gonna be.

86
00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:47.840
So show you how to do that
and we'll do a split here

87
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.960
between the rows and we'll
set up another column.

88
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.210
And this time we're going
to be looking at setting

89
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.105
the column using the small size.

90
00:03:56.105 --> 00:04:00.770
We want this column to go
to across this column,

91
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.995
we're gonna use a small size
and this one can be four.

92
00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:06.905
And then we'll just set
these ones as well.

93
00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:10.625
So that total is going
to equal to 12 columns.

94
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:15.560
And we see now that this one
is going to get two slots.

95
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.445
This one is going to get
four columns, again, 24.

96
00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:21.125
As the re-size.

97
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.335
That's going to adjust
depending on the screen size.

98
00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:26.480
Once we shrink it down,

99
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.960
once is less than the
breakpoint on the small size,

100
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.149
those columns are
now going to stack.

101
00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:34.970
Instead of being
within the role.

102
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.730
That's dependent
on what you set.

103
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.070
So right now we're using the SM.

104
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.739
And the SM is for small devices.

105
00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:44.720
And if that means that if

106
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.565
the screen size is equal
or greater than 576,

107
00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:51.290
it's going to set
the column widths,

108
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.480
but if it's less than 576,

109
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.525
then it's going to break that
down into separate roles.

110
00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.205
Let's try another one where

111
00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.275
we're going to use
instead of the SM,

112
00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:02.870
let's use the Excel size.

113
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.400
So this is gonna be the extra

114
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.850
large for extra
large screen sizes.

115
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.020
This is going to have
a breakpoint of 1200.

116
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.140
Anything that we have smaller
than that breakpoint is

117
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.260
going to stack them
automatically as separate rows.

118
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.960
And once we get to the
larger breakpoint,

119
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.370
It's going to match what we had

120
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.870
for the small size screens

121
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.050
where we're using the SM
with the same column sizes,

122
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.565
where we'll use the SM.

123
00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:31.204
Again, that's the column sizes.

124
00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:33.530
And this is gonna
be an example of if

125
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.530
we have a number
which doesn't total

126
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.260
12 feet have that is that we

127
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.020
end up with having the
first one being one column,

128
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.340
the second one being to,

129
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.765
the third one being three,

130
00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:46.265
the fourth one being for,

131
00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.830
then it just leaves
THE other two columns

132
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.330
blank because we don't have

133
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.950
any properties that are taking,

134
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.575
we don't have any
elements that are taking

135
00:05:54.575 --> 00:05:58.475
that space when we
resize it back down.

136
00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:01.130
Because it's gonna be
on the smaller screen.

137
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.795
It's going to end
up stacking them

138
00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:05.885
vertically instead of
setting them horizontally.

139
00:06:05.885 --> 00:06:08.315
It makes designing your grid

140
00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:11.060
easy and constructing the layout

141
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.280
for your webpage
that you can set

142
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.205
how it behaves on the
various screen sizes.

143
00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:21.470
Add in the different columns
to construct your page grid.

144
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.050
And you can be ready to
move on to the next lesson.
