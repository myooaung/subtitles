00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
this lesson.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.950
We're gonna be looking at the bootstrap motile,

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.450
and that's one of my favorite boots.

4
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.310
Dropped components.

5
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.490
I use it all the time.

6
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.260
I don't like the way that alerts look,

7
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.920
and Moto's provide us a nice,

8
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.320
easy,

9
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.820
clean way to communicate with the users.

10
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.620
So it's a little bit better than alerts,

11
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.180
and the users usually have to take CYP I've of action to either close it,

12
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.930
Uh oh,

13
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.470
are there's additional form information or something that gets submitted.

14
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.780
So this is just information boxes that pop up,

15
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.060
and they're relatively easy to set up.

16
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.520
An idea for the motel's is that usually there's a button or an event to launch the model.

17
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.460
You can launch the motives using JavaScript as well.

18
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.500
So there's an option down here with the bottom where you can select the mortal and you can

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.950
toggle the view of the motile,

20
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.130
so showing the mortal hiding the motile.

21
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.590
And there's also different ways different types of motives.

22
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.480
So there's are extra large motile.

23
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.840
There's a large motile,

24
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.730
and then there's the small motile.

25
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.080
And then there's the in between,

26
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.350
which is the regular mortal,

27
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.850
and these air all again adjusted via classes really easy to set up,

28
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.670
and as I said,

29
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.210
it provides a great way to communicate with your users to provide them some additional

30
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.690
information about what's happening within your website.

31
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.920
So in order to set up a motel so usually what first thing I like to do is I like to create

32
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.520
a way to trigger the motile.

33
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.630
So we just do a typical button and you can do it in any number of ways.

34
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390
And even with JavaScript,

35
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.750
you can trigger mortals to pop up,

36
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.400
and this is just a regular button button and we'll have a success button for this,

37
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.680
and I'll just say,

38
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.260
Click me and that will open up the mortal.

39
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.840
And we do need to apply some attributes in order to yet the mortal functionality.

40
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.010
So this is data toggle,

41
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.700
and the data toggle is gonna be for a mortal and then the other and,

42
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.120
of course,

43
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.160
most important one.

44
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.370
So these targets are the most important way to connect it because,

45
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.770
of course,

46
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.750
you can have more than one motile and connect it via the I D.

47
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.210
So use the hash and the idea that you're going to use in order to connect it to the motel.

48
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.550
So the bootstrap knows what you're trying to show and what elements should be showing up.

49
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.190
And then,

50
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.120
typically with the motels themselves,

51
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.050
you might have them at the bottom of the page.

52
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.900
I gotta add in the motile right down here,

53
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.750
way at the bottom.

54
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.250
So first will give it an I.

55
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.590
D.

56
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.710
So out of the main content.

57
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.990
So make sure that the I d matches with what you're trying to open,

58
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.190
and we also have to give it a class.

59
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.150
So a class of motile so that boots Trump knows this is a mortal.

60
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.540
So when I create that and because it's got a class of mortal,

61
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.680
it's not going to show up.

62
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.650
If I remove it,

63
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.280
then it does show up.

64
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.730
So make sure it has a class of mortal and that will hide the pop up motile.

65
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.110
And so now when you click it,

66
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.740
you're going to see the pop up mortal.

67
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.850
But it's not really formatted grade,

68
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.350
and there's doesn't seem to be any way to close it.

69
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.690
Eso This is something that we need to take care of,

70
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.340
and that's why it's important that you include all of these options within the model so you

71
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.610
can get it to run just by having the I d and the class of motile.

72
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.540
But as we saw,

73
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.400
it doesn't look great and there are some additional options that we can add in.

74
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.050
We can even add in how it's supposed to act so with the feed and how it's gonna show up.

75
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.640
So let's add in the additional classes,

76
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.740
so we'll create a class to wrap the content and this is called motile dialogue.

77
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.350
So we're going to wrap the motile pop up content with that,

78
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.280
so it's looking a little bit better.

79
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.490
At least it's center now,

80
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.930
but we still don't have a way to close the motor,

81
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.360
so we do definitely need a way to close the motel.

82
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.460
So we've got the motile dialogue so the content contained within here.

83
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.870
So this is essentially where we've got the motile content and that's the next class that we

84
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.970
need to apply is the motile dash content,

85
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.480
and this will indicate that this is part of the content of the motel.

86
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.660
I'll just slightly and then that.

87
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.620
So now we've got mawr of what looks like a model,

88
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.170
and we can actually click off it into the great out area and close the motel,

89
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.410
so it's looking a little bit better.

90
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.420
But of course,

91
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.670
always better to apply all of the styling,

92
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.490
and you can add in headers as well.

93
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.900
So that's contained within the motile content and give it a class of motile dash header

94
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.300
show you what that looks like.

95
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.330
So we click that we got the little header section,

96
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.220
more structure to the motel.

97
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.670
And then we've got the motile content,

98
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.950
and there's also the mortal body as well.

99
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.090
So this is where we would typically place the content.

100
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.790
So I give this one a class off motile body,

101
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.790
and we've got several layers for the motel at the end.

102
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.410
So it goes all the way down,

103
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.730
so there's a bunch of classes within other classes,

104
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.470
so everything is within content,

105
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.440
and then everything within the content there's a header.

106
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.670
There's a body option,

107
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.220
and that's the mean kind of area for the model was starting to look better and better,

108
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.060
and this is also responsive in the size it will always track to the middle.

109
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.540
So it's the really nice thing about motels they really present well for users and to

110
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.750
provide that information.

111
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.150
So the other thing that we want to add in is one away to close the mortal.

112
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.300
And we can put that within the motile header,

113
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.650
and this could just be a button.

114
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.390
And there's some styling that bootstrap allocates for it.

115
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.040
So type,

116
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.260
button and class,

117
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.900
and the class is close.

118
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.620
This is creating a close object and data dismiss and what we want to miss dismiss is the

119
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.120
motile and will do.

120
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.630
Ah,

121
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.340
span.

122
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.350
You can put an X here if you want,

123
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.130
or you could use the and times which looks a little bit better and has had to refresh it

124
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.370
there.

125
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.630
So there's the clothes.

126
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.110
So this is what users would typically be expecting.

127
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.490
They need a way to close the motile that's popping up.

128
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.520
So once they've read the message,

129
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.440
the action that they want to take you can also have multiple ways to close.

130
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.490
The motel SI can also have a button within the mortal,

131
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.530
so it may just copy this button and we'll make it look different,

132
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.700
so it's gonna be within the mortal body,

133
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.280
and this is just providing the users another way to close eso give it a class and it's not

134
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.480
gonna be class close to be a class button and then button whatever we want to give it color

135
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.470
and we'll get rid of the close and we'll just say close.

136
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.160
We got to see it again.

137
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.510
So there's are close button,

138
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.860
so this will take the same action where it's gonna close it.

139
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.390
So anything that's saying that Data dismissed motile,

140
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.840
it will dismiss the motile,

141
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.530
and that's going to apply to whatever mortal it's in.

142
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.350
So if you have a few mortals and I'll give this one motile too,

143
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.390
so that we have two different models and give up,

144
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.800
create recreate the button and I like this 1 to 2,

145
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.300
and this could be a warning and refresh so that opens that motile that one opens that

146
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.750
motile.

147
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.580
You can't have two at the same time,

148
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.540
but they are.

149
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.890
That's how you can have multiple models and a lot of cases you will have multiple models.

150
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:09.760
There's also with JavaScript so you can for those of you that want to script it,

151
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.870
and often times I do script with the mortals because there's some added functionality

152
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.620
that's good toe.

153
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.730
Have within the motels.

154
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:22.340
So if you do have some type of script where you've got another event listener and its

155
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.550
listing for event and you want to close the motile,

156
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:32.960
you can always select the motile object with J coury and whatever the motile I d is and

157
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.450
using the hash for the I d.

158
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.570
And then there's ah,

159
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:41.030
method called motile and you can toggle the motel or you could close it,

160
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.030
you could hide it or you could show the Moto.

161
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.920
So by default,

162
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.540
if you wanted to load the page and show the motel,

163
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.190
it would automatically show in the motel.

164
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.880
Also,

165
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.000
toggle will show it because it's hidden.

166
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.720
So if we load the page,

167
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.860
it's gonna show in the motel.

168
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.840
And this is how you can control the motile using bootstrap action.

169
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.080
There's also a way to have an event listener for the mortal,

170
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.390
So I'm gonna put it on the other motile So motile to is gonna have the event listener on it

171
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.180
and on,

172
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.980
