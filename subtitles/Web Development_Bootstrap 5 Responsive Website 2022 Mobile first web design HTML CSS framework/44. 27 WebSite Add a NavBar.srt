1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
this lesson is going to be a fun one,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,210
because we're going to be creating the navigation bar.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,460
So this is the core of most websites that you've got a navigation bar to help navigate your

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:16,140
users through the content and navigation in bootstrap is excellent because it give prides

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,420
you,

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:16,550
ah,

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,950
fully responsive navigation bar.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,980
And there's a lot of options when it comes to the navigation bar.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,100
I'm just over at the bootstrap website gives you more information,

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,150
but the navigation bar so you can set different collapse points.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,080
So that's got S M M D L G Excel,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,420
and these will collapse the navigation bar to the men ified bar that little hamburger icon

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,600
bar at various points.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,290
You also have full structure.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,150
You've also got the Nice nab,

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,930
our toddler icon that comes with boots.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,220
Drop now and then.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,870
You can create your section to have as much navigation this plot as you want.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:00,150
You also can set up navigation on left side and on the right side.

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,480
There's a lot of options when it comes to navigation,

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,980
also including the input fields as well.

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,420
Within the navigation bar,

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,410
there's a ton of different examples you can also have header text,

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,230
logo,

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,050
text branding,

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,500
text,

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,090
and there's various color schemes that are available so the typical boots drop background

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,170
colors as well as you can set the navigation bar,

29
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,940
which will automatically update the colors of the tax contained within it.

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,140
And the one that we're also using is gonna be the sticky top.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,610
And what sticky Top is going to do is it's gonna stick the navigation bar to the top,

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,250
and this is the one that we want because it's a single page website,

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,380
so we don't want users to always have to go to the top of the page to scroll themselves up

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,380
.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,400
We want it just to stick at the top.

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,660
So this is the one that we're going to be adding in.

37
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,440
And then there's the responsive behaviours where the nab our expanded the different break

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,510
points the toddler option to toggle the bar.

39
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,250
And then there's also the option here,

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,030
where they're demonstrating how you can have content on the left and content on the right

41
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,830
hand side within the navigation bar,

42
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,260
with a ton of different code examples.

43
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,820
And that's an example of how it's gonna look like once collapsed with the collapsed content

44
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,690
and the toggle icon as well.

45
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,700
So shrink back down there a peach,

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,020
and I'm gonna go into where we have the placeholder.

47
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,560
For now,

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,120
I got a place that default sticky top navigation bar So there's obviously nothing in the

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,530
navigation bar yet.

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,760
But if we are scrolling the page and I have to make this page smaller and you see that it's

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,780
staying at the top,

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,620
no matter where you stroll to,

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,150
it's always going to stay at the top.

54
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,050
So we're ready to add content to the navigation bar and also do some styling to it.

55
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,230
So if you don't like the default look of the background light,

56
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,000
you can update it to any one of the default primaries.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,190
So we've got.

58
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,140
And also,

59
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,520
if you switch the naff bar light to now bar dark,

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,200
you're going to see that the text color changes,

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,060
so make this a little bit bigger and we can get rid of some of the content that's contained

62
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,170
in here because we're gonna be building our own structure for the navigation bar.

63
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,570
So once we've set up the navigation tags,

64
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,590
give it a class of knave bar And that's going to indicate to the browser that this is a

65
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,050
navigation bar that we want to use and apply the appropriate classes.

66
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,060
There is one thing that I do want to know about the sticky top,

67
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,010
and there is a difference between fixed top and sticky taught.

68
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,410
That sticky top does use position sticky,

69
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,110
which isn't supported by every browser.

70
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,470
Up until that support is there,

71
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,730
I would suggest to use the fixed top class instead so that you get full cross browsers

72
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,250
support.

73
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,350
So let's make a quick update to fixed top,

74
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,350
and it's going to do the same thing where it's gonna specify,

75
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,800
and the only difference is that it moves the content down.

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,780
So if we're using fixed top,

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,230
we're gonna have to make an adjustment to the content.

78
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,850
So watch what happens when I do update this to be the fixed top.

79
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,250
We hide the first part of the content the navigation bar sticks on top of it,

80
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,080
so that's the disadvantage of having fixed top over the sticky top.

81
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,910
Whereas a sticky top is what it's designed for to push the content down slightly,

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,280
that option is available on sun available across all browsers quite yet.

83
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,350
So keep that in mind and update it to fix top,

84
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,550
and we're ready to continue to build the navigation bar.

85
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,650
So typical navigation,

86
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,000
Boris,

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,880
we've got the UN ordered list.

88
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,970
And then we've got all of our items that we have in the navigation bar as list items.

89
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,350
And there are classes for the navigation item.

90
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,290
So now item.

91
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,760
And there's also classes for the navigation item links,

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,390
so create a hyperlink.

93
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,940
And this is where we need to hyperlink to the various tags that we indicated in the

94
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,040
sections below.

95
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,160
So this could be home page and going to the splash,

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,270
which was that first header section that we had.

97
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,770
Let's also add in classes here,

98
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,270
so they do have default classes for links called knave link class.

99
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,670
And I'm gonna update this to nab or light.

100
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:25,370
You could just duplicate the list item for the other pages that you have with other

101
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,090
sections,

102
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,560
so specifying whatever the name of the section is to correspond to where the anchor is

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,190
going out.

104
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,790
So we also had the vote area,

105
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,380
we had projects,

106
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,930
and I'm just going to double check just to make sure that it is projects,

107
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,040
not project.

108
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,250
There was also the story i d.

109
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,150
And then lastly,

110
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,130
the contact.

111
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:52,310
And we need to also apply a class to the UN ordered lists to the wrapper off the list items

112
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,310
,

113
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,640
and this will indicate And as soon as I apply the class to it,

114
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,000
it's gonna be now bar naff is the class,

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,280
and right away you see that now they look like navigation items.

116
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,640
So there's the drop down for the navigation items.

117
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,330
As soon as you apply that,

118
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,860
there's also some automatic that we want to move right automatically.

119
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,610
So always put it to the right.

120
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,050
So that's some styling within bootstrap.

121
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,850
Now we want to indicate that this is gonna be collapsible content.

122
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,330
So let's create another rapper for that,

123
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,190
and that's going to wrap all of the content that you want to collapse in the navigation bar

124
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,190
.

125
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,830
So I'm going to wrap it with a div and give this one a class,

126
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:42,010
and the class is gonna be now bar collapse class and then also add in the collapse class to

127
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,200
it.

128
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,330
So it's gonna happen is it's gonna collapse the content.

129
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,750
But we haven't specified at what break point we want to collapse the content.

130
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,950
So that's where we need to go back up to the naff and specify the NAB our expand.

131
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,850
And I'm gonna use it on sm to expand on the S M.

132
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,460
So it's already taking shape that we've got a navigation bar and we do have the collapse,

133
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,300
but the collapse isn't showing.

134
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,120
And this is where we need to specify the I DS and collapse the content using the bootstrap

135
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
collapse format.

136
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,060
And this requires a button in order to have the collapse take place.

137
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,980
And this is the knave bar toddler class tight button and data caught Tuggle.

138
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,660
So you have to add in a bunch of attributes in order for the collapse to take place.

139
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,430
And by the way,

140
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,950
you also need to have your JavaScript,

141
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,710
Torri J Query libraries included,

142
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,770
and we need to specify the data target.

143
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,140
So this is probably one of the most single,

144
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,580
most important attributes here because we want to be able to select the navigation bar.

145
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,670
I'm gonna just call this knave one as the target,

146
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,850
and we have to given I d of now of one to the main rapper.

147
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,360
So that did that we created to go down to the DIV.

148
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,410
Give it an I D.

149
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,490
And this has to correspond with the I D that you want on your collapse bar and then within

150
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,800
the But you can have any type of character that you want,

151
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,170
and in this case,

152
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,970
Bootstrap does provide a default toddler icon that can be used.

153
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,180
And this is just a class of default toddler icon,

154
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,790
and it doesn't have to contain anything cause by default.

155
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,420
Bootstrap will add that in and before we try it,

156
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,830
this has to be have a hash in order to identify it as an I D.

157
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,120
So it's refresh,

158
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,710
and we're ready to try the Mugler.

159
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,310
Now.

160
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,350
When we shrink it down to the smaller size,

161
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,510
we get the button to toggle it.

162
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,310
You can also update this toe,

163
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,480
have different break points for the Togo bar to appear.

164
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,360
That's the medium size.

165
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,310
My preference is to keep it at the SM,

166
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,550
but you can have any break point that you want for the bar.

167
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,930
So coming up next,

168
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:00,210
we're gonna also introduce some items that we can add to the navigation bar on the right

169
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,930
hand side.

170
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,420
So typically you might see social media icons and I'll show you how to bring those into

171
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,770
your project coming up.

172
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,440
We're going to use fought awesome for that.
