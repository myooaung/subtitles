00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
this lesson.

2
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.910
We're gonna look at the knave component so novel.

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.610
Oftentimes it's associated with the navigation bar,

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.330
but you can also use other navigation within your page and such as here.

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.550
There's an example of another list here,

6
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.150
and they've got a bunch of links,

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.020
so these typically might not be the main navigation bar.

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.550
You might have another navigation bar at the top of the page,

9
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.740
and you've got some additional navigation that's included in your page.

10
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.090
And you can accomplish this with nab.

11
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.580
And there's another really interesting.

12
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.890
When you can do with knaves,

13
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.990
you can do it horizontal.

14
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.050
You can do it vertical and the nice one is with the tabs.

15
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.350
This is a really nice effect where you have a number of different tabs,

16
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.290
and you can also combine this with what we learned with the accordion and have the ability

17
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.870
to hide and show various pages,

18
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.220
depending on which one is selected.

19
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.370
So if you do something like home profile contact,

20
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.320
this is all self contained,

21
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.590
and it's loading the content accordingly.

22
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.690
So just as we saw with the Cordy in,

23
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.410
you can do the knave typically,

24
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.940
just as you do the accordion and you could include this on your page to provide additional

25
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.750
information for users.

26
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.490
And then we're also going to look at the navigation bar,

27
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.720
which is coming up in the next lesson.

28
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.460
And this is war of a common use for navigation.

29
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.630
So this lesson we're going to run through quickly what the other possibilities with knave

30
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.930
is,

31
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.340
and then eventually we're gonna transform the naff bar ist into the main navigation bar.

32
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.770
And there's a lot more options as well for that one because that one is obviously more

33
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.200
commonly used in just the naff and then create a bunch of list items and these will

34
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.900
eventually become our navigation tabs.

35
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.970
And so these typically for a navigation,

36
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.280
you're gonna have hyperlinks.

37
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.890
So they're gonna linked to particular page or something within the content as an anchor.

38
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.850
And this one could by default,

39
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.150
be the active one and then just duplicate that we need to add in the classes for it to have

40
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.170
the navigation effect otherwise is just regular HTML to transform this into a naff.

41
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.200
And so right away,

42
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.060
we see that it takes the horizontal format where it converts it to enough and then within

43
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.810
the list items we can add in a class of nav dash item,

44
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.410
and this will transform them into navigation items and now items.

45
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.610
And we don't see a whole lot of change quite yet.

46
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.550
There's also the class of nav link so naff dash link,

47
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.750
and I'll sit this one to be active.

48
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.040
And then I didn't the nav class to the other list item.

49
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.880
And also add in the class for this hyperlink and remove out active.

50
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.820
So starting to structure mawr like a navigation bar.

51
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.640
And then typically you'd have more than just two links.

52
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.150
Suit probably have three or even four links for the navigation bar,

53
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.720
and I'll just number them so that we can have distinguished between them.

54
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.660
You can also set the links suggests as we saw in the last lesson,

55
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.480
you can have disabled links,

56
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.770
so that could be applied to any link.

57
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.950
You could make them disabled,

58
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.830
and usually they're going to get this greed out muted color to them.

59
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.710
So what?

60
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.260
The naff?

61
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.850
There's number of styling options,

62
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.400
so there's now pills,

63
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.050
so they turn it into a pill format.

64
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.010
You can also do now fill,

65
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.870
so that fills the available space that you have for the navigation.

66
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.630
So even if we adjust so even if we just on the size,

67
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.350
it's still always gonna fill the available content.

68
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.510
So this one's got four of them,

69
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.450
so it's taking the available content that's there.

70
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.870
You can also do that now have tabs.

71
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.290
So that's always a really nice,

72
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.200
neat effect and creating another container for that.

73
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.440
Let's give it a class of knave and I'm gonna turn these into the nav tabs.

74
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.740
Eso create a few hyperlinks,

75
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.780
so you don't have to have mean containers for these.

76
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.410
Either weaken directly apply that classes right to the hyperlinks.

77
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.490
So this will just be a regular hyperlink and they're gonna add in a class.

78
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.620
And the class is of course,

79
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.450
it's gonna be nav item because we don't have any parent now items.

80
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.130
So just by applying that it's gonna transform it slightly.

81
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.130
And then also we wanted to add in the now link because these air links so you can combine

82
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.020
the classes that saves you the trouble of having the one that's wrapping it again.

83
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.250
It's up to you how you wanna handle that.

84
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.780
And so these could be linking two pages let me add in a few more,

85
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.220
and this will be linking to about this.

86
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.240
One will be linking to Contact Savella about element with the idea of contact and will add

87
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.860
those in after and let's transform them into naff pills.

88
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.780
So save as now pills.

89
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.240
And also I like the effective going the knave,

90
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.750
Phil.

91
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.840
So all the way across.

92
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.880
So we'll add those in as well.

93
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.290
And then just below this parent class,

94
00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.610
we cannot ended if and give it a class of tab content,

95
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.880
as this is where the content is going to sit,

96
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.550
that's going to be tabbed through.

97
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.430
I'll bring this up a bit.

98
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.700
So this is where we can add in the various pages and number of dips that will actually hold

99
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.900
the content to the 1st 1 It's gonna have a class of tab pain,

100
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.990
and then you can attach how it's gonna be handled so we can fade.

101
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.510
We can show you can also set it as active,

102
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.050
so active will open it,

103
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.820
and I can also have ah,

104
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.090
different background colors so set background of primary and we need to provide the I D.

105
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.740
So this one is just gonna be I d home to match with that first hyperlink there,

106
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.590
the first anchor and then I'll add in some content here and make it really big.

107
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.750
So display dosh for so home page.

108
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.010
Let's create a few other ones s.

109
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.100
We also had one that was linking to about and I'll update the color as well.

110
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.400
So warning.

111
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.370
And I'm going to remove the show and the active and this is the about peach.

112
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.080
Oh,

113
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.620
and we do have to add in one.

114
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.000
Were attributes here for the data toggle for it to actually work.

115
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.390
That's the important one.

116
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.500
That's why it's not working.

117
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.150
We need Teoh.

118
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
Add that in as an attribute,

119
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.920
and that will give us the ability to treat these as tabs.

120
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.250
That will toggle the data.

121
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.940
No,

122
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.650
Ive got home.

123
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.970
We've got about Let's add in that last one and this one was the contact and that,

124
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.380
of course,

125
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.960
you can put us much content as you want down here below.

126
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.450
I will make that one the danger so safe.

127
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.760
So now we do all of these taps and we can see how we can navigate through them and how they

128
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.800
change and I'll update Thies to be have tabs.

129
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.060
That was the other option.

130
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.150
So these air being displayed in a tab format is gonna cut that tabbing option,

131
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:55.940
and I'm gonna add in a margin top of five so that this content is distinct from the content

132
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.300
above.

133
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.320
And of course,

134
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.310
you can customize the styling and you could add more content as needed into each one of the

135
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.100
top pains.

136
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.370
So coming up next,

137
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.920
we're going to look at the now far,

138
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.720
so it's gonna be very similar to what we've covered.

139
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.250
There's gonna be flotsam or structure of changes and more attributes that we need to add in

140
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.600
and these are gonna be the one set can collapse.

141
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.050
So it's got that collapsible menu that you typically find within the navigation bars.

142
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.050
So you can see that within the main bootstrap a swell that when it collapses,

143
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.900
it's gonna collapse down to this collapsible menu and you can set different break points as

144
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.210
well.

145
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.200
So we're gonna check that out enough coming lesson
