1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,470
take what you've learned and you've witnessed most of the commonly used components and

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,390
bootstrap and how you can apply them into your project,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:14,800
even go over to draw I o or take a piece of paper and sketch out a website and create that

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,460
website from scratch using the various components that you used.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,070
So really challenge yourself and see what you can accomplish with boots.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,730
Drop start from a blank webpage and then build out at in.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,130
The components designed the grid first.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,760
So it's always the first step when you are creating your website to design the grid.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,090
So how it's laid out,

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,720
How many columns How many rows you're going to need for your basic website structure and

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,050
then go to Bootstrap for the various components that we've covered throughout the earlier

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,160
lessons and how they can fit in In order to accomplish the styling for the various website

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,950
design elements that you need,

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,230
We've covered quite a bit of functionality,

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,240
and there is really a lot of stuff that you can do and then once you've got your core

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,660
components in and you've got some of the styling in,

17
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,040
you can make adjustments going into the bootstrap utilities,

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,750
where you can update spacing,

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,020
sizing and,

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,450
of course,

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,000
all the different colors that are available in bootstrap and then really find,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,290
too,

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:23,790
in the look and feel of the website in order to complete the complete website design using

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,620
boots drop And as we've seen for the most part,

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:34,120
you can accomplish everything with just some attributes that are added into the elements as

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,370
well.

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,750
As,

28
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,230
of course,

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,350
the various boots dropped classes that provide the styling.

30
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,660
And if you do need to Adam customize styling,

31
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,110
you can always do it within the style.

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,500
Tags directly within your file,

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,710
or you can link out to your own style sheet.

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,900
So if you do want to customize the way that some of the content is being displayed,

35
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,940
and bootstrap might not have the option for you,

36
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,160
you can do that by applying the style tags as well.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,260
If you go over to the Boots Drop website,

38
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,880
there's a lot of documentation,

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,460
and it's well,

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,860
there's an example button.

41
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,580
So if you select the examples,

42
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,410
this would give you some of the commonly used types of styling that you need for building

43
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,170
websites.

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,530
So,

45
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,950
such as a sign in sticky footer,

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,870
sticky footer nav bar.

47
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,150
And then there's also some basic framework,

48
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,330
so you can take the basic starter template and select the source code for it on a browser

49
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,520
you can right click anywhere or within the deaf tools you can select from the right hand

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,300
side menu under more tools.

51
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,930
And from there you can select the deaf tools and that will open up the code editor.

52
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,070
Seek and inspect the code from that Web page,

53
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,590
so I usually just do a view page source and selecting the page source to have the page

54
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,490
source open.

55
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,260
You can select the HTML,

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,120
and it also includes all of the classes within the attributes to do a quick copy and paste

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,120
.

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,280
And that will be the quick way to get started in used the templates that they have on the

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,850
website.

60
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,700
And don't forget,

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,610
we also have some customized styling,

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,680
so we'll add that in as well in order to get the exact copy of what we see within the

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,320
example,

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,660
Web page select the starter template styling and noticed that they do have the padding at

65
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,470
the top because from our nap bar,

66
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,580
it's covering over the top content,

67
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,240
so they do have some customized styling.

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,350
So don't forget to include that as well.

69
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,480
If you are looking on the website for some of the examples and starter templates,

70
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,750
So now that I've set that up and I refresh it,

71
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,200
it moves the content down so that we can see the main content area.

72
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,730
We've got our nav bar,

73
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,800
and if we shrink it,

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,250
it shrinks nice and neatly so fully responsive and ready.

75
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,970
So try it the code and also try out the various components available on the bootstrap site

76
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,950
in order to get more familiar with what you can do with bootstrap.
