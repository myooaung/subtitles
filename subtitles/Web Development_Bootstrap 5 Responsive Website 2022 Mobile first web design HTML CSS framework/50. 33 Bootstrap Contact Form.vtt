00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
every website should have a way to get a hold off the person that has the website and this

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.720
is no different where we're gonna be setting up the contact US area of the website.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.090
Just a quick refresh and contact us.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.470
We haven't touched it yet,

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.310
and that's what we're going to do in this lesson.

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.810
We're gonna be looking at what Bootstrap has in the way of form fields,

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.120
how we can group forms together and how we can make a really nice looking form quickly and

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.670
easily.

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.220
So the information that we're gonna be gathering is gonna be the emailed field also having

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.350
a text area for a message if we want.

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.160
We can also just keep this as a regular input so we could have a number of inputs and then

12
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.240
these can be adjusted as needed.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.620
So you can have different types of inputs like the text area that input the email field and

14
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.010
so on.

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.420
We're gonna bring that into the project,

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.400
so go down to where we have our text or contact us.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.110
And again,

18
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.780
we want to make sure that the structure is going to be the same as what we saw within the

19
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.420
other ones.

20
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.320
We've got that our story.

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.050
And also,

22
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.450
we're going to do this one a little bit different because this one isn't gonna be the full

23
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.450
with the cross.

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.180
Where are gonna use the role and column of eight,

25
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.150
But we want to justify and we want to center that content.

26
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.100
So it's gonna be the big difference here for the contact area.

27
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.150
I'll slide this down to make some more space for this particular section.

28
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.010
Remember,

29
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.730
this is the contact us,

30
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.520
and add in the other gives there to close off that section.

31
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.220
So we just want a center,

32
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.110
the contact form.

33
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.910
We don't want to have any additional columns and update this to say contact us.

34
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.330
So what?

35
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.650
Apply some styling and contact form.

36
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.520
Just a placeholder for now.

37
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.670
So right now,

38
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.140
if I go over here and for this,

39
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.620
I have set of background color so I could see where the contact form is gonna sit.

40
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.210
So see,

41
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.220
it's still pulled over to the left hand side.

42
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.080
And that means that we need to adjust some of the styling just as we saw over here,

43
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.880
where if we didn't want to go the full with,

44
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.750
We could set using the Flex center so that justify center of the column contents.

45
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.390
So let's add that in,

46
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.540
and that should shift it to the center.

47
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.860
That's the same class that we used earlier.

48
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.080
And actually this needs to go into the world.

49
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.970
So that centered that content.

50
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.280
I'm just adding some spacers so we can scroll the contact form up so it's more center for

51
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.840
you as we're creating it.

52
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.390
We're going to get rid of that after,

53
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.450
so that's not part of what we're building.

54
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.340
So going into the forms,

55
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.680
just as we typically would.

56
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.850
So now that our form is nascent centered and probably doing eight is a little bit better,

57
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.150
we're gonna have eight columns across,

58
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.200
and the content is centered using the justify content center class.

59
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.110
I'm also gonna add in a spot that if we are using JavaScript,

60
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.700
we can add our success content to and then this could be dynamically populated using

61
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.750
JavaScript so I could say maybe thank you or something like that.

62
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.750
I'm also going to get rid of the background because we don't need that.

63
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.170
So this is actually going to be something that we're going to use with JavaScript if we

64
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.510
want.

65
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.010
So it's just a placeholder for applying some messages.

66
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.950
So once the form gets submitted,

67
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.870
we can hide.

68
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.150
We can show various classes and then using the four tag set up the form and within the form

69
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.150
,

70
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.170
we're gonna have some structure with bootstrap to set up a class and using form a group

71
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.790
class,

72
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.070
it's going to be an input group.

73
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.910
So this will group all of the inputs together and we've got the inputs type equals text and

74
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.710
give it a name.

75
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.670
And we're gonna collect the name of the person and class form control.

76
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.380
So give it that bootstrap styling for the form and play soldiers regular html.

77
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.180
And this should actually be placeholder.

78
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.280
So we've got the form area and we can also use pre penned in order to add.

79
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.980
Some were styling to the forms and on the boots trot site.

80
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.640
You can see some examples on how the pre penned is being used and we've already got fought

81
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.640
.

82
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.130
Awesome added in.

83
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.270
And the pretend is something like this where you've got this at symbol within the input

84
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.700
field.

85
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.890
So we've got input.

86
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.160
Group pre penned the content that were pre pending and then we've got the whole input group

87
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.280
gathered together.

88
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.930
So it's the same thing that we want to do for that input group and for our fields where

89
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.280
we've got the contact us.

90
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.860
So we want to use some of the fought awesome icons in order to odd to the input area.

91
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.520
So set up the input group.

92
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.970
We already have that whole input group Forum Group Input Group.

93
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.570
Together they're using a diff and class and input group.

94
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.000
Pre penned is the class that we want to use,

95
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.980
and then we need to specify what it is that we want to pretend with so class.

96
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.200
And I want to input group text as it's going to treat the thought awesome as text.

97
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.880
And then whatever the thought awesome icon is that you want to use already got one that I'm

98
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.470
going to use.

99
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.820
So I'm gonna simply dropped that one in,

100
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.200
and you see that it shows up now on the on the form pretended.

101
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.120
That's all you have to do as it's all contained within the input group and then the form

102
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.040
input group.

103
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.430
And that's how you can add a number of inputs So I'm gonna copy that structure and we'll

104
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.240
update them as we go through.

105
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.660
So of course we don't wanna ask only name eso.

106
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.210
The classes are all the same,

107
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.550
and you'll find that with boots drop,

108
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.900
there's a lot of repeat.

109
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.280
So once you create one kind of chunk of classes and elements that you like,

110
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.590
you can reuse it,

111
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.850
and this one is going to be for email.

112
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.300
So it's gonna be on envelope open,

113
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.300
and the name for this one is going to be email,

114
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.880
and you could just update that.

115
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.440
And this way we can really easily build out of form.

116
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.600
So whatever a number of fields we want to ask,

117
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.250
that's all available here.

118
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.000
And also you might want to ask a subject so we can copy the structure once again,

119
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.770
and everything is the same.

120
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.810
One update the fought awesome icon,

121
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.520
of course.

122
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.150
And as you're copying and pasting,

123
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.720
just make sure that you are doing it properly,

124
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.970
so this can be the subject.

125
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.620
So the name is subject and placeholder is subject to make sure you update the attributes

126
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.290
accordingly.

127
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.530
And then also let's do one where we've got a text area so again structure is always very

128
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.160
similar.

129
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.080
It's using the same structure of the classes,

130
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.150
so you've got input form group Input group as the main container.

131
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.190
There's also for the input group pre penned,

132
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.950
and this is gonna be a comments will update the input type to text field,

133
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.430
but we can also pre penned these as well the text area.

134
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.750
So update the tag here to text area and we also need a closing text area.

135
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:10.120
I will update the other attributes as well for text area and for the name it can be message

136
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.120
.

137
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.130
The class is the seam says still,

138
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.470
four of control placeholder works in the text area of the same and with text area,

139
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.240
you can specify the number of columns.

140
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.100
So if you want to 30 columns,

141
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.740
you can also specify the number of rows to make.

142
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.210
That bigger is essentially that's our form and then lastly for form,

143
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.490
you need a buttons again,

144
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.680
using a diff in order to contain the class content and using form group.

145
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.020
And there's nothing that's gonna be pretended here,

146
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.090
so we don't have to have an input group were just using the form group,

147
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.400
and this is an input type.

148
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.500
You could also use Ah,

149
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.920
button,

150
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.750
just a regular button or any element because we're applying the styling as button style.

151
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.830
So this is submit and with submit type on a form,

152
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.770
it's gonna have some default action to it.

153
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:06.010
And this is all just regular HTML adding in a class so class button and button primary.

154
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.900
And also to get the button to go all the way across,

155
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.450
you can use button block,

156
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:16.280
so it's an option with buttons and you can update the value to be sent.

157
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.570
Those take a look at the form and once we've got all of that content,

158
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.250
as we want on the form,

159
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.370
we're ready to move on to the next part.

160
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.020
This is that 80%.

161
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.000
So it 100%.

162
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.550
This is what the form is gonna look like.

163
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.240
Big sure that it re sizes and scales as you want,

164
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.120
and we're ready to move on to the last part where we're gonna be taking care of the footer

165
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.080
section of our website that's coming up next
