1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,730
breadcrumbs in bootstrap as well Azzan websites.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,550
They provide us away back of navigational hierarchy.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,510
So you'll see these,

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,010
typically at the top of the page,

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,380
where you've got your navigation.

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,070
And if you've gone in several folders deep,

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,540
you might see something with the bootstrap breadcrumbs being presented.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,650
All the different folders that you are in so you'd be in home and then home is parent to

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,760
library and libraries,

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,010
parent to data and then within data.

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,030
You might have some additional options as well,

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,450
and the breadcrumbs are done within an a nordeste in providing within the navigation.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,190
You can also do separators within the BET breadcrumbs so you can do this kind of quote

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,950
separator,

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,980
and that provides all the different options for separating the breadcrumbs.

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,130
So this is a relatively easy one.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,350
It would be just a quick lesson on how to use those and how to implement it.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,210
So let's set up for breadcrumb,

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,160
and it'll be three layers deep,

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,590
so contained within the knave,

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,540
and you should also always include the area labels.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,210
I'm not gonna do that within this lesson,

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,000
but adding in the area labels air good for accessibility,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,880
so that main container is the bread from class and that's an ordered list.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,050
And then within the ordered list,

26
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,410
you're gonna have a set of list items,

27
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,940
and each one of these list items can have a class of breadcrumb item.

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,730
And then these air usually typically hyperlinks.

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,650
So this would allow that user to easily navigate back to whatever page that came from.

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,810
Let's do home as well.

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,340
Maybe this is main,

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,820
and this could be multiple levels deep,

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,710
depending on how complex your website is.

34
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,320
Of course,

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,010
in the last one,

36
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,830
we're just gonna ply active to it so that we know that this is the active breadcrumb.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,400
So it's still breadcrumb item,

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,370
but it's got the active class to it and also add in the area label and give this a label of

39
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,910
breadcrumb because this is part of the navigation,

40
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,490
so it should be included
