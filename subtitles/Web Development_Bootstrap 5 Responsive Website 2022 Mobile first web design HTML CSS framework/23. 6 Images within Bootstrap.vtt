00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490
this lesson.

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.050
We're gonna look at images with bootstrap pan,

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.620
just different ways of styling,

4
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.340
those images making them responsive.

5
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.840
We need an image down here at the bottom,

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.510
so just beside to the left of it,

7
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.500
we've got an image I'm using.

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.250
Placeholder dot com services.

9
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.400
A nice place to get some images if you need.

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.990
In that image is exactly the same height and width,

11
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.900
so the dimensions are identical.

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.060
And when just post him image like that,

13
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.620
you're going to see that it doesn't fit quite exactly.

14
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.330
And obviously it's not responsive.

15
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.050
So we want this image to be nice and responsive and fit into that spot,

16
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.260
Mace and neatly.

17
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.390
Let's go back into the bootstrap website and within.

18
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.620
So they do have an option to make images responsive,

19
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.160
and that's contained under content images.

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.780
And all you have to do is add the class of image fluid to your image,

21
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.540
and it will make it responses.

22
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.790
Watch what happens when I add this class,

23
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.310
and you see that it automatically slots it in into the appropriate role.

24
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.100
Call them there,

25
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.680
and then there's also a bunch of other options for images.

26
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.850
We're not going to be taking a look at those because this is kind of all we need really

27
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.970
needed for the image.

28
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.490
We just needed to have an image there.

29
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.420
Next.

30
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.670
Let's look at the columns and add in the title for this part,

31
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.990
and we already have a title.

32
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.820
So I'm gonna just copy and paste that and we're using the H force for the title.

33
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.680
You might want to use something different,

34
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.390
of course,

35
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.430
and then also want to wrap it,

36
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.990
wrapped the content within a paragraph and go back and see that it's a title to so trying

37
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.920
to make it look as much like this as possible.

38
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.590
Also,

39
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.720
there's some spacing underneath the title to so we can add in a margin bottom and do

40
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.990
merchant bottom of five.

41
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.050
It looks like there's quite a bit of spacing.

42
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.600
We could also do a margin top on the next element.

43
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.780
So for the paragraph,

44
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.750
we could do a margin top for that one as well.

45
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.250
So just do it quick save and there's our chunk of content on a get rid of some of this,

46
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.750
but we did have a little bit too much there,

47
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.550
so going back into what the layout was also notices well,

48
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.440
that there is padding between the different rows,

49
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.780
so we need to add in some padding for the Rose as well.

50
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.740
So we could do We're emergen top off four and allowed that in for all of the roads because

51
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.640
we have some consistency on that styling.

52
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.810
So going back down and this part looks correct.

53
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.400
So the last part was just the list item.

54
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.050
So it has also a title so we can use the same title format before the list group.

55
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.170
And this one doesn't have quite as much spacing.

56
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.540
So it's cut that down and we'll type it out as Title three and then structuring the content

57
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.690
that's contained in there.

58
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.070
So these are all the same.

59
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.880
They just contain some development default text for the development.

60
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.730
So we've got the title three.

61
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.450
The list group and all of these list items are the same,

62
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.230
and I gotta just clean up a bootstrap eso.

63
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.350
Let's refresh and see what our website looks like.

64
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.940
And,

65
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.640
of course,

66
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.180
probably some minor tweaks adjustments that still need to be made.

67
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.430
Let's zoom in.

68
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.840
We see we roughly got the same structure and layout as was presented within the example

69
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.750
that we created.

70
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.980
And that's how you can use bootstrap Teoh,

71
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.550
create websites really rapidly and quickly.

72
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.540
And of course,

73
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.840
it's important to understand all the different available components and how to use the

74
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.310
utilities in order to make adjustments to where the positioning of the various assets are

75
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.360
within the elements.

76
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.260
And we're gonna be going over these as we go through the upcoming lessons.
