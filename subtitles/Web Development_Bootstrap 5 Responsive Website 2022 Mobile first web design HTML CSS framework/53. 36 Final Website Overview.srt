1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
this lesson is gonna be a quick overview of all of the content that we've covered earlier

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,960
and greet Joel on making it through this section.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,060
I know we've gone through quite a bit of stuff with bootstrap,

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,230
and you can always mix and match components and bootstraps.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,830
So if you find that some of the stuff on our in the early lessons might not be relevant to

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,250
how you want to put content,

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,140
there's a ton of information that get bootstrap dot com.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,010
You can go to get started and then under the components.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,840
That list said all of these components,

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,080
and these are all from commonly used components that you might have within the website.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,600
And so adding all of these is really easy.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,450
They also have all of the sample codes and just different ways to add that in.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,130
There's also under the utilities.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,250
So if you don't like the colors that I've used,

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,790
you can update the various colors as well as add in some padding and update how that looks

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,060
so.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,560
The colors are all laid out under the utilities colors,

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,550
and they've got all of the different default colors and the nice thing about the color

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,310
scheme and bootstrap is that if you get a different color scheme,

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,230
it will update the primary secondary success,

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,790
danger,

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,960
warning and info.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,370
And that's why it's really nice to use the boots drop classes because if you ever changed

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,660
the colors of your website scheme,

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,160
it's gonna be really easy to do if you've coded it all with the right classes.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,070
So make any adjustments and tweaks that you want.

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,170
And,

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,530
of course,

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,450
you probably want change that place older images because that's rather ugly.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,160
But they are just to serve as placeholders for the content that you might potentially be

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,720
adding on to your project.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,300
So make sure that everything is as needed and you're ready to publish your website.

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,290
And we've gone over the most commonly used components.

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,330
Applied some customized styling where we had some spacers to take care of the navigation

35
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,220
issue that when we're using the fixed top navigation bar,

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,630
is going to stick it to the tops.

37
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,060
It doesn't work exactly as a sticky top does,

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,100
where the content has pushed down slightly,

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,980
and that's one of the disadvantages.

40
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,280
So some of the browsers still aren't up to date for sticky eso.

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,960
In the meantime,

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,020
you can use fix top.

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,790
And if you are watching this video in a few years,

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,120
you're able to use this sticky,

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,880
and you don't have to worry about all of the spacers s.

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,880
So this is how you would customized and add in different classes that you can use,

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,270
of course,

48
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,100
within the bootstrap and setting up the splash as a background.

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,670
So there are no default classes and bootstrapping toe handle that,

50
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,510
so that so we had to set up the cover and do that separately.

51
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,420
So navigation is always key to any website,

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,750
and because this was a single page website,

53
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,770
the boots top navigation bar is perfect because it collapses and users always have access

54
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,360
to get to the very sections of the website just by clicking the navigation bar.

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
And that's what we do have.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,450
It's sticky at the top.

57
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,190
We have our splash area,

58
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,290
so this is meant as kind of that place wherever the user lands on your website to have a

59
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,690
really nice imagery in the background to get the users excited about your Web content,

60
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,310
give a quick introduction to what this website is about than that boat section.

61
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,910
And this is where you can highlight some of the content that you have some of the more

62
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,040
outstanding things,

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,490
maybe some products that you sell,

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,050
services that you sell and so on.

65
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,650
This is example of how it can be highlighted and output.

66
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,610
We went onto the projects.

67
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,940
This is a kind of a showcase area where you can showcase different projects.

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,380
If you got a portfolio,

69
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,580
you can showcase that portfolio here as well,

70
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,100
and then the IRS story.

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,110
So this gave us an opportunity to use the carousel,

72
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,060
the sideshow.

73
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,880
And this is a really neat component in bootstrapping,

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,320
another commonly used one,

75
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,930
and we saw how easy it is to apply that.

76
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,700
And just by using a bunch of images and bootstrap classes,

77
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,340
we could structure that slide slider really easily.

78
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,670
The contact form.

79
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,570
So bootstrap once again provided us a nice,

80
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,900
neat way to layout,

81
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,660
input fields and text areas to produce a form and,

82
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,210
of course,

83
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,140
buttons and boots drop always really nice and appealing.

84
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,700
We also added the pre penned were using the font awesome icons as we order.

85
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,640
He brought them in for the social media,

86
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,110
so why not bring them into the rest of your project.

87
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,790
And that's one of the nice things about fought.

88
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,560
Awesome is,

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,820
once you start using it,

90
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,360
you're going to realize how awesome and how many amazing icons they have so literally can

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,830
spruce up your website easily with font.

92
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,350
Awesome.

93
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,110
If you have any questions or comments,

94
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,990
I'm always happy to help.

95
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,120
But I always love to hear from you.

96
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,260
Hope you had fun and hope you've enjoyed creating your Web site.
