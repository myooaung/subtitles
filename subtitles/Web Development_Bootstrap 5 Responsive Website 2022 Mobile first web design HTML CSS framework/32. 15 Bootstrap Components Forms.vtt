00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
this list.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.640
So we're gonna be looking at forms and input groups with bootstrap classes and almost every

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.130
website.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.610
You're going to need some type of form,

5
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.790
some type of input for users to add information.

6
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.230
And bootstrap provides a nice way to output that content to present it to the user so you

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.670
can do everything you can with HTML.

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.170
Typically,

9
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.100
HTML forms,

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.250
and there's the bootstrap styling that goes along with it.

11
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.970
So makes a form inputs more readable,

12
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.860
where it's got the border around it and some nice styling.

13
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.240
You can also update kind of have that read on Lee Effect for the text on the input fields

14
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.490
and disable the input of the field.

15
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.250
There's the password field,

16
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.350
so these are all just typical what you would see within HTML.

17
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.850
There's also the check boxes and Reto bought buttons.

18
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.720
We saw just different ways to present the radio buttons earlier when we were looking at the

19
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.700
button groups.

20
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.640
That was a nice way that we can style the radio buttons,

21
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.700
and then overall,

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.050
it's just trying to keep everything within the same structure.

23
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.340
So here's something where you might typically have for a user to sign in and some

24
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.210
information,

25
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.480
and this is done within the grid structure.

26
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.730
So it's done within the form roll and then using the same columns that we had.

27
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.250
So 12 column structure in using six and six and then this one is just a full column

28
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.950
structure,

29
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.680
and this again is using the full column,

30
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.670
so there's no indication that we're breaking any of the rose.

31
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.570
It's just taken the whole form group that's available for it.

32
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.490
There's also ways to do the horizontal form,

33
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.010
so this is again using the bootstrap grid structure,

34
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.140
and we're applying the classes accordingly to make the grid structure and having the labels

35
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.220
on the left hand side.

36
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.570
So they're taking up two columns and whereas the input is taking up 10 and this is gonna

37
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.950
break on S M.

38
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.750
So it will stock on the really small screens that you don't wanna have too much space taken

39
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.670
up with the label,

40
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.370
and you might want to have the email or the label on top of the input field.

41
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.180
That's what those ones are.

42
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.810
The options.

43
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.810
There's also how to have big labeling column auto sizing,

44
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.140
and there's really a time of stuff that you can do with forms with input groups gives you

45
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.160
the option to combine content together as an input group,

46
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.730
so they allow you to have texts.

47
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.260
Button boot button groups and on either side have these textual inputs.

48
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.920
So that's what you see here,

49
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.270
where it's an input group,

50
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.280
so it's an input,

51
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520
but it's got some text that's attached to it,

52
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.150
so it looks like it's still within the one input.

53
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.420
But the text is attached in this kind of agree area,

54
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.720
and that's where we've got the input group.

55
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.620
I see.

56
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.400
Create an input group and pretend it and add in whatever text you want.

57
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.360
Textual content.

58
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.880
You want characters and then have the whole input,

59
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.350
and that way it will display it this nice and neatly within the one element.

60
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.020
There's also the different sizing and multiple inputs and everything really have sizing.

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.940
There's button add ons and button drop downs.

62
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.010
We did look a button and drop downs in the last one,

63
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.330
so there's that drop down menu that we saw last time and then the input fields having these

64
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.400
input groups.

65
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.450
This one has pretended content,

66
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.940
but it's also got upended content to the group.

67
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.230
So let's at the end.

68
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.340
So pre penned is at the start happened.

69
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.140
Is that the end?

70
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.700
You can use both.

71
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.060
You can have multiple items appended as well.

72
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.710
So see and build out a typical billing form that you might have on your website.

73
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.230
So we're gonna do it using the bootstrap grid structure and start with the main container.

74
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.730
Let's create the form,

75
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.950
and that's just gonna be inside the main container.

76
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.120
And then within here we're gonna use variations of Rose.

77
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.120
You also have an option for the former role for the grid.

78
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.220
And the difference is that the standard grid overrides the default column.

79
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.700
Gunners on git provides a little bit of a tighter output and more compact Leo.

80
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.110
It's and that's the form role class.

81
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.310
So they can you be used interchangeably.

82
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.790
So setting up a div and giving it a class of roe and also show you what the difference

83
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.500
between the form role is gonna be.

84
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.050
And that means that we've got class off,

85
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.470
call him and then within the column.

86
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.600
This is where we can start adding the inputs.

87
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.250
We also want toe probably have a title for our input for and I'll give this one a class of

88
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.130
display.

89
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.020
Dash three.

90
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.200
That's nice and big,

91
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.460
and we'll call it building in full.

92
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.950
And within this role,

93
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.000
I will ask the users name,

94
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.820
So give you a label and we'll call it for name.

95
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.990
So I just asked for the user's name.

96
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.960
It could be also first name or last name,

97
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.070
so we'll call it F name.

98
00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.550
So the first name of the user and we'll do the same one for the last name.

99
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.320
So creating an input type is gonna be text class is form control.

100
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.960
And that adds the bootstrap styling to the form I D.

101
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.210
Is gonna just be f name.

102
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.030
So the first name and then will do one l name for the last name,

103
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.620
and that's gonna break on the medium science.

104
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.150
And I try that with the last name as,

105
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.480
well,

106
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.670
an update.

107
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.290
Now when we shrink it down,

108
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.980
we'll see that it's stacks once it gets to the smaller screens.

109
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.410
And that's probably what ideally,

110
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.970
what we want,

111
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.040
because we don't want to cram too many columns because this is important for the user to be

112
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.560
able to fill out this information.

113
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.480
There's also the form role and also do one for the road so you could see that there is a

114
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.930
slight difference in some of the spacing is not a whole lot just a little bit of difference

115
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.580
between the row in the formal as it in dense and creates additional gutter columns.

116
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.750
So it depends on which one you want to use.

117
00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.550
We can use the form role and they are also interchangeable and they work the same way.

118
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.060
So the concept is always going to be the same.

119
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.000
So next one,

120
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.200
we might want just full with where we're asking for a user name and this is gonna be

121
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.190
another input.

122
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.180
And we also have a label for this one.

123
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.310
So just copy that from the above.

124
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.550
And this is the user name and type text and also update the I D to be user name.

125
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.140
And we'll do this one as an input groups so that we have something different and will

126
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.550
provide a div to wrap around it and a class of input group and make sure that the input is

127
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.780
inside of this parent container.

128
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.790
And then whatever you want to pre penned,

129
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.610
attach the input group pre penned class,

130
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.820
and this will pretend the contents in front of the input field.

131
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:54.510
And we're going to just do the at symbol and add in a span with a class of input.

132
00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:00.340
Group text was This is a text item that were adding in the input group and that should

133
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.210
actually be class.

134
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.940
So that adds that symbol inside of the input group.

135
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.500
Also,

136
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.470
let's add in our check out button so I could be at the very bottom and this will be class B

137
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.150
TN BT end.

138
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.300
So have a green button en btm,

139
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.190
LG and B T en bloc.

140
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.810
So it goes all the way across so their users can't miss the Spartan,

141
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.700
and this will be to submit the information also to make it look nice.

142
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.150
You'll often find the horizontal rule and then some classes attached to it and a lot in a

143
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:39.370
margin bottom of five for the HR and also going to do that under the billing information

144
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.170
and let's do one more group of inputs.

145
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.950
This could be a world because we have multiple inputs,

146
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:51.590
will have some drop downs here and give this one a class of column M d and we'll do five

147
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.900
and then add in the label and four.

148
00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:01.360
So maybe this could be for country and then select drop down class and these ones have a

149
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.620
class of custom.

150
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.310
Select.

151
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:09.050
And then we might have some options to choose various countries in the drop down.

152
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.070
And let's do another drop down,

153
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.730
and this one will do the state,

154
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.250
and we'll update the select information to be state.

155
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.180
So again,

156
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.000
it's still custom Select,

157
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.490
and the I d is state and the i d for this one is gonna be country,

158
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.060
so that matches the label.

159
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.650
And then,

160
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.090
lastly,

161
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.140
we might have another input field for the zip code.

162
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:40.320
So around that up and close that off that three and apply a label to that four zip,

163
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.220
and that's gonna require the ZIP code.

164
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.420
And this is just a regular input.

165
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.070
And in order to get the bootstrap styling,

166
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.730
don't forget.

167
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.850
We need to add the class of form control in order to get the styling on the input,

168
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:58.000
and that's going to make it the same size as the drop downs as the other inputs.

169
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.050
And some of these you might want to add some padding the margin top for so there's some

170
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.220
spacing between it.

171
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.540
It's all depends on how you want to customize and when you shrink it down,

172
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.770
whenever you're building the form,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.400

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.750
the form of stacking as you intended to be.
