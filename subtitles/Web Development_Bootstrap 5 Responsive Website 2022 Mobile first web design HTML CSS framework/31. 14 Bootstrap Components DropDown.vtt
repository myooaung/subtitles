00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
There's gonna be a quick lesson on drop downs and drop downs.

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.310
Provide us an option.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.820
Teoh.

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.910
Provide more information on the drop down to providing a menu.

5
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.310
And if we've got a button where we've got possible alternative actions and we were

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.640
presented to the user,

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.150
that's what drop downs can do.

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.850
And of course,

9
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.440
you can use the different button colors to make your things come more toe life.

10
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.550
There's also the button split where you can have the splitter in the merits.

11
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.550
That's the drop down divider.

12
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
So adding that class and there's also the sizing,

13
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.830
So the same with the buttons.

14
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.190
Still the same sizing,

15
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.200
so that Bt en large Bt and Smalls to have the different sizing your seven option and so

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.950
dropped down you could drop up.

17
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.320
This isn't very used very often,

18
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.170
but there are some cases where you might want to present the content this way.

19
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.620
If depending on how your layout is,

20
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.810
you could also adopt to the right drop to the left and again,

21
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.310
I don't see these being used very often,

22
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.170
but of course it is an option within the menu.

23
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.280
You can have it all opened so that there's no drop down.

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.830
You can also set one too active set,

25
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.550
12 disabled and then also customize the alignment.

26
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.420
And there's a responsive alignment as well.

27
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.320
So left,

28
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.840
aligned on large screens.

29
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.700
So again,

30
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.710
this is another option.

31
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.540
There's quite a few with the drop downs,

32
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.710
but mainly what we're gonna be looking at is just a basic drop down and then applying some

33
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.650
colors and also adding in the divider for those.

34
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.050
So let's open the editor and we'll check out what we can do with the drop downs.

35
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.910
So first we need to create apparent element,

36
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.150
and that's just gonna be a diff Give it a class and the class is dropped down,

37
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.330
and then the contents within here is what's going to get dropped down.

38
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.930
So typically you'd have,

39
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.220
ah,

40
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.310
button or something like that to create the drop down action.

41
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.000
So this is something that the user takes an action,

42
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.370
and it's kind of similar to what we thought of when we were doing the accordion.

43
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.950
So do Primary Button.

44
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.850
It's a primary button color,

45
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.930
more options,

46
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.790
and then we'll add in the attributes.

47
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:14.240
So the tape is button and the I D is gonna be D D one and the data toggle attributes is

48
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.020
gonna indicate that it's a drop down.

49
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.450
Now it's ready to attach the drop down action.

50
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.070
And that's where we've got a div with the contents that we have for the drop down.

51
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:33.140
Give this one a list of drop down menu so that the content contained within it is going to

52
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.320
be associated us the drop down menu.

53
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.140
And then here you can have a number of hyperlinks that are going to number different sites

54
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.750
and have the action of drop down item and this world created as a drop down item.

55
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.180
It's no When you click this,

56
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.560
it's gonna open up the different items,

57
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.950
and I didn't have any content in there,

58
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.190
So this would be website one.

59
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.990
Close,

60
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.470
open,

61
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.080
close.

62
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.080
We can have a bunch of items if we want.

63
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.760
As long as everything is contained within the parent,

64
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.550
drop down bootstraps going to know what to do with these.

65
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.860
There is also options to add in the divider,

66
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.850
so if you've got quite a bit that you're doing within the drop down,

67
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.990
you can always add in these dividers and drop down.

68
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.580
It's called a class of drop down divider.

69
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.150
You don't have to have any content within this element as this is a default.

70
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.160
Just a styling addition and then with these use,

71
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.650
have the same options as we saw with the buttons where you've got the large buttons,

72
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.720
that small buttons,

73
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.840
you can have all the different button colors as well,

74
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.250
and that's how you can set up a drop down and typically done within a navigation menu.
