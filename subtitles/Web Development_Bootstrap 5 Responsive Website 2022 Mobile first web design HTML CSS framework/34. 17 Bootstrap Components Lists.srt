1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
this lesson,

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,550
we're gonna be looking at list groups,

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,330
and what list groups do is they allow us to contain a series of content that belongs

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:07,880
together.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,250
So,

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,900
just as we would with each to Mel lists same idea.

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,880
And it just applies the boots.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,740
Drop styling,

9
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,660
using the risk group class for the main container and then for the list items.

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,710
It's the list group item so that provides that bootstrap styling.

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,030
You can also update and add the active class and just says we've seen before.

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,640
The active class will highlight that particular element that has the active applied to it.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,680
There's also an option to disable it.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,780
You can also add in the links,

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,070
so there's what's called the list group item action and that creates this hover effect

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,450
Wherever you hover over it.

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,990
It darkens slightly,

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,380
so it provides a clickable link area that's active whenever the users hovering over it.

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,850
There's a number of options,

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,110
and you can also list your group.

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,210
You can do a list group horizontal as well.

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,290
And then there's various sizes for the list groups that you can add in and to really

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,750
customize the way you want your list being displayed.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,450
So I'm just gonna be using the main container,

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,760
and I'm going to give this container a particular with.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,360
So we create another element.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,990
And with inside here,

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,520
as normally,

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,730
you don't have the list going all the way across,

30
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,750
So this will give it a width of 50%.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,110
So using the bootstrap utility class of W dash,

32
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,050
whatever percentage you wanna go across,

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,330
this is how you can contain a list and most the time.

34
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,540
If you do have a list,

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,330
you're not gonna have it going all the way across anyway.

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,850
So it's create the A Norden list and add in the list group class.

37
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,460
So this will indicate that we want the boots drop,

38
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,620
styling applied,

39
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,960
and then the list items and each one of the list items would have a list dash group stash

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,930
item class.

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,220
So that will turn it into a list item.

42
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,120
And then you might have some content here.

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,440
So whatever you've got contained within the list group,

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,420
so that's the list group and displays it as ah list.

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,880
You can also update this toe on ordered list or ordered list,

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,190
so it actually doesn't matter because the bootstrap is taken care of,

47
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,650
the way it's being styled.

48
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,970
This can also be a div wrapped with a bunch of dips in sight and still going to display it

49
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,660
the same way,

50
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,120
so it doesn't actually have to be list items.

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,980
But for consistency sake,

52
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,860
and especially when you're looking through your source code,

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,520
it makes a lot more sense when you grouping content structurally within your bootstrap as a

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,050
list when you're using the list group.

55
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,430
So it just makes sense to do it as a list group,

56
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,650
although you don't have to.

57
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,140
So let's update this and add in the active class to it and you can see it defaults it.

58
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,590
So it's the blue highlight.

59
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,290
By default,

60
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,890
I'm gonna duplicate,

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,970
thes and add in the links as well.

62
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,330
So go all the Web sites all the way up to 78 so that should give us a good sampling of a

63
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,980
number of different list items.

64
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,600
So we wanted to add in ah hyperlink.

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,230
So let's add in hyperlink here and then the content of this link will contain the website

66
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:18,000
for so by default had already has some styling being applied to it with just bootstrap in

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,520
general.

68
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,600
So we do see that this is a hyperlink.

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,830
But it would be nice if if we go over the hyperlink and it updates so we can update this as

70
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,800
a list group item action and that will create the hover effect you don't even have to.

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,350
You can do it as a list group item action as well,

72
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,080
and this can apply to ones that aren't links.

73
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,210
But typically you would use this type of class for links.

74
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,770
So let's take that and will apply it to the hyperlink eso this creates that has a list

75
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,440
group item.

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,450
And if you just want the action on it,

77
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,830
you need to also have the list group item within it so you can do it this way where you

78
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,300
take the list group and apply it to the parent.

79
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,150
And that way it will highlight just as the other one,

80
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,450
just below it highlights whenever the users hovering over it.

81
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,350
So you also have the option to disable these What?

82
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,430
May I got a duplicate thes with number six,

83
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,550
so that would do have the list group item actions number seven,

84
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,990
so you don't apply it to the hyperlink you could list them out as hyperlinks.

85
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,570
So again,

86
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,020
it doesn't have to be list items,

87
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,260
so you could have them as just hyperlinks and apply the list group list group item action

88
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,160
to that hyperlink and that will list out the hyperlink within that list format.

89
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,890
There's also options so we can do a disabled option,

90
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,600
so that kind of gray's it out.

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,020
Whenever you hover over it,

92
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,630
there's gonna be nothing that's gonna happen on Website five.

93
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,140
You can also apply the list group colors,

94
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,560
so these air the item default colors.

95
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,140
So just as we've seen before,

96
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,130
there's danger.

97
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,300
There's Primary Secondary on there's a whole bunch of the typical ones that you'd expect,

98
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,830
and let's also create ah,

99
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,170
horizontal list.

100
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,170
So just below our regular list group,

101
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,110
you can also create a horizontal list.

102
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,440
And as mentioned,

103
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,270
it doesn't necessarily even have to be a list.

104
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,310
You can do it as an a nordeste or list item.

105
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,420
I got to do it them as dips toe have a little bit of variety,

106
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,710
so set this up as a list group,

107
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,810
and then I'll create the list items as gives supply it class,

108
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,530
so anything you apply the styling,

109
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:33,980
too.

110
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,150
And if we want to change it to be horizontal,

111
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,410
that's adding in into the parent where we specify list group,

112
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,120
and that will make the list group horizontal.

113
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,210
So that way we can see each one of the list group items.

114
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,350
Now they're horizontal,

115
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,540
and it's a Z Z.

116
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,770
Is that just applying this horizontal class?

117
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,250
And I could do that to the main this group that we were working on before as well,

118
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,450
and that will just turn them horizontal.

119
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,410
And there's also different sizing options for the horizontal.

120
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,480
And as we saw in this example,

121
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,440
so we can do a dash,

122
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,490
sm dash MD So the different break points that we can resize and we can turn it horizontal

123
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:14,670
on.

124
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,570
So what we do horizontal MD And whenever we shrink it under the break point,

125
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,920
then it's going to stock.

126
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,090
So it's not gonna be horizontal anymore.

127
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,420
And whenever we're above the break point,

128
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,600
then there are gonna be horizontal listed.

129
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,080
So that's how you can control how they get laid out and presented to the user.

130
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,050
Within the Web page.
