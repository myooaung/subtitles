00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
this.

2
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:00.930
Listen,

3
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.700
we're gonna be looking at collapse.

4
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.490
So collapses what is typically used for Accordions.

5
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.650
If you want to hide some content and show different content,

6
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.910
this number of options,

7
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.450
we can toggle the elements.

8
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.550
You can only show one element if you want,

9
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.750
and you can have different targets and that will close and open,

10
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.510
depending on what content you want to present.

11
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.600
There's a number of options on what we're hiding and what we're showing,

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.980
and typically this type of thing is used as Accordions.

13
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.420
So where you've got header area,

14
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.990
you click the header that opens up the rest of the content but closes the already opened

15
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.170
part of the accordion.

16
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.200
And you can see this as the courting example here to giving a class of an accordion and

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.740
then structuring it with the right classes and attributes in order to make the

18
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.600
functionality.

19
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.930
And just like with everything else,

20
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.940
there's options with the JavaScript,

21
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.870
where you can select the collapse object.

22
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.250
And whenever there's a collapse event,

23
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.540
you can run some cold whenever that collapse happens.

24
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.950
So it's always there at the bottom of every component,

25
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.300
the different options,

26
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.570
how to integrate it with JavaScript So let's bring this into the project,

27
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.580
and we're gonna be working still with that still mean container and was in the main

28
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.200
container.

29
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.050
We're going to create our collapse object,

30
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.950
so creating an accordion type object.

31
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.050
We need a trigger on event to trigger.

32
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.720
So I'm going to use the hyperlink and clicking the hyperlink will open and show the

33
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.690
additional content.

34
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.180
Let's give it a button and button primary,

35
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.960
or that should actually say toggle content,

36
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.150
says you click it.

37
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.550
It will show in height additional content,

38
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.550
and then you need to content.

39
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.820
So creating a div and let's give this one a class off collapse,

40
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.590
and you also need an I D.

41
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.090
So that you can identify it from the data attributes of the button.

42
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.370
All right,

43
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.370
so there's some content and notice that because it's got a class of collapse,

44
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.250
it's not gonna be visible,

45
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.930
and collapse will automatically hide the content unless we do show and that will show the

46
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.410
class.

47
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.570
So we've seen those classes before,

48
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.180
so that was showed a content and you might have a lot of content.

49
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.200
So we want to do is want to be able to click the button and hide and show the content.

50
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.650
So the,

51
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.120
uh,

52
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.350
it's gonna link to whatever the I d is for the class that's hidden.

53
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.350
So it's paste that and still not doing anything yet because we still need to update the

54
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.550
attributes accordingly.

55
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.600
And we need to provide the different data toggle attributes.

56
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.390
So already given it a class,

57
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.940
and it's looking for data toggle,

58
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.240
and this is gonna be the attribute that's gonna provide the collapse functionality.

59
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.680
So when you add that now it's gonna hide and show the content,

60
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.750
you can have multiple buttons that high even show the content.

61
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.900
As long as they're linking to that same element,

62
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.070
they can both have the same effect,

63
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.770
so you can have as many buttons as you want that are hiding and showing the content there

64
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.060
contained within the collapse.

65
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.150
You can also have multiple targets as well,

66
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.920
and that means that we need to add some more elements and we're going to do three.

67
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.300
And right now we're still targeting that 1st 1 But let's add in a button that's gonna

68
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.370
target all of them,

69
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.460
so it's gonna open and close all of the and within the collapse,

70
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.330
let's give it a class of multi collapse.

71
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.540
And this is how we're gonna identify the elements that we want to collapse.

72
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.810
So it's going to be done through the class,

73
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.650
not through the i.

74
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.990
D.

75
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.200
And the data target is gonna be this multi collapse class,

76
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.520
and I'm gonna update this to be the danger.

77
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.250
So that will open and close all of them and then the data tart target.

78
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.000
We can specify the data target as well,

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.570
so that should be that should be specified as data target and equal that to the class multi

80
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.190
collapse.

81
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.310
And I'm mostly gonna add the data targets to the other one.

82
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.320
I didn't add them in.

83
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.440
They're still working,

84
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.750
but it's always best to add in that the target that we actually want to target It just

85
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.990
helps the JavaScript run the cord more smoothly so these ones will open and close just the

86
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.550
main one.

87
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.030
And then the toggle content will toggle all of them with the multi collapse class.

88
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.750
So that opens up all three.

89
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.570
And these just toggle the 1st 1 that we're identifying as the target.

90
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.370
Let's go down a bit and we're going to create an accordion,

91
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.080
accordion,

92
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.550
Zehr great way to present content to users and compact certain content.

93
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.320
If you have a lot of content that you're displaying and the concept is that it's got a head

94
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.890
area,

95
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.650
I'm gonna hide this stuff here.

96
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.580
It's got a head area and then just below it's got some content that might open up.

97
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.880
A good structure to use is to use the cards in order to create the various pieces of

98
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.010
content that are collapsing so each card would have a header on Lee.

99
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.150
The header is divisible visible by default,

100
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.450
and then clicking the header will open up the rest of the content.

101
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.850
So let's create a diff and give it a class.

102
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.300
So this is gonna be the card header and give it a value of one.

103
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.050
So clicking this one will open up the content below,

104
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.370
and the content below is just contained within a diff.

105
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.830
And that's the main def that's gonna hold all of the content and then within their let's

106
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.910
create other card body.

107
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.850
And this is the content that we want hidden by default,

108
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.350
so clicking one will open up the hidden content,

109
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.320
so we need to apply the classes accordingly.

110
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.380
to that so that we can hide and show the content and we might want to have more than just

111
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.410
the card body.

112
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.200
So that's why we wrapped it with another class.

113
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.990
And as soon as we add collapse that will hide that content because then Bootstrap knows

114
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.060
that this is content that needs to be hidden,

115
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.590
and I'm gonna add it in the header toggle.

116
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.550
So just as we saw before,

117
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.470
we need to identify that this is we need to provide attributes that this is data toggle

118
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.410
collapse.

119
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.960
And that's the effect that this element is gonna have in the attributes.

120
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.970
And then data Target is gonna target wherever we're trying to open and collapse the content

121
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.970
.

122
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.340
So this is where we need to have an I.

123
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.640
D.

124
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.160
And I give it called one So data target seal.

125
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.300
L won it.

126
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.210
We didn t identify it with the hash.

127
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.570
Now,

128
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.150
when we click the parent,

129
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.510
it opens and closes.

130
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.300
And if you want a group it together as one complete accordion,

131
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.000
let's give the total parent I d.

132
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.250
Of accordion and call it a c c mean And then within this collapse,

133
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.650
we identify the data parent and this will allow all of the cards to work together.

134
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.480
So the parent for this one is a C.

135
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.840
C.

136
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.300
Mean.

137
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.560
And now we can take the cards and we can duplicate the format so that we can have multiple

138
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.170
collapsible items and then just update the I DS.

139
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.100
And now they're all gonna work together.

140
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.360
Where if you open one,

141
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.530
it's gonna open that one,

142
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.350
and it's gonna close the other ones.

143
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.770
So any given time,

144
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.000
you're only gonna have one open and do a quick refresh.

145
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.270
And I'm gonna add some potting here.

146
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.460
Margin top five.

147
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.530
So there is some spacing between where we're targeting the content there and where we've

148
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.070
got the accordion that we created.

149
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:50.100
And so whatever content you create within the main parent that collapse parent with the I d

150
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.100
.

151
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.260
You can have as much content as you want added here,

152
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.650
and there's also the option to have the accordion open.

153
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.140
So if you want,

154
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.110
when it loads,

155
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.900
maybe you want the 1st 1 to show you can have that one open and the toggle is going to

156
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.370
still work the same way.

157
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.200
The idea is still the same that you can come in and you can toggle it.

158
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.120
But in this case,

159
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.520
when the page loads,

160
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.330
this one is open because we've added the class of show.
