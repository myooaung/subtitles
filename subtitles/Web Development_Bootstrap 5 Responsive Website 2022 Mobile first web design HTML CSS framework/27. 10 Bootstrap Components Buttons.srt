1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
Hey,

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,170
welcome back.

3
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,240
This lesson is going to be a fun one because it's buttons and buttons air.

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Also colorful in bootstrap.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,570
They allow us a way to provide user interaction and really entice the user to click these

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,820
nice and colorful buttons.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,260
So buttons by default.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,550
Whenever you hover over them,

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,000
they get this kind of active state so it does look like that you can take action.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can click thumb.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,710
That's really nice thing about buttons.

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,440
And I've always thought that bootstrapped his really nice buttons.

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,120
So there are options within buttons and buttons can be applied to any different element.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,610
So they've got them inputs,

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,310
buttons,

16
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,080
hyperlinks as well,

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,220
and you can do it to devise.

18
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,380
You could do it to spans.

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:37,950
To do.

20
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,430
You could do it to any element.

21
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,430
Apply the button class with the boots dropped.

22
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:42,750
Four.

23
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,580
We've also got the outline buttons.

24
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,180
So these air kind of that reversed option where the buttons themselves,

25
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,540
they're colored in with the light font.

26
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:51,900
Well,

27
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,600
this is just a white button with the colored in part whenever you hover over it.

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,190
So these air really more appealing because you can see that there's some type of action

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,290
that needs to be taken.

30
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,620
Whatever you hover over these,

31
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,210
there's also button size is so large buttons,

32
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,210
small buttons,

33
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,540
block level buttons.

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,540
If you want your button to go all the way across,

35
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,270
you can do that.

36
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,850
There's also different active states that you can set on the button,

37
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,620
so adding in the active class will by default already add in an active state to the button

38
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,830
and generally with the buttons.

39
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,260
The active state is the one where you're clicking on it,

40
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,090
so whenever you hover over the active ones,

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,610
you don't see any difference.

42
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,470
And there's also disabled buttons,

43
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,870
So that's a disabled state.

44
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:40,330
So various states that are available with the buttons there's also nice buttons they can do

45
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,810
with your forms.

46
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,170
If you got some checked boxes,

47
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,270
radio buttons and these are just a nicer way to present the radio buttons that are on and

48
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,750
off.

49
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,630
That's another really good option to use buttons within the form,

50
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,480
and they take a completely Duke different look and feel.

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,640
Let's try out some of the buttons in our editor.

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,130
So going into the editor,

53
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,230
we're gonna be containing everything within that main class,

54
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:11,450
just as we have in the earlier lessons and creating some hyperlinks that air buttons and

55
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,190
then also applying the class.

56
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,290
So class of Bt end buttons.

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,170
Everyone always wants to press buttons,

58
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,360
so when you applied Bt and class to it,

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,210
it already has a little bit of styling.

60
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,450
But the real styling comes in when you apply the colored class to it.

61
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,750
So if you do a button primary,

62
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,190
it pops out and it's blue,

63
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,750
and there's all the typical colors that you'd expect.

64
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,860
So the warning is there the danger.

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,290
They also have the light,

66
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:39,900
the dark,

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,610
so those ones are all available for buttons.

68
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,310
And these are all of the nice options for buttons.

69
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,110
There's also waste to have the outline,

70
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,900
as we saw with the outline,

71
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,900
that provides another cool way to add button so just could be duplicating these instead of

72
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,350
button B t N Dash.

73
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,470
Whatever that color value is,

74
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,750
there's another dash in there between,

75
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,850
and that one is just outline so that provides that outlined format.

76
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,510
And you can really easily update your buttons with this outline format,

77
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:19,580
so instead make some updates to them and update the way that they look and feel on your

78
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,150
website.

79
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,320
There's also the button sizes,

80
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
so if you wanted these two,

81
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,960
you can combine the various button values so Button L G.

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,500
Is for large buttons.

83
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,870
And then there's also for the small buttons.

84
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,280
There's the button sm option,

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,570
which shrinks the buttons down to a smaller size and with the still the same behaviors.

86
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,220
There's also button block and that will just turn it into ah block,

87
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,240
which means that it's going all the way across the available space so it takes the full

88
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,580
with.

89
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,010
You could also do a button large and a blood in block if you want it really super massive

90
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,830
buttons make them large and then also update any of the other classes that we have.

91
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,350
And then also adding in active,

92
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,590
I'm gonna just duplicate this and add active to put in a They're so active.

93
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,250
That's the same as whenever we've hovered over it.

94
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,120
It's going to provide that same color when you add in active.

95
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,170
There's also the disabled option so you can update the states so disabled,

96
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,490
and that will make the button so that it's not clickable.

97
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,750
So when you re hover over,

98
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,610
nothing's gonna happen you don't have the little hand that's typical for buttons.

99
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,860
Now let's look at radio buttons and these air great for forms.

100
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,650
So if you've got a form where you've got a button group that you want a group together,

101
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,470
this is a great place to to use buttons as well,

102
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,380
to have really nice for type effects and allowed the radio button so that we can see the

103
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,950
difference.

104
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,010
So type radio options.

105
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,790
So maybe this one is the active one.

106
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,540
There's also label,

107
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,820
So if you wanna apply a label to,

108
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,150
it could add a label around the button,

109
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,870
so that just moves it up slightly.

110
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,430
And that's just regular HTML,

111
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,960
so we don't have any of the bootstrap quite yet.

112
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,040
And as you can see,

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,290
the buttons air rather small there.

114
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,550
And obviously they're not all going to say the same thing that are not going to see active

115
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,550
.

116
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,460
So update the's just to be one,

117
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,350
too.

118
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,180
Yeah,

119
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,150
rather small,

120
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,260
not very appealing,

121
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,140
not very clickable in a form and not great for mobile either.

122
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,170
So Bootstrap does provide us a way to update the buttons,

123
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:38,520
so using the button group and button group toggle provides us the toggle option and when

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,750
you need to have an attributes.

125
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,820
So this is the data toggle,

126
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,410
and we need to specify that these air,

127
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,770
button and save and now within the label.

128
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,520
This is where you apply the button class.

129
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,660
So whatever button class you want to apply to it,

130
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,040
and the 1st 1 is the active one.

131
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,310
And with radio buttons,

132
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,530
it's important that you do include that active part because that's the only way that the

133
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,400
user is gonna be able to distinguish which button is actually clicked.

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,010
And so by default.

135
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,470
If you have an active one,

136
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,290
then you want to make sure that user knows that it's clicked.

137
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,530
You don't have to start with an active once.

138
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,160
You don't have to have out as a default.

139
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,370
And generally this looks best if you keep them all the same color classes.

140
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,620
And now when you click thes,

141
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,380
you see the active one is gonna update you want to.

142
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,550
You can update to the different default colors,

143
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,550
although it doesn't look as appealing.

144
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,720
If you have different colors,

145
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,770
just keep that in mind,

146
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,030
but it is an option,

147
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,300
and you can always apply any class at any point within your elements,

148
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,110
using bootstrap
