1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
cards and bootstrap provide us Ah,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,640
great way to combine content together in a particular container.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,800
They used to be called panels and the older forms of bootstraps.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,750
And now,

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,450
with the new form of Bootstrap,

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:20,310
it replaced the panels and wells and thumbnails all for this card structure that's new with

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,850
boots dropped.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,370
Four.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,200
So in order to bring a card,

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,500
you have a number of options.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,690
You can have images on top titles,

12
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,810
the card body content,

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,900
and they help you create and duplicate.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,300
And they're perfect for content that you might be repeating different types of templates

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,250
within,

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,690
such as products.

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,250
We've got product images.

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,870
You've got a title of the project product.

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,440
Some information about the product and purchase link,

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,390
as they do have a nice formatting for the images.

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,960
You don't have to apply in the additional image styles.

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,220
It just gets brought in with the card image top.

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,680
You can also include the list groups within the cards,

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,810
and they provide a nice,

25
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,950
handy container for the list groups,

26
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,080
and you can Mitch mix and match the various content types to create the cards that you need

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,930
in order to output the content.

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,790
The way you need it.

29
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:18,330
So with headers and footers to distinguish the top head area from the body and so much more

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:18,330
.

31
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,620
There's also variations with the sizing,

32
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,200
and they're probably one of those most flexible components within bootstrap and combining

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,540
it with the other classes that are available.

34
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,350
You can align to various text alignments as needed,

35
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,920
and also adding in navigation into the cards to display it within a navigation type format

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:39,920
.

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,240
You could also have image over Lee's so having the image in the background of the card and

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,670
content on top,

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:54,040
and providing this with the typical bootstrap background colors and text colors provides

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,220
you almost endless possibilities.

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,090
The cards can also be laid out horizontally,

42
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,940
where you've got the image to the left,

43
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,280
the court title and the card content on the right hand side.

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,420
And you can use the typical background colors and text colors in the utilities to update

45
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,870
the appearance of the cards.

46
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,290
There's also options for the various borders of the cards,

47
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,870
and you can also group cards together in a card group.

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,790
And if you want to use the card decks and setting them of equal width and height so that

49
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,570
they're not attached to one another.

50
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,690
And there laid out in more than a grid like format that's also available within the card

51
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,130
deck.

52
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,830
There's the card group,

53
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,180
which groups them all together without the spacing.

54
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,760
And there's also a grid option for the cards as well,

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,780
which is similar to what we saw with the boots regular bootstrap grid.

56
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,730
And this could be applied within the cards where you've got the boots drop of grid classes

57
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,970
applied within the card structure by using the rows and columns toe output,

58
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,150
the card content.

59
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,730
So yes,

60
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,870
quite a bit to go over with cards,

61
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,980
let's get started.

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,610
So start by creating a div,

63
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,940
giving it a class of card and then within the card,

64
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,650
create a nested div,

65
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,450
and this one is gonna be card body.

66
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,380
And this is where the contents of the card are going to be contained so they could be

67
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,810
contained within a paragraph.

68
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,220
If you want to add some other styling to it,

69
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,490
you can also add in titles.

70
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:27,260
So let's give this one a class of card title and also H three and all space started so that

71
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,680
we have our card content as a title before Matt.

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,430
And of course,

73
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,060
you can add in buttons and mix and match the various bootstrap classes together to get the

74
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,010
layout that you want.

75
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,010
And the way that I usually create cards is I'll create the basic card structure and then

76
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,360
I'll copy and paste it to have additional card elements.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,580
So either using the boots,

78
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,390
drop grid or the card grid.

79
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,480
There's also options for the links to have it as a card linked.

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,960
That's going to provide more structure with how it's gonna be output.

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,790
And then within the card body,

82
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,250
you can have content as card text and images can also be added in.

83
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,170
So I'm gonna add the image above the card body just as an image,

84
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,730
and we'll do the source,

85
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,490
and I'm going to use the same sources we had before with the placeholder image.

86
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:22,720
And let's apply the class because that image just doesn't look great like that.

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,970
So Kharj image,

88
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,000
top class and with Bootstrap to illustrate this a little bit better weaken set default wits

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,060
So we've got a number of default wits that we can use,

91
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,600
and this way you can see what the card image class is going to do more,

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,720
and it keeps the dimensions of the image instead of stretching it out and you don't want to

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:43,720
,

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,340
just you can have more than one card body.

95
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,300
You might have a requirement to have two different card bodies,

96
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,220
so you can do that as well and also have ah,

97
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,180
card header.

98
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,680
Notice that it's slightly dark grade there,

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,530
as this is what a default header might look like.

100
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,560
And you might also want to make this bigger.

101
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,200
So looking at the various options that you have with the different styling in bootstrap,

102
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,540
there's also an option for card footer as well,

103
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,340
and that will also update the background color.

104
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,670
So it's slightly off.

105
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,390
And if you did have cards,

106
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm going to get rid of the card body there.

107
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,910
My difficult way of using card says that I'd create my default template for the card,

108
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,400
and if I want to be able to reuse it,

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,280
that I create a grid in bootstrap and I just simply copy and duplicate the content and then

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,720
duplicated as many times as necessary,

111
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,360
also going to get rid of the 50 white so that presents the content in tonight's format and

112
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,540
notices well that it's all responsive because we're using the bootstrap grid and you can

113
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,790
have images and multiple spots within the card.

114
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,260
It doesn't always have to sip their the top wherever you place the image.

115
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,120
You could also do it just before the footer as well.

116
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,340
So it's another option.

117
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,260
So wherever you put the image tag,

118
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,680
that's where the image is gonna go.

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,630
And typically you will see them near to the top of the element.

120
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,990
You could also have an image overly as well.

121
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,520
Let's create that and give it a class of card.

122
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,590
I m g overly and what this does is this creates text on top of the image,

123
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,250
and I'll just take the header off.

124
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,180
So we just got the text on top is by default.

125
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,570
It takes whatever the size of the card is,

126
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,010
and it positions the image overly on top of the card as a whole.

127
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,190
That's why you got to be careful when you have the header that you didn't wanna have text

128
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,100
on top of the header,

129
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,050
so text on top hat text doesn't look great.

130
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,250
So that's how you can overlay text on top of your image.

131
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,850
And then,

132
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,420
of course,

133
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,420
use the text white to indicate whatever color of text you want.

134
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,200
And that's again within the utilities of Bootstrap and then the card as a whole.

135
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,780
You can always update the background colors,

136
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,110
using the utilities to make them stand out and make them different and again applying text

137
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,110
.

138
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,460
Wait,

139
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,740
if the need is there and I'm gonna just do background dark,

140
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,090
you can also set border colors,

141
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,000
so border.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,250
So if you wanted a green border and you can see there's a slate border around,

143
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,750
the content could get rid of the dark.

144
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,430
We could just see that green border there.

145
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,530
You have options to set the different border colors.

146
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:35,820
There's also options for the card group That's just a rapper Element was the class of card

147
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,250
group,

148
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,970
and then you would place all of your cards within the card group element,

149
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,090
and that would group all of the cards.

150
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,400
So just select the card and place them within the car group.

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,150
I'm gonna get rid of that default with,

152
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,800
and for now,

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,560
we're just going to do two different cards within the car group,

154
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,370
and you could do as many as you want.

155
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,410
I'll make this bigger so that we can see there is a difference between the card group and

156
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,230
the grid structure,

157
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,800
so the grid automatically has.

158
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,390
The spacing between the card group doesn't have any spacing between,

159
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,050
but it's also a nice way to lay out the card structure.

160
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,090
And you can always update the card Group two card deck if you do want to have that spacing

161
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,750
in between.

162
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,280
So it looks a lot similar to what we saw with the grid.

163
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,940
And again,

164
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,440
it's an option to use whichever one makes the most sense to you.

165
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,080
And if you add in another card into it,

166
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,500
it will literally look just like the grid below.

167
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,000
The structure will literally look very similar,

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,430
so the card group is the one that looks different than the grid.

169
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,490
So if you want to have a different type of effect grouping a bunch of cards together than

170
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,340
use the card group as the card grid,

171
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,550
you might as well just use the bootstrap grid.

172
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,110
But again,

173
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,900
it's up to you how you wanna structure.

174
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,190
There's also card columns,

175
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,660
so if you're using the different a bunch of cards together,

176
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,650
that might not necessarily have the same dimensions,

177
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,370
and I'm gonna update some of this.

178
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:07,070
You could see it takes on more of a Mason type format where it groups them together as

179
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,470
needed.

180
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,440
But it also is smart enough to know how to structure.

181
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,870
It sits in a more readable format that's taking into consideration the various heights,

182
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,690
and that's card call.

183
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:17,820
Um,

184
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,220
so it's a lot different than the card group,

185
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,700
whereas the group would automatically just group it as columns.

186
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,150
And the card columns is the one that structures that better in a more presentable format.

187
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,990
So it comes to cards quite a lot of options,

188
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,050
different ways to output the content.

189
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,900
And overall,

190
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,740
it's a nice way to percent content that you're grouping together within containers that you

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,250
can vary as needed.

192
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,960
With the Darius Bootstrap classes
