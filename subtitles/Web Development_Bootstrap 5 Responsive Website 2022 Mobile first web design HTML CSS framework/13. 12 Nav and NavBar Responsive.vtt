00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
One of the most
commonly looked for

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.170
feature best things
about Bootstrap is it

3
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.495
allows you to build really nice

4
00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:09.255
looking collapsible menu items.

5
00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.255
So there's the nav for
different Nav Menus,

6
00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.760
bunch of options you can
set that the mess tabs,

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.100
drop-down items that
you can add in.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.630
You can set them to take

9
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.000
the full width
across, center them.

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.250
There's a lot of different
options building

11
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.920
out the navigation
bar for your website.

12
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.940
This is an example of
the navigation bar where

13
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.320
once we bring it down to

14
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.300
a certain size, it's
gonna collapse.

15
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.115
We see the hamburger icon menu.

16
00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:36.590
Click that and that's going
to open up the link menu,

17
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.080
Google Branding texts there on

18
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.555
the larger screens
That's going to be open.

19
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:43.279
The links are gonna
be horizontal.

20
00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:44.360
On the smaller screens,

21
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.800
they're going to be
vertical and they're gonna

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.290
collapse within the hang
of hamburger icon menu.

23
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.030
This lesson we're
gonna be looking at

24
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.700
the nav components and
as well as the navbar.

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.490
So the most basic one
is the naff component,

26
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.715
and this creates the
navigation type format

27
00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:01.745
for items for a page elements

28
00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:03.680
are going to be using
the unordered lists.

29
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.890
So typically when we are
creating navs for websites,

30
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.405
we use the list items.

31
00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.760
This makes it a little
bit easier to read,

32
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.435
creating the class of
nav for the parent,

33
00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:17.480
and then for the list
items themselves or for

34
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.040
the page elements
that we're going

35
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.780
to make clickable
within the list,

36
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.135
set that as a nav item.

37
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.910
And then these are typically
going to be hyperlinks.

38
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.045
So set those up as a
hyperlink using the H ref.

39
00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:31.235
And right now that's not
going to go to anything.

40
00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.079
Adding in a class.

41
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.345
And the class that
we're using is gonna be

42
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.390
a nav link class
and close that up.

43
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.860
And this will represent

44
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.725
the links within
the navigation bar.

45
00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:44.210
We can have multiple links,

46
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.475
of course, within the navbar.

47
00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:48.290
So I just started
in four there and

48
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.270
they just get stocked
horizontally.

49
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.280
So by default it is stacking it

50
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.170
horizontally as opposed to

51
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.760
if it was just a
regular list item,

52
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.920
it would be done vertically.

53
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.290
If we were to move
out and remove it,

54
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.565
the parent nav class,

55
00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:03.380
these would just be list items,

56
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.830
stocking them horizontally,
horizontally.

57
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.870
You could also justify

58
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.375
and justify the
content of a knots.

59
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:15.020
So setting it up and
let's set the justify

60
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.860
of the content and center
all of the content.

61
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.650
So that basically centers
the content can set

62
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.930
a background color of

63
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.605
light that will highlight
that entire element.

64
00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:32.210
And for NOV, so we can also
use tabs within the nav list.

65
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.025
So setting up as nav,

66
00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:37.024
and then we can set
these as NADPH tops.

67
00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.050
That sets them up as tabs,

68
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.165
and in each one of those items,

69
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:43.490
now, for the nav links,

70
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.995
we can select one and
set it as active.

71
00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:48.050
And that's going
to be represented

72
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.940
as active within the tabs.

73
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.860
And you don't have to
justify the content.

74
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.705
Typically when you
are using the tabs,

75
00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:56.600
they're gonna be pulled
over to the left-hand side.

76
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.920
There's also an option to use
pills for the list items.

77
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.070
That's another example
of what you can do.

78
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.755
So let's set these
up instead of tabs,

79
00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:09.245
select them as nav pills.

80
00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:11.450
And the active one is going
to be the one that's going

81
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.625
to get the color
associated with it.

82
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.690
And that's set to the links
for these menus as well.

83
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.200
We can set them as
nav and justified.

84
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.035
And what that will
do, the justified,

85
00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:26.450
we'll provide an equal width to

86
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.390
the items within the list.

87
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.350
So that will automatically
become responsive and allow

88
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.295
us to have each one of them
take up selected width.

89
00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:39.980
And just like the
typically for navigation,

90
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.960
Let's add in one
more example and

91
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.030
you can do a drop-down list.

92
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.285
So similar to what we just did
before with the drop-down.

93
00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:50.405
If you want to create one
of these as a dropdown.

94
00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:52.130
So I'm going to
set any of them as

95
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.260
active and we'll select that.

96
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.300
And I'm not going to
justify this one either.

97
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.500
So this one is just speak going

98
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.180
over to the left-hand side.

99
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.550
And let's select
this and set them

100
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.060
as the list item and
set it as a dropdown.

101
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.055
So we'll have a
multiple items there.

102
00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:09.800
And this is still going
to be a nav item.

103
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.155
Set it as a drop down.

104
00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.629
So that's going to give
it the dropdown class.

105
00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.000
Then for the dropdown items,

106
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.700
we want to have a
way to click and

107
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.490
have the drop-down
for the elements.

108
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.885
So let's set this up.

109
00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:28.160
And we need to use
the data toggle

110
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.000
attribute and set
that to drop down.

111
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.435
That will set dot link
as the drop-down.

112
00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:37.100
For the class.

113
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.580
It can use a nav link and drop

114
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.120
down toggle within the element.

115
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.995
That gives it this
type of effect

116
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:48.260
where we can drop down toggle.

117
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.540
So then it needs
some dropdown items.

118
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.510
So let's set that up
as a class and set

119
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.830
down the drop-down menu class.

120
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.050
So creating all the
elements that are contained

121
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.795
within their dropdown items,

122
00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:06.725
you need to have a parent
set those up as a div.

123
00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:08.120
And then within the div,

124
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.050
this is where we can wrap
the hyperlinks within those.

125
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.750
So that will give us
the dropdown items.

126
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.700
And instead of nav links,

127
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.050
these are now going to be,

128
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.790
when we click it, it's going to

129
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.965
open up the dropdown items.

130
00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:24.725
And let's select few other ones.

131
00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:27.425
And we can add multiple
dropdown items,

132
00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:28.700
and they're all
gonna be presented

133
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.320
within the drop-down list.

134
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.485
You can also add in some
text into the dropdown.

135
00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:36.440
So that gives you that
drop down structure.

136
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.050
You can also do the drop-downs.

137
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.695
You can do it within
the tabs as well.

138
00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:46.415
So it's another option
for creating navigation.

139
00:05:46.415 --> 00:05:48.680
So just create a second one that

140
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.215
was similar to what
we just created.

141
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.625
Instead of pills.

142
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:54.770
Let's show you in just two tabs.

143
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.514
And then whatever
we set as active,

144
00:05:57.514 --> 00:06:00.815
that's the one that's
gonna get the tab option.

145
00:06:00.815 --> 00:06:04.025
If we have the first
item there as active,

146
00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:06.560
now the drop-down is going
to be within the tabs.

147
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.715
The navbar for websites
is used for navigation.

148
00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:12.575
And bootstrap allows
you to create

149
00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:15.140
a quick navigation bar that

150
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.020
can collapse dependent
on the screen size.

151
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.860
So it's great.

152
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.290
A typical navigation bar

153
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.500
that we can then resize
and have it collapsed.

154
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.710
So that way we can use it for

155
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.325
different size screens and
for the navigation bar.

156
00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:35.420
So I'll do an unordered
list for this one using

157
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.475
the nav bar class and nav.

158
00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:43.370
So it's going to be
for the parent element

159
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.860
and then for each item that's
contained within there.

160
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.420
So we'll have the list items

161
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.760
set the class for the list item.

162
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.850
These are all nav item classes

163
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.360
and then the hyperlinks that
are contained within those.

164
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.550
Not gonna set that
to go to anywhere,

165
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.200
but they will need a class as

166
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.645
well in order to identify them.

167
00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:03.920
And they're going to use

168
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.220
the nav link and see
what that looks like.

169
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.055
So that gives us
the navigation bar.

170
00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:14.330
So let's wrap this in a parent
which we'll call enough.

171
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.980
And this is where
we're going to have

172
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.055
the navigation bar
responsive aspect,

173
00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:21.335
where we're going to expand it

174
00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:24.170
and then what size screen
we want to expand it on.

175
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.955
And we're gonna set it to SM.

176
00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:28.535
So this will give the parent

177
00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:32.165
container the information
for the navigation.

178
00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:34.565
So on the smaller screen,

179
00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:37.160
it's going to stack
them vertically,

180
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.960
whereas on the larger screens,

181
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.910
it's going to still
go horizontally.

182
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.980
You can add in a
background color

183
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.560
here as well for
the navigation bar.

184
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.305
And let's also set for the text.

185
00:07:48.305 --> 00:07:51.185
And that's going to be
for the text itself.

186
00:07:51.185 --> 00:07:54.395
So within the classes
of the hyperlinks,

187
00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:56.780
we need to add in that
these links are gonna

188
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.660
take a class for the light text

189
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.120
in order to have
the text show up as

190
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.330
light text so we can
update the parent.

191
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.720
And whenever we put the
texts light into the parent,

192
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.310
that means that it's
simply going to

193
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.975
be applying it only to the text.

194
00:08:11.975 --> 00:08:13.490
The hyperlinks are different,

195
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.320
so you need to apply
the different classes

196
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.210
to the hyperlinks
themselves as well.

197
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.870
So we can set this to break
on medium sized screens,

198
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.270
whereas smaller,
whereas largest screens

199
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.995
it's gonna go horizontal.

200
00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:27.260
So a smaller screens
it's gonna go vertical.

201
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.530
You can also center the
content just as we saw with

202
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.720
the other Nav option
where we can do

203
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.345
the justify content center.

204
00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:38.360
And so that will
center the link,

205
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.240
also setting up the
colored navigation bar,

206
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.225
where instead of
setting the text light,

207
00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:46.340
Let's set the nav bar too late,

208
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.060
and that will automatically
update the link content.

209
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.010
So save you the
trouble of adding

210
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.045
the text Light class
to the hyperlinks.

211
00:08:56.045 --> 00:09:00.485
We can also set the navbar
too dark, the dark color.

212
00:09:00.485 --> 00:09:04.985
And let's update this to so
far navigation bar is dark,

213
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:08.240
that will set the
links to lighter text.

214
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.950
That will update
it automatically

215
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.080
sealed off to select
them individually.

216
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.750
But you can also
select the text.

217
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.955
In order to Todd white text.

218
00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:18.395
You set it too dark.

219
00:09:18.395 --> 00:09:20.765
And in order to add light text,

220
00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:24.200
you set it too late for the
navigation bar background.

221
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.640
If you don't set a primary
as a background color,

222
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.210
Let's set it to
have a background,

223
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.570
dark background, dark color.

224
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.125
And then the contrasting
for the navbar is dark.

225
00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:41.405
So that way that the
text is gonna be

226
00:09:41.405 --> 00:09:44.570
late as opposed to setting
the background light.

227
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.750
You can also set the
navbar to light that will

228
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.250
allow you to still see all of

229
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.095
the links within
the navigation bar.

230
00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:53.240
Let's create a, another
navigation bar.

231
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.310
And this is going
to be typical one

232
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.140
that uses a hamburger icon.

233
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.970
So we'll update the
one that we already

234
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.525
have and add that
within the container.

235
00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:05.420
And so we use the nav class

236
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.005
and have this one as
an expand on the SM.

237
00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:10.400
If you do need to set that,

238
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.680
this is going to be where
the navigation bar is going

239
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.170
to break and where
it's going to expand.

240
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.520
So if you update those,

241
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.020
it's going to update
where it's expanding.

242
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.215
So right now on the
medium-sized screens and below,

243
00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:22.820
it's going to be horizontal.

244
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.010
On the larger size screens,

245
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.260
it's gonna it's
gonna be vertical on

246
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.940
the smaller screens
and horizontal

247
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.845
on the longer, larger screens.

248
00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:32.600
Typically you would use SAM,

249
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.075
but you can use the
other sizes as well.

250
00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:37.865
Within the navbar, you can set

251
00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:40.880
a fluid cloths so that can use

252
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.525
the parent's set within
the parent and using

253
00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:48.635
the class wants to take up
all the available space,

254
00:10:48.635 --> 00:10:51.470
will apply separate
container to it.

255
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.200
And set it up as
container fluid.

256
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.300
That's just going to
wrap right around

257
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.180
the unordered list
and allow us to set

258
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.970
different colors for the
unordered list if we want

259
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.680
to click containing
that unordered list

260
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.030
in that main container.

261
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.640
So allowing us to take
the full available width

262
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.135
across and also creating
a parent container.

263
00:11:11.135 --> 00:11:14.915
This is where also if you
wanted to have a logo,

264
00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:19.025
you could add that logo
and let's have an image.

265
00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:22.670
And a source for the image
is going to be the logo.

266
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.965
And then let's add in
some classes for it.

267
00:11:24.965 --> 00:11:27.050
Now there are classes
for it and typically

268
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.420
you wouldn't have
a massive local.

269
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.160
You could restrict the size of

270
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.080
the container as well as you can

271
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.545
set the default width that
you want for the logo.

272
00:11:36.545 --> 00:11:39.050
So those are some of the
options, but with the class,

273
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.860
you can set the class
width twenty-five percent.

274
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.670
If we want the image
to only take up 25%,

275
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.830
we can use the W 25.

276
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.680
That's going to set it
relevant to the parent size,

277
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.985
relevant to the parent.

278
00:11:52.985 --> 00:11:54.170
I'll take a little look at

279
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.925
that a little bit
later on as well.

280
00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:58.010
That's setting us,
and that's giving us

281
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.560
an option to set a logo.

282
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.705
And also for the class of this,

283
00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:04.550
let's set this as nav.

284
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.470
So that will
automatically set it up

285
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.675
as a local within
the navigation bar.

286
00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:10.280
And we should actually have

287
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.470
the navbar brand as

288
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.830
a separate element
surrounds the image.

289
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.290
We don't want to be
using that class as

290
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.870
the navbar brand
around the image.

291
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.060
And that's going to
set the image as

292
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.405
the brand image within the logo.

293
00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:29.840
Also here, we can
set a width for it.

294
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.000
If you are using

295
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.435
an image that's rather large
and in this case it is,

296
00:12:35.435 --> 00:12:37.445
you can make it a lot smaller.

297
00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:39.470
So that way it's
going to fit a lot

298
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.675
better into as a logo.

299
00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:44.030
So that's another option
as well where you can set

300
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.900
an image and I'll see you can
add in within the branding.

301
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.350
You can have some texts
as well that can add

302
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.039
in within the navigation
bar an image local,

303
00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:57.545
as well as text within
the image logo.

304
00:12:57.545 --> 00:12:59.435
So after we've set the brand,

305
00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:02.615
we want to set the
collapsible button.

306
00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.820
You can set this
again as any element.

307
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.410
I'm going to use buttons.

308
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.590
So typically this is a
button that gets pressed.

309
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.345
So we're gonna set
it as a button.

310
00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:13.010
And the class for
this one is going

311
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.780
to be the button toddler.

312
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.930
And the type is going to
be just a regular button.

313
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.705
And we need to add in
some data attributes.

314
00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:23.675
So it's using the data attribute

315
00:13:23.675 --> 00:13:28.130
for toggle where we're
using the collapse,

316
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.745
that it's going to toggle
a certain target object.

317
00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:32.600
And this as well.

318
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.830
So we need to specify the
data BAS target element,

319
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.365
and this is
identified by its ID.

320
00:13:39.365 --> 00:13:40.895
So we need to have hash,

321
00:13:40.895 --> 00:13:44.030
and I'll call it main nav as

322
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.800
the ID for

323
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.950
the main navigation
content. Within the button.

324
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:54.080
There is a navbar toddler
icon in Bootstrap.

325
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.885
You can add that
in using the span.

326
00:13:56.885 --> 00:14:01.370
And Navbar toddler
icon is going to be

327
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.890
the class in order to bring in

328
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.935
that element into
the navigation bar.

329
00:14:06.935 --> 00:14:09.230
Now we need to
select the rest of

330
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.245
the elements that we
want to collapse.

331
00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:14.360
So it's going to be
contained within the div.

332
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.160
And this is where we
need to identify it by

333
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.755
the ID for what we
want to collapse.

334
00:14:18.755 --> 00:14:20.240
And the content that we want to

335
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.955
collapse needs to be
contained within this parent.

336
00:14:22.955 --> 00:14:27.830
So it's navbar collapse class
and then give it an ID.

337
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.740
And that ID has to
match the ID that we

338
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.770
set within the button
collapsible objects.

339
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.390
So that has to be the same.

340
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.830
And if it's an ID, then

341
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.375
that's where we're
using the hash.

342
00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:40.745
Let's close off the
def after that.

343
00:14:40.745 --> 00:14:43.235
Now whenever we go smaller,

344
00:14:43.235 --> 00:14:45.320
we see that we've got
this hamburger icon

345
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.370
that we can open and

346
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.440
close on the larger
sized screens

347
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.805
that's going to disappear.

348
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:53.075
And we're going to just have
the regular default menu.

349
00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:54.890
And just as we saw before,

350
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.130
if we want to adjust
where the breakpoint is,

351
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.785
if you want to break on
medium-sized screens,

352
00:15:00.785 --> 00:15:02.330
we can add that as well.

353
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.700
Then he wouldn't know
any of one of the links.

354
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.030
And we can add additional
links as needed into the menu.

355
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.655
And also when we
expand the large,

356
00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:13.265
that menu is going to
be able to be seen

357
00:15:13.265 --> 00:15:15.050
horizontally and it goes

358
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.225
vertical with the
collapsible button.

359
00:15:17.225 --> 00:15:19.175
Once it's on a
smaller size screen,

360
00:15:19.175 --> 00:15:21.800
That's how you can
set a navigation bar

361
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.040
dot collapses and is
fully responsive.

362
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.590
Depending on the screen size and

363
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.260
anything within this
collapsible area,

364
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.170
div is going to
collapse in the menu.

365
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.570
So even if you had a title,

366
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.430
that would also be there.

367
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.050
So you could add in a title to

368
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:43.325
your navigation bar and it
doesn't really fit in well.

369
00:15:43.325 --> 00:15:45.110
But that's another
option as well,

370
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.720
that you could have
hard-coded text within

371
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.190
your navigation bar because this

372
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.810
is within the
collapsible content.
