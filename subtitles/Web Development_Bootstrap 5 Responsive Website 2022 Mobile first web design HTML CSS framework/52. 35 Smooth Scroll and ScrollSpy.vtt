00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
you need to have the JavaScript library,

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.740
and it's ideal for single page websites because it allows us the user to be able to see

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.270
which section there on that's within the navigation bar.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.260
So when you have the navigation bar the top as they scroll down,

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.570
it will update thes as active.

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.550
That's a really cool thing about it.

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.580
It's really easy to odd to your project.

8
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.940
So first within your CSS,

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.390
add in the body position to relative,

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.520
and if you refresh it,

11
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.770
you're not going to see any difference quite yet.

12
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:39.330
They're going down into the body at an attribute data spy and equal that value to be scroll

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.820
so that this is being applied to the whole body.

14
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.130
And if you have the scroll spy in particular sections,

15
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.950
then you would do the same thing for the section that you want.

16
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.220
Apply the school spy to and then data target,

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.150
and this is going to be the target of where you've got your navigation and our target

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.460
doesn't have an idea.

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.330
So I need to add in an I d for the navigation bar,

20
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.220
so give it an I D so that we can identify it as an attribute and we'll just call it Navy

21
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.850
Novey and then the data target and make sure you include the hash so it understands it as

22
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.140
an I.

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.560
D.

24
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.960
Let's refresh.

25
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.800
You see that the school sport.

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.330
Now,

27
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.320
as we scroll through the various elements,

28
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.450
it's gonna update the values and is gonna provide it as active.

29
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.590
And just to be sure,

30
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.590
you can go down to the JavaScript as well and add that in.

31
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.660
So I'm gonna add some custom script.

32
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.860
So custom script tag is where it can add the javascript of the geek worry.

33
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.050
So selecting the Body Scroll spy.

34
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.680
So if we don't want to place it within the body as an attribute,

35
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.020
we can also do it down here as Na'vi.

36
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.670
And this is gonna work the same way.

37
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.140
And this if we want to do it that way,

38
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.990
we can get rid of the body attributes and remove it save.

39
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.640
And now it's still working.

40
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.170
So it's working for the JavaScript,

41
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.250
so there's two different ways to apply it.

42
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.980
I gotta keep both in the project,

43
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.390
but he only really do need one,

44
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.950
so you could do it with the scroll spy in the JavaScript or you could do it within the body

45
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.200
attributes and are scrolling even though it's working,

46
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.400
it's not smooth.

47
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.750
So now we're gonna apply the JavaScript in order to make it more smooth.

48
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.710
Let's clean up the code and apply some JavaScript to make smooth scrolling.

49
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.440
And in order to get the smooth scrolling,

50
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.460
we are gonna have to do some custom coding using J Query and apply that to the bottom.

51
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.830
Within the script tags need to update the J Query Library,

52
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.520
so by default it uses the slim version,

53
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.530
which is a slimmed down version of Jake Worry.

54
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.480
So some of the J.

55
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.640
Corey functionality might not be available,

56
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.610
and you might have already found that if you are rating Gee query and you find that it's

57
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.150
not working within bootstrap,

58
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.240
that's because it's got the slim version in The slim version is missing some of the

59
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.270
functions that are contained within the full version.

60
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.570
So we do need the full version for animation because animation is only contained within the

61
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.990
full version does not.

62
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.240
When the one that's by default with bootstrap,

63
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.370
there's a number of places to get the J.

64
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.250
Corey Library see,

65
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.500
go to that bakery website downloaded there if you wanted to store it locally,

66
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.000
if you want to use a cdn,

67
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.390
the one that I usually go to is Google.

68
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.590
It's available developers dot google dot com for slash speed for its Pash libraries.

69
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.760
And this is one that I prefer to use because I think a lot of websites are using Google s

70
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.840
Oh,

71
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.700
it does increase the speed,

72
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.200
and you don't have to worry about any of maybe some download and library slow down of your

73
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.820
website,

74
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.140
because if the user already has it cached,

75
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.490
then it's gonna load relatively quickly because it's cash within the browser.

76
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.660
And that's the nice thing about using CD ends when you are programming and using common

77
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.580
shared libraries.

78
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.890
So now we're just gonna overwrite the J Query one and you'll find that Bootstrap still

79
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.460
works the same because now we've got the full version,

80
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.380
so it's just given us some more options,

81
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.640
so everything is still running the same way as before.

82
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.220
So now,

83
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.080
going into the script tags because this is JavaScript and Jake Worry is a JavaScript

84
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.580
library.

85
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.190
So it's why I referred to it as JavaScript because at the heart of it is JavaScript.

86
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.080
But the methods and the structure and some of the code that you write it's gonna be based

87
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.300
on what is available in G query.

88
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.730
So we need to first use a selector in J coury and the way that we did the selector just

89
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.960
like we did the body element on the page.

90
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.270
We select the element that we want to work with and number of different ways to select it.

91
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.500
So I'm selecting it,

92
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.570
using the hash.

93
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.540
So that indicates that we're looking for element nav Bar One and not gonna correspond with

94
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.540
,

95
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.970
of course,

96
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.250
the navigation bar.

97
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.740
And actually,

98
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.600
we've given an idea of Navy,

99
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.400
so it's updated down there as well.

100
00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.230
So Navy is gonna be our knave bar and then looking at the honored A list and the list items

101
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.360
that are contained in there and we all on a select specific ones is going to be the ones

102
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.400
with the H rough.

103
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.940
And the reason that we're being specific here is that we want to make sure that we're Onley

104
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.590
selecting the ones that are equal to ah ha hush of we want to make sure we're selecting the

105
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.830
ones with the hash on Lee because we don't want all of the hyperlinks in the nav bar to go

106
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.960
out to to be activated when we click it so that meaning these ones here,

107
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.360
the social icons would We don't have any associate ID scroll with them,

108
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.790
and we don't want Thies to get fired off whenever the user makes this selection.

109
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.650
That's why we've specified the path to the specific elements,

110
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.410
and you have to be really specific here.

111
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.290
So once you have selected the element adding an event listener,

112
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.690
so the on and we're adding on click event.

113
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.050
So that means that the Event listener is gonna fire off every time it's clicked and the

114
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.270
structures to have a function in there and within the function.

115
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.220
It's passing the event object,

116
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.350
so that's contained within the function.

117
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:18.250
And this is basically what is going to get selected and invoked that event object,

118
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.160
and we have to prevent the default action as well,

119
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.510
and this is just to illustrate just to make sure that we have actually selected it properly

120
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.510
.

121
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.240
So go into the console and now whenever we click thes,

122
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.880
we see that there is an event that's taking place.

123
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.860
And whenever we click the those hyperlinks,

124
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.800
it's not invoking the function,

125
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.940
and that's what we want.

126
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.330
This error is an error for the brackets editor.

127
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.730
So you're not gonna encounter that if you using another type of editor as well as the

128
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.310
warning about the button is part of what's contained within the bootstrap CSS,

129
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.480
so that hopefully there's gonna be fixed for that soon,

130
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.980
so that won't be appearing anymore.

131
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.890
And we're not using any of that styling that's been deputy created anyway.

132
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.520
So that is something that you can ignore as well,

133
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.150
for now.

134
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.620
And there's more information about chrome and some of updates that they're doing.

135
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.960
So once we actually link it properly,

136
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.480
you're not going to see any errors,

137
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.450
and we see the event is being fired off.

138
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.890
So what we will also want to do is we want to use the prevent default action,

139
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.900
so this is going to prevent any kind of default action.

140
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.100
So typically with hyperlinks and HTML,

141
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.990
it already knows that this is supposed to link out somewhere so supposed to go somewhere so

142
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.110
want to prevent that default action from happening because we want to create the animation

143
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.070
with decree that's over removing the default action.

144
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.540
Also using Let hash.

145
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.220
We're gonna collect a variable using this object.

146
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.480
And this is referring to the active element that made the event that triggered the event.

147
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.680
And you can console Log that out as well.

148
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.270
If you want.

149
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.350
You don't have to do all of this console log.

150
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:03.570
You can copy and paste my code and just update the I d of your navigation bar if you want.

151
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.010
But this is for those that I really want to understand what's happening here with the

152
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.470
coding.

153
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.650
It's no when we click.

154
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.970
So you were picking up The harsh is about so that's gonna include the content and that's

155
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.520
gonna be how we're gonna know where were animating to where we're scrolling too.

156
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:28.550
And this hush if we select it as an element and using the J query structure were selected

157
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.760
as the element it's gonna have on offset top value.

158
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.210
Is this gonna be a value of where the section starts?

159
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.060
How many pixels down on the screen?

160
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:45.030
And this will change depending on the screen size and amount of content within that screen

161
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.500
area.

162
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.070
So if I make it bigger,

163
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.450
and actually,

164
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.050
we're not going to the footer they're not able to see.

165
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.320
But this could vary,

166
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.800
and this is dynamically picked up with the code because we need this value in order to

167
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.370
specify to the J query.

168
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.720
We wanna anime school,

169
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.020
too.

170
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.470
And now comes the fun part where we actually make it school.

171
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.470
Where makes it happen?

172
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.120
So take the HTML and the body tag.

173
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.500
So the elements with HTML and body that full and use Anna Meat,

174
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.050
which is a J coury function,

175
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:20.710
which performs a custom animation so it automatically applies all that styling in order to

176
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.850
perform the animation.

177
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.520
So Jake worry is just a quick way to do some really,

178
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.350
uh,

179
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.150
updates on your CSS,

180
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.020
and we want to scroll top.

181
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.540
So we need to specify position that we want to scroll to.

182
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.240
So if we did something like 300 or something like that,

183
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.770
it would always scroll to 300.

184
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.340
That's the pixel position,

185
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.110
that it's scrolling,

186
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.450
too,

187
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.890
and this is where we use the value that we got from the Hashi,

188
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.590
and we could specify where we want to scroll to.

189
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.920
So let's try that again.

190
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.470
So now we're scrolling to the right position.

191
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.950
I got close the consul,

192
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.310
because we're not going to need it anymore.

193
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.020
Now it's scrolling to the right spot and see that's nice animated scroll.

194
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:08.930
And so you also do have some options on the scrolling so we can slow it down or we could

195
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:09.680
speed it up.

196
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.590
So if we want to take one second to scroll,

197
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.490
that's 1000 milliseconds and then the function.

198
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.260
Whenever the school is finished,

199
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.070
I want to update this window location,

200
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.320
see it or is still says contact.

201
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.370
And that's because of the hashes that were being applied whenever we clicked the menu here

202
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.370
.

203
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.800
So we want this to update as well,

204
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.580
so that the URL corresponds with where we are on the page.

205
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.970
And we could do that with JavaScript,

206
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.900
where we select the window object,

207
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:45.770
take the location of the browser window and updated toe hash and equal it to whatever the

208
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.980
hash is and the hashes just this value here that's gonna be appearing.

209
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.500
At that end,

210
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.150
let's see how that works.

211
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.710
So you see it and updates to projects.

212
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.830
It updates the story at updates to contact,

213
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.160
and if you find that scrolling is too slow.

214
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.560
You could always speed it up,

215
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.320
and if you find it's too fast,

216
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.550
you could always slow it down.

217
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.190
So whatever your preferences for users,

218
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.510
I find that's actually a little bit too fast.

219
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.990
And I usually prefer to stay around one second for the scrolling,

220
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.400
so it doesn't matter how far it's scrolling.

221
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.020
It's always going to take one second to do the scrolling,

222
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.000
so actually calculates all of the in between.

223
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.740
So that's it.

224
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.950
That's how you can add that nice animation effect to your project.

225
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.250
You're single page website.

226
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.820
Let's try that one more time and check it out.

227
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:37.300
And that last part was just updating that you are else so that it updates accordingly to

228
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.550
whatever you're scrolled to.

229
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.250
So even if you're scrolling and it's updating the scroll spy,

230
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.270
so whatever you click thes,

231
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.310
it's gonna update the hash there in the URL.

232
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.290
And I didn't want to focus too much on what bakery is and how it works.

233
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:56.750
Eso It's just been a quick overview of the functionality that's relevant to this project,
