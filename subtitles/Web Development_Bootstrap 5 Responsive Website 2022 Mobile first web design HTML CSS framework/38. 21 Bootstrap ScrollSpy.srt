1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
this lesson.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,920
We're gonna apply the scroll spy.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,180
We need some of the content from the last one.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm gonna move this up to the top and we had a bunch of links here.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,020
I can also update the content of these links because they were moving to particular

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,370
sections on the page and that was home about and contact.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,380
And what we want to do with Scroll Spy is a just which one is active.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,440
So whatever content were scrolled upon,

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,600
we want the navigation bar to indicate that,

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,030
and we do that with Scroll Spy.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,240
And now we need to specify the content that we want to spy on.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,750
So whenever there's scroll happening on this piece of content and we're gonna use the body

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,600
so we're spying on the body and looking for the event of scroll toe happen and then data

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,670
target is going to specify where we're getting the information.

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,010
So what?

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,100
We're targeting and what's being updated whenever the school is happening.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,710
So we're taking the knave one as the target because that's where our navigation bar is.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,080
And then there's data offset.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,180
So this just offsets where the data starts.

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,410
That So let's see what happens.

21
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,130
And now,

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,820
as we scroll through the different sections,

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,990
you can see that it lights up there at the top.

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,670
So all we did is connected.

25
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,150
The enough one Teoh actual navigation.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,050
And the rest is just being done through the scroll Spy,

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:33,010
where we're listening for the navigation bar to hit these particular anchors.

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,480
And as they hit the anchors,

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,130
it's gonna ply the active class to the various elements.

30
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,800
Used to see that as well.

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,940
When you go into the navigation bar,

32
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,350
make this a little bit smaller and I'll open up the an ordered list and we see that contact

33
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,930
has active what I scroll up,

34
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,360
the active goes to about and I scroll up right to the top.

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,410
The this one gets the active home gets the active so you see where the active class is

36
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,720
moving through the elements,

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,900
and that's automatically done with the scroll Spy
