00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
It's gonna be a
quick setup lesson

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.060
on how you can get started

3
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.950
writing Bootstrap and prepare

4
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.360
yourself in order
to create code.

5
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.815
In the upcoming lessons,

6
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.090
we're going to be
reviewing how to

7
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.455
get set up with Bootstrap,

8
00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:14.280
where we can take a normal
looking webpage and apply

9
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.570
Bootstrap to it and apply

10
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.705
the Bootstrap styling on
the Bootstrap website.

11
00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:20.940
When you go to getbootstrap.com,

12
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.250
there are CDN libraries,

13
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.080
so as their content
delivery networks.

14
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.035
So there's a CSS as well
as the JavaScript library,

15
00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:29.820
and there's also a
starter template.

16
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.590
You can use these in order to

17
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.870
start and it gets set
up with Bootstrap.

18
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.505
We're gonna be showing
you how you can build

19
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.170
quick photo websites
using Bootstrap,

20
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.085
the main website for Bootstrap.

21
00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.360
And to get familiarized with

22
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.770
bootstrap where
you can get all of

23
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.060
the different components and

24
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.210
additional details
is getbootstrap.com.

25
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.740
This will display whatever

26
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.960
the current version
of Bootstrap is.

27
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.430
So as I'm doing the recording,

28
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.895
the current version
is version 5.1.3.

29
00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.280
And the versions do
update all the time,

30
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.440
so some of the
components will change.

31
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.495
So this video is
gonna be based on

32
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.910
this current version
of Bootstrap five.

33
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.150
I am gonna be using an editor
in order to write the code.

34
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.000
The editor that I'm using
is Visual Studio Code.

35
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.290
Now if you already
have an editor,

36
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.580
you can go ahead
and use the editor

37
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.200
that you're most familiar with.

38
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.970
If you want to try a new editor

39
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.980
or if you want to try
Visual Studio Code.

40
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.570
This is the website for it,

41
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.525
so that's at code dot
Visual Studio.com.

42
00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:26.360
The editor opened on
the left-hand side.

43
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.630
And on the right-hand side
will be showing a preview of

44
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.520
the website content as we're

45
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.100
constructing and
building the content.

46
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.170
The editor code on the left and

47
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.345
then the website on
the right-hand side.

48
00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.100
If you want to open
up the website,

49
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.520
you can simply select it
from where it's located on

50
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.950
your local device
and bring it over

51
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.615
and open it up
within the browser

52
00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:48.905
the same way that I have it.

53
00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:50.915
I do suggest as you go
through the lessons

54
00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:53.210
of this course that you
try the code out to

55
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.850
get more familiar with what
you can do with Bootstrap and

56
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.595
you can customize it
and see what happens.

57
00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:01.100
So going over to
getbootstrap.com,

58
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.360
This is the place to

59
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.580
start where you can
download the files.

60
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.610
So they've got right on the
homepage a download button.

61
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.020
And this will download the files

62
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.225
locally so that
you can access and

63
00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:15.230
link to the CSS file as well
as the JavaScript file.

64
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.670
There's also a gets started

65
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.455
where you can link to the CDN's.

66
00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:21.395
It's CDNs are done within
the content delivery network

67
00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:22.580
and you will need to have

68
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.875
an Internet connection in
order to connect to these.

69
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.890
These are just live web
versions of the file.

70
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.690
So you can link your code to

71
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.340
the live web version and

72
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.440
bring it into your
projects that way.

73
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.330
There are some
advantages to using the

74
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.630
CDN's when ever they are online.

75
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.100
Chances are that the user might

76
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.050
already have at cash
within the browser.

77
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.300
So you might improve
some of your load time

78
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.150
as opposed to uploading the
Bootstrap files yourself.

79
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.800
You can do either one where you

80
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.465
could download the CSS file,

81
00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:51.995
download the JavaScript file,

82
00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:53.180
and then upload it to your own

83
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.875
server within your website.

84
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.365
So copy the CSS file

85
00:02:57.365 --> 00:03:00.410
and we're gonna bring
that in to the top.

86
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.875
Go ahead and open up your
HTML file in the top,

87
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.045
just under the title.

88
00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:08.840
Go ahead and paste the
link to the CSS file.

89
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.850
And that's going to
automatically bring all of

90
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.860
the CSS components and

91
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.710
the classes directly
within the project so

92
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.665
that you can start using
them and linking to them.

93
00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:22.025
I do suggest that you do
create a second CSS file.

94
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.530
And this is a file that
you would be using

95
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.740
that you could update and
apply some of the properties.

96
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.945
So this is a
customized CSS file.

97
00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:31.820
So, uh, creating, uh,
will allow you to

98
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.980
update properties
within your webpage.

99
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.930
Go ahead and create the CSS file

100
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.250
that you just link to from

101
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.050
the HTML and you'll be ready

102
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.030
to proceed to
create the project.

103
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.430
Let's go back to the
Bootstrap website.

104
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.055
We've brought the CSS,

105
00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:46.880
and we're also going
to be bringing in

106
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.355
the JavaScript using the CDN's.

107
00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.755
They also have links for
those on the website.

108
00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:55.490
We can also get the
JavaScript file and bring

109
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.560
the JavaScript file in the
same way that we brought

110
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.320
the CSS and JavaScript.

111
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.670
All of the functions that

112
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.260
you're going to need
four components.

113
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.940
If you're not using
any of the components

114
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.485
and if you just
want plane styling,

115
00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.200
you can just stay with
just the CSS file.

116
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.970
But if you are looking
at using some of

117
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.860
the components which
we are gonna be doing

118
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.780
and exploring in
the later lessons

119
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.505
that you need to bring
that in as well,

120
00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.920
where the JavaScript, you
do have some options so

121
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.380
you can get the bundled
version of the JavaScripts.

122
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.685
So the JS file,

123
00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:25.970
which is a minified version
as well as the CSS.

124
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.320
And this is going to include

125
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.970
both the pauper file and as
well as the bootstrap MSG S,

126
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.440
You can also separate those.

127
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.965
So bringing in the
Bootstrap minified JS file,

128
00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:39.665
which is not going to
include the pauper.

129
00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:44.225
The pauper is gonna be used
for tooltips and popovers.

130
00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:45.710
Once again, if
you're not planning

131
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.030
on using those components,

132
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.040
but you don't need to bring
them in and you can just get

133
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.505
the regular Bootstrap JS file.

134
00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:55.595
But if you are planning on
using the tooltips popovers,

135
00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:58.940
then you can select either
the separate versions of

136
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.265
those libraries or
you can bring it in

137
00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:04.205
as a bundled version
into the project.

138
00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:05.480
I'm going to go ahead and select

139
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.759
the bundled version and placing

140
00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.285
the script file just before
we close off the body tag.

141
00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:13.580
So just before in
the body tag as we

142
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.055
are gonna be interacting
with the DOM content.

143
00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:19.010
So we want all of the page
content to load first and

144
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.130
then access it using
the JavaScript code.

145
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.835
Going down to where we've
got the starter template.

146
00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:28.685
So this is a starter
template and it's got

147
00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:30.260
both of the CDN's that we've

148
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.015
just brought into our project.

149
00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:35.005
I'm also going to
have the Meta tags.

150
00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:37.115
These are required Meta tags,

151
00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:40.295
the viewport and
the UTF dash eight.

152
00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:42.275
I can just be added in the top.

153
00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:43.940
Now we've got our HTML file,

154
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.535
we're ready to start
writing some code in there.

155
00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.085
And alternatively, there's also

156
00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:51.410
a starter template
that you can select

157
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.990
and then you can just copy
the starter template.

158
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.510
And this is again
linking to the CDN's.

159
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.450
Or you could download the
files locally depending on if

160
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.890
you have an Internet connection

161
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.360
as you're working locally,

162
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.250
and then just copy and paste

163
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.875
the files directly
within the project.

164
00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:07.490
Save that.

165
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.855
And now when you open it up,

166
00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:10.445
we've got the Hello World.

167
00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:12.950
And this is going to be
styled with the Bootstrap.

168
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.290
If you were to take
the Bootstrap and

169
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.735
remove the bootstrap
and we refresh it.

170
00:06:17.735 --> 00:06:19.370
The Hello World is
gonna be quite a bit

171
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.305
different within the webpage.

172
00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:22.700
Now that we're ready to

173
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.425
start writing some
Bootstrap code.

174
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:27.770
And of course you can clean
up the peer commenting area,

175
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.860
so you don't need that
in your bootstrap file.

176
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.870
So that's what we're gonna
be doing in the next lesson.

177
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.510
So go ahead and get set up
ready to write some code.
