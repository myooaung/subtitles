00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
This lesson are gonna
be showing you alert

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.800
solar to allow you to highlight

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.210
content and give the user

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.400
an interactive
component that they

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.010
can close if you
add in the button.

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.530
And you do have some
options for how it closes.

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.720
So you can do a fade option

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.255
for it so that kind of fades
it out from the screen

9
00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:20.790
as well as you can just
use the alerts just

10
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.640
as regular alerts to
highlight content.

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.890
And also if you're
adding in links,

12
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.915
you cannot in alert link.

13
00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:29.580
And that's going to
take the color of

14
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.620
the parent element when you

15
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.019
are using the various
color classes

16
00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.340
that are available
within Bootstrap.

17
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.640
This lesson, we're
gonna be looking at

18
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.110
alerts and alerts allow us

19
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.170
to provide a predefined
way to create alerts.

20
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.810
And these are messages
that you can use to

21
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.600
pop up on the screen
for the user.

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.285
So let's set some alert classes.

23
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.220
Within the alert.

24
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.725
We need to specify
it as an alert.

25
00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.185
So container alert and

26
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.195
I'll update the text
content in there.

27
00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.820
And that provides this
type of component.

28
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.160
Without the color, you're

29
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.530
not gonna be able to
see the full alert box.

30
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.504
So let's alert value of success.

31
00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:14.945
And this is going to return back

32
00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:18.605
a greenish color
for the background.

33
00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:20.990
So the next one
that we can try is

34
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.359
going to be the alert primary.

35
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.800
And this is gonna be using

36
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.070
the primary color for
the alert elements.

37
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.950
Also, there's the
warning colors,

38
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.840
so that creates the orange

39
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.615
colored by default
for the alert.

40
00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:38.120
There's also a danger alerts,

41
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.135
so that's the red
alert by default.

42
00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.730
There's also the info alert.

43
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.070
So that gives you another option

44
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.990
for colors for the alerts.

45
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.220
Basically there's these pop-up
boxes that you can use.

46
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.540
You can also use the

47
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.930
secondary and then the
dark and the light alerts.

48
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.750
So those are also options
that you have for

49
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.580
the alerts where
we're setting the

50
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.635
secondary and then
that's the grayish one.

51
00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.470
And then the dark one is
gonna be the one that's dark.

52
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.760
The light is going to be sending

53
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.640
the alert as a light alert.

54
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.400
There's also the alert links.

55
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.200
You can add in links within

56
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.140
the alert elements
and set that up.

57
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.910
And then that's going
to look and it's

58
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.325
going to take the
properties of the parent.

59
00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.635
If you do have a hyperlink.

60
00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:26.240
Right now, I'm just
not going to link out

61
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.085
to anything with the hyperlink.

62
00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.365
So this is just
going to say Link.

63
00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.245
And then we'll close off
the anchor tag there.

64
00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.390
So that's gonna give us a link.

65
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.835
By default, the links
are gonna be blue,

66
00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:41.510
but it's good to be able to
set a class for the link.

67
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.985
And if you do want them
to be within the alert,

68
00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:48.620
and it is suggested that you
set it as an alert link.

69
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.780
What that will do is
that will just update

70
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.230
the link color to match with
whatever the parent is.

71
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.095
You can have those
across all of them

72
00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:00.200
and it's automatically going
to take the apparent color.

73
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.105
As you can see in the example.

74
00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:04.880
There's also options
for closing Alerts.

75
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.175
Alerts can be dismissible.

76
00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:09.620
And this is something that

77
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.200
can pop up and then the
user can close that.

78
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.020
This is going to
require that we allow

79
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.110
that the jet JavaScript
is available.

80
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.870
So you do need to link to
the JavaScript library in

81
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.365
order to close the
alert box boxes.

82
00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:26.150
And this is gonna be
a little bit more

83
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.070
complex for an alert,

84
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.975
a copy one of these,

85
00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:33.725
and we'll use the fluid
container for this example.

86
00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:37.535
The main parent of the alert
is going to be an alert,

87
00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:39.350
alert success and then allowed

88
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.240
in one more class and it's gonna

89
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.815
be called alert, this miscible.

90
00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:50.210
That's going to create
a dismissible alert.

91
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.915
We need to have a button
within the alert.

92
00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.825
It's gonna be different
than the anchor tag.

93
00:03:56.825 --> 00:03:59.930
And adding in the button
is going to give the user

94
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.340
the option to click that
button and dismiss the alert.

95
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.425
Setting up a button,

96
00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.515
type elements and
give it a class.

97
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.080
And the class is
going to be a button,

98
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.170
dash close class, which

99
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.245
will show up as a
default close option.

100
00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:23.105
And the data is
going to be data BS.

101
00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:25.925
And what it's gonna
do is dismiss.

102
00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:28.400
You need to add that
into the attribute that

103
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.920
it's a dismissible
for the alert.

104
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.390
And the alert is whatever is

105
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.175
contained within
the parent object.

106
00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:36.395
So basically that
gives us the x.

107
00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:38.210
When the X gets clicked than

108
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.430
that alert is going
to disappear.

109
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.700
That just adds another
option when you are

110
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.700
creating the alerts to
make it a dismissible.

111
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.955
And then whatever we have
for the apparent color,

112
00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:51.830
both of them are gonna show up.

113
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.210
When you click them.

114
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.965
That's going to close
and they're going to

115
00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.890
disappear from the
view of the screen.

116
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.680
There's also, you
can do an animated.

117
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.430
These are also additional
classes that you can add in.

118
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.935
Let's copy this again and

119
00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:09.650
we'll create a few
more, one of them.

120
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.615
So keep all of the same.

121
00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:18.650
Then we can do a feed and
show that will fade it out,

122
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.070
which is different than just
dismissing it right away.

123
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.680
So that's using the feed option.

124
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.660
And with the fade by default,

125
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.235
if you don't add in the show,

126
00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:30.035
it's not going to
actually show the alert.

127
00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:32.645
So it's gonna show
it as already faded.

128
00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:34.400
That's why you need
to add in both of

129
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.535
the classes in order to
be able to see them.

130
00:05:37.535 --> 00:05:40.690
And then let's update
these so that they

131
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.805
are different than the
other alert boxes.

132
00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:47.494
We've got the primary
info, danger and success.

133
00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:49.100
You can use all of the colors

134
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.810
for the parents just as we did.

135
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.850
And this is another option.

136
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.680
So typically if you
want to have an alert

137
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.540
that hides and
shows that you can

138
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.070
select it and have the user

139
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.200
interact with these
alert options.
