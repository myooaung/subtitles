1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
were you wondering why you need the Popper library that's included with bootstrap,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,140
where you've got that within your code?

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,560
Well,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,200
this is for the pop overs as well as the tool tips,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,060
so they're very similar in nature.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,210
And these provide a way to kind of cover over something with the tool tips and provide

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,480
additional information,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,720
and that's contained within the tool tip itself.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,090
So the title and this is the content that gets displayed within the tool tip.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,660
You can place them to the top,

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,010
right bottom left,

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,180
and those are the options that you have.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,490
The styling is typical with boots.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,450
Dropsy can do the various button classes for the main button,

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,160
and then the tool tip just sits on top within the attributes of the element,

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,450
so you can add it to any element the tool tips and typically they would be used for buttons

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,520
and the same thing for the pop overs.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,110
So the bought pop overs are more something that you might use for additional content,

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,270
and when you click it,

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,570
it has more a little bit more structure than the tool tip where you've got the pop over,

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,110
you get the same choices,

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,100
and this is also contained within the attributes.

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,360
So there literally very similar,

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,970
and all of the information that you've got within the pop up is gonna be contained within

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,510
here.

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,060
You can also add in titles,

27
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,700
so there's got an option for title,

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,820
and then the data content is the same.

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,640
So just do a quick run through of how these work.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,160
And then,

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,580
of course,

32
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,540
with the JavaScript,

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,900
you can also do some customizing of what happens when it gets clicked and so on.

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,350
So if you need that additional coding option with JavaScript that's there as well,

35
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,150
with the pop ups in the tool tips.

36
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,400
So going into our code,

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,220
create some buttons and then we'll apply the tool tips to these buttons.

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,860
So just regular type of button and applying a class.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,400
And again,

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,090
you could do this to any element that you want.

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,770
So it doesn't have to be buttons,

42
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,530
but primarily they are used on buttons,

43
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,910
and it will just say Click me for the button and let's add in the attributes so that

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,100
tributes is where the magic happens that you've got your data container,

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,610
and the data toggle is going to be a pop over so nothing happens yet because we haven't

46
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,010
specified any content.

47
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,450
Now we also have to equal that to pop over.

48
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,950
So no content yet.

49
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,830
And this is where we get the content.

50
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,580
So we've got data content,

51
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,760
isn't here is what's gonna be displayed in the pop pop over.

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,800
And you are also going to need to use within the script tags in order to enable it.

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,580
So there is the function in order to enable the pop over.

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,800
You could enable it to all of the data toggle whichever one's equal,

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,070
pop over and apply the method of pop over.

56
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,020
Or you can specify a particular element and apply the pop over just to that element.

57
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,600
So either one s.

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,670
So now when you click it,

59
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,730
it's gonna enable the pop over and that we can duplicate it and also apply a class of

60
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,350
margin top five to move that down and I'll put this one at the top.

61
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,390
So the 2nd 1 has the pop over at the top.

62
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,510
Let me just say that and a lot in some line breaks.

63
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,150
So does show up on the top and do a refresh the bottom top,

64
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,650
and they click it again to close it.

65
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,900
And it's gonna work that very similar to what we do with the tool tips.

66
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,300
We have to enable the tool tips as well.

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:32,040
So if one enable all of the elements with the tool tip the data toddler toggle tool tip

68
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,580
attribute that we can enable that I and do something very similar to what we've got with

69
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,440
the pop over,

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,920
where we've got data toggle is gonna be tool tip instead of pop over,

71
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,990
we also have the data placement.

72
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,070
And then instead of data content,

73
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,150
it's just gonna be titled.

74
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,750
And we can get rid of the data content for the body.

75
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,300
So the last one will be a tool to you can see when you hover over.

76
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,850
That's the tool tip and these ones you have to click.

77
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,980
So the pop overs you have to click the tool tip.

78
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,550
You could just hover over and you get that tool tip showing on
