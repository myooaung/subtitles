00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Now,

2
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.130
before you create any website,

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.350
it's always a good idea to do a wire frame.

4
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.950
First,

5
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.870
there's a number of tools online.

6
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.190
Actually,

7
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.640
there's tons of tools online,

8
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.820
and you could also do it within a free hand on a piece of paper.

9
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.350
So whatever works for you when you're designing your Web site.

10
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.410
And this is also why it's important to note and understand all of the options with the

11
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.650
various components in bootstrap.

12
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.290
So you draw out your wire frame first,

13
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.000
depending on how you want your website toe look and the draw.

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.260
I always the one that I'm looking at right now,

15
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.260
so you can just simply create different layouts for websites and create that,

16
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.670
and then you can move the various components around.

17
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.050
This is a great tool,

18
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.790
and this is one that I used quite often in order to plan out the way that I want my website

19
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.160
toe look and be able to also present it.

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.740
So there's also various colors that you can add in,

21
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.710
and you can really style your website really nicely.

22
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.440
There's also different buttons,

23
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.450
containers,

24
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.500
forms,

25
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.700
graphs and so on,

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.430
and in the upcoming lessons I want to illustrate all of the amazing things that are

27
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.630
available with bootstrap.

28
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.210
So it is important to have an understanding of what's possible and then create your wire

29
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.870
frame around all of the different possibilities.

30
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.530
So at the very heart of it,

31
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.400
bootstrap is the grid,

32
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.580
and the grid is what provides the core layout for bootstrap is number of ways to create

33
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.490
various,

34
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.440
easily different columns as well as arose.

35
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.240
And these all get divided by a main container where you've got the container class.

36
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.530
So either container fluid or just container and container will give you the gutters on the

37
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.900
side,

38
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.470
on the left and on the right hand side,

39
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.420
whereas container fluid will go full with and then within the container you can add in rows

40
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.420
.

41
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.130
You can add in as many rose as you want and think of it like a table like a grid when

42
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.410
you're designing your website.

43
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.790
So everything is already within a grid format,

44
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.870
and when you do your wire frame,

45
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.720
you can easily layout and see how many columns you're gonna need.

46
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.980
So,

47
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.630
for instance,

48
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.190
this one is going to need three columns,

49
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.350
so this one is 50% 25 25.

50
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.980
So you could really easily do a three column design there.

51
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.890
This one is two columns.

52
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.300
So this column is probably about 80% where 75% and then this is 25%.

53
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.260
And then back down here below.

54
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.360
There's three columns.

55
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.060
So this one is probably 25 50 and also 25.

56
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.200
So this can give you your basic structure off your website.

57
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.800
So let's create this structure using the bootstrap grid and a number of rows.

58
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.970
And also there are three rows here.

59
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.450
So open up the editor,

60
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.450
and I'm going to just create this within the main section because every website is gonna

61
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.380
need a navigation in the main.

62
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.900
I'm gonna provide a class of container,

63
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.020
and this is in order to contain the grid and create a bunch of dips.

64
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.720
And these dibs are going to break up the role so we'll have first rope,

65
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.050
and then another div inside of it nested in there.

66
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.290
And this can be for the columns.

67
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.060
And the first road did have three columns.

68
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.280
So it's create all of those three columns.

69
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.430
So right now they're going to be equal with,

70
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.740
and then,

71
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.140
of course,

72
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.750
of bootstrap.

73
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.640
You can adjust that.

74
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.690
So we're creating the basic structure.

75
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.150
First,

76
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.770
the 2nd 1 had two columns,

77
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.560
and then the 3rd 1 once again had three columns and going back into the wire frame design.

78
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.690
So we had ah website name and we had a number of sections of content.

79
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.730
So this first column it had the name and then these sections had some content in them and

80
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.490
then going into the wire frame once again.

81
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.300
So we had a big section of content.

82
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.650
Grab that content and this one had a title.

83
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.370
But we're not gonna worry about that for now.

84
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.590
Eso this one again.

85
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.380
This was too mean sections for the website,

86
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.150
and the 1st 1 had just a ton of content.

87
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.830
That's a little bit too much for our example.

88
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.050
And then here we had a new ordered list and a bunch of list items within,

89
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.580
and I'll just add in a couple lists there,

90
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.470
and we can transform them two buttons afterwards and then one last time.

91
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.640
Let's go into the example once again and copy this text.

92
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.440
And we are We have the two buttons here.

93
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.740
We have an image here,

94
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.650
and we have another list here,

95
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.510
So this one might not even be a list.

96
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.380
It just might be a couple buttons and some text underneath.

97
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.200
We could always adjust that with bootstrap.

98
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.090
It's really easy to do so in the last one we haven't image.

99
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.450
So this create an image placeholder there,

100
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.150
bunch of text.

101
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.250
And then we also have a new ordered list and several list items included.

102
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.180
Now we do want to adjust the columns of our website.

103
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.540
I can make this smaller,

104
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.050
so I'm gonna shrink the screen size so that we can get a better sense of how the content is

105
00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.840
being presented.

106
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.510
So we need to shift these over and with the bootstrap grid.

107
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.070
There is a number of ways to do that.

108
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.250
So we just use the call and the call on the break point.

109
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.520
This is only gonna break,

110
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.470
and this is gonna provide even columns.

111
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.620
So none of our examples needed that.

112
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.900
We need to have used the 12 column structure,

113
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.590
which is available in bootstrap,

114
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.730
and then we can also set various break points.

115
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.670
So there's extra small,

116
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.050
small,

117
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.470
medium,

118
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.890
large,

119
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.530
extra large and usually by default.

120
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.900
I like to have the break points on Call Dash MD.

121
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.610
That's because this is kind of the area where I can get enough content.

122
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.590
And this also really depends on amount of content that you're providing within the sections

123
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.590
.

124
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.560
Because if you set the break point to be smaller than depending on how much content you

125
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.960
have,

126
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.250
you might not want it to stock where it might not.

127
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.400
So it might be something that doesn't need to stock quite yet.

128
00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.160
So that's dependent on content is how you an output that the different prefixes in the

129
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.320
different break points.

130
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.780
So here's another example of the equal with for the auto columns.

131
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.750
And again we do need to have special column widths.

132
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.500
And this is more of kind of like what we're looking for where we've got one of three two of

133
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.770
33 of three and the middle one is twice as wide as either the sights,

134
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.110
and that's using the call Dash six and then just down below.

135
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.100
There's an example where the call dash five so you can have these,

136
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.960
and these ones are always going to be that with,

137
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.400
so they're going to be a straight column with it doesn't matter where you resize it,

138
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.750
There's gonna be no brought break points,

139
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.450
so they're not going to stock at any point.

140
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.360
So that's the big difference there.

141
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.240
If you add in the break point,

142
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.310
it's gonna stack.

143
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:53.040
So let's add in the break points and we're going to do the MD break points on our columns.

144
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.180
We've got the 1st 1 here where we're gonna MD and this one is going to be twice as wide as

145
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.610
the others and M D Dash three and M D Dash three.

146
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.860
So see what it looks like.

147
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.050
So now we've got that first structure.

148
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:17.850
Let's do the same thing for the next role where we've got MD and maybe this is M M D Dash

149
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.190
eight.

150
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.820
You might not want you would not want to set the break points.

151
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.570
So get up to you depending on the content,

152
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:29.510
do MD dash for so that provides that type of structure for the website,

153
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:35.130
and I'm gonna make these sides smaller so you can see these ones are the same with,

154
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.320
and that one is the same width as well.

155
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.380
And this was just a random default example.

156
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.040
Of course,

157
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.870
you probably want to spend a little bit more time creating your examples.

158
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.210
So this one is M D three and I should update this one to be three as well.

159
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.250
And then this could be night so that the with stays the same in the middle.

160
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.810
Here is MD six,

161
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.600
and I do have a lot of content.

162
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.590
So we might want to keep this one static and we might not want it to stock it'll.

163
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.650
So how about we do that for the last part there?

164
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.500
And that's another thing that you need to decide when you are designed your website where

165
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.470
you want it to break.

166
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.070
So now we see the way that it's gonna stock,

167
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.050
so these ones are already stocking.

168
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.320
These ones are stocking.

169
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.430
And what I mean by stacking is that watch where the buttons go.

170
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.750
They go underneath that other div.

171
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.810
But this one will always stay the same with the three column designs.

172
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.010
So doesn't matter where we shrink the page down to.

173
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.310
It's always gonna have the three column to move on to the next lesson,

174
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.430
go over to draw I o or get a piece of paper,

175
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.610
sketch out a quick website design,

176
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:43.280
and then produce that using the grid system in bootstrap and coming up,

177
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.620
we're gonna make a few other minor adjustments and tweaks to this website to be able to

178
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.820
present it just as we see it here.

179
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.970
Within this example,

180
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.790
that's still to come in the next lesson.
