1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
can this lesson.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,670
We are gonna be looking at the footer content and that's the one right at the bottom.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,440
We haven't done a whole lot with it,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,630
and that's just outside the main section.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,290
So I'm gonna take all of these spacers gonna put under footer that will bump up the foot or

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,780
area and allow us to work on it and also have it kind of mid screen there as we're working

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,150
on it.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,530
And within the footer.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:21,890
Why,

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,020
No,

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,690
we haven't done a whole lot with lists yet.

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:31,200
Eso this lesson we're gonna look at list groups were gonna list out a number of links in

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,840
the footer,

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,830
create the footer area,

15
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,550
make it fluid so all the way across.

16
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:43,190
Also add in a background color to match what the navigation bar is and set up the lists for

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,750
the fluid.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:50,580
Let's get started on that and going into the class for the footer and on a center,

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:57,020
the text so adding in text center class will center the text,

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,840
also setting up the container dosh fluid that will make it all the way across.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
Background is primary and safe,

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,110
so we refresh and of course we don't have any content in there yet,

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,570
so we can add in some content that says Footer,

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,050
that we can actually see it.

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,250
Also,

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,110
let's make the text by default to be white.

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,520
So there's our footer area and already to continue to build that.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,750
So make this smaller.

29
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,620
Remember,

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,760
the footers is going to be under the contact us,

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,910
and that means that we don't actually have a navigation to it.

32
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,390
So contact it's working.

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,350
Story is working projects about home all working properly.

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,330
So going into the footer,

35
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,860
let's create role and this.

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,050
So we're going to divide up.

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,430
So we're going to use the bootstrap grid just like we did in the previous lesson where we

38
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,170
set up our role and the row is going to contain a bunch of columns that are gonna hold all

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,030
of the information that we want in our Footer.

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,440
So within the footer,

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,550
we're gonna divide it up by a three column grid,

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,460
and the first column will be six.

43
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,560
So using just the default sizing on it,

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,500
and then let's set the copyright symbol for it.

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,800
So Copyright 2020 of 2021 whatever year it is make the copyright,

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,850
they might have some statement information for the users that are coming to your site.

47
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,130
So what could I do a whole lot on that as we did Want to focus on the lists.

48
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,620
So the lists are gonna be called him three across,

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,060
and we're gonna have two of them.

50
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,250
So both matching in size.

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,030
And let's set up the list for that so the list might have a title.

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,180
So give this a class to do that after my links.

53
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,420
That's the title.

54
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,040
And there's also some nice ways to transform text.

55
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,640
So I'm gonna just change this to uppercase associate gain change to upper case when you

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,350
apply that class to it and then the list items is going to be all within the UN ordered

57
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,760
list.

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,560
And let's apply a class to the an ordered list so that it applies.

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,850
The boots drops styling,

60
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,670
So this will be a list group class,

61
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,080
and I'll make the text dark for this one.

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,150
So we have some different types of links and the list items,

63
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,310
so the list items are all using the list group item class,

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,950
and that's going to style it with the bootstrap list styling,

65
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,830
and this could just be a number of websites,

66
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,700
the website one and we might have a bunch of websites that we want to showcase on our

67
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,240
website.

68
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,180
So in this case,

69
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,860
maybe we've got four different websites.

70
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,600
So 234 and then you could also update thes two hyperlinks or whatever information.

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:42,940
However,

72
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,200
you want to present the content.

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,250
That's the first list.

74
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,010
And let's duplicate this this structure,

75
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,410
and we'll do it within the second as well.

76
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,660
And going into the list groups,

77
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,880
you can set the top one as active,

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,490
so distinguish it from the other items.

79
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,150
You could also have disabled items in the list,

80
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,140
links and buttons.

81
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,010
So how the links and buttons air presented.

82
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,410
And this is a really neat one,

83
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,170
because this allows you whenever you hover over it,

84
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,060
toe have that kind of hovering effect.

85
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,080
So instead of list items,

86
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,560
you're using list group with hyperlinks,

87
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,680
and actually we're gonna change that.

88
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,150
We want to use the list a new ordered lists,

89
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,170
but we'll look use the list group so that we do have a different way of presenting the list

90
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,170
.

91
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,290
You can also do it with buttons as well.

92
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,490
So hyperlinks buttons doesn't matter.

93
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,020
Those just have default actions with HTML.

94
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,450
You can also stack it horizontally if you want,

95
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,570
so this is more like the navigation bar.

96
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,910
There's different colors that you can apply to the lists.

97
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,710
So it's also really neat feature with bootstrap.

98
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,050
And these are all that typical default functions.

99
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,500
Did default colors that you see in boots drop.

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,230
So whatever.

101
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,850
If you change your color scheme,

102
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,010
it's gonna change all of the primary colors.

103
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,080
Secondary success,

104
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,600
danger.

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,150
And that's the nice thing about boots Drop is that it does have all of that flexibility.

106
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,610
So now we see it.

107
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,960
We've got this list and I'm gonna get rid of some of this excess here.

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,430
I don't need an active,

109
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,840
so we'll remove that.

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,970
And then for the entire role margin bottom and I put a margin bottom of four on.

111
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,210
It actually changed this to pounding bottom of For that,

112
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,640
we have some padding around it,

113
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,100
and if we just wanted padding around the whole thing,

114
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,280
sometimes that looks better and that's a preference.

115
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,420
You could just do a patting of four around the entire object.

116
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,070
So now take a look at the project.

117
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,810
Make sure you've got the content as needed for your website,

118
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,850
and we're gonna wrap this up with a few tweaks and adjustments.

119
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,220
So one of the things is,

120
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,620
when you do click this.

121
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,270
We want the scroll,

122
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,480
spy toe work and scroll spies A really neat thing in Bootstrap because it allows us to

123
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,380
highlight whichever part of the navigation menu were on.

124
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,570
And this is ideal for single page sites.

125
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,660
That's a really cool feature and as well as I've got ah J.

126
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,560
Corey Tweak that will provide a smooth scroll.

127
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,710
So whenever the user clicks projects,

128
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,090
it will scroll it down in an animation format,

129
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,850
So that's still all yet to come in upcoming lessons.
