00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Lesson, we're gonna
be checking out

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.750
modals and how we
can use modals.

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.480
So how we can set Close
buttons within the modals,

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.835
set the header, the content,

5
00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:12.240
and the footer content
for the modal in order to

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.040
structure the modals so that

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.200
they appear nicely
within the page.

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.725
We're creating a modal
component within Bootstrap.

9
00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.095
We need to have two
pieces for the modal.

10
00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:24.660
One is going to be the
button that gets pressed,

11
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.445
that's going to
open up the modal.

12
00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.470
So give this one a class,

13
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.585
and I'm going to just
set this as a button.

14
00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.080
So we'll use a div
and this will open.

15
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.445
Whenever it gets clicked,

16
00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:40.565
it will open the modal object.

17
00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:43.295
And it needs some attributes.

18
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:48.965
So it needs the data
toggle attribute

19
00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.950
and setting the
toggle to be modal.

20
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.054
And also it needs
the data BS target.

21
00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:01.190
So this is going to be
the target of the modal.

22
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.240
I'll just create one
called mole mod one,

23
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.970
using the hash to indicate
that this is going to

24
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.970
be an id value that we're
going to be collecting.

25
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.080
Here. We can just say open
mod one and save that.

26
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.655
So it's going to add a button.

27
00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:22.085
Right now that's button's
not gonna do anything.

28
00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:24.440
And then to set the
modal so the modal

29
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.005
doesn't have to sit within
the main container.

30
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:28.280
It can sit outside of

31
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.290
the main container
as this is gonna be

32
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.120
a pop-up window
that's gonna show

33
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.310
up whenever the
button is clicked.

34
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.170
So let's go ahead and
we're gonna set and

35
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.660
create the components
for the modal.

36
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.910
So setting up the class and
set the class as a modal,

37
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.575
and then give it an ID.

38
00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:47.150
And that ID needs to match

39
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.430
with whatever we
set for the target.

40
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.635
As you can have multiple modals

41
00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:54.785
when within Bootstrap as
you're creating these modals,

42
00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:57.965
in order to create some
dialogue within the modal.

43
00:01:57.965 --> 00:01:59.480
Let's give it a class.

44
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.300
And this is where
the modal dialogue

45
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.780
is going to set modal dialogue.

46
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.775
Within the dialogue.

47
00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.665
Let's set up the content.

48
00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:14.340
We can have a modal
content option

49
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.700
and give this one a class
for the modal dash content.

50
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.360
All of the content for

51
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.190
the modal is gonna
be shown in here.

52
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.080
So you can create
some structure for

53
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.570
the modal that's using the head,

54
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.300
the body, and the footer.

55
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.865
You don't have to use these.

56
00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:37.205
But it makes the modal
look a lot nicer.

57
00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:39.290
So I typically will use them.

58
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.525
We've got the modal header,

59
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:44.630
and this is where all
the head content can go.

60
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.390
There's also the modal body.

61
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.140
And of course, this is where
the body content would go.

62
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.135
For the modal.

63
00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:55.370
This is where you'd have

64
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.870
probably quite a
bit of contents,

65
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.300
so you can structure
it in any one of

66
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.509
the elements are using some
of the Bootstrap classes.

67
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.990
Then the last one is going to be

68
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.685
the footer for the modal.

69
00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:11.850
So this is where footer
content can go for the modal.

70
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.720
You might have
something where you

71
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.745
want to close the modal.

72
00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.700
So let's create a button
and set this up as

73
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.075
a type button and
give it a class.

74
00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:26.465
What this will do is this is
going to close the Modal,

75
00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:30.440
Modal primary in
order to close it.

76
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.595
And it's going to use
the attribute data BS,

77
00:03:34.595 --> 00:03:37.280
dismiss, which will allow it to

78
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.970
close the modal object
whenever the modal is open.

79
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.425
And we'll just give it a,

80
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.675
some text in there to be closed.

81
00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:49.145
So we click the modal,

82
00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.370
there's our close button
that serve content.

83
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.095
This is the footer.

84
00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:56.630
And then we don't have any
tax jet for the header.

85
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.124
The header, you can apply
some additional structure.

86
00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:02.570
Let's set h1, h2.

87
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.980
And this can be the modal title.

88
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.290
And I'll just type
heading there.

89
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.865
In the modal opens up,

90
00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:13.085
There's our heading content.

91
00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:16.160
You can have additional
options there as well.

92
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.755
You can also have a
button to close it.

93
00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:21.680
You can put these
buttons as needed.

94
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.000
So typically you will

95
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.755
find them in the
header or the footer.

96
00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:28.310
Typically, you might not
have both, but you can.

97
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.705
So that is an option.

98
00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:32.270
So what this will do is
this is going to just

99
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.375
close the modal content.

100
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.330
You can also use a class
in order to do that.

101
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.625
So instead of the button object,

102
00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:43.490
we can set this
as a button close

103
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.810
class that will give

104
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.890
the x automatically and do
the styling for the modal.

105
00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.305
You can also set for the modal
to feed within the parent.

106
00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:02.990
Set it to fade.

107
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.415
That feeding effect that you
see there within the modal.

108
00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:10.235
You can do it with or
without the animation.

109
00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:13.595
There's also different modal
sizes that you can set.

110
00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:14.870
And that set within

111
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.814
the modal dialog where we've
got the modal dialogue,

112
00:05:18.814 --> 00:05:21.695
we can set different
modal sizes.

113
00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:26.270
Default size, but if you want
a small size for the modal,

114
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.535
you can set it as
a smaller size.

115
00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:30.020
And this is also going to scale

116
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.985
depending on the
size of the window.

117
00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:35.435
It's always gonna be a
small size for the modal.

118
00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.450
There's also a large
size for the modal.

119
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.770
And this is dependent on

120
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.110
how much content that
you're going to have.

121
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.230
There's also an
extra large size for

122
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.240
the modal size that's

123
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.215
represented with a
class of modal XL.

124
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:55.475
That's going to preside the
largest size for the modal.

125
00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:58.999
You can also do a modal
as a full-screen.

126
00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.760
Let's actually going to
be the largest size for

127
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.490
the modal that opens up in,

128
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.005
that just opens up

129
00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:08.375
whatever the full screen
of the window is.

130
00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:10.610
See if a ton of content
for your modal you

131
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.965
can use the full screen version.

132
00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:17.285
You can also use a centered
class for the modal.

133
00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:20.015
Let's actually add
another modal.

134
00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:21.950
You have an option to have

135
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.100
multiple modals and set this
one and link it to mod two.

136
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.490
And we'll use the success.

137
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.055
This one's going to
open up mod two.

138
00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:37.160
When you click it, it
doesn't open anything.

139
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.075
As we don't have anything
yet set for the mod to

140
00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:43.820
copy what we have for mod

141
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.330
one that we can use
this for mod two.

142
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.910
It's going to open
up the mod two,

143
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.905
and right now it's
set to full screen.

144
00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:55.520
Let's update the mod
one for the dialogue.

145
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.245
Let's sit the modal dialog
and set that to centered.

146
00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:02.959
That's an option to center

147
00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:05.630
the modal dialog where it's

148
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.795
centers that instead of
having it up at the top,

149
00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.870
it's going to center it within
the content vertically,

150
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.975
as opposed to if we just
do the regular one.

151
00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:17.240
Let me get rid of the
full screen option.

152
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.180
And that's going to bring it
at the top of the content.

153
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.585
And the centers that at
the center of the page.

154
00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:25.850
Those are some of
the options that

155
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.310
you can have for modals.

156
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.355
If you had some
additional buttons.

157
00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:33.020
So let's say you had

158
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.090
an input form or
something like that.

159
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.085
For this, we can set
this as success.

160
00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.770
I'll update this
one to be danger.

161
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.825
So you have multiple
buttons there.

162
00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:47.975
And maybe this one can say Save.

163
00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:50.240
And we just need to remove

164
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.150
out that these ones

165
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.130
aren't going to be
dismissing the modal.

166
00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.125
So whatever button you
have the modal dismiss,

167
00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:01.430
that's going to automatically be

168
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.245
set to dismiss the modal.

169
00:08:03.245 --> 00:08:06.005
These ones won't close it.

170
00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:08.825
Although the close
button will close it.

171
00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:11.180
So that's how you can
have multiple buttons.

172
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.825
You can use the various
components within

173
00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:18.890
the Bootstrap classes in
order to structure it.

174
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.919
So you can even add in a grid
within the modal pop-ups.
