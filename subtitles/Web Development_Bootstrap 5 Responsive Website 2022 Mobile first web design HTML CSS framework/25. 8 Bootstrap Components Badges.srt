1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
badges and boots drop.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,150
Allow us a way to do counts label and also apply attention to specific numbers and this

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,740
number of a different examples.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,290
We can also use the default colors.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,300
So the primary secondary success stager warning in fault,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,380
light and dark.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,050
So all of that corresponds.

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,850
You can also have them as pills.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,000
So pills air slightly more round.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,700
They've got the border radius being applied border radius property from CSS.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,780
They can also be within a link format.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,630
So the links actually gonna look the same way as the regular badges and this number of

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,650
options had to present this content.

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,460
So let's try that out in we're you just using the content contained within the mean

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,360
container and build out all the different options for badges,

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,080
so badges are typically within additional content.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:57,240
So if you have a class of H four and then some content and maybe over here we want to have

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,570
a distinguished part of the content,

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,670
see that in a span and then within the span,

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,850
you could specify the content number.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,580
So to turn that into a badge and we see that it takes the full H four because that's part

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,190
of the parent.

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,350
And let's add in a class,

24
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,310
and the class that we're adding in is a badge so right away when we add in badge,

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,550
there is some styling that's being applied to that element,

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,650
and now we can specify the color of the badge.

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,150
So let's use badge warning.

28
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,090
And there's all those default color options for the bootstrap,

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,080
so warning always is yellow on the default.

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,350
You can also do a badge light as well.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,000
So light,

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,450
dark,

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,330
and this will update depending on what the surrounding content is so light.

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,710
And then there's also Dirk,

35
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,420
so that will have it as a dark background in light text.

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,260
And there are some stylings.

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,380
Well,

38
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,940
there's one styling option for them,

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,190
and you could change it to badge pill,

40
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,740
which will apply the border radius to it,

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,140
so that will round it.

42
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,290
And this is something that keep in mind,

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,790
depending on what size of a number.

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,570
So when I only had just the one number,

45
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,750
it was completely round.

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,550
So why not want that effect?

47
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,390
And this is all dependent on how you want to output in what you want to look like.

48
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,010
It So I got a copy and paste this and we'll have a few different examples of the badge.

49
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,620
So maybe this one is badge success,

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,530
and this one might not be a pill.

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,600
This will just be a regular badge success.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,730
And that's how the differences off the layouts so you can use thes as needed within your

53
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,490
Web pages.
