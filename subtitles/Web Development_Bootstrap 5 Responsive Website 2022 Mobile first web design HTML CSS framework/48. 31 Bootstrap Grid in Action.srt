1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
We're going to copy some of the format that we used in the last lesson about the about me

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,530
section,

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,360
and we're going to do the same thing for the projects area.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,910
So this is where we can showcase the number of projects.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,470
Maybe that we've worked on have a type of a gallery,

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,730
and in this case,

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,250
So the last one we used card.

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,980
So we used the card grid.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,360
And this time we're going to use just the regular bootstrap grid.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,150
We're gonna have a number of rows and columns,

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,000
and it put some visuals under the Projects area and for the A boat.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,500
We did make some adjustments where we added in the margin bottom so that there is some

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,880
space between what the section or at the page is called and identified as and what the

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,850
content below.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,350
Also,

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,600
click it just to make sure that when you do click it,

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,040
it is right at the top,

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,370
and there's no overlap with the navigation bar.

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,400
As we saw that that sometimes happens,

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,270
and that's what we added in the spacer.

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,790
So just get make sure that those are all in place,

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,350
and if you find that you don't have that in place,

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,970
then look,

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,790
to make sure you're adding in the proper spacers and structure.

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,060
So we've added and quite a few things.

26
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,900
So I'm gonna temporarily copy and then we'll write the stuff over just below.

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,150
So we've got the A boat and the text is centered.

28
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,350
So the more important thing is that everything looks the same.

29
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,220
So I could just paste this and update the about US two projects.

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,660
And then also don't forget if you are copying and pasting than update the I D.

31
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,150
Otherwise it's not gonna work.

32
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,620
So just make sure that things are still going to the rate section,

33
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,550
and that is still going to the projects.

34
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,890
And the reason that it's not at the top is that there's no more room to scroll.

35
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,270
So there's nothing to scroll the projects up to the top,

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,680
and that's until we we add some contents.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,270
We're gonna add content in the footer.

38
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,290
There's going to contact us our story.

39
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,060
So what?

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,640
Next time,

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,100
when we do have content there,

42
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,570
it will scroll to the top,

43
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,990
just like that about works and the homework's.

44
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,650
The projects will work the same way,

45
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,030
so That means that we need to add some content.

46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,050
So going into the projects and we did want to structure it with the number of rows and then

47
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,850
within each one of these rollers,

48
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,710
we're gonna have our dibs to divide up the content and then have a column and will force it

49
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:25,390
to MD for you could also just use call if you want them always toe have this grid structure

50
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,630
so again depends on the content that you're presenting.

51
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,680
And then with inside of each one of these columns,

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,150
you might want to have an image and I get a source for the image.

53
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,160
Use that same place.

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,380
Soldier will make some updates and adjustments.

55
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,860
That does look slightly different.

56
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,420
And of course,

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,680
if you already have the images that just use the images that you have also adding in that

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,330
class of fluid because this is just a regular image.

59
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,350
Other ones already were structured because they were within the card format,

60
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,670
so we didn't have to add the image fluid and always with the images,

61
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,340
you should have the old text as well.

62
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,560
So just out of police holder for the old text.

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,590
So now we've got an image and update some of the colors of this image.

64
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,080
This is just a hex value.

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,350
Just picking them at random.

66
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,530
No particular pattern to that.

67
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,660
And then underneath the image we can add in ah product.

68
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,780
So I'm gonna wrap the image in a diff and this is good if eventually we want to add some

69
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,070
type of classes to that that we can do that.

70
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,020
And essentially,

71
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:36,320
it's just giving us the block of content when were structuring with the diff.

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,860
Also wanna have h three so class of H three.

73
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,620
Because I want to have the bootstrap H three classes.

74
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,720
So this could be product one.

75
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,020
And then,

76
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,970
just as we did with the cards,

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,570
once we determine what we want,

78
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,450
the first product call them to look like that.

79
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,780
We could just duplicate that,

80
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,240
and then this would potentially have some info about the product,

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,980
and they're not gonna put product one.

82
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,370
So it's going to make it easier for me to copy and paste it.

83
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:13,480
So now that once we're happy with the way that it looks and remember with bootstrap that we

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:21,340
can have up to 12 columns on a typical grid So that means that we can do 123 and that will

85
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,850
take full with across and it will stack once we hit less than the and the break point.

86
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,800
So it's something else to consider that if we don't want it stacking like that,

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,740
then we might also just want to use the call so that it's always within the grid format.

88
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,380
So let's update that actually to call so that it doesn't matter how small we shrink it.

89
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,380
We're always gonna have it stacked as the three,

90
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,760
and this is really working.

91
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,280
Essentially,

92
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,250
just like the grid was working.

93
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,550
It looks the same.

94
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,250
Let's update thes product numbers so that there is some distinction between them.

95
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,740
So this is actually that's product three.

96
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,540
That's product to L updates some or random colors.

97
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,110
That's too similar and say that.

98
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,230
So now we've got the three different products,

99
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:14,010
and you can also change the what's being displayed with the placeholder where the equal

100
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,630
sign is just text and it doesn't look like you could do a hash.

101
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,620
So I just do the product names to some of the stuff,

102
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,260
obviously doesn't always work well,

103
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,570
and this is just placeholder content.

104
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,550
So typically you would have some real content that you want to use.

105
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,150
And we probably don't just have three products.

106
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,850
We might have six.

107
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,970
So that's two rows of three in each column,

108
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,410
and you might also have additional.

109
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,450
Maybe you have eight.

110
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,120
Let's do it for eight and we'll update it.

111
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
And then we'll duplicated across.

112
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,090
So it gives it a yellow color and,

113
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,380
like teal kind of color.

114
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,930
So selecting that entire roll,

115
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,010
all I'm doing for the projects,

116
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm just duplicating it.

117
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,250
So we have another role and then making the updates to these products.

118
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,550
So this one is five,

119
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,780
67 and eight.

120
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,400
And then let's also update the corresponding values and save.

121
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,490
And then we should also update the colors just that that there are some differences and

122
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,450
what's being output.

123
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,630
I know some of them look fairly similar,

124
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,530
and there we go.

125
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,020
So let's see what this looks like on the larger sighs.

126
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,060
Refresh it,

127
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,250
make sure you see it and then now when we go to about when we go to projects so that it is

128
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,770
being shown here at the top,

129
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,500
you might also have some additional information or maybe even have 12 or so on.

130
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,630
So this is fairly flexible and how the content gets presented so you can take advantage of

131
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,380
the grid and present content.

132
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,540
You might also have some additional information.

133
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,150
So so info about the product.

134
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,640
This might be a little bit longer,

135
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,250
and the advantage of using the cards is that the structure is a little bit nicer,

136
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,700
so it's more self contained,

137
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,480
whereas here you'd have to add in than you've had in the borders and so on.

138
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,960
So depending on how you want output,

139
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,860
your content there is a big difference between using the cards and using just the grid.

140
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,250
It's up to you how you want to present the content on your project.

141
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,360
So coming up next,

142
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,120
we're gonna update the our story where we're gonna use somewhere components,

143
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,970
go back into the boots drop website,

144
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,430
and in this time,

145
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,300
we're going to use one of my favorites,

146
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,520
which is the carousel.

147
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,090
So that allows us to slide images and have multiple images that the user can slide.

148
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,810
So that's coming up next in this.

149
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,290
We're gonna include in the next section
