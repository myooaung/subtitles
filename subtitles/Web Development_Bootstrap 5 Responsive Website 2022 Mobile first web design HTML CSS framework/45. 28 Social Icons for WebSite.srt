00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
Hey,

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,650
welcome back in this.

3
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,020
Listen,

4
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,350
we're going to get social,

5
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:09,930
so we want to add in some social icons into our navigation bar at the top so that the users

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,710
have an option to see our social media sites.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,900
So going into bootstrap by default,

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,860
there's not a whole lot.

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,990
They used to have geoglyphs.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,580
They don't have the cliffs anymore.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,930
But they do have really good connection with fought awesome and font Awesome.

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,640
If you've never used font awesome,

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,250
it truly is awesome.

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,190
I'm using gonna be using the font awesome 4.7 icon reference they have in a cheat sheet at

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,500
4.7 ford slash cheat sheet.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,860
And this is or you can see all of the amazing,

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,040
awesome thoughts that you can have all these little gifts that you can have.

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,710
And of course,

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,180
they do have the social media,

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,730
and pretty much any type of lift that you want to use is typically available that for

21
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,350
awesome,

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,280
So I have to do is apply the CSS class,

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,850
and that will bring the icon into your project.

24
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,500
Or you could use the Unicode to his number different options to do that.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,930
So all you have to do in order to bring this into your project is either download the style

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,250
sheet or linked to it through the Cdn,

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,650
so I'm gonna simply link to it through the Cdn,

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,340
So bootstrap cdn dot com for slash font Awesome has makes Cdn for that,

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,310
and they do have options for the different versions of font.

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:27,930
Awesome.

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,690
I prefer to use 4.7,

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,760
because for me,

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,180
it's one of these here one Steve's.

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,680
But there are different versions,

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,780
and some of the syntax might be different.

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,680
So just keep that in mind when you are looking at front awesome that this particular lesson

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,250
I'm using 4.7 point zero so there might be different versions and the syntax would change

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,730
slightly.

39
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,810
But if you are using 4.7,

40
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,200
then it's going to use all of the same ones,

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
and it's all available on the cheat sheet.

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,840
So let's go over to the Cdn,

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,050
and we're gonna bring it in with the HTML Cdn.

44
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,690
There's number of ways to bring this into your project,

45
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,720
so going into where we've got all of our style libraries just paste that,

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,970
and that's all you have to do to bring it into the project.

47
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,950
So next we're ready to add another bar to our top bar,

48
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,920
and this is we're gonna have our social icons.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,430
So just outside,

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,080
but within the collapse area,

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,570
because we do want this part to collapse us.

52
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,000
Well,

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
we're gonna create another one ordered list,

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,630
and this is gonna be strictly for the two thoughts that we're using and we're going to use

55
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,990
the Twitter and Facebook.

56
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,260
So it was probably two of the most popular once.

57
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,360
So setting it up,

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,620
just as we did before,

59
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,750
where we've got the class and now have item class for the list item,

60
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:51,160
and then the hyperlink can go up to wherever the link for the social media is going to be.

61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,710
So whatever that link is gonna be and setting it,

62
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,170
giving it a class of knave link.

63
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,000
So that gets the knave link class styling applied to it.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,850
And then inside This is where the fun awesome comes in.

65
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:10,260
So you can go over to the cheat sheet and go down to where we find Twitter and cause there

66
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,080
are so many.

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,050
Usually I have to do a quick search.

68
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,930
S O.

69
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,100
C.

70
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,310
We've got a number of options for the Twitter one.

71
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,300
So f a square and they have the FAA Twitter.

72
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,840
I like to use the square ones,

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,240
but again,

74
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,110
this was up to you.

75
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:30,800
So in order to add that in to you could do a tag of I apply a class.

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,090
And this is where the fun awesome class comes in and then close eye off and go back into

77
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,920
the project.

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,310
And,

79
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,930
of course,

80
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:47,120
we have to update the a Norden list and give it a class of now bar now and then for the fun

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,120
.

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,750
Awesome.

83
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,980
We have to also apply a class of F A for fun.

84
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,570
Awesome.

85
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,750
And now we've got the Twitter icon there available for this hyperlink,

86
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,410
and we can duplicate that.

87
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,840
And we're also going to do the one for Facebook.

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,080
So include the F E class to indicate that it's a font.

89
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,520
Awesome.

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,810
So it gets that styling added to it,

91
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,960
and then the shortcut for this one is going to be Facebook square and safe.

92
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,970
And that applies the Facebook link within a navigation bar.

93
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,530
And because we've added into the collapse,

94
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,620
we see it's being applied within the collapse as well,

95
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,550
and just as we've moved right auto for this one,

96
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,780
I'm gonna move left auto for this one.

97
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,290
So it's always pulled over to the left hand to the left hand side,

98
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,000
and that one's pulled to the rate.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,690
So that's it.

100
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,490
How that's how you can add fought awesome to your project.

101
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,430
So if you do need the social icons,

102
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,120
or if you do want to make use of any one of the other icons,

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,330
and we're going to use some more of them as we progress to the upcoming lessons,

104
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,290
so do check out,

105
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,350

106
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,350
.
