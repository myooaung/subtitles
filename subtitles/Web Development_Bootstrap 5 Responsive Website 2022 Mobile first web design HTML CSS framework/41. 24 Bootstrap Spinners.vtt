00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
this lesson,

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.640
we're gonna look at the Progress Bar and spinners,

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.650
so these air components that you might be able to utilize that provide some animations and

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.700
really some cool effects for users.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220
So come cool visuals,

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.900
especially if you have a dashboard.

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.550
These will come in really useful.

8
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.990
And,

9
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.360
of course,

10
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.580
you do need to have something to measure for the progress bars.

11
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.540
You can make different colored ones striped ones,

12
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.790
combinations of progress bars,

13
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.580
animated progress bars.

14
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.710
So these show really well for it users a zealous spinners.

15
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.170
So these air useful to hide and show when you're ever you're loading content.

16
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.810
So whenever the content has finished loaded than you would hide the spinner and otherwise

17
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.850
you would show the spinner.

18
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.280
So it's just a default that is sitting within bootstrap,

19
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.500
and in most cases,

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.640
sometimes you need to use it.

21
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.620
Sometimes it's just good to have it.

22
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.780
There a few case you do need to use it.

23
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.820
There's also the different colors,

24
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.740
and these air just text colors,

25
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.080
so it's nothing different than regular text,

26
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.550
and these air treated just as text.

27
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.050
There's also glowing and growing spinners,

28
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.050
so these ones grow bigger.

29
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.420
Eso that's another option within the spinner grow,

30
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.880
and you need to supply it to the element,

31
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.510
the parent element for the content inside,

32
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.480
let's do a refresh.

33
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.420
Get rid of the content that was there,

34
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.060
and we'll walk you through some of the options that you can have with the progress bars,

35
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.340
and that's gonna be a relatively quick lesson.

36
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.800
So just meth specify it as progress,

37
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.770
and that's the parent class.

38
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.460
And then the content inside is could be the where the Progress Bar is.

39
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.130
And this is where you can apply the attributes to how long you want your progress bar to be

40
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.130
.

41
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.610
So the main classes Progress Bar and then specifying the style you could specify with with

42
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.940
25%.

43
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.780
And that's why it has to sit within,

44
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.660
because this is a separate element and you got to treat it as such.

45
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.470
And that's where you get the different width of 25% within the Progress Bar.

46
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.640
And you could also indicate 25% if you want as well.

47
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.560
So it's all self contained,

48
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.080
and you,

49
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.270
if you do want to create additional ones than go and creates,

50
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.680
so to create additional ones,

51
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.180
you just copy and paste.

52
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.660
So you do you need to have the parent and then the Progress Bar Insight.

53
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.230
So there are some options for styling the Progress Bar Seacon do a background of success

54
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.000
background styling so that would produce a green one and noticed this well,

55
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.170
that there's no spacing.

56
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.690
So if you do want to add spacing than you could do margin top five have spacing between

57
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.920
them.

58
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.180
There's also an option.

59
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.430
If you wanna make them wider,

60
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.150
you could apply the styling of height for the Progress Bar and that you would apply to the

61
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.710
parent.

62
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.280
And this isn't bootstrap.

63
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.450
It's just regular styling that you'd apply the height just lets you did the with and

64
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.380
whatever number of picks you want it.

65
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.890
If you want 20 picks,

66
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.900
if you want it 50 picks that will make it whiter so you get a height of 50 picks.

67
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.060
And if you want to have multiple bars,

68
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.620
you can do that as well where you could have multiple growers.

69
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.900
So maybe this one is background primary,

70
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.520
and that one is gonna be background success,

71
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.060
and you could just stock the bars.

72
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.430
So every 25% you add,

73
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.220
it will stack the other bars,

74
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.580
and they don't have to be equal as well.

75
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.090
So whatever you want to make them,

76
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.850
you can make them.

77
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.350
There's also an option for having a progress bar striped.

78
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.100
Let me copy some of this silver,

79
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.270
and this one will turn striped so we'll keep it big and you can mix and match the various

80
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.590
properties that makes a striped progress bar.

81
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.170
You can also animate it,

82
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.960
so it's another really cool one that's actually one of my favorite wants to do to an

83
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.300
immediate.

84
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.840
So I'm gonna change the color of this.

85
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.450
We have some different colors and progress bar instead of progress Bar striped or you can

86
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.830
include the striped as well,

87
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.440
and you could do add in the Progress Bar.

88
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.410
Animated gives a slight animation to the Progress Bar and the spinners themselves.

89
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.260
They're going to be really straightforward because they're just one element that you're

90
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.700
applying that Class two.

91
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.400
So the class is spinner,

92
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.410
the classes spinner border,

93
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.960
and that's gonna create the class by default.

94
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.410
And then,

95
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.120
if you want the different colors than whatever color you want the spinner to be,

96
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.250
then you to supply the different tax colors to it so you can see the spinners air there.

97
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.630
There's also,

98
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.190
instead of spinner border,

99
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.450
you can do spinner growth.

100
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.900
That's another different type of effect for the spinner,

101
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.990
and you have all the same color options.

102
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.790
A swell for them.

103
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.830
If you want to center,

104
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.900
align the spinner.

105
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:59.430
You can create another element to wrap around it and using the text center class that can

106
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.950
center align the spinner.

107
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.990
So just rap the rap the spinner with the Central Line and Tech Center and that will center

108
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.600
the text.

109
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.640
There's also options for the different size,

110
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.550
and the size is based on width and height.

111
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.350
So if you update the width and height of the parent,

112
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.680
it's gonna update the height of the spinner so style and equal that,

113
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.140
too,

114
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.850
with whatever you want your with to be.

115
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.100
Let's do three R E m.

116
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.460
And also to,

117
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.630
ah,

118
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.390
height of three r e m.

119
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.790
And save that that's gonna make bigger spinners.

120
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.440
Oh,

121
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.590
promise the three there.

122
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.950
So it looked a little bit weird there.

123
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.770
Did you make it as biggest you want and notice this?

124
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.010
Well,

125
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.030
if they're not matching that,

126
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.750
it kind of is this oval shape.

127
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.290
So these are just some of the options that you could have for visuals within bootstrap
