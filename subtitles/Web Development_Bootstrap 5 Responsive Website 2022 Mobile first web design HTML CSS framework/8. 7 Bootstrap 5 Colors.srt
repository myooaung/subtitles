1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
This lesson we're looking
at the colors of Bootstrap.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,465
So they do come with
default color palette.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,670
And you can of
course update these.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,980
And the idea is that
if you update like

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,500
a primary and by
default it's blue.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,405
If you update it
to a custom color,

7
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,250
than that will
propagate across all of

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,995
the classes that are
using the primary color.

9
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,020
So it gives you an
opportunity to update

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,690
your entire website with
a scheme of colors.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,085
These can be combined.

12
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,510
So I'm gonna give
you an example of

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,420
the text values and then
the background values.

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,655
And you can apply
these to any element.

15
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,700
And you can also use them in
combination with the text,

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,260
the background, and so on.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,175
Let's talk coming
up in this lesson.

18
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:43,895
Bootstrap five comes with
contextual classes for colors,

19
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:46,145
and they can provide
different colors.

20
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:47,960
So you can provide meaning for

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,405
your elements just by
applying the colors.

22
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:53,375
Let's create an select a few
of those different colors.

23
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,890
I'm going to just add in

24
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,510
multiple elements and these

25
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,190
are just a bunch of divs here.

26
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,660
And then we'll apply some of

27
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,260
the color classes to the
various page elements.

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,305
We do have the
ones for the text.

29
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:09,410
And I'll set the
class here and set

30
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,400
that to be text slash muted.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,235
And it'll just set that
as container muted.

32
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:20,585
That's slightly graze out
the content of the class.

33
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:21,905
Let's try another one.

34
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,810
And thus, this one is gonna be

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,580
the one that is commonly used.

36
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,440
So this is a Texts primary.

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,295
This is the primary
color that you can use.

38
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:34,970
And I'll set the container
value to be primary as well.

39
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,890
So typically by default that's

40
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,675
going to be a bluish color.

41
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:40,880
There's also a success.

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,460
So setting it as text success,

43
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,325
and then these colors are
repeated within the background.

44
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:48,500
There are also repeated
within the tables.

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,480
They're repeated over and

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,519
over again within
the various classes

47
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,410
so that you can reuse
and you can select

48
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,765
these color schemes
really easily.

49
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,700
And then if you update
the color scheme,

50
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,500
that will update
all of the colors

51
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,065
for those elements
within the page.

52
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:05,435
There's also a text info.

53
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,835
I'll set that to container info.

54
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:11,540
So that's light-blue
successes by default green,

55
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,055
the primary is blue
for the warning.

56
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,930
So this is another
one that you can use.

57
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,700
And this is gonna be by default,

58
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,070
an orangeish yellow color.

59
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,789
There's also a text danger.

60
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:29,315
So this one, by default
is going to be red.

61
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,640
And it'll set these
ones as well.

62
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,900
So that's a red color.

63
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,390
The warning is an orange color.

64
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,195
There's also a secondary text.

65
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:42,620
This is slightly lighter
than the mean text.

66
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,445
And that's a text secondary.

67
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:50,555
And I'll also put thought
into the container there.

68
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:53,285
So it's similar to what
we see with muted.

69
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:57,935
And there's a text dark and
a text Light class as well.

70
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:00,290
These can be used in combination

71
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,690
depending on what you're
setting your background.

72
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,420
If you're setting
your texts too dark,

73
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,615
then that means that your
background should be light.

74
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:11,810
Whereas if you're setting
your texts to light,

75
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,905
That's gonna be ideal
for a dark background.

76
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,800
Let's set all of those
so you can see the light

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,860
one disappears because it's
completely white there.

78
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,580
You can also set
background colors as well.

79
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,700
And I'll just copy this block.

80
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,790
We're setting these
divs and I'll set

81
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,884
the background colors
within the fluid example.

82
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:38,524
These are the text values.

83
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:40,220
So we can select
those and we can

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,155
update those two background.

85
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,580
And it's going to apply those

86
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,515
color schemes to the background.

87
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,780
And then you can use
various combinations

88
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,040
of these two set,

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,260
either the texts colors or you

90
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,139
can set the background colors.

91
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,700
And this is when we are saying

92
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,830
the background
color to dark than

93
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,510
the texts colors
should be set to

94
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,865
light and then vice versa.

95
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:04,805
Otherwise, you're not gonna
be able to see the text.

96
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:07,415
So you'd use it in a
combination where you'd have

97
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:10,310
the text light and
then you'd have

98
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,370
the text dark so that
you could see the texts.

99
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,870
So it'd be the opposite.

100
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,550
So that's how you can
use the light and

101
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,549
the dark for setting the colors.

102
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,590
These colors are
gonna be repeated,

103
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,480
so they're not always
all available.

104
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,500
But for the most part,

105
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,140
the primary success
info warning and

106
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,184
danger are pretty much
mostly available.

107
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:33,530
And even when we're looking
at tables and as well,

108
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,300
there's a lot of other
examples where you

109
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,160
can bring this in and set

110
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,240
the color values to the
elements within your HTML.
