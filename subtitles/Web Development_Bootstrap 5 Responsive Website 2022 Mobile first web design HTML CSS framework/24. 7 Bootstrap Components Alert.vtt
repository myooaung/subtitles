00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
this lesson.

2
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.800
We're gonna be looking at bootstrap alerts.

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.780
They provide us a way to provide a message to users,

4
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.290
and these really stand out and they're nice and colorful.

5
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.800
So they're using the default bootstrap colors,

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.310
Primary secondary success,

7
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.810
danger,

8
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.780
warning info.

9
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.520
And there's also light and dark.

10
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.710
And there's various ways,

11
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.400
so you can also update the link color inside as well,

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.200
and also update additional content.

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.460
You can add the horizontal rule,

14
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.550
so to break up some of the content if you've got quite a bit and in order to make them

15
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.450
dismissible,

16
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.950
you do need to have JavaScript,

17
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.440
and the JavaScript will allow you to click the alert and close the alert.

18
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.850
Let's try that within our code.

19
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
And I've just cleared out most of the content that we work on.

20
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.280
In the earlier lessons,

21
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.020
I've still linked to the bootstrap CSS as well as the JavaScript,

22
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.710
because for most of the components,

23
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.420
you are gonna need to have the JavaScript.

24
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.650
We're going to rate the main code contained within this main container element.

25
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.290
And this is where we're gonna try all the different alerts and all the wonderful things we

26
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.990
can do with bootstrap.

27
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.080
So creating a diff first in this div is gonna be what the alert is going to be sitting with

28
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.750
him and then applying a class to make an alert so soon as I apply the alert class to it.

29
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.100
It already applies some styling to it,

30
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.510
where it kind of bumped it in and moved it over,

31
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.040
and there isn't any color yet to it.

32
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.110
So let's set up the alert as primary alert,

33
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.410
and we just put more content.

34
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.360
And as we saw,

35
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.740
you could do the horizontal rules and whatever.

36
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.330
And if you do need to have different colors,

37
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.690
so looking at the bootstrap color scheme,

38
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.550
so if you had something that maybe was approved,

39
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.590
you might want green.

40
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.050
There's also the danger there's warning.

41
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.100
So these called these classes.

42
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.850
They're going to come up over and over again.

43
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.470
The's class names for the different default colors.

44
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.050
There's info as well,

45
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.950
and you would choose whatever the appropriate one is that you want to use.

46
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.820
There's also an option to update the link color.

47
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.550
So let's say,

48
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.370
for instance,

49
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.260
we had ah hyperlink for the hello world,

50
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.610
and we want to link out to something or other within the message.

51
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.950
We get updates and we could set this as a plus link.

52
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.050
And that's alert link.

53
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.210
Actually,

54
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.370
the classes alert link,

55
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.540
so this alert link will be in line with the colors of the parent.

56
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.090
If I update this to danger,

57
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.920
that will change slightly as well.

58
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.300
And that's what we can do with alerts is we can update these.

59
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.420
You can also have a heading for an alert,

60
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.590
which is also another need option.

61
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.830
So if we had an H three,

62
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.600
and just to make sure that the user knows that this is an alert and apply a class of alert

63
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.630
heading so that stays within the alert style.

64
00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.000
So it's got a default for that where it's applying some default styling to that if want to

65
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.360
make it dismissible.

66
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.050
That means that we need to add a button in order to close it and adding in the close button

67
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.870
at the bottom.

68
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.260
A swell will allow the user to be able to click that to provide a close.

69
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.150
So let's do a class select in that class of clothes and also adding in the data,

70
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.400
dismiss,

71
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.450
attribute and indicating that the attribute is an alert and then within the but in itself

72
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:41.220
going to create a span and we'll add in the times symbol within the span of the button.

73
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.940
So now whenever the user clicks that they're gonna be able to close it.

74
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.150
Let's try it outs and refresh.

75
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.610
So there's our alert,

76
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.850
and there's the button in order to close.

77
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.920
So when the user selects the button,

78
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.390
that's going to disappear,

79
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.950
the alert from the screen.

80
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.960
So try that one more time and close,

81
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.050
and it's gonna close the button on the screen.
