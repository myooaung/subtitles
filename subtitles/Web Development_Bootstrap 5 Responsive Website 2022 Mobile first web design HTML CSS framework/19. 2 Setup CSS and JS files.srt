1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
Hey,

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,100
in this lesson,

3
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,220
I'm going to demonstrate how rapidly we can design a website.

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,970
So we're starting out with an index dot html file.

5
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,740
So it's just got a basic HTML structure where we've got a title.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,700
I've also added in the meta the View Port eso This will allow it to fit on mobile devices.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,850
And because bootstrap is responsive and built mobile first,

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,090
it's always a good idea to include this meta information as well as the utf eight and the

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,320
language that you're gonna be using on your Web page.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,600
Then I've got ahead section So this is our heading area for the websites have got a div

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,530
with potentially three different columns off content that we can add within the diff and

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,560
then a footer area where I've got some copyright information.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,460
So taking all of this just regular HTML code,

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,350
we're going apply bootstrap to it to quickly transform it into a bootstrap website.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,040
So there's a number of options that you have with starting with bootstrap so over at the

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,050
getting started introduction page,

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,940
it gives you the links to bring the CD ends.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,730
And there's also the JavaScript files you can copy these and simply bring them into your

19
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,370
project.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,860
And that will link to the online libraries of the bootstrap CSS File and the JavaScript,

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,580
the J Query file,

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,360
the JavaScript file and also the bootstrap JavaScript file.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,550
So the boots the J quarry for those that are familiar with Jake Worry,

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,430
this is a slim version of J.

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:28,820
Corey.

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,830
So if you are looking to bring Jake weary and develop with Jay Query,

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,500
then it's advice that you do get the full J.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Corey Library because this is a slim,

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,940
trimmed down version of the J.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,230
Coury Library and the M I end within.

31
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,690
All of these file names means that it's men ified,

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,060
and what men ified means is that all of the white space has been removed.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,950
But there's also a starter.

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,450
Templates Seacon Select the starter template,

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,900
and you can copy this.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,880
And this is a great place to start because it has all of the CD ends and all of the

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,670
JavaScript libraries that you need in order to run Bootstrap.

38
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,800
It's already in place,

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,480
so if you want to dive right in and just without any download right on your system and

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,460
start working with it.

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,110
You can do it this way as well.

42
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,450
There's also another option,

43
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,060
so there's actually a bunch of options.

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,950
You can get it on,

45
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,600
get hub.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,230
So this gives you a link to the get hub repository where they've got boots drop and see.

47
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,550
It's a super popular to bring boots drop in from get Hub.

48
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,500
There's also just different ways that you can,

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,280
uh,

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,050
access it using the terminal.

51
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,340
So they've got all of the different commands that you can bring bootstrap into your

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,960
projects.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,890
And then also,

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,350
lastly,

55
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,810
of course,

56
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,920
there's a way to download the source files,

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,430
So if you click the download,

58
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,980
it's gonna bring you over to the download file,

59
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,760
where you can select the type of download that you want.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,190
So there's the compiled CSS and Js files,

61
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,980
so this is typically the one that you want to use where you can just download the CSS and

62
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,200
JavaScript files,

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,010
and then you can link to those directly from your project.

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,430
And then,

65
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:02,770
of course,

66
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,300
don't forget.

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,360
You need to upload thes as well onto your website.

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,670
For them to be able to work properly.

69
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,630
There's the whole source files with the S,

70
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,230
a S s compiler.

71
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,680
Eso If you want to go that route,

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
this is also on option.

73
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,280
It was going to download a ton of files and there's gonna be a ton more information here

74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,890
downloaded.

75
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,440
And there's also one where we've got pre built examples so you can select those and

76
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,410
download via the pre built examples.

77
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:30,780
And,

78
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,220
of course,

79
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,650
again,

80
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,020
boots drops cdn You can bring it in through the node package managers,

81
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,160
though,

82
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,930
doing an NPM install boot boots drop There's bring it in with yard Ruby composer and just a

83
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,300
ton of options to bring it in.

84
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,440
So let's download the file,

85
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,190
and this is just gonna download CSS folder and A.

86
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,360
J s folder.

87
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,700
So when you download that within the CSS,

88
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,820
you're going to find that you've got the bootstrap grid.

89
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,450
You've got all of the bootstrap files,

90
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,810
and this is the main one here.

91
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,300
The boots drop CSS.

92
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,110
So if you are to open this and I'm gonna open it within brackets,

93
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,520
they can take a quick look at it.

94
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,030
Eso within the bootstrap file,

95
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,920
you're going to see all the different classes that we're gonna be using,

96
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,310
and the non unified one is the one toe look at if you just want to look at all the

97
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,090
different properties and values that are being set because this is the one with where it's

98
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,690
nice and neatly laid out where you can see what the H r does were displayed for,

99
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,190
and we are gonna be going over what the's classes do and how we're going to bring them into

100
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,800
the project.

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,550
So that's another way to bring bootstrap in and then also within the Js file.

102
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,990
If you open up the Js folder so it's gonna download two different folders,

103
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,380
and then this is the bootstrap Js file so we can open that as well within brackets,

104
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:57,330
the various JavaScript functions that are built in to boots drop and that provide the

105
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,200
components all of the capabilities that they're able to do.

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,740
So just says she would any other style sheet you can link to it,

107
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,340
specifying that this is gonna be a style sheet and then specifying the location of the

108
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,010
style sheet.

109
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,200
So it's located within the CSS directory and then select the bootstrap CSS file,

110
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,270
and that's going to allow you to bring Bootstrap into the project and then also for the

111
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,050
JavaScript.

112
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,940
So the JavaScript files.

113
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,500
They're gonna be a little bit more complicated because you need to specify the source of

114
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,240
the files,

115
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
and they're all located within the JavaScript file.

116
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,110
So the 1st 1 that you need to bring in is the J.

117
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,120
Corey and then the popper,

118
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,530
and then,

119
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,140
lastly,

120
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,630
the bootstrap Js.

121
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,280
So without the other two,

122
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,600
it's not gonna work properly for all of the components.

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,090
So I'm gonna just copy and paste so that we've got a sampling of the CD ends as well as the

124
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,000
CD at the direct link for the style sheet.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,120
So now that we've bought Bootstrap into the projects,

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,240
let's save it and go back out to our project and refresh it.

127
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
So right away we get the bootstrap styling being applied.

128
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,150
So now let's go through and add some classes.

129
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,350
I'm gonna add in some of the common classes from bootstrap.

130
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,440
And,

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,800
of course,

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,990
we're gonna be covering these in more detail in the upcoming lessons.

133
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,300
I'll also add it to the footer when we refresh.

134
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:24,710
So you can also wrap the parent in a container and then set up a grid with class and rope

135
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,610
and then each one of these can function as a column.

136
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,900
So you do have some options for column.

137
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:38,450
If you just do seal l to indicate column and put it on all the same level Dibs.

138
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,020
What's gonna happen when you go out here?

139
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,280
You're gonna have are three column website already built there.

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,720
There are a few options with the container so you can do a container fluid and that will

141
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,990
spread that container all the way across.

142
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,060
And this is fully responsive website.

143
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,820
So when you do a resize of the space that you have for the website,

144
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,600
I'll move this over to the right hand side so that I can shrink and expand the website

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,450
content and then also if want to align the text and its text center.

146
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,970
So what that will do is that will center any text that we have.

147
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:25,130
And we also did this see that we had some larger text size using the display for a class.

148
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,040
So going back into the bootstrap CSS,

149
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,300
we've got all of the classes listed here so we can see what size display four is.

150
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,310
The font weight.

151
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,350
The line height display three display to display one.

152
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,800
Let's go back in here and refresh it.

153
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,300
And now we've got that heading.

154
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
It looks a lot bigger,

155
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,000
lot better,

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,840
so spreading it out that maybe this is called to call,

157
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,390
too,

158
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,220
and I'm going to be covering how the grid works in the upcoming lessons.

159
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,540
So this assist a brief example of how he can split up the columns into different sizes.

160
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,140
Essentially,

161
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,150
there's 12 columns across,

162
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,950
and the way that the grid works is it structures each one of these to take up the

163
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,210
appropriate space.

164
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,780
So if we've got eight than that's taking up 66% of the available space,

165
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,610
and the rest of the four out of 12 is shared by the other two.

166
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,450
So this is taking up 2/3 and the other two are just taking up 1/3.

167
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:31,090
So they end up being 1/6 of the available spacing for that parent element role,

168
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,010
and basing it off of 12 makes it really easy to divide the columns.

169
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,150
To try it out,

170
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,540
bring Bootstrap into the project,

171
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,070
apply some of the classes that we've covered,

172
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,490
