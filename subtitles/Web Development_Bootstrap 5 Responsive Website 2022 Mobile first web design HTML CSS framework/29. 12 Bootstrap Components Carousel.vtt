00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
this.

2
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.640
Listen,

3
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.770
we're gonna look at the bootstrap carousel,

4
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.390
so this is a way to do a slide show and that can cycle through images.

5
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.950
You can also have text on top of the images,

6
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.420
so the number of ways to present the slide show you can also add in various controls to

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.100
move to the next slides.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.710
The users of your website can move manual to the next slide.

9
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.130
There's also indicators you can add in both indicators as well as the controls.

10
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.290
So those air multiple options that you can have within the slide and that allows the user

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.750
to interact with the content and move to whatever slide they want to look at.

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.260
You can also add in captions on top of the image.

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.250
That's a nice effect to find out more information.

14
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.230
There's a cross fade options is different types of feeding that we can do as well.

15
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.020
You can customize the intervals,

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.820
so by default it's set to one second,

17
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.270
but you can update the whatever the milliseconds air going to be.

18
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.150
So this case that data interval is 10,000 milliseconds,

19
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.680
so that's a 12th interval so you can customize the various intervals as needed.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.330
And that can be done with JavaScript setting the interval as well as you can do it within

21
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.510
the attribute,

22
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.150
calling it data interval.

23
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.250
So just like the other components that was seen within bootstrap,

24
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.740
you don't actually have to go into the JavaScript code.

25
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.200
You can handle all of those updates just out putting them and updating the attributes for

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.790
the element.

27
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.370
So let's start by creating a diff,

28
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.120
and you need to have an i D.

29
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.200
In order to identify it,

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.240
I'm gonna call it Slide one,

31
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.740
give it a class of care,

32
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.630
care ourselves so the classes carousel slide,

33
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.270
and you do need to add in on a tribute.

34
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.460
And that's called data right and identify it as a carousel so that the JavaScript knows how

35
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.950
to identify it and how to handle the content contained within.

36
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.910
That's our initial carousel and then inside of the carousel.

37
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.850
So there's B'more dips to wrap the content,

38
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.440
and then this first class is gonna be the carousel inner.

39
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.610
And that's just carousel dash inner.

40
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.770
And this is where all the inside content is going to sit for the caress ALS and create

41
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.410
another div to have all of the different carousel items,

42
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.250
these air all having the class of carousel item,

43
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.390
and the 1st 1 is gonna have the active class so that we can identify whatever the 1st 1 is

44
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.910
going to be.

45
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.090
And then here you would place an image with the source.

46
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.790
I'm gonna use the same place older image.

47
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.650
So it's our place.

48
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.500
Older image.

49
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.240
And then you have to make the image responsive and set a with for the image.

50
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.820
And you can do that with boots.

51
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.850
Drop where we can set a width of 100 and said it to D Block,

52
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.600
which will turn it into a block format for the image.

53
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.390
And with these types of sliders and care cells,

54
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.590
you should have fairly similar dimensions for the images of the wise,

55
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.800
they just won't look right.

56
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.980
Eso this one.

57
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.110
I've updated to be 500 by 300 and then adding in some additional images and updating the

58
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.370
images so that they actually say something different,

59
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.000
so that could be second.

60
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.830
That could be third and so on.

61
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.150
So we see that they are actually rotating the different images,

62
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.160
and this is happening on a default interval of every second.

63
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.670
I mean refresh and actually placed them all active,

64
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.530
So let me remove the active part of it.

65
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.680
So the active is the default first image,

66
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.330
and then the intervals of the images will rotate.

67
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.060
The image is now to second,

68
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.780
and then through the next interval,

69
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.750
it's gonna update it to the third image.

70
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.080
And that's so you can move through the intervals.

71
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.880
And a lot of times when you've got people coming in to interact with your content,

72
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.780
they might.

73
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.710
They might not want to wait till the content updates,

74
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.950
and that's where you can add in other controls.

75
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.780
So you might want the Chevron's on the left and the right side so the user can move and

76
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.750
navigate through them.

77
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.330
So set these up as hyperlinks,

78
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.840
and they have to identify to whatever you give your mean parent I d as gonna move this down

79
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.870
a bit so we can see it.

80
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.110
So that's where the hashes going.

81
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.610
That's where the hyperlink is gonna be.

82
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:30.720
Go and set the rule as button and a data slide attribute is gonna be the previous role,

83
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.940
and then the other one is gonna be the next and then Lastly,

84
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.290
let's out in a class,

85
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.950
and the class that we're adding in is care,

86
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.740
carousel control and previous.

87
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.810
This is that previous control,

88
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.930
and we also need an icon for that.

89
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.340
So we need a way to identify.

90
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.010
If you already have some type of icon that you want to use,

91
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.720
you can add that in as well.

92
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.050
And Bootstrap does come with an icon that you can use so applying the span class and it's

93
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.540
ah rather long class.

94
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.250
So it's carousel control previous icon.

95
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.430
So that adds in the icon there that we can see and I'll duplicate it and will do the same

96
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.350
thing for the next.

97
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.420
So the H ref is still to the seem.

98
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.690
The slide is the data slide is going to be next.

99
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.350
The carousel control class is also going to be next,

100
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.650
and the icon is also going to be next.

101
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.700
So that way,

102
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.190
now the user coming in can control the slides.

103
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.160
There's also the indicators at the bottom so you can use both or you could use either one

104
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.350
and we can represent those as an ordered list.

105
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.840
So adding in the list items and then going to add the class and the class for the

106
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.560
Indicators is care or sell dash in carousel indicators.

107
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.130
As soon as I added that we get that 1st 1 popping up there and then we need to specify the

108
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.860
attributes so the data target is going to be equal to the main parent.

109
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.290
So that is slide one.

110
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.320
So identify the main parent,

111
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.380
and then what's slide we want to go to.

112
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.550
So this is zero based,

113
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.300
like a raise,

114
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.470
so slide and whatever slide we want to slide to whenever it gets clicked.

115
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.610
And we can copy this over to three times because we've got three separate slides there,

116
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.630
so update where it's sliding to when it gets clicked.

117
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.580
And then we also want to have a class of active for the default for the 1st 1 so that we

118
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.370
have an indication of which one is the active one,

119
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.100
and that will correspond with the carousel item that's active.

120
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.550
You can also add in caption,

121
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.630
and that's just text on top.

122
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.280
So have that within a diff and then whatever text you want,

123
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.670
whatever structure you want,

124
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.280
maybe you want a little bit larger,

125
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:54.300
so there's our text coming in and we want to move this on top of the image.

126
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.730
And as we saw it's it's still down to the bottom there.

127
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.370
So we need to add in the right class for that.

128
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.150
And the class is care.

129
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.550
A cell caption we had in the Carousel caption,

130
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.610
and we go to the 1st 1 Now we've got this as a caption.

131
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.950
Remember the some images coming from the image itself,

132
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.510
So that's not actually text there.

133
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.980
That's coming from the placeholder dot com image,

134
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.380
so it's so you can add that text on top,

135
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.490
and then you can apply some styling to the text and move it around as necessary and as

136
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.910
needed.

137
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.480
There are a lot of options for the care cells,

138
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.460
and this is a NAWF use component within many websites.
