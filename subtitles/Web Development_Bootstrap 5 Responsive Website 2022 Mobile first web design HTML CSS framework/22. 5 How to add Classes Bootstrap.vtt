00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380
So once we've set up the basics of the website structure and we did that with Bootstrap.

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.300
Now we can apply some various classes,

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.520
and this one is gonna this one.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.720
We've already done where we've got the website name,

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.840
and then this one has ah heading section there.

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.410
So it's not just the paragraph that it's got and apply a class so I can apply an H for

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.160
class to it,

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.980
and it's just got the section one and then content underneath that I'll make some space

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.350
there.

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:39.740
I will also do the Section two and apply some spacing underneath and take a quick peek back

11
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.890
at the diagram.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.740
So it's Section one,

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.570
Section two and then with section,

14
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.830
and we've got a search with an input field so we can copy the section one content into the

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.750
next section area.

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.960
And so we've got that as section one and then below that.

17
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.860
So let's use the same format and apply search to it.

18
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.670
And then,

19
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.470
just below that,

20
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.760
we need an input field,

21
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.680
and it's not gonna be exactly what we're doing to have got our search,

22
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.990
and you can go to the bootstrapped site and always look at the different components so that

23
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.790
input field is within the form and see within the form.

24
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.170
We've got the different form groups.

25
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.520
I only have the one field,

26
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.750
so we don't necessarily need to have a form group.

27
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.990
But we can add that in.

28
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.140
Of course I was needed eso Let's do a quick one here and bring it back down.

29
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.780
And I'm just gonna do a quick update of this one so that we wrapping it within the form

30
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.550
input field and that we have the search all the way across.

31
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.090
And we don't need a label for it because in our example,

32
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.940
there's no label.

33
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.580
And then also there's no help test text either,

34
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.050
so you can get rid of that.

35
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.940
So there's our search input field and again,

36
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.500
looking at our example,

37
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.430
so looks very similar.

38
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.940
And,

39
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.550
of course,

40
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.460
they're using the placeholder name and these air just HTML.

41
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.630
So it's got nothing really to do with boots,

42
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.530
drop animal type in a search and refresh.

43
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.460
So there's our search,

44
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.320
so ready to move on to the next part.

45
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.790
And this was just a simple paragraph and it had a title,

46
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.910
so we used the same structure that we were using earlier with the titles and will give them

47
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.150
the H four.

48
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.350
So you might also want to change that up again,

49
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.730
depending again on what?

50
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.660
Your designers Title one.

51
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.850
And then we had a bunch of content contained within that next section.

52
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.550
So all of this was the contents and there was quite a bit of content contained there.

53
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.510
So that gives us very similar output and that this one does look like it had a little bit

54
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.350
more spacing.

55
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.910
So we can add in spacing and these air the minor adjustments that you can do with boots

56
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.020
drop when you go into utilities and adding in the various spacing so you can add margins

57
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.950
padding with the classes.

58
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.990
So you selective.

59
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.860
It's a margins or padding that you want to use.

60
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.210
Top bottom left,

61
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.890
right X.

62
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.590
Why that I typically just use the top bottom left,

63
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.940
right.

64
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.340
If you don't include these and I will just do the full way around,

65
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.200
and then the size of the padding that you want to do so this one to me looks probably like

66
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.340
a margin bottom,

67
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.640
So that would be M B and dash.

68
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.820
Whatever the size.

69
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.550
We want to put slits to MB,

70
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.390
Dash 4-3 and going into the title.

71
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.880
It's a margin margin.

72
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.850
Bottom Dash four.

73
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.210
See that moved the content down a little bit and then also within the example.

74
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.630
So going back to the example,

75
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.890
we have a couple of buttons,

76
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.680
and then we have some text underneath.

77
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.690
So it's go down to where we created those and we did them as on ordered lists that you

78
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.940
could also do this as a grid as well.

79
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.790
So those air couple options that you have and the structure would be the same where you'd

80
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.610
have kind of one on top of the other,

81
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.850
with the A,

82
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.170
Norden lists and the list items.

83
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.620
There's a number of options here that you can do where you've got the list group,

84
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.390
so I'm gonna turn this into a list group.

85
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.010
So that one was just more just as a placeholder and get rid of a couple of the list items

86
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.900
because to me it looks like there's only about three,

87
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.150
and I'm gonna select the text from there,

88
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.080
and then these ones would just be buttons.

89
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.750
So give them even a diff or they could actually be buttons.

90
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.410
How about we stick with just button and inside it will save button one and then we'll copy

91
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.770
what we do within button one,

92
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.100
and we'll just duplicate it to the other list item.

93
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.730
So let's add in a class and buttons air really easy.

94
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.130
It's the Bt end class in Bootstrap.

95
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.430
They're going back into the bootstrap website,

96
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.490
so under buttons,

97
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.500
you can also select colors of buttons,

98
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.390
which is really cool.

99
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.660
So the first thing is indicating that it's a button and the next just selecting out the

100
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.840
different colors that you want.

101
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.940
So I'm gonna keep it agree,

102
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:04.010
So use button secondary as the colored class for the button and refresh.

103
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.430
So we've got our button one and oops,

104
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.940
I did put in the wrong spot.

105
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.180
So let's copy this,

106
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.080
and we are going to need the list item for that part down there as well go up.

107
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.700
And this was the list that I was trying to trying to update.

108
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.490
You could also do this as a Siris of Rose.

109
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.770
Is there no always a number of ways to accomplish this?

110
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.260
So it's you create the button,

111
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.750
you can duplicate it and bring it into the next button.

112
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.880
So we've got the two buttons and then we've got some text underneath.

113
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.790
We also might want to center the content,

114
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.520
and that's another option that we have with boots drop,

115
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.030
we can do text center.

116
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.950
We can also do all of the different alignments of the text.

117
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.380
Eso that's one class we could add in and that relatively looks something similar to what we

118
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.750
have.

119
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.800
So we just leave it at that and we'll move on to the next section.

120
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.970
This is the last part where we've got an image.

121
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.830
We've got some content again and a title and other title.

122
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.010
And what looks to me like another list s we're gonna take care of that in the upcoming

123
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.490
lesson.

124
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.400
So go ahead and add in the styling into your bootstrap website with what you're designers,

125
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.270
and I know we're going rather quickly,

126
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.860
so most the time you would take a little bit more time with the various classes and make

127
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.440
sure exactly what you've drawn out.

128
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.510
But in this case,

129
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.390
this was just a quick wire frame,

130
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.340
and this is an introduction to how to use the bootstrap classes
