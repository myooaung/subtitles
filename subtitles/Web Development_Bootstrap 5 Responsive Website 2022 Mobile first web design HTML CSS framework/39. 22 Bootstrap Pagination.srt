1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,610
if you have multiple pages of content that Bootstrap provides a nice sweet toe,

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,570
have indicators for Siris of that related content.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,790
So going through number different paid strings.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,390
If you have a bunch of pages,

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,500
there's previous next and all the numbers in between.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,570
So essentially it's a nice way to group those together those links together and provide

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,750
that capability.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,080
So we're just gonna be doing a quick lesson on this as this is an option and there's really

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,470
nothing dynamic about it.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,820
This is all hard coded,

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,960
but if you do are loading a bunch of pages of content,

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,070
you can also keep the structure and load this dynamically.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:43,220
So it's creates our pagination on the page and going into our website,

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,770
we can create a new ordered list,

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,300
and you can use any element just as we've seen before.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,780
So duck,

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,060
she doesn't matter which element you use.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:58,050
They're all going to be able to handle this of creating the pagination because again it

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,550
just plying classes and the classes do all of the styling element for the element.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:11,320
So the mean parent classes pagination and then each one of the elements that air nested

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,960
inside So in this case,

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,290
the list items is page item and I'll shrink this down and then wrapped within here.

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,460
You might typically have a page link,

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:29,100
and these would typically be hyperlinks with the class off page link that would say,

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,080
previous actually going to duplicate this one.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,950
And this would be one and so on.

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,870
So as many as you need to 345 and go all the way,

28
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,470
and then the last one would typically be next to.

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,340
So if there was additional pages there,

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,920
if you had,

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,280
ah,

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,180
lot listed,

33
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,750
you might want to do next or something like that so that users can move through the pages.

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,820
And then you had code this with JavaScript to load additional pages as the user click

35
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,150
through the various links.
