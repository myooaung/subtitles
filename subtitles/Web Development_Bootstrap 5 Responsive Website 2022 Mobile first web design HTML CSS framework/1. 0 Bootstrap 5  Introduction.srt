00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,110
enjoy working with
bootstrap because it

10
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,970
allows me to create
websites quickly,

11
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,105
is mobile first websites
that are fully responsive,

12
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,070

various classes and

the power of Bootstrap
into your web pages.

16
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,390
There's a lot of really useful

17
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,280
components that you can make use

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,450
of in order to create

19
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,670
your websites and really
make them stand out.

20
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,265
We are fully responsive
mobile already,

21
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:42,095
so it doesn't matter
what size screen

22
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:44,570
your users are visiting
your website with.

23
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,790
Bootstrap is gonna be
able to take care of it.

24
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,050
This course is going to cover

25
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,210
the commonly used functions and

26
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,924
components and classes
for Bootstrap,

27
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:55,565
including how to set up
bootstrap containers,

28
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:57,410
also the Bootstrap grid,

29
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,185
how that works and how you can
set up the different rows.

30
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,270
Columns, structure your webpage

31
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,850
content using text typography,

32
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,220
how to update and
include images,

33
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,810
making them fully responsive,

34
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,960
creating tables and the
various color classes that are

35
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,030
available within
Bootstrap to make

36
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,565
your websites colorful
and really stand out.

37
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:19,400
There's alert components,
accordion components,

38
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,220
and there's a lot of really
useful components that come

39
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,990
alongside Bootstrap that are

40
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,254
commonly used in order
to create websites.

41
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,650
So the buttons, and that's

42
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,270
one of my favorite
components within

43
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,935
Bootstrap because those buttons

44
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:33,200
look amazing within
your webpages.

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,654
There's the card component,

46
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:37,415
the navigation in
the navigation bar,

47
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:40,880
and how you can create a
responsive navigation bar

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,065
that resizes,

49
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:44,240
has the hamburger icon and that

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,729
opens up on the mobile
screens vertically,

51
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,785
on the largest sized
screens horizontally.

52
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:50,660
So this is built-in and really

53
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,030
easy to apply within
your websites,

54
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,965
making them mobile friendly.

55
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:57,080
And then really
amazing components

56
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,404
like the carousel, the modal,

57
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:01,790
and other utilities that
you can make use of,

58
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,190
style your website and
really bring it to life.

59
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,990
Bootstrap is the world's most

60
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,600
popular front end
open source toolkit.

61
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,510
It lets you rapidly
create, customize,

62
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,480
and develop websites using
the Bootstrap components.

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,775
Bootstrap five is new and
updated version of Bootstrap,

64
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,800
so it doesn't include
jQuery anymore.

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,450
A lot of the classes are still

66
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,085
the same as Bootstrap four,

67
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,330
and I'm gonna be covering

68
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,700
classes within the
upcoming lessons of

69
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,380
this course also
includes some of

70
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,300
the older versions of Bootstrap.

71
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,550
The new versions of
Bootstrap come available.

72
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,690
I am gonna be updating

73
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,910
the content source
code is included.

74
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,650
And one of the best
ways to learn is to

75
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,600
try the code out for yourself.

76
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,910
Prior HTML knowledge
is essential,

77
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,160
focused on Bootstrap
and applying

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,900
the various classes in order

79
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,835
to make things happen
with Bootstrap,

80
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,590
Let's open up her editors and

81
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,630
start writing some
code with Bootstrap.
