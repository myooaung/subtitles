00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
This lesson we're gonna
be looking at some of

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.095
the table classes that
are commonly used.

3
00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:05.400
And they do have

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.220
some really cool table
classes just by adding in

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.320
the main table class
that's gonna already

6
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.515
structure IR tables in
a nice readable format.

7
00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.285
You can set the table hover.

8
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.150
So that creates this type of
hovering effect on the rows.

9
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.310
I've also got this
set to table dark,

10
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.660
and I've done the table board

11
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.730
unless it's turned
the table dark,

12
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.720
so inverted the colors and
also set it as borderless.

13
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.615
There's also an example
below of another table,

14
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.190
and this is where we're using

15
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.380
the different table
colors that we

16
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.570
have for the textile classes,

17
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.415
such as the primary success
danger info warning.

18
00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:43.895
And those are also all
available as Table colors.

19
00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.645
This one has the table
primary applied to all of it.

20
00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.355
That's why it's slightly blue

21
00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.835
and we're also using the
table-striped class.

22
00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.335
You can use a combination
of the table classes.

23
00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:55.730
And the table-striped gives you

24
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.170
the zebra type pattern for

25
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.525
the rows of content
within the table,

26
00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.670
making it a whole
lot easier to read.

27
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.650
Let's create a table
and then we apply

28
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.915
some Bootstrap
classes to the table.

29
00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.524
I've got to add the table
within the container

30
00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:11.840
and set the sum of the
classes for the table.

31
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.525
This is gonna be using
the class table.

32
00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:18.500
That's going to apply the table
class and allow us to add

33
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.660
table options within

34
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.615
the table elements
that we're creating.

35
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.850
So this is setting up the table

36
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.460
heading will list out just

37
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.430
like the first and
last names for people.

38
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.040
And so this can be the
head of the table.

39
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.650
And next let's set up
the body for the table.

40
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.220
So using the HTML
body for the body.

41
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.040
And then we've got number
of rows of content.

42
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.410
So have them in
line with what we

43
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.720
have for the first and last.

44
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.715
So we're just going to
have the two columns.

45
00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:52.070
Of course, you can add in
as many columns as you

46
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.175
want using the TD for
additional cells,

47
00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.610
we want some more
rows of content.

48
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.130
And I'll update this
and update some

49
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.350
of the names that we
have and save that.

50
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.895
So that gives us a table.

51
00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:06.920
And right away there's
really nice styling

52
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.840
with just adding in
the table class.

53
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.685
If you were to remove that,

54
00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:13.370
It's just regular text

55
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.295
content and you don't have
any structure for the table.

56
00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:19.145
So just by adding
the table class,

57
00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:20.960
it gives you quite
a lot of options

58
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.105
there within the table already.

59
00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:24.725
So there are some ways.

60
00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:26.690
So this is just a basic table

61
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.405
that applies the
basic table styling.

62
00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:32.315
And of course the table is
going to be responsive.

63
00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:34.940
That makes it really
nice that it's

64
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.400
just the one class she
can add in the table.

65
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.010
I'll give you some additional
options for the tables.

66
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.395
So a few other tables.

67
00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:46.175
And we'll create some
within the fluid class.

68
00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:49.010
That's the table within
the fluid class.

69
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.930
And the difference is
that the container,

70
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.780
the parent containers larger
within the fluid class.

71
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.470
There's also some additional
classes that you can set.

72
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.935
One of my favorite ones is
the table-striped class.

73
00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.275
And what that does
is that stripes.

74
00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:05.450
It does the zebra
stripes to the table.

75
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.760
So every other row on the table.

76
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.460
You can also do a table

77
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.185
boarded and it adds borders
to the sides of the table.

78
00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:16.880
So applying some borders

79
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.740
and also under the
heading class,

80
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.275
it added that solid line.

81
00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:24.290
There's also the table
has either hover.

82
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.660
So odd that into the top table.

83
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.940
What table hover
does is it allows

84
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.460
that hover effect
over the elements.

85
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.730
So as you're selecting
the rows of content,

86
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.410
it hovers and highlights
role of content.

87
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.515
You can also apply
different table colors.

88
00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.900
So there's a table dark.

89
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.460
What table dark is,

90
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.105
it essentially turns a dark
dot hover will still work.

91
00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:55.100
Combinations that you can do.

92
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.840
So you can do the table dark.

93
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.195
You can also have
borderless table.

94
00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:06.125
Let's set this as table
border Less class,

95
00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.005
so that removes any of the
borders from the table.

96
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:11.960
There's also the
contextual clauses

97
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.985
that you can add to the table.

98
00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:18.980
So setting up the default
table colors using the table,

99
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.785
the color scheme that you
have within Bootstrap,

100
00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:24.890
which are the primary, sets,

101
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.085
the entire table to
the primary class.

102
00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:29.885
You could also select,

103
00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:32.000
if you want to set for the table

104
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.250
had set this as table info.

105
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.860
That will apply the class to

106
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.530
that particular row of content.

107
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.439
There's also all
other table classes.

108
00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.305
You can set multiple
table classes,

109
00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:51.574
such as the table octave

110
00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:55.715
or table success,
the table octave.

111
00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:58.535
And that basically
highlights it as octave.

112
00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:01.384
There's also the table success.

113
00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.230
And we'll take a look
at the different colors

114
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.460
and the upcoming lesson.
