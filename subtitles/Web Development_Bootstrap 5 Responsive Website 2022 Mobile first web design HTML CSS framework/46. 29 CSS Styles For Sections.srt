1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
as nice,

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,960
says Bootstrap is it can't always do everything.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,890
So we need to have some custom styling,

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,620
and especially for the single page websites.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,350
You do need to apply some custom styling in order to account for the different section size

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,210
that you want to use,

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,760
as well as for the navigation bar that it's covering part of the content at the top.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,710
So I'm gonna create some spacers as well a supply,

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,000
some default styling to the body,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,620
to the header and also as 100% so set the height to be 100% of available height.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,260
So some default styling there because this is a full page website and then creating the

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:41,990
spacer,

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,110
and this is what we can use at the top of the page.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,880
I'll give it a height of 10 picks and a width.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,390
So these air kind of like spacer bars,

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:58,650
and they're also visually appealing because that can give the user that's using the website

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:58,650
,

18
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,050
an indication that these are actually different sections.

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,840
I was gonna make a black line,

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
and of course you can style the colors as needed,

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,100
and I'm gonna ply ah,

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,840
margin for the talk and bottom off 40 and then left and right is zero and then do a display

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,910
block to make sure that takes the full with.

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,230
So it's the spacer and adding in these spacers,

25
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,090
I'm gonna add them in between the sections or at the top of the sections.

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,980
So where we have the about that's adding in these types of spacer breaks and then go down

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,060
and apply the same thing just above each one of the H twos.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,100
So there is consistency in the design that separates out the content.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,400
And we also need another type of spacer that we can have to move the content down because

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,570
of the navigation bar.

31
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,660
And this is just going to be a blank one and give it a height of 50 and display block.

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:00,270
And this is the space of that I'm gonna use to move the main splash page area down there

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,980
mean welcome content because we can't see it.

34
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,160
It's being hidden with underneath the navigation bar,

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,210
setting up a div class spacer,

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,380
and I just realized I called them both spacers.

37
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,460
So I called that one space or two and space or two.

38
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,390
So wherever we need that spacing that extra spacing.

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,490
We can add that in as needed,

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,330
and that's just doing that 50 block of space.

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,890
So now we can see that the content and we might even want to adjust it slightly.

42
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,200
Maybe that should be a 60 block of space moving the content down and also want to do ah,

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,040
100% for the splash,

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
so want that to take up a full percentage.

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,980
It's also select the splash element with the idea of Splash.

46
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,000
I use an image from placeholder dot com.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,820
So if you don't have any images handy and if you need some place over content,

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,790
placeholder dot com provide you some good images.

49
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,300
You can set the different sizes,

50
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,210
the dimensions.

51
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,290
You can also add in some text,

52
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,090
specify some custom colors.

53
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,480
There's a lot of options here.

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,210
This is one of my places that I use in order to set background images and just general

55
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,900
overall place older images.

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,750
So it's add that background to this elements of Earl,

57
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,770
and then I'm just gonna pace in the background image and will specify no repeat and center

58
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,480
the image,

59
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,900
center it and have that fixed so it doesn't change and also for the background size.

60
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,820
I'm going to use cover so it's fully across and as well so it will work across browsers,

61
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,840
so Web kit,

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,900
background size,

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,430
mas background,

64
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,120
size and cover.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,950
So they all get cover on that.

66
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,500
And now let's go down to where we have the splash content.

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,930
So it's contained within the header that we can update that contents off.

68
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,020
This added in a diff,

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,850
and I'm going apply a class so this class is going to give it a role and specify the height

70
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,340
of 100 will wrap the content inside of it.

71
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,310
So we've got quite a few dibs happening there and also on H one for this content.

72
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,030
And let's use the display for for the largest size and each one tags.

73
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,640
So going into boots drop,

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,680
they have some options for the various sizing severe to use the H 100 which is 100%

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,630
available with then they also have in line block in order to set that as ah block.

76
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,800
So if you don't have any content contained in there,

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,490
you can automatically select all of that.

78
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,490
So let's take the in line block and we also need to make some much of other adjustments as

79
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,900
well,

80
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,600
where we have the HTML to be full.

81
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,390
There's also positioning that we can do.

82
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,350
There's various positioning options,

83
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,700
there's spacing and there's a bunch of different layout options that we have available to

84
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:48,990
us.

85
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,190
So if you want to add in padding or margin,

86
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,700
that's also possible.

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,450
So we select the property.

88
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,860
Either it's patting emergent,

89
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,360
and then we can select the sides so we can do top bottom left,

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,320
right X,

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,910
why and then blank for all four sides of the element and then the number of sizes.

92
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,830
So there's a scale of 0 to 5.

93
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,450
You can also do auto and as well they do have some examples.

94
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,720
So we do use some of these spacing classes in order to provide spacing within the page

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,230
content.

96
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:28,730
So going back into the website where we've got each 100 I have paced the D line in line

97
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,740
block and also going up to here where we've got the body.

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,840
We also need to specify that the HTML so that will produce it at 100%.

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,510
So going back down,

100
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,750
I wanna center the content on the splash page.

101
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,920
So we've got our splash.

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,850
We've got the container fluids that's going all the way across,

103
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:58,270
and we want to use justify content center so it's within the contact positioning.

104
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,340
So if you go back into the website and you can always search the various classes so it's

105
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,620
got justify content,

106
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,000
it's under flex and give you more information about how that works.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,550
So if there's ever a class that you need to search up,

108
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,180
the easiest way is just go to search and provide a search for that.

109
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,760
And what this will do is this will center that content because we're using the Flex Justify

110
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,240
Content center.

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,350
We don't need the in line block for the spacing of that element.

112
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,890
So once we removed that,

113
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,350
we'll see that the content does get centered,

114
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,980
and you also might want to add some additional another each to their kind of like as a

115
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,810
subtitle for your content,

116
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,510
and then apply PT so padding top and will do just a little bit of patting,

117
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,370
patting top,

118
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,850
and you can type in whatever content that is necessary for the page.

119
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,480
And of course,

120
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,440
you won't have something that says image here in the background as this is coming from the

121
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,290
placeholder,

122
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,650
you probably have something nice and bright in that stands out.

123
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,200
You also keep in mind that your text you don't wanna have you won't have a nice contrast

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,450
from your text to the content,

125
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,620
and maybe it will even make this bigger to display one.

126
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,270
So if you're using a dark background that make sure your text is a light color and if

127
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,460
you're using a light colored background that you can keep your text as a dark color.

128
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,920
And now,

129
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,890
whenever we click the links,

130
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:33,430
we get brought to the other pages so you can go back to home and about US Project's story

131
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,150
contact.

132
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,890
So there's no more scrolling.

133
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,490
That's why it's not screwing down because we don't have any content.

134
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,200
That means that we have to add some content in that's coming up next.

135
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,430
As we continue to build this project,
