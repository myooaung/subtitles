1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
there's gonna be a quick lesson.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,070
We're going to be looking at the about us section,

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,220
so this isn't gonna be 100% like the home,

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,060
and you can,

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,540
of course,

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:15,590
if you do need to adjust to be 100% you can add that into the styling to give it a height

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,850
of 100%.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,140
But because we've got a specific amount of content and we might not necessarily want this

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,880
to be 100% where he's gonna leave it as is and let the content dictate how much height this

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,290
particular element gets,

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,830
we're also going to do the same thing that we did here,

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:39,100
where we're adding in the height 100 justify content center into the elements already be

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,560
thinking,

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh well,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,250
it does look centered.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,190
And that's because we've got the call Dash MD Dash eight.

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,460
And if I make the screen a little bit wider,

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,220
we see that it is in fact only taking up eight columns of with,

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,490
and there's four that are empty,

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,520
so it's not exactly centered.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,750
And when on the larger screens and that's where we could use the Flex,

22
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,450
justify Content center in order to center the content.

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,350
And of course,

24
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,940
if you want to add in another column off four column column,

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,800
then you could have added that in this Well,

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,770
so maybe if you wanted to have an image there,

27
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,350
so that is another option.

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,270
And again,

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,410
depending on how you wanna handle this,

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,820
you can treat it in a few different ways because the about us is taking up the full width,

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,840
and then we've got the various columns.

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,590
So how about we do that as well that we're gonna add in another column under just past it,

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,260
And this one is going to be four,

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,250
and this one can contain an image,

35
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,170
and this image is gonna be fully responsive.

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,560
And we're going to just use an image from the placeholder dot calm and take the same image

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,940
that we're using in the background of the splash.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,320
And,

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,650
of course,

40
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,390
you probably already have images that you might want to use and adding in the image and

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,580
then the source for the image and set the source as the placeholder path,

42
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,070
or whatever the path to your image is going to be.

43
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,770
And then for the image itself.

44
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:08,330
Wanna add in the classes for image dosh fluid to make it Reese ice and fluid.

45
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,070
It's now we have an about section that's Centre Alliance of the content is center aligned,

46
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,690
and this is fully responsive.

47
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,110
So as the container gets smaller,

48
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,080
it will stack.

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,660
So once the break point under the midsize break point is underneath that it will stack the

50
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,560
rose.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,640
And if we go larger,

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
it'll just have the different various columns.

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,640
And this is all contained under the about US section.

54
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,780
I also want to add additional content underneath about us,

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,790
so you want to add additional spacing.

56
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,550
So going back to where we had looked at with spacing,

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,090
we want to add spacing below.

58
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,930
And you could do that with utilities and under spacing and selecting to add a margin below

59
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,660
margin bottom and then specifying the margin that we want to add.

60
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,020
So we're gonna add a margin bottom and a margin of five for margin bottom.

61
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,060
So margin bottom five underneath about us and we could try variations for to see what it

62
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,310
looks like and then for consistency,

63
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,470
we're going to do the same thing for the additional content.

64
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,880
Also to the text alignment,

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,700
so there is obviously an option to text the line.

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,810
So let's align the text left as this is a paragraph.

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,440
So we don't necessarily want it to be center aligned for this example.

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,530
So we also wanted to add in some cards below,

69
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,360
So this is gonna take the full roll,

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,010
call him.

71
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,010
So adding in another rope and then within this role,

72
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,660
going back,

73
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,200
Teoh the bootstrap components we're gonna add in a few carts.

74
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,750
So basic structure of a cart is what we define as a class of a card,

75
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,240
and we're gonna be creating a card deck.

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,710
So number of cards together presenting the content from the cards,

77
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,770
we're gonna have an image on top a title and then some content about the card.

78
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,910
And this is what's a card deck where we can automatically group the cards together,

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,710
and we can include the card footers,

80
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,440
the card headers,

81
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
the car titles and,

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,910
of course,

83
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,700
the card body and as well as images within the card deck.

84
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,490
There's also option to do grids for the cards,

85
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,200
So that's another way that you can present the cards where you can just use the typical

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,310
grid format that we've been using from boots drop,

87
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,870
and this also allows you to accomplish the same thing.

88
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,030
But in this lesson,

89
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,600
we want to try the card deck.

90
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,850
So I'm gonna take the card deck,

91
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,320
and I'm going to copy that source code over into the project and save it.

92
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,300
It will make some tweaks and adjustments to the way the card deck is being output.

93
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,190
And also shrink this down a bit so that we can see the full size of how the car deck is

94
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,750
gonna look.

95
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,330
We're gonna add in a class of margin top five.

96
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:58,270
So we got some spacing between the card deck and the rest of the content in the about

97
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,750
section,

98
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,280
and we also want to add in some images.

99
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,330
So let's go ahead and paste some more placeholder images into the card deck.

100
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,330
So there we've got our image there,

101
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,130
and of course,

102
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,320
you can update detects to be whatever you want it to be.

103
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,220
And then within the card body,

104
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,380
you can also add in a card header if you want,

105
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,280
and then this part here at the bottom,

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,050
where we've got the card text.

107
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,490
So I'm going to remove that and I'm going to replace that with a button.

108
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,340
So using a div applying a classical buttons that could be added with bootstrap.

109
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,280
So going back into the bootstrap documentation.

110
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,810
And let's make this bigger.

111
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,840
So under buttons and buttons air really easy to add.

112
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,400
So typically they do use the button tag,

113
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,250
but you can use any tag that you want,

114
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,260
and this will still indicate,

115
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,820
because this is styling and styling that's being applied so that it's taking any form that

116
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,290
we want.

117
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,530
So I'm actually going to use the outline buttons of success and copy that in that has

118
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,360
mentioned these can be did is they don't have to be buttons,

119
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,210
especially if you're doing you're quoting with JavaScript.

120
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,000
It doesn't really matter what's accomplishing the button action,

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,960
so you can use any element and it's gonna look the same way,

122
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,690
and I'll update the text here as well as with the card title.

123
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,560
So maybe this is a silver plan adding in on icon from the font.

124
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,070
Awesome.

125
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,850
This is a great place to include those icons.

126
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,870
This is just a computer desktop,

127
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,510
and I'll make this a little bit bigger,

128
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,040
and of course you can adjust these as needed.

129
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,550
So now that you've created one card and this is all contained within the card deck,

130
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,450
we can duplicate that format and overwrite the other cards so that they all have the same

131
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,050
structure.

132
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,980
And that's one of the things that you do want with this type of action that you do want the

133
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,240
ability to have the same type of structure for all of your cards.

134
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,860
And of course,

135
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,560
the images would be changing so you can update some of the colors,

136
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,760
and this is what done within the placeholder image.

137
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,110
So these could be really easily updated.

138
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,320
And also we can update this to be just so it is different.

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,320
And let's update the text on the buttons to be by now and update the background color for

140
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,260
this one this well and update the plan to be gold.

141
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,350
And we're gonna update this one as well and a buy now button and safe.

142
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:24,120
So there's our about section so we can start whenever the page loads and then click about,

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,150
and that will bring us down to the boat section.

144
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,880
So coming up next we're gonna look at the projects,

145
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,900
are story and then create a form in order for the contact us
