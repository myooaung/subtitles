00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
This lesson we're
gonna be looking at

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,020
the carousel component
in Bootstrap.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,300
So bringing in three
different images

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,190
that we're going to
apply to the carousel.

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,400
The carousel automatically
rotates to the next image.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,030
You have an option to add
in indicators that you can

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,660
go to selected images with
the indicators as well.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,450
You can use the icons
on the left for

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,820
Previous and Next images to

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
slide the carousel
over to those images,

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,615
you should have images that
have the same dimensions.

12
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:32,070
Otherwise you end up with

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,545
the carousel that's
adjusting in height.

14
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,285
So when you are creating images,

15
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,505
try to cut really large images

16
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,095
and have the same dimensions
for those images,

17
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:42,545
meaning their width and

18
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,750
height are gonna be
the same so that

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,065
the carousel component resizes

20
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:51,710
and looks really smooth on
different sized screens.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,050
The Bootstrap carousel
allows you to

22
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,420
create a slideshow
component that

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,430
allows the Bootstrap to

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,205
cycle through images
in the component.

25
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:02,645
So let's go ahead and
we're going to create

26
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,340
a main parent div.

27
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,170
And this is gonna be the class

28
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,880
that's going to
hold the carousel,

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,564
give it an ID or a class of
carousel, and then slide.

30
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:15,559
And that's going to
create the slideshow.

31
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:17,644
And it also needs an attribute,

32
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,270
set it up at a data BS.

33
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,459
And right, and that value
should be equal to carousel.

34
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,949
That's the parent
for the carousel.

35
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:31,099
And then in order to
set up the carousel,

36
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,950
let's add in the images
within the carousel.

37
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,425
So that's gonna be
contained within a class

38
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:40,010
called carousel image or enter.

39
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,340
And this is where you would
add in all of the items.

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,410
So those are as well
contained within

41
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,455
a class called carousel items.

42
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:52,445
And each one of the items
gives it a class of item,

43
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,950
and you can select one
as the active ones.

44
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,470
So this is the starting one
that's going to start out

45
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,170
at create some images in there.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,680
And I do have the image
that the bootstrap image,

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,670
so we'll just load that image
into the Bootstrap image.

48
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,240
Then you can also set a
class for that as well.

49
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,210
So setting it up as d block,

50
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,225
so it takes the full
width across the image.

51
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,935
So there's our image there.

52
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,440
Now the images within
the carousel should be

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,985
the same height and width

54
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,265
in order for it
to work properly.

55
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:26,810
So I do only just have

56
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,445
the one image that
I'm working with.

57
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,410
So I'm going to set
a default width

58
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,540
for the image that's gonna

59
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,415
be hard-coded for the image
itself to be a width of 500.

60
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:40,280
And of course, when

61
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,905
you are creating the
images for your carousel,

62
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,540
makes sure that the
dimensions are the

63
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,955
same for those images.

64
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:49,865
So that it looks nice and neat.

65
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:53,495
Once you construct the
carousel content in

66
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:54,935
a few other images

67
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:58,520
into these ones should
just be carousel items.

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,260
Don't set them as active.

69
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,000
And now we see that
we already have

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,520
the rotation to the next item.

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,580
There are some options that
you can set indicators,

72
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,220
and indicators allow us to move

73
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,999
to the next item
within the carousel.

74
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,340
So let's set up a parent for

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
that and give this a
class, indicators class.

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,135
It's the parent for
the indicators.

77
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,760
And you need to create
as many indicators as

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,385
you have items
within the carousel.

79
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:31,520
So that thought matches
up in the user can click

80
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,080
the indicators in order to

81
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,705
move to the next available item.

82
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:40,700
We need to set a data BS target.

83
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,490
For the indicators to work.

84
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,320
This is gonna be whatever we're

85
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,420
setting for the
parent container.

86
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,030
We didn't set an ID for this.

87
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,355
We'll set it up as car one.

88
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,140
And this is going to be an ID.

89
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,100
So use the hash car one
in order to select it.

90
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,990
Also set the active
class on the button.

91
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,885
That's gonna be the first
representing the first.

92
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:10,055
And we also need
to set the data BS

93
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:12,155
slide to let it know

94
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,990
which slide this is
going to connect to.

95
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,020
And these are zero-based.

96
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,760
Starting at 0 would be

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,105
the first slide within
the carousel items.

98
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:27,965
So select that and let's
create three other ones.

99
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,465
And then just update

100
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:32,570
which image that the
data is going to

101
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,520
slide to elect for

102
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,685
the parent and assign
an ID to the parent.

103
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:40,760
That's going to match the
ID for the indicators,

104
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,410
again to update the images.

105
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,740
So there are actually going
to be different images using

106
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,750
the placeholder image analysts

107
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,985
at the image size to be 500.

108
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:52,070
So that way the second image is

109
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,260
going to be different than
the first two images.

110
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,780
And I'll also update
the image source,

111
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,700
so off of the logo to be
different again for this image.

112
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,500
And this allows you to set

113
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,520
the default size for the
image as well as customize.

114
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,760
The colors and the output
for the image as well.

115
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,085
This is coming from
placeholder.com.

116
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:14,630
There's a number of
sources where you

117
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,295
can get placeholder images.

118
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,795
So this is just one of them.

119
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:20,660
And that's how you can bring
a placeholder image directly

120
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,890
within your project as you're

121
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,290
developing it with if you
don't have the image,

122
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,829
let's update this
to be times 300.

123
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:33,139
And I'll also force
this height to be 300.

124
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,645
So all of our images
have the share,

125
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:39,364
the shared dimensions
and apply some text.

126
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:43,535
So now we've got distinct
images within the carousel.

127
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:45,500
And let's just
update this cut in

128
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,200
the wrong place where
it's sliding too,

129
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,165
should be within the opening
button tag. Save that.

130
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:56,150
And now we can click the
indicators to move through

131
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,390
to the different images that
we have within the carousel.

132
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,585
Let's add in the left
and right controls.

133
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:04,925
We'll add them in as buttons.

134
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:08,300
Just below the inner
content for the carousel,

135
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,420
a class called carousel control.

136
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,815
And for the previous,

137
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,240
we're going to give it a class

138
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,415
of carousel control previous,

139
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:19,235
set the button to be a button.

140
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:25,310
We need to also link to
the data BS, target value.

141
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,460
And this is gonna be
linking to the main parent,

142
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,605
which is going to be car one.

143
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,530
Once again to the
mean parent element

144
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,905
that's going to contain
the carousel object.

145
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:38,765
And also we need to add in

146
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,875
another attribute to set it
to where it's gonna slide.

147
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,440
So it's going to simply
move to the previous one.

148
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
Once this button is clicked,

149
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,535
set that up as an attribute
within the button tag.

150
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:54,185
And then for the button,

151
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:57,785
let's set up an
element within there.

152
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,360
So create the indicator within

153
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,280
the button carousel
control previous icon.

154
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,680
And that could just
be a blank element.

155
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,740
And that gives us
the controller on

156
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,410
the left-hand side
that can move it to

157
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,965
the previous slide
in the carousel.

158
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,765
Let's also add in one.

159
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,670
For the next.

160
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,230
You can copy and paste

161
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,485
the previous structure
is gonna be the same.

162
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,850
Other than we need to change

163
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,200
the class values is to
the previous two next,

164
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,630
and it's still links
out to the same target.

165
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,010
So once you update those,

166
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,750
you should have an icon for the

167
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,480
next and then for the previous,

168
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,315
creating the carousel component.

169
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:45,335
So let's suggest these images
that once we're expanding,

170
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:46,685
we'll set the image.

171
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,595
We're not going to fix
the width of the image.

172
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,220
And we can set these to be

173
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,360
width for the image
using a class of fluid.

174
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,485
For the image that it takes
all the available space.

175
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,150
The best practices to get

176
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,870
really large images
for your carousel.

177
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,810
And let's just simply
we'll add up the height.

178
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,790
They're the only one that works

179
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,100
really well is going to
be the Bootstrap one.

180
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,940
As I've adjusted, these
dimensions are different.

181
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,890
So you're going to have
this type of effect where

182
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,980
the carousel is going to
be changing in height.

183
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,690
And so that's again
why you need to

184
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,105
have the same dimension images.

185
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,875
In order to output

186
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,125
the content properly
within the slider.

187
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,860
Go ahead and try it, the
carousel component in Bootstrap,

188
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,200
and it'd be ready to move
on to the next lesson.
