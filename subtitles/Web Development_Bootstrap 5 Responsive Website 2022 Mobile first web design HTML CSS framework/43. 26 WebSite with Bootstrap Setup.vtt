00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
in this lesson,

2
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.480
where are going to be setting up the basic structure for the Web page that we're building?

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.130
And that's going to be a single page website where it's going to scroll down to the various

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.630
sections of the site.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.400
So have opened up the editor on the left hand side.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.870
This is going to be brackets that I'm using available of brackets Io.

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.090
And this is the editor that I'm gonna be using for the upcoming lessons as well.

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.800
I've got on the right hand side,

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.210
the browser window open.

10
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.350
I'm using chrome,

11
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.580
and it's opened up on the right hand side.

12
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.290
I've done the life preview in brackets,

13
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.220
and that's where I've opened up the Web page.

14
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.000
So this is just a blank index dot html page,

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.350
and we're ready to add in all of the bootstrap structure and HTML structure,

16
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.750
so you can always go over to bootstrap,

17
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.840
get bootstrap dot com,

18
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.320
click get started,

19
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.200
and this will give you the links to the Cdn for the styling as well as for the JavaScript.

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.990
It gives you some more information and this Wallace a nice starter template.

21
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.660
So this is usually where I like to start and grab the starter template,

22
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.250
go back into brackets and paste the starter template.

23
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.820
So this gives you the basic structure for your Web page and update the title makes some

24
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.570
fine tuning as needed.

25
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.300
And of course,

26
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.000
you can get rid of the commenting and the hello world.

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.100
We're not gonna be needing that,

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.120
but you are gonna need to have the Jake worry.

29
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.620
And we're also going to be using some customized hickory toe have a smooth scroll.

30
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.290
So eventually we are going to update the unified Slim J.

31
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.990
Corey Library to the full gene quarry library.

32
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.450
So going into the body,

33
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.240
we want to add in the basic structure for a website.

34
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.470
So we are going to need to have a navigation bar.

35
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.770
We're also gonna have a header area,

36
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.080
and then we've got our main container where all of our content is going to go.

37
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.190
And then lastly,

38
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.190
we're gonna set up a footer and the footer is going to be obviously for the footer content

39
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.190
.

40
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.160
Let's set up all of the basic elements that we need.

41
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.960
And within the main section,

42
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.150
I'm gonna add in a number of different sections,

43
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.270
so just have one will create one as a template.

44
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.310
And then we got a duplicate this for the other sections will have five sections for this

45
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.210
project and the navigation.

46
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.060
Whenever you click any of the knave bars,

47
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.650
it's gonna go directly to the sections that are indicated within the hyperlink.

48
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.270
And within the HTML structure,

49
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.880
we're gonna have multiple sections that we're gonna be using.

50
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.230
And they are all going to get linked from the main navigation bar.

51
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.580
So it's set those up so each one of these pages is gonna have to have an I d.

52
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.540
And because this is a single page website were going to do that and within the sections and

53
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.010
as well,

54
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.710
we're going to do that within the header.

55
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.850
So the header is the 1st 1 that we're gonna look at and going into the header create a div

56
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.850
.

57
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.740
Given an I.

58
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.070
D.

59
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.150
So that it can be identified and this is gonna be the location where the hyperlink is gonna

60
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.860
take you to.

61
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.330
I'm going to give it an I d of splash.

62
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.170
So all the contents contained within Splash are going to be what is going to make up that

63
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.390
mean header area and as well.

64
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.510
We're going to create another div inside,

65
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.890
and this is gonna be our main container.

66
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.180
And I'm gonna use container fluid so each one of these sections or pages are gonna have

67
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.260
their own set of containers and then structure within their.

68
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.250
And this is gonna be typically the grid structure that we're going to be using from

69
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.990
bootstrap,

70
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.100
which is allow us to create some type of structure and grid for the content contained.

71
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.350
So let's do one more div.

72
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:37.230
And within this stiff setting up I A class and that's going to be a class of column dash MD

73
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.620
eight and we're gonna center this column and this is where all of our mean content is going

74
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.080
to go.

75
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.900
And for now,

76
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.750
we'll just type in welcome content and then going into the main area.

77
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.860
So this is gonna be where all of our main content is going to go for the site and going

78
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.080
into main,

79
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.820
set up a class and going under the container class.

80
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.960
So all of the sections are going to be slightly indented and have gutters on the site

81
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.970
because this is going to be in container,

82
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.250
whereas this is container fluid.

83
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.600
And then we're now we're gonna work on the individual sections.

84
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.400
We want tohave five different pages.

85
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.230
So one is splash.

86
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.380
We've already done that one.

87
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.590
The next one is just gonna be a section so contents contained within that section to give

88
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.770
the section and I d and whatever you want to make those different pages,

89
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.710
I could have an about page and as well there's gonna be projects and contact and whatever

90
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.170
other pages that you want to display here,

91
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.490
you can have as many as you want because this is this gonna be all related to the

92
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.560
navigation bar.

93
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.680
How many items you want?

94
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.650
A place is dependent on the navigation bar,

95
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.370
and I also want to add in that class of text center.

96
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.380
So this will center all of the text contained within these sections.

97
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.770
You may or may not one apply the centering of the text.

98
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.240
So this is a bootstrap class that's gonna center all of the text that's contained within

99
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.610
also gonna have an h two and this is just going to see what this section is.

100
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.150
So call it about us,

101
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.220
and the reason I'm using H two is more for s e o purposes as we're gonna be applying a

102
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.630
bootstrap class and the bootstrap class is going to be displayed Dash three.

103
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.960
So it's gonna make it nice and big and really stand out.

104
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.340
And then just below that,

105
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.950
the h two you can add in all of your content and we'll have another class,

106
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:36.750
another div.

107
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.310
And this could have a class of rope.

108
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.530
And then within the rule,

109
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:48.040
one more class and this one is gonna be the columns M d eight and I usually prefer to use

110
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.040
the MD break points and then one last one.

111
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.910
We're just gonna add in some content.

112
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.670
So this a paragraph with some Laura Ipsen content.

113
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.710
So it looks like we are good with that type of structure for the about us.

114
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.430
Let's create the other sections.

115
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.270
And we can do this by simply copying and pasting those sections.

116
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.420
So we did have the about section and another about section,

117
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.620
and we're going to create four of these and then we can update the contents of those

118
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.320
sections.

119
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.160
So we've got our first about area,

120
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.730
and then this one obviously can't be called a boat,

121
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.510
So give this one a separate I D and the I d is really important because this is how we're

122
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.460
gonna select the derrick various sections and this is gonna be a listing of the projects

123
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.150
contained within that section.

124
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.530
So all of the different projects can be listed out here.

125
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.760
And I'm gonna get rid of this place holder,

126
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.390
and we're gonna do do customized one for that one.

127
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.750
There's also the company information.

128
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.420
So maybe the story of how the company came to be.

129
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.050
So instead of about,

130
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.400
I'll call this one story and our story,

131
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.670
and I'll also customize the contents contained in this section and then lastly,

132
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.060
we're gonna have one called contact Contact us and as well,

133
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.150
same thing will customize the contents came contained within their.

134
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.850
So it looks like we're ready to continue with our website.

135
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:19.970
So as long as you have been able to set up the different pages that you want for your

136
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.600
project,

137
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.080
you can use the same pages that I'm using in this demonstration and next,

138
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.860
we're going to set up the navigation bar and apply some more styling to bring our project

139
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.360
toe life.

140
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.590
So it's still to come in the next lessons
