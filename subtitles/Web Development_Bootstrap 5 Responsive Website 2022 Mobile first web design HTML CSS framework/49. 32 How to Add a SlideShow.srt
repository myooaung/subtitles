1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
this lesson,

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,160
we're gonna be continued to build out our project.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,480
And we did the about.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,750
We've got the whole and we've got the projects.

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,240
Next we want to set up the our story.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,100
So this is a section on the website where we could include some information and additional

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,740
information.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,900
Maybe some pictures and images of the company that's being presented on the site and we are

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,560
going to be using the carousel is a slideshow component,

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,650
which allows us to cycle through elements,

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,910
so images,

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,280
slides of text just like a carousel.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,570
There's some great examples on the website and self and important thing here Is that the

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,210
carousel?

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,090
So these air,

16
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,480
based on the attributes,

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,950
it's gonna also require javascript for this component.

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,670
So we need to specify the class of Carousel slide.

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,710
The data rightist carousel,

20
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,740
giving it an I.

21
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,880
D and the I D will help identify it when were used in the carousel controls and then within

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,310
the carousel itself.

23
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,860
It's got the carousel inner and a bunch of different carousel items.

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,100
There's also the active one,

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,450
so that's the starting point,

26
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,790
and these are within a block with with of 100.

27
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,710
That's providing a full with of the images.

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,950
So in case the image itself isn't taking up the full with,

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,300
you can adjust it using that class.

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,530
There's also an option to add indicators,

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,390
so indicators are these things here at the bottom that we can add in,

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,520
and this allows you to go from slide to slide so you can even jump through different slides

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:30,520
.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,670
And those indicator controls also require the i.

35
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,720
D in the data target.

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,140
And then we need to specify which slide with order of index.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,440
And this is a rebased,

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,740
so it starts at zero.

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,260
So the 1st 1 is zero,

40
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,850
then 12 and so on,

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,630
and that's how you can add in the slides.

42
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,410
There's also a bunch of cool options like captions that you can add in,

43
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,870
and this you could added on top of the text.

44
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,570
So that makes a really nice effect.

45
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,190
Is also cross fade and a bunch of different ways to set the carousel.

46
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,490
You can adjust the carousel intervals,

47
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,400
so by default there is an interval of that's already preset,

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,870
so the default for the interval is 5000 so it's five seconds interval.

49
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,160
You can adjust that say,

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,920
suggesting the data interval.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,230
And here it date.

52
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,770
Inderal is 10,000.

53
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,850
That's 10 seconds,

54
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,470
and these air in milliseconds.

55
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,950
So 2000 is two seconds and so on.

56
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,280
So let's build this part out on our project.

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,390
So going down to where we have the section our story.

58
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,880
And once again we want to keep the format the same that we had within the projects and

59
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,820
within about.

60
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,080
So I'm gonna do a quick copy and paste just to make sure that our section is the same type

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,850
of structure.

62
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,340
Because this type of thing it's it's really important that we do get the structure the same

63
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,340
.

64
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,450
And for the most part,

65
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,940
I think that we already had it.

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,410
But let's copy and paste it anyway.

67
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,730
And I think the only thing that we were making different was we were adding in the margin

68
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,410
at the bottom.

69
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,780
So let's update our story and also be mindful of the I.

70
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,190
D.

71
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,250
You do need that I d to touch to that anchor ideas in the navigation bar,

72
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,850
so make sure that that one is always in place and we're going to need some images because

73
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,060
that's going to be just a image beast carousel.

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,950
So I'm gonna use the placeholder content in order for the images.

75
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,620
And of course,

76
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,860
if you already have images that you want to use,

77
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,740
you could use those instead and we might not want the carousel to go fully across.

78
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,720
So we'll divide up the carousel into spacing of eight,

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,160
and then we'll have some content on the site.

80
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,400
So let's set up that structure first,

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:50,130
using the classes where you have the role and setting up a column of M D eight and also

82
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,810
another one for some additional texts or carousel will go in the larger one,

83
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,780
and we'll have some additional text in the m d for.

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,500
And I just have a place soldier right now for the text so ready to create start

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,530
constructing the carousel and we need a mean differ that and northen i d to give this one

86
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,810
an idea of how you want identify the carousel.

87
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,300
So of course you can have multiple cara cells,

88
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,110
and the way that they're gonna be finding each other is with the I d.

89
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,970
So I'm gonna give it a carousel off.

90
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,900
I d.

91
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,140
And I spoke carousel wrong there and we do need to apply those boots,

92
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,650
drop classes of carousel and slight,

93
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,250
and then it also needs the attributes of data.

94
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,800
Right?

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,440
So that's the attribute.

96
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,660
And the data ride is a carousel so that this bootstrap nose and the browser knows to ply

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,530
the carousel functionality.

98
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,070
And again,

99
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,770
this is done in javascript.

100
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,600
So that's what we're going to make sure that we do have that available,

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,140
that we do have the JavaScript libraries attached.

102
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,980
And I miss spelt that once again.

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,180
So it seems to be having trouble spelling Carousel says car O U S E.

104
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,970
L is the way to smoke carousel,

105
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,990
so you do have to spell them properly.

106
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,820
Otherwise it's not gonna pick up the rate styling and the attributes.

107
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,240
That's their mean carousel container.

108
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,070
So that did.

109
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,810
There is the main carousel container,

110
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,450
and next we're going to do the inner part of the carousel.

111
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,460
So this is where the contents of the carousel are gonna take place.

112
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,540
So this is carousel inner class to indicate that this is where the inner contents of the

113
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,240
carousel are going to be housed and within the inner,

114
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,230
we've got the dibs and these air the actual slights that we have within the carousel.

115
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,990
And these are all carousel items and usually the 1st 1 we set toe active.

116
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,470
That's the default that it's going to start on.

117
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,990
And then whatever is contained within here is gonna be how what gets output And we are

118
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,170
gonna place an image in there with a source,

119
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,530
and then the source is gonna be going over to the placeholder.

120
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,940
So just copy that,

121
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,610
and we'll make some adjustments by that,

122
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,380
an object that to be hello.

123
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,910
And this image is gonna have a class.

124
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,840
So D Block is gonna create a block object from this a block element.

125
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,360
And if we said it two with 100 where take up 100% of the available space and this is gonna

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,800
be keeping the dimensions so we might want not want to have.

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,390
So we want to make maybe set a preset height of this and with these carousel is you do

128
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,410
wanna have images with the same dimensions.

129
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,690
So this is one thing to keep in mind when you are selecting the images,

130
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:35,360
so usually they look way better if they're more wide than they are tall.

131
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,340
That's why I just did that to 500 by 300.

132
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,860
And with police older,

133
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,200
it's a lot easier with regular images that's going a little bit more difficult to to handle

134
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,200
.

135
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,970
That's our content for the first item,

136
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,190
and you can add additional content as needed.

137
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,250
But we're just gonna have images in there and copy it.

138
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,760
Don't forget to remove the active and these air ologists carousel items and put some

139
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,080
different text into it and color it slightly different and will leave the class when we

140
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,830
refresh.

141
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,670
And by default,

142
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,800
it's every five seconds.

143
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,510
It's gonna change,

144
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,380
and we don't have the indicators yet.

145
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,190
We're gonna add those.

146
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,670
Of course,

147
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,800
that's our next carousel item.

148
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
It's a little bit hard to tell,

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,730
So there it just went to the next next slide.

150
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,390
So grab the next carousel item and you could add as many items as you want there all

151
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,280
carousel items,

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
so there's no wait.

153
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,610
There's no distinction that you have to do.

154
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,960
I'll just do last one on this.

155
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,410
Those air,

156
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,370
all of the carousel items conceived that and again.

157
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,010
Default is every five seconds,

158
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,640
so we can adjust that as needed.

159
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,000
So it's add in the carousel indicators,

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,800
and this is typically done with an ordered bust or on order list doesn't actually really

161
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,130
matter,

162
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:52,440
because this styling that's going to overwrite the differences and the class for this one

163
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,790
is carousel indicators and that carousel indicators are done with list items.

164
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,870
So list items and we need to specify the attributes.

165
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,150
So this is the target off what it's targeting,

166
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,740
and we had given the whole carousel an I d.

167
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,450
Of one.

168
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,740
Don't forget to add in the hash to indicate that we're looking by I d.

169
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,870
If you've got one by class,

170
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,010
then you could do the dot.

171
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,460
But it's always better to have ideas because we know what I ds.

172
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,790
That there's only the one.

173
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,690
And because the 1st 1 is active so that that corresponds,

174
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:34,770
and then there's more data that needs to be added in so data slide to attribute and then

175
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,920
equal that to the index value and the class is actually active,

176
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,260
and I just put that class in the wrong spot.

177
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,800
So let's update the target,

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,610
the class too active,

179
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,610
and you don't have to include anything in the list items.

180
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,690
So there's our 1st 1 So whenever we click it,

181
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,050
we always go back to the first.

182
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,260
You can adjust this and go toe to toe.

183
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,230
Doesn't matter.

184
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,690
Whatever one it's set to is the one that's going to go to.

185
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,390
And usually you do wanna have it in order that the slides air being presented just makes

186
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,740
sense.

187
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,820
So Carousel one so still the same one.

188
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,730
And it just set that to one.

189
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,280
Remove the active because this one's not active.

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,660
So it's a little bit more of agreed out kind of effect to it because it's not active and

191
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,990
then duplicate this to whatever number off slights.

192
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:28,680
So this is not automatic that you have to list them and associate them with the number of

193
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,170
slights.

194
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,590
So if you have three slides,

195
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,240
then you should have three of the indicators there.

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,340
So make sure that that all equals and matches.

197
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,140
So one last thing that we wanted to do a swell is toe have the controls so that controls

198
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,750
for previous and next.

199
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,060
So the user coming in,

200
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,680
they have an option to move to the next ones,

201
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,990
and we saw there's a number of ways to do that,

202
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,260
so these air these controls here on the left hand side.

203
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,470
And they do have some carousel icons.

204
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,680
So I got I just copy these just to save some trouble.

205
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,100
And we always have to make sure that you are rating these properly A soon as I put that it

206
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,110
shows up,

207
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,530
but they're not hooked up yet.

208
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,280
We have to update where we're linking them to.

209
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,800
So they have to link to whatever the name of our main object is.

210
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,620
And that's gonna be the carousel one element with the idea of Carousel one.

211
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,450
And then also just make sure that this one matches to carousel one as well.

212
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,180
And that's all you need to get the functionality.

213
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,730
So now we can click them and we see that it works.

214
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,080
Let's make this bigger and looks like everything is working as expected.

215
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,830
And then also,

216
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:46,400
we want to add in some text eso going back into that other def that we have for text.

217
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,430
I'm going to copy the Laura Ipsen text that we have from this previous section,

218
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,420
and also I could just align it left.

219
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,510
You can do any number of things for this area.

220
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,880
Eso just got that Laura Ipsen text there within the our story.

221
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,110
And then the main part of this lesson was to explore what we can do with the slide show

222
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,030
with the carousel.

223
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,070
So coming up next is the contact us where we're going to use the form,

224
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,210
and that's again available from the bootstrap documentation.

225
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,360
So they have a really nice way to present forms that's coming up next.
