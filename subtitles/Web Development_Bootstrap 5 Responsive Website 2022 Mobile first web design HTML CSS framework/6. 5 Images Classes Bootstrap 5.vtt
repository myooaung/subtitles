00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350
This lesson we're
gonna be adding in

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.030
images and the various classes

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.180
that you can use in order
to position your images.

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.800
So we've got the
one where we've got

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.570
the image within the text,

6
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.670
where you can set it to
the left to the text,

7
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.425
you can set it to the
right of the text.

8
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.360
Also how you can set
an image to take

9
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
the full line for the full
block of available spacing,

10
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.570
how you can add rounding
to your images,

11
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.445
create images as thumbnails,

12
00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:27.855
and also add the rounded
circle around the image.

13
00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.085
And then these images,

14
00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:31.080
depending on the
classes that you set,

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.300
they can be set to be fluid,

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.025
which makes them responsive.

17
00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:37.080
Pickup all of the
available space

18
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.775
within their parent container.

19
00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:40.350
We're going to add some images

20
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350
into the page and then apply

21
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.990
some image classes that we
have so we can set them

22
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.125
as thumbnails as well
as responsive images,

23
00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.450
selecting the source
for the image.

24
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.130
And I've got one image

25
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.350
here that's going to
be the bootstrap logo.

26
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.930
We'll just apply
that as an image on

27
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.310
the page and that's gonna be

28
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.410
listed just under
the container one.

29
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.850
So this image by default,

30
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.540
it's rather large and we can
apply some styling classes

31
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.370
to it in order to

32
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.590
be able to see it within
the main container,

33
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.450
to be able to see
the full image.

34
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.710
So let's go ahead
and we're going to

35
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.450
apply the image fluid.

36
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.920
So this is the class That's

37
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.840
gonna make the image responsive.

38
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.000
So now we can see
the full image and

39
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.280
as we resize the container,

40
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.400
resize and we can see the
image within the container.

41
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.385
You can also set the
image as a thumbnail.

42
00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:30.800
So it's another
alternative option.

43
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.435
I'll add the same image

44
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:34.190
and this time we'll
get a set it up

45
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.135
as a thumbnail,
the IMG thumbnail.

46
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:40.595
So that's gonna be setting
it as a thumbnail.

47
00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:44.630
So it provides a slight border
around the image and it's

48
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.535
a one-page border that's

49
00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:49.775
set and it's a whiteboard or
that set around the image.

50
00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.760
So it's slightly different
and it's still gonna be fully

51
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.985
responsive within the
available peach area.

52
00:01:55.985 --> 00:02:00.575
You can also set the
images in aligning them.

53
00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.000
So let's go ahead and
we're going to set

54
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.440
the image and create

55
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.025
some content within container
one within the div.

56
00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:10.520
I'm going to set the view to
word drop so that we can see

57
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.250
the full available spacing in

58
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.175
that container and add this,

59
00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:18.920
setting it up using a class of

60
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.530
rounded and then
doing the float.

61
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.095
And we'll set the float
to be to the start.

62
00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:26.915
Once again, our image
is going to be big.

63
00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:28.940
So we're gonna take
the image fluid,

64
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.460
bring that class
for their rounded,

65
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.540
it's easier to see it with

66
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.550
the thumbnail because we're
looking at the border.

67
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.690
So these are the edges that

68
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.800
are gonna be slightly rounded.

69
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.920
Let's make the image
and set a width of 100.

70
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.630
So that will take the width
and the height dimension.

71
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.570
See that float start

72
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.340
is going to work
and it's going to

73
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.575
inline it into the content,

74
00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:50.165
into the surrounding content.

75
00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:53.765
Let's copy this and we'll
set that to the other side.

76
00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.790
So you can set it as

77
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.865
inline image and
float it to the end.

78
00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:01.280
And you do need to have
the smaller images

79
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.470
so that they fit into the text.

80
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.695
And now that we've set
a width for the image,

81
00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:10.340
we're not going to need
to use the fluid as

82
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.155
these images are gonna be set
to the width of 100 picks.

83
00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:17.090
And this is in order
to demonstrate

84
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.505
the float start and float end.

85
00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:22.640
There's also to
center the image.

86
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.825
So create another copy of
this and set the style.

87
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:27.950
So we're gonna keep it as

88
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.085
rounded and they'll apply
some other properties.

89
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.950
Mexico, that will
set the image on

90
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.415
the full block aligning
vertically the text.

91
00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:40.010
It's not gonna, it's gonna
keep the first line of

92
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.740
text inline with the image size.

93
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.110
So if the image size is bigger,

94
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.500
when we use the MX auto
dot txt will be in

95
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.285
line and centered vertically
within the image height.

96
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:56.465
And the height and the width
are automatically set.

97
00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:58.220
When we set either the width or

98
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.920
the height within
the HTML styling,

99
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.210
that's going to automatically

100
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.835
resize and keep the
dimensions of the image.

101
00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:06.739
There's also a d-block,

102
00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.880
and what that does is that
centers the image and

103
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.200
removes out the text
that was surrounding it.

104
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.235
What this did is this
essentially created the image

105
00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.200
that took up the full block of

106
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.690
available code within that line.

107
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.940
So it's shifted the content

108
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.560
down so that the image

109
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.285
would be able to take
up the full block.

110
00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:32.420
You can combine the various
classes together so you can

111
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.260
set the image to be fluid
as well as thumbnail.

112
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.685
So that's the fluid.

113
00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:41.720
I'll get rid of the rounded
and set this to image.

114
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.070
Thumbnail.

115
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.910
We can have a combination where
the thumbnail is going to

116
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.705
add in the available
border around the image.

117
00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:53.525
And then as we
resize this image,

118
00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:56.360
and because we already have
fluid and image fluid,

119
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.440
it's already going
to be taking up

120
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.940
the full available width

121
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.355
that's available
within the container.

122
00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:03.740
We can get rid of the width of

123
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.850
200% and the fluid
size of the image.

124
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.380
We'll just take
whatever's available

125
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.520
within the container.

126
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.740
So this one is going to be using

127
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.270
the thumbnail and it's also

128
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.010
going to allow us to resize it.

129
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.395
So you can combine the
various classes together.

130
00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:22.054
You can also set the image
to be rounded circle,

131
00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:25.400
the rounded circle class
That's going to provide

132
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.760
that rounding of the
image within the circle,

133
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.680
which is different than
the rounded corners

134
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.510
because they're
rounded corners is

135
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.755
slightly rounding the
edges of the images.

136
00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:39.785
Instead of just having
them as a square.

137
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:42.545
You can see that better
within the thumbnail.

138
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:44.690
As the thumbnail does
have the border and

139
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.850
it is slightly
rounded on the edges.

140
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.890
And if you want a
complete circle,

141
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.270
you can do it this
way where we added

142
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.590
the rounded circle class.
