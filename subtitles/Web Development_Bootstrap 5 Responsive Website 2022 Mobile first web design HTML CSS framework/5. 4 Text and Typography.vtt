00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Lesson we're gonna be
looking at options for

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.235
typography and text formatting

3
00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.035
and as well within the lists,

4
00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.110
how we can apply different
list styles in order to create

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.085
structure within our
lists of HTML content.

6
00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.970
Looking at the H tags
and how we can apply

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.710
a class which applies

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.515
the same styling as
the heading tags.

9
00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:26.325
There's the H1, H2,
all the way to H6.

10
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.680
There's also a display tag.

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.090
So this is if you want to

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.590
highlight the text
a little bit more,

13
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.705
makes it bigger
and makes the text

14
00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:36.565
thinner as opposed
to the heading tags.

15
00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:39.200
There's also what
the small and markup

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.435
where you can apply
the various classes.

17
00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.825
Some of the elements
will also have styling

18
00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.395
in Bootstrap such as
code for the list items.

19
00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.454
So if you want it to do
on unlist, unstyled,

20
00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:54.290
that will remove out the bullet
points in the margin for

21
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.240
the list and basically

22
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.045
stock the list items one
on top of the other.

23
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.295
There's also the list inline.

24
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.865
So if case you want to have
the list contents inline.

25
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.085
That's how you can
stack them inline.

26
00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:08.450
You need to apply

27
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.425
the list inline item class
to the list items as well.

28
00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:14.600
We're also going to be
looking at how we can create

29
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.060
a description list and applying

30
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.160
different grid options within

31
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.110
the description list
in order to create

32
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.315
structure for the HTML elements.

33
00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.400
That's all coming
up in this lesson.

34
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.420
Bootstrap five uses a default
setting of font size,

35
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.700
which is equal to one REM,

36
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.670
and that's approximately
16 pixels by default.

37
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.115
And the line-height is 1.5.

38
00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.379
When you do add in the content.

39
00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:42.290
And you can see that
once it starts wrapping,

40
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.420
it's applying the
different line heights,

41
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.440
as well as the default
pixel size for the font.

42
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.365
There's also a size that's
being set for the headings.

43
00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:54.185
So we've got this
element as having one

44
00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:55.790
and you can go all
the way to heading

45
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.440
two and heading three.

46
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.610
You can also apply

47
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.435
the customized styling to
the various page elements.

48
00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:04.850
So if we had a div and let's

49
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.280
set the class for
the div and set it

50
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.335
up as H1 and add in the
same content there.

51
00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:15.665
So we can do HelloWorld
one for that,

52
00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.290
and we'll do one for H2 as well.

53
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.630
So just under the H12 and it

54
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.270
is applying different
styling sizes.

55
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.420
And once you apply the class,

56
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.655
it's going to actually
make the page element,

57
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:31.100
even though it's
not an h2 element,

58
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.795
it's gonna apply
the class to it.

59
00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:35.390
So it's going to output
that identically.

60
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.445
There's also display headings.

61
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:39.230
So these are ways to really

62
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.000
stand out from the
normal headings.

63
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.475
And these allow you
to really upside

64
00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.505
with a larger font and
lighter font-weight.

65
00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:49.580
There are also six of these
display headings that you

66
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.775
can use in order to apply
the display headings,

67
00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:54.830
you just need to
specify which size

68
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.215
display heading you want to set.

69
00:02:57.215 --> 00:02:59.930
This is display, and it's done

70
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.600
with a dash to indicate
the different sizes.

71
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.120
And I'll update that
content in there.

72
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.860
And you can use any elements.

73
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.185
So these could be
paragraphs there, divs.

74
00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:11.735
You can set them to
whichever ones you want.

75
00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:13.220
The different display settings,

76
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.920
just like the headings
within the HTML tags,

77
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.775
they can go from one to six,

78
00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:21.065
with one being the largest,

79
00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.810
six being the smallest in size.

80
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.650
And they are quite a bit bigger
than the regular H tags.

81
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.515
So they will stand
out more on the page.

82
00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:32.060
And as you can see,
it goes all the

83
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.695
way down to display six,

84
00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:38.030
which is still larger
than the H1 tag.

85
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.790
But notice that the
font is lighter in

86
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.690
size and for other
page elements as well.

87
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.040
So if you're using the
small tag for the element,

88
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.215
or if you're using the
mark tag for an element,

89
00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:59.510
there's already going to be
default styling for these,

90
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.405
in addition for code as well.

91
00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:05.510
And these are built-in
to the HTML and they're

92
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.540
actually going to output
it in this format.

93
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.580
So if we were to take these and

94
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.575
apply the Bootstrap styling,

95
00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:14.300
and actually the code
isn't going to work

96
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.205
because they don't have
a class for the code,

97
00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.425
but they do have a
class for small,

98
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.555
and they do have
a class for Mark.

99
00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:25.280
Those are just using the same
words for the class names.

100
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.080
So you can convert
it into small,

101
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.670
you can venture into mark.

102
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.290
And the only thing
that it doesn't do

103
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.270
is it doesn't set it as inline.

104
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.045
So if you were to
set these as spans,

105
00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:36.380
whereas span would already have

106
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.225
that inline property
within the element itself,

107
00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:42.950
then they're going
to look the same.

108
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.105
Now the small and the mark

109
00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:49.220
are going to look
identical to what we would

110
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.605
have if you were
using the elements.

111
00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:54.559
This is styling that's
being applied by Bootstrap.

112
00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:55.835
I'll make the page view

113
00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:57.410
slightly bigger so
that we can take

114
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.680
a closer look at the way the
content is being displayed.

115
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.800
There's also lists and
within the topography,

116
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.650
there's what you can do with
the lists in Bootstrap.

117
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.125
Let's create a few lists and C

118
00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.780
and apply the different
classes to the lists.

119
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.490
So this is an unordered list

120
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.350
where we've got a
bunch of list items.

121
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.975
And I'll just add
in the list items.

122
00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:20.765
So it gives us the first list
that we're working with.

123
00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:23.915
And I'll copy that and
create a few other lists.

124
00:05:23.915 --> 00:05:25.984
So let's apply a class.

125
00:05:25.984 --> 00:05:27.485
And for the classes,

126
00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:29.389
we do have a list.

127
00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.320
And this class is going
to be list on styled.

128
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.570
That will apply and

129
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.880
remove out the bullet
points from the list.

130
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.250
So by default, we do have
the bullet points within

131
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.265
the HTML with list unstyled.

132
00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:45.440
This is gonna give
us an unstyled list

133
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.480
that remove South
the left margin.

134
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.335
There's also a list inline
applying the class,

135
00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.630
and this is going to
be listed in line.

136
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.945
And list inline also
removes so at the margins.

137
00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:58.970
But for the list items,

138
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.450
this is going to allow us
to apply the inline list to

139
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.000
each of the list items

140
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.620
that are contained
within the list.

141
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.500
You have to specify
the class of list

142
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.515
in line item in
order to apply it.

143
00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:14.150
And when that gets supplied,

144
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.205
It's going to move the
list items inline.

145
00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:18.485
So that means that if
you have more than two,

146
00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:20.150
it's going to start
inlining them.

147
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.585
And if you apply the list
inline to all of the elements,

148
00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:27.935
It's going to add them all
and have them as inlined,

149
00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:30.290
applying them
horizontally instead of

150
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.990
what you would typically
get with a list.

151
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.500
There's also with
the description list

152
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.990
and how you can construct
the description list,

153
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.210
including the grid format.

154
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.880
So typically with a
descriptive list,

155
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.145
you'd have the descriptive list,

156
00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:48.740
and then within there
you have the d t for

157
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.545
the title of the
descriptive list.

158
00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:55.220
And then for each one of the
descriptive list elements,

159
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.990
you would use the DD.

160
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.870
And that would include the
elements for the list.

161
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.820
So let's tell you
typically create

162
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.915
the descriptive list how it
might have a number of these,

163
00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:09.275
23, and just save that.

164
00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:11.720
So that gives us the
descriptive list.

165
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.865
With the Bootstrap grid.

166
00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:16.820
You can apply the Bootstrap
grid properties to

167
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.980
the list items in
order to display them

168
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.470
as needed title of the list.

169
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.685
You can use an add-in
the class of row.

170
00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:27.470
And then for each one of

171
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.080
the list items can set

172
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.275
the different nesting that
you want for the list items.

173
00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:37.880
You can align the title
alongside of the list items.

174
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.490
So that's supplying that
property to the title.

175
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.860
And then for each one of the
other elements because they

176
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.275
are contained within the row,

177
00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:48.230
we can apply the different
list of values to

178
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.485
those elements within
the list elements.

179
00:07:51.485 --> 00:07:54.635
So let's set these
up as two to two.

180
00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:56.240
And maybe we want
to set this up as

181
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.550
six because we're using SM.

182
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.200
So that's setting a breakpoint.

183
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.500
Let's update the screen size.

184
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.335
And now you can see
that the title has

185
00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:09.740
this element and then these
ones here are aligned.

186
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.035
This is another way that
you can create the lists,

187
00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:14.930
creating a grid format and

188
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.869
then applying two
different titles.

189
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:19.910
So if you have additional titles

190
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.130
and you might have
some elements,

191
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.649
maybe this one, you
have the two elements.

192
00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:28.220
So you want them to be
aligned with the title.

193
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.280
So always having that same
spacing for the title.

194
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.545
And let's create one more here.

195
00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:35.780
This can be for the title.

196
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.760
And maybe we want to
go all the way across

197
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.650
for this element
because we want to just

198
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.930
have the one element there
that will keep all of

199
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.210
the titles in line
with the elements.

200
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.074
We will resize it that
will keep that structure.

201
00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:48.560
If we go really small,

202
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.640
then it's going to stock

203
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.355
those list items into
this type of format.

204
00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:56.300
And this is how you can
use the list alongside

205
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.310
with the grid in order to build

206
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.830
the structure for
your webpage content.

207
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.720
So try it out to get more

208
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.490
familiar with what
you can do with

209
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:09.095
the grid and various topography
and text formatting.

210
00:09:09.095 --> 00:09:11.550
Within Bootstrap.
