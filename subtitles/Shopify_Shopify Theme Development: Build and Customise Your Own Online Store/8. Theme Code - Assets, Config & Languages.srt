00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,090
Welcome back everyone. In this video,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,495
we're going to finally dive into our theme code and talk about what's going on.

3
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:12,345
Let's open up our code editor,

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:19,995
or if you want to follow along in the edit code section of your theme, either is fine.

5
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:21,615
As I mentioned previously,

6
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:23,570
I recommend you make all your changes here.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,380
But just for looking at the code,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,440
you can look at it here if you prefer.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,110
I'm just going to look at it in the code editor

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,420
because that's where we're going to be editing,

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,765
but you'll see here that if I contract all these parent tables,

12
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,710
we've got assets, config, layout,

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,220
locales, sections, snippets, and templates.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,755
Templates, snippets, sections, and layout are the main folders of your theme.

15
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:57,980
That's the ones you're going to be editing to edit the look and feel of your website,

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,450
what you'd expect from a theme.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,600
But there's other important supporting folders here;

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,500
assets, config , and locales.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,915
In this lesson, we're going to cover those first,

20
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,150
and then we're going to go into the main ones,

21
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,195
break them down in the following two lessons.

22
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,355
To start with assets.

23
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,920
Assets, if you're new to web development,

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,230
stuff like images, style sheets, and JavaScript files.

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,375
That's really what we have here.

26
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:30,130
We've got images that we use within the theme,

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,055
we can put in here.

28
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:34,395
We've got JavaScript files.

29
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,455
This one is for when you do gift cards.

30
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:43,055
We have SCSS files and you can see there's a.liquid at the end there.

31
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:51,565
The most important one in your assets file would probably be your theme.scss.liquid.

32
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:57,125
Something that you may not be familiar with is a technology called SAS.

33
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,295
SAS is basically a CSS compiling language.

34
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:08,420
It basically comes before CSS and allows us to do call things like functions,

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,320
and variables, and nesting.

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,830
What it does is it compiles or transforms

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,555
into regular CSS when we either choose to compile it,

38
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:23,685
or, and this is the great thing about Shopify,

39
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,330
is that SCSS is compiled for us.

40
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,735
When you see an SCSS file,

41
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:33,380
you can basically put in whatever CSS you want in there.

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,025
CSS is backwards compatible with SCSS,

43
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:41,100
but this is basically your style sheet of your whole theme.

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,010
Now, the reason it's got.liquid on the end of it,

45
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,765
is because we're able to put it in liquid variables.

46
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:50,195
We're going to go into liquid in a later video,

47
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:55,035
but I can search for this right here.

48
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,890
You can see here that we're loading in

49
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,875
some SAS variables with variables that are set in our customizer.

50
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,845
We're also going to look at this in a sec in our config.

51
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:10,700
But settings here, the global settings object,

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,805
is what our theme settings is.

53
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:16,195
If we go back to here,

54
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,275
this is going a bit too deep too quickly,

55
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:20,535
but we'll get there.

56
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,200
If we go into here,

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,485
so we are going to the customizer part of that,

58
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:29,100
then we go into theme settings.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,920
Here at settings color text,

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,020
that's going to be in colors,

61
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,700
and it's probably going to be one of these ones,

62
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,630
probably the body text.

63
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,830
It's essentially putting what selection you have here in

64
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,580
your customizer inside a SAS variable.

65
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,425
Then what you can do instead of calling a specific color,

66
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,450
you can call this.

67
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,995
You can search for usages of that variable.

68
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,275
As you can see here,

69
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:05,850
this is pretty normal CSS apart from the SAS variables.

70
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,530
If you're not familiar with SAS,

71
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,800
I definitely recommend looking it up.

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,900
It's not too complicated to learn if you already know CSS.

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,510
If you are overwhelmed by this and you didn't expect

74
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,205
to learn SAS as well as learning Shopify development,

75
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:22,440
don't worry at all,

76
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,510
you don't have to use SAS.

77
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,675
You can throw in regular CSS in here.

78
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,950
If you want to think of this as your main CSS file,

79
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,600
you can go right ahead and do that.

80
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,630
Don't worry too much about SAS if you're new to it.

81
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,470
But if you are familiar with SAS or you want to learn it,

82
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,830
it's great that Shopify does compile SAS and

83
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,190
allows you to do stuff like I showed you where,

84
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,000
let's see if I can find it again, it's too hard to find,

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,440
but basically where you can set a variable in your theme settings to

86
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,420
a variable in your style sheet and then call it throughout your style sheet.

87
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,140
Very cool. The other one is your theme.js.

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,440
Now, this could easily be theme.js.liquid,

89
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,630
but with this theme,

90
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:16,400
it appears that there is no liquid variables that are going to be inserted in this file.

91
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,390
It's just theme.js, and that goes for here as well.

92
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,685
If you're not inserting any liquid into it,

93
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,665
you don't have to put.liquid on the end.

94
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:30,315
This is going to hold all your themes JavaScript.

95
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:33,200
If you're not too familiar with JavaScript,

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,615
this could get a little gnarly as well.

97
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,385
Best to leave this unless you need to dig into the JavaScript.

98
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:44,095
Here you've got some other JavaScript libraries.

99
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:47,870
Lazysizes is something that a lot of Shopify themes

100
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,815
use in order to optimize image sizes on different screens.

101
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:55,505
Again, you don't need to worry too much about what's going on in here.

102
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:59,615
What you do need to know is that the assets folder is there,

103
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,880
and that's where you find your style sheet,

104
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,530
which you'll likely be editing,

105
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,595
and your JavaScript file.

106
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:11,195
Moving on, we've got another folder here called config.

107
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:16,430
Config is interesting because you know how we talked about how

108
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,975
that color text was set in your customizer, in settings.colortext.

109
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:26,945
Well, you can actually look up that value in your setting_data.

110
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:32,580
If we were to do that, find out what it's calling color text.

111
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,825
If I copy that and I go into our data,

112
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,455
I can actually find where that is set.

113
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:43,215
Here, you can see there's thirteen of them.

114
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,430
Let's have a look.

115
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,930
Current. Here on current,

116
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,320
which is what we're using right now,

117
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,510
you can see the color text is set to this specific value.

118
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,485
But if we were to go in and change it here,

119
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:08,780
it's going to update in that theme settings_data.json.

120
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,410
All the data in Shopify are setup in json format,

121
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,520
so that's J-S-O-N. Again, if you're new to web development,

122
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,475
that might be something that you're not familiar with,

123
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,080
but it's pretty simple,

124
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,845
you nest within these curly brackets.

125
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:29,315
Say for instance, you wanted to get to current.colortext,

126
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,170
go into current, go into color text,

127
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,450
and there you have it.

128
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,455
Pretty simple stuff.

129
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:46,345
In settings_schema, that is the layer that sits outside of what data you have in here.

130
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:50,400
You have the value for color text here,

131
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,175
but in your schema,

132
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:58,790
you set that as a value that users can edit within the customizer.

133
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,005
As you can see here, settings, Id, color_text,

134
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:09,405
this is what sets it up as a customizer option,

135
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,585
and the type is a color selection.

136
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:17,179
To show you, if we were to delete this altogether,

137
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:22,280
this option, you'll see that it doesn't even show up in the customizer anymore.

138
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,215
Press save on that.

139
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:26,780
I'll look at theme watch.

140
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,580
By the way, if you made any errors,

141
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,265
it should come up here.

142
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,000
Definitely keep an eye on this.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,020
If there's any errors,

144
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,875
it actually won't compile and send up to the store.

145
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:41,555
But if I want to refresh the editor here and head into my theme settings,

146
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,735
go into colors, you can see that color is gone,

147
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:47,585
and it wasn't actually the body text, it was the one above it.

148
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:50,195
I can't remember what that one was called,

149
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,615
but if we bring this back,

150
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:58,005
you can see the label was headings and links.

151
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,550
If I save that,

152
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,495
which I've done, it's going to re-upload again.

153
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:06,260
Refresh the page, theme,

154
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,615
settings, colors, and there you go,

155
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,370
that option is there again.

156
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,320
This is a first introduction to schemas for us.

157
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,110
We basically got a giant schema that sits on top

158
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,395
of the whole theme with a bunch of different settings,

159
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:27,430
and this mirrors what we have in our theme settings.

160
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:36,815
This is like the developer backend JSON representation of all the data we have in here.

161
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:38,960
I could even change it here,

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,055
and it will update over here in our actual theme.

163
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:45,695
Or I can change it here,

164
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,240
and that will update in our theme here.

165
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,365
Both are tied together.

166
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:56,255
Now, when I deleted this before and I brought it back,

167
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,580
you'll notice that it still has that value.

168
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,240
Now, that probably is the default value that's set here.

169
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,830
But even if it wasn't,

170
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,705
even if there was no default value,

171
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,410
the data still saves.

172
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,290
If you go into your schema and delete something like we did,

173
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,180
it doesn't actually delete the data as well,

174
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,535
and maybe you want to delete that.

175
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:19,410
But usually when you're doing theme development,

176
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,215
this is specific to the store and you don't necessarily want to edit this stuff.

177
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,750
I would generally leave this stuff alone.

178
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,870
It does come in handy when you're maybe

179
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,990
migrating a store and you've made some changes to settings,

180
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,230
you may want to copy those settings that are

181
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,150
all listed out here when you make those changes.

182
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,310
If that was a bit overwhelming or it went a bit over the head,

183
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,705
don't worry too much.

184
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:49,100
The main reason to know about this stuff is,

185
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,985
say for instance, if you wanted to create your own setting.

186
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,690
If you wanted to create your own setting,

187
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,265
you could come in here,

188
00:10:55,265 --> 00:11:00,150
maybe you want to create another color text type.

189
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,090
You could just throw that in there,

190
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,150
rename the ID, change the label,

191
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,285
and then suddenly you would have that in

192
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:13,065
your list of options here and then within your code,

193
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:16,125
you could reference it just like we had in our example here.

194
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:21,420
You can reference that new variable that you set anywhere within your template.

195
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,545
That's the real benefit of having the schema here to edit.

196
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:31,440
You can create theme settings from this file and then this one just stores your data.

197
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,540
You probably shouldn't need to change anything

198
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,080
here unless you wanted to do a migration and

199
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,300
you didn't want to have to go through and update

200
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,630
all these different values yourself through the Customizer.

201
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:50,220
Final one and then we'll move on to the actual like layout files is Locales.

202
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,585
In Locales, it's basically your languages.

203
00:11:54,585 --> 00:12:01,469
If we go back into our online store and in the theme section,

204
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:04,545
click on actions and edit languages,

205
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:10,485
we can see a user interface for us to change all the language options.

206
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:12,570
Now what are these language options?

207
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,345
Well, if we look through our code,

208
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:17,940
so let's just go into,

209
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,180
let's just choose header and we can see here a bunch of them already.

210
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,925
We can see { layout.

211
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:30,780
navigation.search} and then we can see this pipe symbol here with a'

212
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,100
T.' The 'T' basically says, filter by language.

213
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,945
Why that's important is,

214
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:39,435
instead of hard-coding in values here,

215
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:44,400
we can set them up in languages and then we can translate them.

216
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,440
Hopefully this will make sense,

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,975
I might provide an example later in the class,

218
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,705
but let's look at a more obvious one,

219
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,730
just for demonstration purposes.

220
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,880
A common one is Cart language.

221
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,100
If I click on I'm going to do it with my customer, I might as well do it here.

222
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,875
If I go into here and I see your cart on the cot template.

223
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,610
Let me go into templates,

224
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,055
cart and it links directly to a section called cart template.

225
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:19,275
I'm going to go into that section.

226
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:23,300
If I try and find your cart, it's not there,

227
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,910
I can't find it and the reason why is because your cart is set in the language settings,

228
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,190
so you see here your cart.

229
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,590
If we wanted to change that label,

230
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,450
we could go in here,

231
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,930
find where the language variables come across.

232
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,680
I think it's this one { cart.

233
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,650
General. Title}. Let's just go in and change that.

234
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,980
I'm going to get rid of that liquid tag and just put in,> this is the cart<.

235
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,215
I'm going to save that,

236
00:13:55,215 --> 00:14:04,620
check that everything's working fine with theme kit and then [inaudible].

237
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,050
Let me just click on it from over here,

238
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,395
making sure we're on the correct theme.

239
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:12,465
It's not that one,

240
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:14,835
so we've obviously edited the wrong one,

241
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:18,150
but I can actually find what it's [inaudible] in here.

242
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,800
This is the English language file and we're running English at

243
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,210
the moment as you can see and if I was to go to find title.

244
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,260
Let me just look for cart and they'll have general title, your cart.

245
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,250
I need to find that cart general title.

246
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,910
Some product title, sorry,

247
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,775
there's a few uses of the word title in here.

248
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,550
It appears we were editing the right one,

249
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,320
but we just don't have any items in

250
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,585
our cart that's why this header is not actually showing up.

251
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:10,980
Let's just add something to our cart to demonstrate this,

252
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,345
so we don't have whole products showing on a homepage yet,

253
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:18,584
but we can go to the old collection.

254
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,985
Let's just add this to our cart.

255
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:24,420
Now we're in our cart page and as you can see,

256
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,710
the text we put in,

257
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,635
this is the cart is showing.

258
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:34,965
We can obviously cart code values into our project right here.

259
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:39,570
Just to show this is the cart cart to make it clear,

260
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,540
like I am editing this particular page.

261
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,725
I am editing it right here,

262
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:52,830
we don't want to do that and the reason why is,

263
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,380
if we change to say, for instance,

264
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,840
German and we offer this website in German as well and we want to have

265
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,360
certain language that is easily translated

266
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,810
into that language to come through and be in that language,

267
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,740
is going to come up with this is cart cart while everything else has been translated.

268
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,095
That's why we use languages.

269
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:18,380
If say for instance and you may not care about other languages,

270
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,895
may be you are only advertising to the one market.

271
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:24,705
Maybe we don't care at all about languages,

272
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:28,710
but even still, it's a best practice to use these variables.

273
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:37,410
I'll go into here and Instead of changing that in the code here,

274
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,255
I'm going to update the variable.

275
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,460
Instead of your cart,

276
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,345
put in, this is cart cart.

277
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:49,815
I am just making it really obvious that we're changing it.

278
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:54,570
Because nobody would say this is cart cart, quite obviously.

279
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,040
If we refresh the page it will come up with this is cart cart.

280
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,650
Essentially the same result,

281
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:10,725
but just a better practice to have all of these common words in a file in your locales,

282
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:15,555
then calling that variable within your template.

283
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:20,130
You'll see here we using a lot of standard language and

284
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,260
it might trip you up a little bit if you didn't know

285
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,660
about these language files because you might go in and be like,

286
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,835
well, I want to change this text.

287
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,335
Let's refresh it again,

288
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:29,670
back to your cart.

289
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,580
You know, it might trip you up if you want to go on, well,

290
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,820
I want to change that word in my Shopify theme.

291
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,520
Let me search for your cart in cart template.

292
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,440
What the hell, I can't find it.

293
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,335
Like, how am I going to change this?

294
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:45,630
That's why we need to talk about

295
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,170
language variables because if you want to change something like that,

296
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,900
you're going to have to change it in here.

297
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,540
All hard-coded, as I said,

298
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,300
hard coding is not best practice.

299
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,730
If you want to change language like that,

300
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,470
that standard across the theme,

301
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,995
change it in here and if you ever in future,

302
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,275
when I translate it into a different language,

303
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,975
you've got these other files here.

304
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:14,835
You can see cart general title and this is what it is in English.

305
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:19,455
If we go into this which I believe is German,

306
00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:23,580
you can go cart general title and

307
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,005
that value on a German [inaudible] is going to be this word instead,

308
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:33,130
which I won't even try to pronounce because it looks hard and I don't speak German.

309
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:39,000
That's locales, that's config and that's assets.

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,460
Maybe I rushed a bit through this because there is a lot to cover with Shopify themes,

311
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,530
but essentially, this is where you store variables related to language.

312
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,745
This is where you store a schema data or like

313
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:56,610
General Settings data and this is where you

314
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,915
define what options are available in your schema,

315
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:04,140
which translate directly to your Customizer.

316
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,555
Finally, to review assets.

317
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:09,015
Assets is where you put your style sheet,

318
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,740
you JavaScript file and any images or other files that you

319
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,750
need to call in Frontend assets that will help your store run.

320
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,865
But again, you shouldn't have to edit any of these, it's just theme.

321
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:27,270
SCSS. liquid which is the most important one because

322
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,620
inevitably you're going to want to change some CSS on your page.

323
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,360
You can do that using liquid,

324
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,750
you can do that using SAS.

325
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,185
But you can also just put in plain old CSS that'll work to,

326
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:43,260
all of those options are available to you.

327
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,620
In the next video, I'm excited to get into the other parts of your theme template.

328
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,600
I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
