1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,645
So in this course we learned how to quickly spin up a Shopify development store,

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:08,040
how to edit the code of the debut theme that came with the store and in the process,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,490
we learned how themes work and the options available to us to

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,000
customize virtually anything to do with our online store friend.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,290
Now this knowledge alone might be enough to satisfy your basic Shopify needs.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,640
But inevitably, you're going to need to make changes beyond the scope of this course.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,350
Now in the next bonus lesson,

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,910
I'm going to introduce you to a much more complex way of developing Shopify themes,

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,875
starting almost from scratch.

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,890
But before that, I'm going to assume

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,175
that the debut theme or any other theme that takes your fancy,

12
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:41,430
provides a good base for how you want your site to function.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,215
And this is definitely what I recommend to everyone who's developing Shopify themes.

14
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:51,380
There is a lot of great themes out there and especially when I'm working with clients,

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,710
I usually use an existing theme as a starting point.

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,020
Doesn't always make sense to re-invent the wheel unless you really need something custom.

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,535
And that's why we're going to talk about slate in the bonus lesson.

18
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:06,580
We're also going to talk, after this lesson about,

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,420
how to take your site live.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,035
I've actually put this lesson before, that one,

21
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:15,995
because once you actually transfer ownership of your store,

22
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,885
you may lose access to it.

23
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,390
Unless the person or the account that you've

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,425
transferred ownership to starts on a paying plan.

25
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,275
So if you're ready to get on a paying plan,

26
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:29,020
you can definitely learn about how to move your site

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,035
onto your actual Shopify plan in the next video.

28
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:36,820
But for now, what I wanted to talk briefly about is how you would

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,640
take the next step in learning what you want to do with your Shopify theme next.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,480
So let's just dive into our theme and

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,815
talk a little bit about maybe some customizations we would want to make.

32
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:56,230
Now the first customization that you might want to make is a styling change.

33
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,950
And that is very normal

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,040
and that's probably going to happen at some point with your theme.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,630
You might want to change say the margin between this heading and this right here.

36
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:14,030
So you go into your section and you look for that option in

37
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,950
your customizer and you don't have a option in your customizer to change the margin here.

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,220
So you have two choices.

39
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,795
You can either go in and just create the change,

40
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:30,335
or you can create an option in

41
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:34,775
your section code to allow yourself to do this in your customizer.

42
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:38,330
So if it is a styling change and you just want to apply

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,050
it to side-wise without making it a customizable option,

44
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,515
what you can do is just throw it in your theme.scss.liquid.

45
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:50,735
So let's just use that example that I just talked about.

46
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:53,790
Let's find out what this is.

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,025
So we are in the image with text overlay section,

48
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:01,060
and unfortunately we can't look it up by the template name.

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,560
We're going to have to search the folder and find image with text overlay.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:15,800
So image with text overlay and then in here we can

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,060
see where that appears and that name appears

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,815
in the schema of this section right here, hero dot liquid.

53
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,280
So this is the section that we're currently looking at.

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,140
If we look at it right here,

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,855
maybe it's not clear which of these divs actually relate to what we see on the page.

56
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:38,825
So we might want to inspect and this is something I often do.

57
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,770
Using our development tools,

58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,390
we can see what that is.

59
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,065
And as you can see here,

60
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:50,550
it is this div with a class of R-T-E dash setting mega dash subtitle,

61
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,305
mega dash subtitle, dash, dash, large.

62
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:58,210
So looking into my code here,

63
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,905
I can search for mega subtitle.

64
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:05,455
I can already see it, but just to be clear.

65
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,900
So we've got mega subtitle,

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,795
and mega title. Here we go.

67
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:15,055
We've got it in a few different places,

68
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,070
but this is the one we're looking for.

69
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,560
So if we wanted to make it a option in the customizer,

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,195
what we could do is add an inline style

71
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:32,400
and set margin top and we would define it maybe as,

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,600
so we go into section dot settings and maybe we called it top margin.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,480
Now we'd also want to check if we actually have set the top margin first.

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,530
So we'd want to put an if statement around this.

75
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,035
But let's just say we want to change the top margin site-wide.

76
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:57,675
So we would go into our theme dot S-C-S-S dot liquid,

77
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:59,160
scroll all the way down.

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,710
This is a very big file and let's create a rule for mega dash subtitle.

79
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,049
And in here, we're going to set the margin top to something ridiculous,

80
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:14,660
just so we can see that it's working.

81
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,820
So I'm going to press save on that.

82
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,310
Check that we haven't made any errors.

83
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,810
Yes, it's updated now and if I refresh this page,

84
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,730
you can see now that we've got this ridiculous margin top that's

85
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,760
affecting any element with a class of mega dash subtitle,

86
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,370
which should hopefully only be

87
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,815
that section within this section or that piece of text within that section.

88
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,720
So I've just removed that.

89
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,055
It's updated our code.

90
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:49,080
If I refresh the page again, we're back to normal.

91
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,475
So that's one scenario.

92
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,035
Maybe you want to update the styling.

93
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,225
So you can do that with CSS.

94
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:57,170
Maybe you want to update something that happens with JavaScript.

95
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,045
So I'm not sure how much ajax we have on here.

96
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,690
If I put that up to three,

97
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,870
looks like the debut theme is not heavy on the JavaScript.

98
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,690
I have to click update here when quantity updates.

99
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,675
But this could be a customization option.

100
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,970
Instead of having to click Update,

101
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,660
maybe we want this to update whenever we click on this.

102
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,495
And because this is a live page change,

103
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:25,925
we would want to do that with JavaScript.

104
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:30,590
So you would research how to do that and then you would go,

105
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,755
and likely you put it in your theme dot js.

106
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:35,975
So let's say we want to do that,

107
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,345
how would we word that problem?

108
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:40,820
Open up a new tab and search in Google,

109
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,970
make quantity update price automatically,

110
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,970
and then of course,

111
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,860
we need to put in what platform we're using; Shopify.

112
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:03,215
Okay. So there's a bunch of different articles on here.

113
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,290
I haven't actually searched this before,

114
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,355
but this is the process I would go to find the answer.

115
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,935
So this is not the best thread.

116
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:16,600
You're not always going to find the perfect answer on your first search.

117
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,630
Here we go. Here's something that looks about right.

118
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,870
So judging from my knowledge of JavaScript already, and of course,

119
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,280
this is not a JavaScript course,

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,175
so if you do want to get deeper into JavaScript,

121
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:33,820
I have got a course on JavaScript here on skillshare.com as well.

122
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,920
But you're going to want to set up an event listener here to

123
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,590
check when this changes and then we're going to have to update these parts here,

124
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,445
rather than having it updated when you click the update button,

125
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,595
which you can see here is reloading the whole page.

126
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,905
So that's a customization you might want to do.

127
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:56,825
Of course, before you customize anything with code,

128
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:00,230
you should check whether you can actually just customize it using

129
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,600
the inputs that you already have in your theme customizer.

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,615
I mean, that's why they're there for you to use without having to dig into your code.

131
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,535
And as a side note,

132
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:12,875
if you are digging into your code

133
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,490
and you're creating something that you might want to change later,

134
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,940
make it a option in your schema and that way you can

135
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,945
edit it here and flip it around without ever touching the code.

136
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:28,750
That's one of the reasons why to use this schema at all.

137
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,385
So it could be a styling change,

138
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,000
could be a change you could easily fix with your schema,

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,785
could be some dynamic JavaScript stuff.

140
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:38,450
But it's likely you're going to come up against

141
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,305
something that you don't already know how to do.

142
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,850
Again, as I mentioned in this course,

143
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,955
we only have enough time to do an overview.

144
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:49,430
So your best places to go find some answers,

145
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,680
if you're okay with reading documentation,

146
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,200
let's go to the Shopify documentation again and go to themes.

147
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,530
Here is where you're going to be able to search for

148
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,250
all the information that Shopify makes available for you to develop themes.

149
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,590
So if we want to learn about sections,

150
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,125
search for sections in the documentation.

151
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,590
Click on Theme sections.

152
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,530
And then you can learn about the schema.

153
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,630
You can learn about including JavaScript style sheets,

154
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,230
rendering section blocks, all sorts of stuff.

155
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,995
So the theme documentation should be your Bible,

156
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,795
should be your textbook on this stuff.

157
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:31,070
And then also the Shopify cheat sheet,

158
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,600
which we looked at earlier.

159
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,210
So if you go and click the first link,

160
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,035
this is like a summarized version of the documentation,

161
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:44,645
and were able to use command F or Control F on a Windows to search

162
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:51,000
for what are the different variables on a particular object like product.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,480
So those are the two main places you might want to look.

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,575
Obviously, there's two other courses on Shopify,

165
00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,480
on this platform, skillshare.com.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,175
They are a little bit outdated and one's quite basic,

167
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:07,495
and the other one just goes really advanced really quickly.

168
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,410
So I guess pick your direction with that.

169
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,560
But otherwise, I was actually thinking of creating a start-to-finish Shopify course.

170
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,925
If there's enough interest,

173
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,150

174
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,410

So as I mentioned in the next video,

178
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,890
we're going to talk about taking your site live and then in the video after that,

179
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,754
we're going to do a bonus on Slate.

180
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:49,190
So Slate is if you want to get really serious about

181
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,810
theme development and start from basically scratch, that's where you want to look.

182
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,580
So two more lessons and then we're going to wrap up.

183
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,235
Hope you guys are enjoying the course.

184
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:00,900
