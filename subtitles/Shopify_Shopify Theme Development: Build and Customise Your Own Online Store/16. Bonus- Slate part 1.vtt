In the next video, we'll talk greater in depth about

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.890
an old-school development tool that Shopify ended support for back in January 2020.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.425
I'm talking about something called Slate.

4
00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:15.100
Since January 2020, it's been clear that Shopify have been moving away from Slate,

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.310
and now with the announcement that

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.320
the Shopify CLI has been extended to allow for theme development as well,

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.075
I see little to no reason why anyone should start a new Shopify project using Slate.

8
00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:30.030
That being said, I've left the next video in as

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.420
a tutorial for anyone who has forced to use it.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.805
Some older themes might still be using Slate,

11
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:39.195
and therefore this knowledge is not completely obsolete.

12
00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:41.105
If you have any choice in the matter however,

13
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.350
I definitely recommend using the latest tool for the job,

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.570
and that tool is currently the Shopify CLI.
