00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.335
Welcome back guys.

2
00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:02.505
In this lesson,

3
00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.550
I have closed down all those other tabs,

4
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.470
I have closed down my code editor,

5
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.890
and I've closed down my terminal which was running theme watch,

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.195
because we're going to learn about Slate in this lesson, okay?

7
00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:18.520
So if you've used Theme Kit before in this course,

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.565
and Theme kit is great because it allows us to edit themes on the fly,

9
00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.620
and Slate does something similar,

10
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.470
but it also has another element to that,

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.835
and that is, it creates a brand new theme for us.

12
00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.535
Actually, we can do the same thing in Theme Kit.

13
00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.560
I probably mentioned theme,

14
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.155
new as one of the commands for Theme Kit.

15
00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:42.910
It creates a theme that's,

16
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.685
kind of a Stata theme.

17
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:47.180
So you can't do something similar within Theme Kit.

18
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.265
But if you are very serious about developing a custom Shopify theme,

19
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.980
you're going to want to use Slate,

20
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.470
and Slate is a little bit more complicated.

21
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.080
The folder structure is going to be a bit different

22
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.040
and it takes a little bit more effort to set up.

23
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.610
But that's why it is a bonus lesson in this Shopify course.

24
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.470
I didn't think I could do

25
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.400
a Shopify theme development course without at least talking about Slate.

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.890
So, we're going to talk a little bit about Slate,

27
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.685
get it setup on your computer and if you want to know more about it,

28
00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:23.470
you can let me know in the discussion box below, alright?.

29
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.280
So let's just look up Slate now.

30
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.500
So if I go Shopify/slate,

31
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.495
we've already gone through the documentation and looked at, the grid.

32
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.295
There's two links here.

33
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:41.045
Let me have a look. This is the GitHub repo.

34
00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:44.405
But what I want to look for is the actual website,

35
00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.580
for Slate, which is right here.

36
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.625
The information in here is not the best,

37
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.245
especially with getting started,

38
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.155
so I actually recommend you follow along

39
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:57.635
this class rather than follow the instructions here,

40
00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:02.960
because I actually learned how to get started with Slate through a video,

41
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.875
on Shopify's YouTube channel.

42
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:11.070
So, if I type in Shopify Slate YouTube video,

43
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.755
maybe it'll come up, yeah.

44
00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:18.625
So right here you can see a video by the Shopify partner' s YouTube account,

45
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:24.140
and this is actually how I learned to the steps of installing Slate.

46
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.500
So you can also reference this or you can just listen

47
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.950
to me in this lesson right here, okay?

48
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.900
So, first of all,

49
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.555
there's actually a slide in this video,

50
00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.780
which talks about the history of Slate,

51
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.850
and it actually comes from Timber,

52
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.315
so remember I mentioned Timber before,

53
00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:47.810
and they have a slide in here to say why it's now Slate.

54
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.300
The timber framework was too opinionated and this is

55
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.090
like a programming word, which means that,

56
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.285
it decided too many things for developers upfront,

57
00:02:56.285 --> 00:03:01.245
so they stripped it back even further and they created, Slate, okay?

58
00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:03.045
So Timber is now Slate,

59
00:03:03.045 --> 00:03:06.560
and slate is actually the starting point that Shopify

60
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.075
themselves use for all their Shopify themes that they develop.

61
00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:13.190
It's also the starting point for a lot of

62
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.470
themes that you'll find on the Theme Store, and in fact,

63
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.610
I've worked with themes before that it developed from the party developers,

64
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.465
not necessarily Shopify, that still use the Slate responsive grid.

65
00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:27.270
It's good to know a little bit of Slate

66
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.530
even if you want to go off and develop in a different way,

67
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.310
chances are you're probably going to use Slate if you want to develop custom themes,

68
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.405
because this is basically what Shopify recommends and what they use themselves.

69
00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:41.330
Like I said, you've got the documentation here,

70
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.080
and of course it's going to be a good reference,

71
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.005
but in terms of installing Slate,

72
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.345
I recommend you just follow along these steps,

73
00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:50.215
which I've found easier than what it says in here.

74
00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:55.730
So the first step is you need the Node package manager for those that don't know,

75
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.685
Node is a JavaScript development environment,

76
00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:01.040
so we look for a Node.

77
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.635
It's technically a JavaScript runtime, okay?.

78
00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.120
You don't need to know what that is.

79
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.580
All you need to know is that you need Node and you need Node Package Manager,

80
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.195
in order to start using Slate or installing Slate.

81
00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:16.850
So download and install Node,

82
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.590
then you want to, download and install Node Package Manager,

83
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.830
which is just npm for short,

84
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.290
and I'm not actually going to go through and show you

85
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.010
how to install Node and npm because I already have it on my computer.

86
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.375
You should be able to find

87
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:36.780
pretty detailed instructions on how to do that on both for their websites,

88
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.715
and lots of articles,

89
00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:40.185
online about it too.

90
00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:43.930
Then, once you've installed Node and Npm,

91
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.980
you're going to look for the package for Slate CLI so I'm going to,

92
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.970
click on the first option here.

93
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.345
You can see this one which isn't the right one,

94
00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:55.025
I don't know what that is.

95
00:04:55.025 --> 00:05:00.280
I think we need to, be a bit more specific and say Shopify Slate,

96
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.900
and as you can see here, we're looking for the one that has @Shopify in front of it,

97
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.375
so maybe I'll just,

98
00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:10.640
type it in as I know,

99
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.940
Shopify, Slate, there we are, exact match.

100
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.785
I don't know why that didn't come up in the search box.

101
00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:23.030
Here you've got Slate CLI and if you're not sure if you're on the right one,

102
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.315
you need to be on the one that says @Shopify/slate, okay?

103
00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:30.800
So this is it, this is the one you need to install and

104
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.020
you have installation instructions right here.

105
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.710
So you're using an npm command to install Shopify Slate and that's why you need npm,

106
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.290
because you need npm installed in order to install this package right here.

107
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.835
Now as I previously mentioned,

108
00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:48.395
I already have Slate installed,

109
00:05:48.395 --> 00:05:49.895
so I don't need to do this,

110
00:05:49.895 --> 00:05:54.380
but let's just say you run that command and now you have Slate installed.

111
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.730
The next thing you're going to want to do is just like we did with theme kit,

112
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.060
navigate to the directory in which you want to start

113
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.140
your new Slate project and then run a particular command.

114
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.475
So I'm going to,

115
00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:11.050
open up my terminal again,

116
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.470
and I'm going to navigate to where I want that to be.

117
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.090
So I'm going to icd,

118
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.615
code/personal/current, and now that I'm in current,

119
00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:30.865
the command I'm going to run is going to be in a Slate documentation so,

120
00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:35.080
it should be a menu item here for commands which there are,

121
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.090
and what we want to do is create a new project with Slate.

122
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.295
So, I doesn't actually have it here which is why.

123
00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:49.340
I feel like the documentation isn't that great.

124
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.460
Maybe it's in here. Slate theme, no.

125
00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:00.665
Okay. Well, that Command that you're looking for is Slate, theme.

126
00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:03.505
Then the name of the theme that you want to create.

127
00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:06.205
I'm going to call it Clean Slate,

128
00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:08.860
came up with that name all by myself,

129
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:16.090
and it's going to download the slate theme and set it all up for you to use.

130
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.980
This might take a little bit,

131
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.685
so I will catch you at the end of the installation.

132
00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:24.925
Now it is finished downloading slate,

133
00:07:24.925 --> 00:07:27.385
and the reason why it's taken so long to set up

134
00:07:27.385 --> 00:07:30.505
is because it's downloading a bunch of dependencies as well.

135
00:07:30.505 --> 00:07:33.115
If we go into our current folder now,

136
00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:38.020
I've got the Skillshare theme here,

137
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.450
and now you can see in the directory as well I've got clean slate.

138
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:50.365
I'm going to click on that, and open that up in my Finder Window here,

139
00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:55.730
but what I'm going to do is also change into that directory through here.

140
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.690
Now that I'm in that directory,

141
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.270
I can run Atom dot because I'm running atom,

142
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.805
and I can open that directory,

143
00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:05.860
that project up in my code editor.

144
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:13.810
All right, so let's contract some of these folders here,

145
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:19.315
and you can see that the folder structure on the top level is quite different.

146
00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:23.740
We've got this config.ylm file that we need to set up as well,

147
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.615
but as you can see,

148
00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:29.710
we've got a folder at the top with node modules.

149
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:36.129
This is a long list of dependencies and that's why it took a long time to download,

150
00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:38.650
I think for me it took maybe a minute,

151
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.095
which is pretty considerable time.

152
00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:43.225
Then you've got this src folder,

153
00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:46.840
which inside you should recognize some of the folders.

154
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.030
You've got assets, config, icons,

155
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.850
layout, locales, scripts, sections.

156
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.459
There's a few other ones like styles,

157
00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:59.215
scripts and icons that went in the theme that you developed before,

158
00:08:59.215 --> 00:09:02.335
but this is basically in the src folder,

159
00:09:02.335 --> 00:09:07.660
that's basically your theme where you actually make your changes.

160
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.675
The big difference with slate is we don't actually upload this to your site,

161
00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:16.900
what it does is, compiles all of this and we'll

162
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.745
create a different version of this and then that will go into your theme.

163
00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:24.400
We'll see how that works in just one second.

164
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.110
What we're going to need now however,

165
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.250
is an actual store to run this theme on, and unfortunately,

166
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.605
we already transferred that development store,

167
00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:37.160
so I am going to have to create a new store.

168
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.610
It's not biggy though, I'm going to use the same password and I'm going to call this,

169
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.015
the Slate Skillshare Theme,

170
00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:46.350
if that name is available.

171
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.590
Yes, and I'm going to use the same password as before.

172
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.200
Put in a random address and

173
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.795
then we can say it's for testing an App or a theme, click Save.

174
00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:03.460
This should all be pretty familiar,

175
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.890
we've done this before, it's creating a store.

176
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.945
Now we need to go through a similar process to what we did before.

177
00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:18.130
Now because we are going to create a new theme and we're going to upload it to the store,

178
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.035
we don't need a theme ID,

179
00:10:20.035 --> 00:10:23.080
what we need though is the store name,

180
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.460
which we can find here,

181
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.385
and also the API password.

182
00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:29.560
Like we did earlier in the class,

183
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.405
we need to go into Apps,

184
00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:35.335
Manage Private Apps, Create New Private App.

185
00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:39.535
Sorry, I'm going a little bit faster this time because we have done this before.

186
00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:42.925
I'm going to call it Slate Connection.

187
00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:46.645
Obviously it has to put in an emergency developing e-mail,

188
00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:48.850
and we need to give it the same read,

189
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:55.300
write access as we did previously to the theme templates and theme assets.

190
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.585
Other than that, we are good to save,

191
00:10:58.585 --> 00:11:01.630
I understand, Create the App.

192
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:07.795
Now we have two of the ingredients that we need to actually configure slate.

193
00:11:07.795 --> 00:11:11.215
The reason why I need an API password to the store

194
00:11:11.215 --> 00:11:14.950
and the store name is because we're going to run a similar commands,

195
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.195
a theme kit watch,

196
00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:18.780
which is slate watch.

197
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.580
We're doing this ahead of time,

198
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.095
but we don't need it just yet,

199
00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:27.250
what we need to do is actually build our theme and then upload it to the store.

200
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.560
I'm going to right-click here,

201
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.325
so we still have access to our password to reference later,

202
00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:36.640
and In our Commands over here,

203
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.160
you can see the command for build,

204
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.130
and it will build a production ready version of the theme

205
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.240
by compiling the files in the dist folder.

206
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.839
This is stuff that happens behind the scenes with theme kit, but for slate,

207
00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:56.470
it's happening right in front of your eyes and what I mean by that is

208
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.920
you'll soon see that we have our assets,

209
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.640
our styles, broken down into multiple files.

210
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.770
You can see blank states, forms,

211
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.015
the grid, remember with our previous theme,

212
00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:14.685
we had only one css file or scss file that held everything.

213
00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:16.845
Well, slate is a little bit more modular,

214
00:12:16.845 --> 00:12:18.555
it's a little bit more complex,

215
00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:22.530
it's more of a scalable way to make shopify themes

216
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.640
because you're separating out what would be a big css file,

217
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.270
which is what you want when you run it on your actual website,

218
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.060
but in terms of development,

219
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:37.240
it's nicer to have different folders and different files,

220
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.815
but what you want is all that compiled into css JavaScript in a single file, okay?

221
00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:49.300
So you can see here plenty of different scripts and in our styles,

222
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.605
plenty of different styles.

223
00:12:50.605 --> 00:12:54.310
So one of the things that's going to happen when we run slate build is going to

224
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.170
compile all of that into like one style sheet or one JavaScript file,

225
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.960
and we'll see that happening once we run the build command, so again,

226
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.765
it's just slate tools build,

227
00:13:07.765 --> 00:13:12.280
think actually we can use the word slate without tools,

228
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.070
there we go, that happened pretty fast.

229
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.080
If we go into our code editor now you can see a folder called dist,

230
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:27.700
and in dist we can see assets and now we can see theme.scss.liquid and theme.js,

231
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.095
which is what we're used to.

232
00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:31.240
So it took all the styles from

233
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.180
all these different style sheets and put them together in this,

234
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.955
and it took all of our scripts and put it together in this, all right?

235
00:13:39.955 --> 00:13:43.480
So that's part of what it's doing when it's compiling.

236
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.640
So this is where we want to develop,

237
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.285
but this is where we want to upload to the store.

238
00:13:49.285 --> 00:13:52.195
So we can actually compress this file,

239
00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:54.730
make it into a zip and then upload it to the store,

240
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.555
but we actually have a command within slate where we can do that automatically.

241
00:13:58.555 --> 00:14:02.275
So I'm going to call slate zip,

242
00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:08.645
and now we have a upload folder with clean slate.zip, okay?

243
00:14:08.645 --> 00:14:10.025
How goods that? All right,

244
00:14:10.025 --> 00:14:14.470
so let's go back into our store and as you see,

245
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.825
it's password protected so we might want to disable password,

246
00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:20.420
but what I'm going to do is click, Upload theme.

247
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.490
I'm going to have click, choose file,

248
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:28.825
going to go to my directory where I have that zip file,

249
00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:36.880
Upload folder, click on clean slate.zip or whatever you called yours, upload that file.

250
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.700
It's going to start spinning up,

251
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.385
and then I'm going to click "Actions",

252
00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:45.205
"Preview", to see what our theme looks like.

253
00:14:45.205 --> 00:14:48.925
Now this is a Slate Theme.

254
00:14:48.925 --> 00:14:51.025
It is super bare-bones,

255
00:14:51.025 --> 00:14:53.290
pretty much no styling whatsoever,

256
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.285
but it is a fully functioning theme.

257
00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:58.735
So if I wanted to put some products into my store,

258
00:14:58.735 --> 00:15:00.280
I could actually select them,

259
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.350
add it to a cart and buy them,

260
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.530
believe it or not, in this terrible looking store,okay?

261
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.880
Now this is the whole point about Slate and the reason why I

262
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.900
recommend you start from an existing theme,

263
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.390
unless you want to develop your own custom themes

264
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.925
that you may be going to sell on the Shopify platform,

265
00:15:18.925 --> 00:15:23.215
or you have maybe a client or needs that a very particular,

266
00:15:23.215 --> 00:15:26.350
you probably don't want to start from this starting point.

267
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.075
But, for that purpose,

268
00:15:28.075 --> 00:15:31.000
you have Slate here for you to use, okay?

269
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.400
So now you have your Slate theme on your online store,

270
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.445
but just like we did with Theme Kit,

271
00:15:39.445 --> 00:15:44.710
we're going to want to be able to edit that theme through our own computer,

272
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.340
like we have with our code files here, okay?

273
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.875
We don't want to edit it within here for reasons that we previously mentioned, okay?

274
00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:55.630
So just like Theme Kit,

275
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.645
we can either update config.yml file,

276
00:15:58.645 --> 00:16:02.560
so we can go in here and put in the details there,

277
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.830
or we can run the configure command that's quite

278
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.630
similar to our Theme Kit or theme configure.

279
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.535
So again I can't see any documentation on configure,

280
00:16:15.535 --> 00:16:17.260
so let's just do it the other way.

281
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.215
Let's just put it in our actual config file.

282
00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:25.195
So let's find out our store name, which is right here.

283
00:16:25.195 --> 00:16:28.730
Pick that, put that in here.

284
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:34.795
Theme id, actually let's do password next.

285
00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:37.405
Put the password there,

286
00:16:37.405 --> 00:16:40.630
and then remember how we find the theme id.

287
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.770
We just go into our customizer and then in our customizer,

288
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.630
we can pick it off the URL.

289
00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:58.990
Okay. So now we have our project actually pointing to this theme that we've uploaded.

290
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:04.135
So now they are essentially configured to connect to each other, okay?

291
00:17:04.135 --> 00:17:05.395
And as you can see,

292
00:17:05.395 --> 00:17:06.834
we can still customize

293
00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:12.610
even this bare-bones theme using our theme customizer section here, okay?

294
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.600
In theme settings, it should be pretty bare, which it is,

295
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.210
because there's not many CSS rules set up,

296
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:25.615
but that's for us to decide what we want to put into these theme settings, okay?

297
00:17:25.615 --> 00:17:27.055
Now, if we want,

298
00:17:27.055 --> 00:17:31.375
we can run slate deploy,

299
00:17:31.375 --> 00:17:35.425
and any changes that we make locally to our theme,

300
00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:40.270
because we've set up with config.yml to point to this particular theme on

301
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:47.140
this particular store is going to upload all files and deploy them to our website.

302
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.645
But as we just saw,

303
00:17:49.645 --> 00:17:54.355
all we did was zip the original theme and we've already uploaded,

304
00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:57.295
so right now both versions of our theme,

305
00:17:57.295 --> 00:18:00.250
the one we have on our own computer and the one

306
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.760
on the actual online store should be exactly the same.

307
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:10.165
So what we can do for detecting local changes is run "Slate Watch".

308
00:18:10.165 --> 00:18:12.895
So I'm going to do that right now, "Slate Watch",

309
00:18:12.895 --> 00:18:15.655
and if our config.yml file is set up correctly,

310
00:18:15.655 --> 00:18:18.740
this should start watching for changes.

311
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.945
Now the difference between Slate and Theme Kit

312
00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:30.370
is it actually creates a local address for us to look at the theme as well.

313
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.680
And there's actually some steps here in

314
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.430
the documentation to create a self-signed SSL certificate,

315
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.105
but this can be kind of cumbersome and annoying to do,

316
00:18:40.105 --> 00:18:43.525
so a way to get around this privacy error is just to say

317
00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:47.590
that you accept it and you're going to proceed to the local host.

318
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.074
All right. So let's close now and we can enter using the password.

319
00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:55.870
So we actually didn't turn off password protection,

320
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.170
so rather than turn it off,

321
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.560
I'm just going to find out what the password is in our preferences.

322
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.590
It gives you a really basic password by default.

323
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.410
I'm going to put that in here to access our theme,

324
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.935
and here you go.

325
00:19:11.935 --> 00:19:14.245
You have the theme,

326
00:19:14.245 --> 00:19:18.820
just like you would by going into your themes here,

327
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.970
and clicking "Preview", we have the same thing,

328
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.725
but on a local address,

329
00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:26.890
which is kind of misleading because we are still running it through

330
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.280
the Shopify platform which is not actually local,

331
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.550
but it creates this little environment here for us,

332
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:39.680
so at least we know we are working with Slate on the development theme.

333
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:04.405
So just to conclude its working and that it is actually watching for changes,

334
00:20:04.405 --> 00:20:06.175
let's actually edit something.

335
00:20:06.175 --> 00:20:09.850
So remember we go into the SRC directory to edit our theme,

336
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.700
and let's make a basic change.

337
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.120
So I'm just doing anything to demonstrate.

338
00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.270
Let's inspect this element and see what that is,

339
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.310
it is the site logo.

340
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.305
So let's just remove that.

341
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.290
This is probably going to be in the header section,

342
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.850
so I'm going to go into here,

343
00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.600
search for a site logo,

344
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.820
here it is, and let's just delete this whole, a tag.

345
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.360
Think I'm going to hit "Save" on that.

346
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.530
Let's have a look at what's going on in our terminal.

347
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.775
You can see here, there's some stuff going on, reloading browsers,

348
00:20:48.775 --> 00:20:50.274
file change is successful,

349
00:20:50.274 --> 00:20:54.940
sync to store and now if we refresh this,

350
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.030
we should see that that site logo,

351
00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.170
which was just text,

352
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.875
is now disappeared, and if we bring it back,

353
00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:12.040
hit "Save", it should register that file changes successfully synced to store.

354
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.975
Sorry that's a tongue twister.

355
00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.655
And refresh the page.

356
00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:16.960
It's back again, okay?

357
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.350
So I'm not going to go through how you're going to set up this theme to

358
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.460
actually make it look presentable because that would be a course in and of itself,

359
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.120
but this should provide you with a good starting point

360
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.705
to maybe take your Shopify knowledge to the next level.

361
00:21:31.705 --> 00:21:35.260
So by learning how to actually customize this and change

362
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.415
this into a fully functioning theme.

363
00:21:39.415 --> 00:21:40.600
While it is fully functioning,

364
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.490
but I mean it's just terrible user experience.

365
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.750
It just looks terrible.

366
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.370
If you could transform this into a really cool store-front,

367
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.399
then you're really going to know the Shopify platform.

368
00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:53.500
And maybe that's something you want to do.

369
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.395
Maybe you want to create a whole custom store-front.

370
00:21:56.395 --> 00:22:00.310
It's up to you. That's why I put in this little section about Slate at the end.

371
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.735
If you have any questions,

372
00:22:01.735 --> 00:22:06.640
of course leave them in the [LAUGHTER] discussion box below.

373
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.695
Thanks so much for watching guys.

374
00:22:08.695 --> 00:22:11.869
I will see you in the conclusion.
