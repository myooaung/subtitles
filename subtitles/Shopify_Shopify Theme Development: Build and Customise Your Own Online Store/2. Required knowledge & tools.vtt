00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.545
Before we get started spinning up our online store and editing our theme,

2
00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.410
it's important to discuss who this class is for,

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.020
and what skills you should have coming into this.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.680
First of all, if you're someone who's EVA, already selling online,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.770
about to launch their own online store or working in

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.770
a role where you work a lot with the Shopify platform;

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.010
it definitely helps to know how your storefront is generated,

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.400
so that you can find the right place to make changes.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.295
On the other hand, you might be someone like myself who might not have their own store,

10
00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:36.650
but are excited about catering to the 800,000 plus sellers on Shopify,

11
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.355
who will probably need some help with their theme at some point.

12
00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:44.690
To me, learning Shopify theme development is a great opportunity,

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.685
to gain a valuable skill that you can use to offer services to Shopify sellers.

14
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:52.325
However, as i touched on in the previous video,

15
00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.430
this course is going to benefit those who already have

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.360
some knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS.

17
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.790
If you're completely new to those languages,

18
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.150
i highly recommend you learn a little of those two first,

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.340
and seeming you're right here on skillshare already,

20
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.955
a good place to start is my previous course,

21
00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:13.755
Web Development Fundamentals HTML and CSS.

22
00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:16.670
Other than that it's going to help to have some experience

23
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.955
with a programming language like JavaScript or PHP,

24
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.325
as Shopify's templating language liquid,

25
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:26.740
uses basic control-flow and iteration blocks to display content.

26
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.410
I'm talking about simple things like four loops and If statements,

27
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.870
which should be super familiar if you've done any programming in the past.

28
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.950
If not, loops and conditionals are pretty

29
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.340
basic and especially easy to understand and liquid.

30
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.480
You shouldn't have too much trouble regardless.

31
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.250
Something that's kind of obvious but still worth mentioning,

32
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.495
is that you should have some familiarity with the Shopify platform itself.

33
00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:54.740
Whether that's as basic as knowing what it is and what it does or better yet,

34
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.725
some experience with adding and organizing products,

35
00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:00.500
pages, and blog posts within the admin.

36
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.320
The more familiar you are with the platform of course,

37
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.970
the easier it's going to be to understand what's going on.

38
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.320
Shopify makes managing your online store as easy as possible,

39
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.090
so you don't necessarily need to have worked with Shopify

40
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.065
before to learn the things I'm about to teach you in this class.

41
00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:20.630
Finally, to briefly cover tech requirements,

42
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.955
just like any of my web development classes,

43
00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:26.990
the only tools you're going to need is a web browser and a code editor.

44
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.335
You'll also be using command line a little bit in this course,

45
00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:34.355
but that's a software that come standard in any operating system.

46
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.830
Now if any of this sounds confusing already,

47
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.670
then i definitely recommend you take a step back,

48
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.805
learn some Web Development Basics and come back to this class at a later date.

49
00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:47.150
A good place to start is my course here on SkillShare.com,

50
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.755
Web Development Fundamentals, a beginners guide to the web.

51
00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:54.500
To quickly summarize, all you'll need is some basic web development skills,

52
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.479
with HTML and CSS,

53
00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.610
a web browser and the code editor,

54
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.230
and you should be ready to go.
