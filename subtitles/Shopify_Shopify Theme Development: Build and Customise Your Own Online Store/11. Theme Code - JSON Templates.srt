1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
In this video, we're going to talk about JSON templates.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,460
JSON templates are a newer alternative to

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,420
Liquid templates that provide for greater flexibility in the theme editor,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,175
allowing us to create reorderable sections in the admin for not just the homepage,

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,245
but for the other templates as well.

6
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:22,085
If we look at the index file in the previous default theme of Shopify Debut,

7
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,450
you'll see the tag content for index.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,265
This tag dynamically generates our homepage based on a list of sections.

9
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,990
This list of sections we can both edit in the admin,

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,825
as well as inside the settings_data.json file.

11
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:43,050
If you check out the settings_data.json file,

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,085
you'll see here the list of sections in the homepage under the current object.

13
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:53,720
If I scroll down to content for index,

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,960
you can see this is the list of

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,175
sections that appears on the homepage for this particular theme.

16
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:04,190
Notice if we go back to the index.liquid file here,

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:10,560
there is no liquid code in this file apart from this singular tag content for index.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,815
What if instead of this tag here,

19
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:15,830
we stored the list of sections that we found over on

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,595
settings_data.json inside this file instead?

21
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:25,445
This is essentially what Shopify have done in their newer theme, Dawn.

22
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:29,870
If I navigate over to the Dawn theme which I have stored right here,

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,540
click on Edit code,

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,165
you'll see that the index template is now a JSON file.

25
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:40,085
Just like our settings_data.json file in our Debut theme,

26
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:44,345
you can see that similar data exists now in the template itself.

27
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:46,565
Here is the order of sections,

28
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:51,890
just like we had in the content for index array on the previous theme that we looked at.

29
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,130
The index template is now a JSON file that

30
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,255
stores the list of sections as is the product template,

31
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:03,080
the article template, the page template,

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,135
and so on and so forth.

33
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:09,755
This is what enables reorderable sections in all of our templates now,

34
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,550
not just the homepage template.

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,640
The consequence of this is that you will need all liquid code that may have been

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,185
stored inside these templates to be moved into sections instead,

37
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:25,740
even if you only plan on having one section in your template.

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,730
Let's take a deeper look at the code that goes into these JSON templates.

39
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,200
Here, I've got the dawn-two theme that I set up earlier in this class.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,625
It's exactly the same as the Dawn main theme with a minor edit,

41
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,995
but seeming it's published and it's right here,

42
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,585
I will edit this one.

43
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:50,660
If I go into Edit code and then I click here to Add a new template,

44
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,870
you'll see there's now an option here to create your template

45
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,625
as either a Liquid template or a JSON template.

46
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,780
Let's keep the JSON option selected here,

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,850
and instead of article,

48
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,950
I'm going to switch this to product.

49
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,750
We've got product.json,

50
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,325
and I'm going to leave it with this default name of alternate.

51
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:14,180
Let's create that and just like we saw a few videos ago about templates,

52
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,330
we can create alternate templates with JSON as well.

53
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,600
I'll show you how that shows up in the latest theme customizer in just a second.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,040
Now, as always, what I like to do is open up

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,655
the documentation and we had that just on our screen a second ago.

56
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:33,790
Let's switch back to it now and what I'm going to do is put these side-by-side.

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,590
Put this over to the left and then I'm going to close that down,

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,300
put this over to the right,

59
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,990
and zoom in on our code.

60
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,860
Unfortunately, it seems I can't get rid of this so I'm just going to

61
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,950
move this over, and there we go.

62
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,675
Let's read about JSON templates.

63
00:03:57,675 --> 00:04:00,740
As it says here, JSON templates allow you to control the look and

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,430
feel of different pages of the online store using sections,

65
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,120
and they are now data files that store the list of sections to

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,310
be rendered rather than templates that contain Liquid code.

67
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,750
I encourage you to read everything on this page,

68
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,695
but let's scroll down to the important stuff, the template structure.

69
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:23,030
JSON templates must be valid JSON files,

70
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,090
the root should be an object with the following attributes,

71
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,630
so we've got some here that are required and some here that are not compulsory.

72
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,995
Obviously, we're going to need to have

73
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:37,310
the required fields filled in in our object over here.

74
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,335
But for the ones that aren't compulsory,

75
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:41,810
we don't necessarily need to put them in the object,

76
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,480
but we can if we want to.

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,820
As you see here,

78
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,085
this is already been populated with a section's object and an order array.

79
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:51,545
What's missing is the name string here,

80
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,525
so I'm going to add that now.

81
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:57,005
Name, and I'm going to call it Alternate

82
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,845
Template because I can't come up with anything else right now.

83
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:04,205
Let's hit Save on that, make sure we haven't got to any issues.

84
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:07,040
Here we go. Sections can't be blank and order can't be blank,

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,295
so it will give you this when it starts up.

86
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:12,230
But then if you try and save on it,

87
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,160
it'll come up with an error.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,980
In order to fix those errors,

89
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,450
what we're going to have to do is fill out this object and this array.

90
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,335
I'm going to open up this object and inside,

91
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:28,070
what we're going to have to do is create a section object.

92
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,250
What we need to do before we do that is decide on

93
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,900
what section we're going to load in because we need at least one section,

94
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,105
and in the Dawn theme,

95
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:43,310
we have a section called main product which goes in the main product template as well.

96
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,875
Let's just use that one,

97
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,400
and so I'm just going to call that one main.

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,060
Let's open up an object for this main section and inside here,

99
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,690
what we do is scroll down and look at section data.

100
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,895
Again, we have this table of the different fields that are required, and basically,

101
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,835
all that's required inside this section itself,

102
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:09,000
unless we get into blocks is the section type.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,405
As it says here, it's the filename of this section file to render without the extension.

104
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,620
That's very simple.

105
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,570
All we need to do is put main-product in here without the.liquid.

106
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:28,575
We've got type and then inside type, we got main-product.

107
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:33,605
Now, of course, the other error that we've got to fix is that order can't be blank,

108
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:37,115
so you've got to put in even if there is only one section,

109
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:39,830
we've got to put in what's here,

110
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,655
the name as we defined here inside the section object,

111
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:46,655
we need to put that in our order array.

112
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,110
If I hit Save on that,

113
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,835
we shouldn't get any errors.

114
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:56,950
We're all good, and now if I go to Customize theme, open that up,

115
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm going to open this up to full,

116
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,180
minimize a little bit,

117
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,105
and then click up here to choose the template that we're editing.

118
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm going to go into Products.

119
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,370
In here, you'll be able to see the alternate template we

120
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,340
just created which we simply named alternate.

121
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,850
If I click on that one, you'll now see that we've got

122
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,525
this product information section here which is in fact main.

123
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:29,965
We now have our section here and we can start to add new sections to it.

124
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,360
It's important to note that any changes we make

125
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,510
here will now be stored inside the template

126
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,390
itself because this JSON template stores

127
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,765
the list of sections and it also stores the settings.

128
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:49,160
Now no longer we have this need for so much data to be stored in this one JSON file.

129
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,890
The data for each individual template and

130
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,205
its customizations get stored in the template itself.

131
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,965
Even if we click on settings_data.json,

132
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:02,045
you'll see this current object is completely empty

133
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:07,875
because that data has been moved into the specific product template.

134
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,585
What I'm going to do here is add in an extra section here,

135
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:14,360
and you'll see this reflected in the customizer.

136
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm just going to copy this object here and what should we add?

137
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,405
Let's add in a newsletter section.

138
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:32,260
We're just going to call this newsletter and then inside the type,

139
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,500
remember we've got to use the name of the actual file minus the.liquid.

140
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,265
Newsletter.liquid, remove the.Iiquid and there's our type right there.

141
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:48,325
Of course, we need to add that to our order here so I'm going to add

142
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:53,000
comma and then I'm going to put newsletter.

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,905
I'm going to hit Save on that.

144
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,900
Now let's go over to our customizer and refresh,

145
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,005
making sure we're on the alternate template,

146
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:07,865
and here you can see we've got product information and email signup.

147
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:10,600
Now, remember I said any changes we make here will be

148
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,100
reflected back in our file as well.

149
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,460
You just saw we made an edit here to the file

150
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,240
itself and those changes were reflected in the theme editor.

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,760
Well, it works both ways in the sense that if

152
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,775
we change the order of these or add blocks,

153
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,250
it will be reflected in the file as well.

154
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,995
If I hit Save on that,

155
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:33,175
reordering the email signup above the product information.

156
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:35,110
This is all broken anyway,

157
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,360
but we'll refresh over here,

158
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,735
and as you can see,

159
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:45,235
we've now got newsletter first and main second in our order,

160
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:50,610
and we've also had some default settings being added to our object here.

161
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,035
I'll type newsletter which we had before.

162
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:56,540
It's now at the top and we've got

163
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,260
some default settings populated in this settings object.

164
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,865
Like I mentioned, we've got two-way data binding here so if I was to change this here,

165
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:07,115
it would reflect in the customizer.

166
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:09,530
If I go up to email signup,

167
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,960
you can see all these color schemes,

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,910
background one, background too.

169
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,905
I'm going to assume that the ID for the second one is background-2,

170
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:22,415
so I'm going to change that in the file itself.

171
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:25,490
Hit Save on that, head back into the customizer

172
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,160
refresh and you'll see that background 2 is now stored.

173
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,705
Then again, I can change that to background 1,

174
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:40,205
head back here and you'll see that that setting is stored in the file.

175
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,930
The paradigm shift is this.

176
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,030
JSON holds data, whereas.liquid files hold liquid code.

177
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,155
Here you can see that the new system of

178
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:54,155
templates is having templates as data, not Liquid.

179
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:58,910
What that allows us to do is make them more dynamic and make it so that we

180
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,360
can edit our section data and section order in the customizer,

181
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,625
allowing us to do that on every template now because we've

182
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,605
got template data stored on the template itself.

183
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:16,620
Now what we have is data stored in templates rather than Liquid,

184
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,690
and what that allows us to do is have customization on every page,

185
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,795
whereas previously we used to hard-code in

186
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:29,165
section tags in different parts of the Liquid code to say put the section here.

187
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:33,700
Now it's all just data and it's a lot more dynamic.

188
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,105
One more thing to note here is the block data,

189
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:39,715
and I don't recommend trying to do this manually in the file.

190
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:44,000
Just go straight into your customizer here, Add block.

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,450
Let's say, we want to have a heading here,

192
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,800
subscribe to our email.

193
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,770
These are all default settings and putting it in email form.

194
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,215
Let's hit Save on that and let's just have a look at how that affects our JSON object.

195
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,255
Refreshing the page over here,

196
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:04,285
you'll see that just like it says in the documentation with the blocks and etc.

197
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:06,500
Let me move this over.

198
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,370
You can see that we have a block ID for the block.

199
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,005
We have the block type which is arbitrary.

200
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:19,685
It's just whatever your code responds to and then we have

201
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:24,475
a settings object to store the settings inside that block.

202
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:26,390
All the documentation is here,

203
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,525
and our documentation can be hard to read for some beginners,

204
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,930
hence, why I'm here providing this tutorial.

205
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,505
But essentially the main points to understand here is that we're storing data,

206
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:41,465
not Liquid code in our templates when we're using JSON.

207
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:47,210
This is the way moving forward so that we can have the most amount of flexibility for

208
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,270
our admins to go in here and edit whatever they

209
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,570
want and reorder sections on different templates.

210
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,045
It's been a big frustration of

211
00:12:56,045 --> 00:13:00,200
Shopify users for a long time having a homepage where they can

212
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:07,415
reorder sections like this feature has been available for a long time on the homepage,

213
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:12,155
but it hasn't been available on other templates until now,

214
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:16,645
until JSON templates and this is the technology that enables it.

215
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:20,720
Of course, you can continue to use Liquid templates if you so choose.

216
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,690
But we have these JSON templates now and you'll start

217
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,780
to see that more commonly as time goes on,

218
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,520
this is the modern way of doing it.

219
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,960
Hence, why I've added this section to the class.

220
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,205
Any questions, obviously, leave them in the comments,

221
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,095
and in the next video,

222
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:40,290
we'll dive a little deeper into Shopify liquid.
