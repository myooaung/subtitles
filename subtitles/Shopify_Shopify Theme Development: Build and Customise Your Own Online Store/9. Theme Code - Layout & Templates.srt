1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,185
To set us up for the next two lessons on editing our theme code,

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:09,360
I have closed down a bunch of tabs and now I just have my store,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,340
my partner account and this diagram that

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,305
I've prepare to break down what's happening with our theme.

5
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,730
Now, this might look nully,

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,350
but it should provide a good overview of how it all works.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,770
Essentially, we've got these colored boxes and these

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,240
represent rather the four major sections that we're going to be talking about.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,200
If we go back into our code,

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,905
sections, snippets, templates, and layout.

11
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:43,695
At the very top, this is the entry point.

12
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,325
Anyone entering our website,

13
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,035
they're going to get the layout.

14
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:49,235
Then within the layout,

15
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:53,500
you might have snippets which is why you've got this line going down here.

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,600
You might have sections in fact,

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,095
you're very likely to have sections.

18
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:02,165
Inside the content for layout,

19
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:04,760
which is in the middle of your layout,

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,860
you'll get a template.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,505
These lines show the flow of the templating structure.

22
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:17,035
At the bottom you have sections here,

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,640
then sections flow into this template,

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,920
but they also can flow into layout they also can flow into content for index.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,600
Then you have this template which flows into layout.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,060
So layout sits at the top.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,500
Trying to find another word other than layout,

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,425
but it's basically the structure that sits at the top of each page.

29
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:46,814
Then you get served the template and then sections

30
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:51,215
are really cool dynamic pieces of code,

31
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,679
dynamic sections that we can put into our homepage,

32
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:55,790
throw into our layout,

33
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,095
throw into our template,

34
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:02,480
and then snippets are just reusable bits of code that we can basically throw in anyway.

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,050
Now I've got these clouds in here as well.

36
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,060
I made it a cloud because it's dynamic content.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,940
We can't actually edit a theme template for header content or content of index.

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,340
It links to different parts of your theme with this double line.

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,385
The double line is just to signify a dynamic link.

40
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:28,430
In your layout, it's linking to header content,

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,965
which because it's denoted with a Cloud is

42
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:34,175
communicating that we can't actually edit this specifically,

43
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,470
but it's an out layer.

44
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,620
The same for content for index.

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,720
Actually this line here probably shouldn't be here.

46
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,090
This is only on a specific template, the homepage.

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,775
So I might delete that link.

48
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,150
But as you'll soon see,

49
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,200
and something I touched on briefly is that content for index is

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,110
the thing that sits on your homepage and you can add in sections dynamically.

51
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,060
This diagram might look a bit nully at first,

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,719
but after these two lessons hopefully the relationship

53
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,025
between all these parts should make pretty clear sense.

54
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:11,225
In this video we're going to talk about layouts and we're going to talk about templates,

55
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,640
and then we're going to break it up so in the next lesson

56
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,730
we talk about sections and snippets.

57
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,335
Let's start at the entry point.

58
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:24,600
Let's just go preview our theme.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,575
When the user comes to our store,

60
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:35,020
they're presented with this which is a mixture of all we have in here.

61
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,375
First of all, it's going to hit a layout file.

62
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,565
That's why layout, if we go back to the diagram, sits at the top.

63
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:48,000
We're going to go into our layout photo.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,790
Usually you only have one layout and it's theme.liquid.

65
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,760
As you'll see in this video,

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,815
we're able to create our own layouts,

67
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:00,930
but the standard layout is theme.liquid.

68
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,170
If you haven't set a custom layout,

69
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,555
it's going to go to theme.liquid.

70
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:08,765
Let's just assume that you haven't set a custom layout.

71
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,445
It's going to go theme.liquid.

72
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:16,390
This is the code that will generate what you see here.

73
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,190
That goes for not just the homepage,

74
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,180
it goes for pretty much every page that doesn't have an alternative layout.

75
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,620
This is the skin that will run on every page of your website.

76
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,455
But as we'll see, there's some dynamic bits of content in here.

77
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,620
We've got liquid tags as you can see here,

78
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,940
which are denoted by the two curly brackets ending into curly brackets.

79
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,665
There's another one that you might see that has instead of two curly brackets,

80
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:46,410
curly brackets and a, there we go.

81
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,755
Curly brackets, percentage sign,

82
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,320
and a dash to eliminate white space,

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,890
we're going to go into liquid and how it works in a later video.

84
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,655
But I just wanted to go through and let's see

85
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:03,935
where this page links to other parts in our theme.

86
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,590
We have got some liquid logic here.

87
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,285
Don't worry about that too much.

88
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:12,860
What I'm looking for is this first tag content for header.

89
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,885
Basically by putting content for header here just before the closing head tag,

90
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:23,425
what it's saying is take whatever we have and put it right here.

91
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,310
Again, seemingly can't edit it,

92
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,540
it might be hard to understand what actually goes in here,

93
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,875
and that's why I've written this box here.

94
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,040
This is according to the Shopify documentation,

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,970
that content for head of variable must be placed between the opening and closing tags.

96
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,255
It inserts the necessary Shopify scripts into the head,

97
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,670
which includes scripts for Google Analytics,

98
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,920
Shopify analytics for Shopify apps,

99
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,500
and more editable in preferences.

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,890
That answers the question of where would I go to edit that?

101
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,305
So I can go in, click on Preferences.

102
00:05:56,305 --> 00:06:00,440
So things like Google Analytics code.

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,495
If I had some Google Analytics code,

104
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,650
I would paste it in here.

105
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,215
That would dynamically go into content for header.

106
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,040
Then with this liquid tag,

107
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,045
basically controlling where it goes in our liquid layout.

108
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:19,170
But it's something that you shouldn't really mess with.

109
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,590
I'm just letting you know that that's where it inserts.

110
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,595
It doesn't really make sense to move it because it needs to be in that head tag.

111
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,435
Going down the page,

112
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:36,245
we can see this word include and include followed by a string here.

113
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:39,080
What that's doing is including a snippet.

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,005
If I go into My Snippets folder we're not going to be covering snippets in this video,

115
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:47,660
but you can see if I look for Icon Search going down,

116
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,385
there's a lot of different icons here.

117
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,895
Right there it is. It's just an SVG file,

118
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:57,710
but I can basically can include it anywhere I want on my whole theme.

119
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,480
Going back to theme.liquid.

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,745
Let me scroll down again by putting in include and then the name of the snippet.

121
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:09,890
Going back to the diagram,

122
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,910
you can see that we can include snippets anywhere in our theme code,

123
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,490
layout, template or sections.

124
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,670
That's why the line links to those three.

125
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,840
If we scroll down the page,

126
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,335
we can see another keyword here, which is section.

127
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:33,880
Just like include, we can bring in the header section by using the section word.

128
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,195
So Include to bring in a snippet,

129
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:38,625
section to bring in a section.

130
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,910
If we go into our sections folder,

131
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,640
there should be a file called header.liquid.

132
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,060
Remember we don't have to use the.liquid to call a section snippet or template,

133
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,930
we just put in the word without the.liquid.

134
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,450
Liquid knows what you're trying to do.

135
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,195
As you can see, we've got another section here, and in between,

136
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:08,300
we've got this other dynamic liquid tag called content for layout.

137
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,985
Going back to my diagram here,

138
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:14,220
we can read what content for layout is.

139
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,810
The content for layout variable must be placed between the opening and closing body tag.

140
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,520
It outputs dynamic content generated by all the other templates.

141
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,900
Index.liquid, product.liquid and so on.

142
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,460
As you can see, I've got this box in-between layout and template.

143
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,365
That's because this is where the template comes in.

144
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:43,040
If we go into our templates here,

145
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,190
the code in these templates will be loaded into here.

146
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,330
You might be wondering, well how do we know which page to load in here?

147
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,740
The answer is, it depends on the URL that you're in.

148
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,035
If I'm on here and I go to collections.all,

149
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:05,525
like we have beforehand.

150
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,915
I'm still on the theme layout.

151
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm still on this layout file.

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,895
But then once I hit content for layout,

153
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,940
it sees that I'm in a collections page.

154
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,790
Load up the collection template.

155
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,545
We're in the collection template right now.

156
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:28,855
As you see, there's pretty much nothing in here apart from a section.

157
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:34,620
We'll get into more details or more reasons to why that is in the next video.

158
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,710
But essentially the main reason why,

159
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,605
and if we dig into this section briefly,

160
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:46,020
is because we want to make the whole section customizable using a schema.

161
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,435
We can set a bunch of options here,

162
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,390
and then we can use that within the code.

163
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,690
If you're ever curious as to why you would have

164
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,700
a template file and then suddenly you have it linked to just a section,

165
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,035
why is that the case?

166
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,970
That's why. Because in our templates we don't have a schema to edit anything.

167
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,770
As I showed you before,

168
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,395
if we go into the customizer,

169
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:19,240
so I'm going to get out of preferences and I'm going to click customize on our theme.

170
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm going to go to the collection page.

171
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,510
You can see here that we've got this section block here.

172
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,840
So we're able to edit settings within this collection.

173
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,960
We can also add in a random section if we wanted to,

174
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,580
which we'll do just in a sec,

175
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,740
or we can remove this completely and there's no content in the template file.

176
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,605
But just to demonstrate if I was to get rid of

177
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:49,085
this section and just maybe put a random div.

178
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:53,345
Maybe I still bring in the collection content because we're in the template here.

179
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:56,000
So I can bring in a collection.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,275
I'm not going to, I'm just going to type in hello.

181
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:02,915
Just to demonstrate.

182
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:06,175
Theme watch is running fine.

183
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:12,455
I'm going to preview the theme so you don't need to leave the customizer.

184
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:16,710
Go to that page again, collections.all.

185
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,595
Now you can see that we've got just Hello.

186
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:24,760
You're Okay, that makes sense,

187
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,390
but now if we go into collection pages in our customizer,

188
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,765
you'll see that it just has collection content.

189
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:36,490
There's no little section here for us to go in and edit settings.

190
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,410
Hopefully that makes it a bit more clear why it just links directly to a section.

191
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,095
It gives us the ability to go into

192
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:50,185
a tab right here and not just have our content in there,

193
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:55,190
but also have options to edit it from within here as well.

194
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,215
That pretty much covers the layout.

195
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:05,420
If we go back to liquid.

196
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:12,040
You can read it here in the code itself or you can have a look at the diagram,

197
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,230
but main liquid tags you've got is header content,

198
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,695
content for layout over here

199
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:26,590
and any snippets or sections you want to include in your layout as well.

200
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,120
I am going to demonstrate alternative layouts in just a sec,

201
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,585
but let's talk more about templates.

202
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:38,380
We showed a quick example of the collection page,

203
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,600
but what I want to do is create a template for About page.

204
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:51,490
Let's go into our templates here and as you can see,

205
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,050
we've got page, we've got password, products, search.

206
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,335
Maybe I want to create a new page.

207
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:03,070
Let me go into my back end here,

208
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:09,970
click in pages, add a page and this should look pretty familiar.

209
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,395
It's pretty similar to products,

210
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:14,270
it's just title and content.

211
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,310
I'm going to put in About Us and I'm going to

212
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,340
generate some Lorem Ipsum just to fill it up.

213
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,165
I'm just going to search for a random Lorem Ipsum generator,

214
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:30,385
just grab a bunch of dummy text to put in there.

215
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm going to click Save and what I want you to notice here,

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,705
because it is a page,

217
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:42,475
we've got the page template suffix, that's by default.

218
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:46,400
If we go and click on View page,

219
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,095
you can see here that once again,

220
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,880
it's loading our theme layout,

221
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,810
which is going to happen on every page unless we specify otherwise and

222
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,760
then because it's a page, it's loading this.

223
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,105
Then within here, we have our dynamic content,

224
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:07,180
which we just set up in our back end here,

225
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,430
a title and content.

226
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:17,515
You can see here in between the h1 tags is title and in our div here is content.

227
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:21,025
We could change this up, we could structure this however you want it.

228
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:27,400
Maybe we want to take this here and the first line we want to say,

229
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:35,050
this is the page for Save

230
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,090
that and we go back to

231
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:46,330
here and you can see this is the page for About Us and then it goes on with the content.

232
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,255
Not very practical, but you can see here,

233
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,830
we can take those two variables and we can use them however we want,

234
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,140
this is totally customizable.

235
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,110
But I want to show you a more practical example,

236
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:05,440
and that is to be able to include a section in this template.

237
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,835
For that, I'm going to create my own custom template.

238
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:13,375
I can do that by going, New File,

239
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:18,490
and here's how you would create an alternate page template.

240
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,120
You do page, then you'd place a dot after that,

241
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,405
and then you put in the name of your alternate.

242
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:31,195
Mine is going to be About and then of course you need to end with.liquid.

243
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:36,190
If a page about, I'm going to copy the exact same content as page,

244
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,390
but I'm going make one change and that is,

245
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,345
I want to bring in a map section.

246
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,280
If we look in our sections here,

247
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,145
we have this section called map.

248
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:52,515
As I'll show you in a later video,

249
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:55,320
sections are great because we can pull them into

250
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,040
any area of our website through templates.

251
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,060
I'm going to add in a section like we saw before,

252
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:12,320
the section map, press Save and see if that worked.

253
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,400
Now there's going to be a two-step process to

254
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,760
changing this page into the About Us template.

255
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,590
This is what you would expect the behavior to be.

256
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,390
You would expect to be able to go in here and just change your About.

257
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,070
You've got it in your theme code.

258
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,875
You should be able to go in here and update that template suffix.

259
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,800
Well, the gotcha here and something you're just going to

260
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,725
have to remember to do if you ever get caught on this step,

261
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:46,350
is the alternate template needs to actually be on the live theme as well.

262
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,485
This is not a problem, it's just an extra step.

263
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:54,370
If we go into our current theme,

264
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,435
click on actions, click on edit code.

265
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:04,270
We can create a template of the same name and it doesn't have to have the same content.

266
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:10,600
It just has to have the same name so that we can select it from within that admin area.

267
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,265
I know this sounds silly,

268
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,825
but this is what you have to do within Shopify,

269
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,735
because this page menu here,

270
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:21,700
this is for everything.

271
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,140
This doesn't change the pages,

272
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,205
the blog posts you have on your site based on what theme you have.

273
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:32,440
That answers the question why it's not related to the theme you

274
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,885
have published because it's going to pull the templates from the published theme.

275
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:42,625
Again, I think it should have all the templates that are available in all the themes,

276
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,145
but that's just not how Shopify works.

277
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,980
Anyways, just a little bit of a gotcha and the way we can

278
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,920
get around that is create the same thing,

279
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,295
but we use this user interface here on

280
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:57,355
the Shopify website and what we can do

281
00:17:57,355 --> 00:18:01,345
is just choose page and the alternate is called about,

282
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:08,020
and then Shopify are going to create it with the correct name, page.about.liquid.

283
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,330
Once that's done, we can refresh the page and we can

284
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,980
come down here to template suffix and we have that page.about.

285
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm going to click on that, click Save.

286
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,215
Now, when we go back to our About Us page,

287
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:29,709
we will have a map section underneath.

288
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,960
Look at that, isn't that great?

289
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,905
Now, what we will also have because we want to be able to customize this.

290
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:39,430
Unfortunately, we can't customize the section within

291
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,080
this page from within our pages because we can only edit title and content,

292
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:53,570
but what we can do is find this template in our theme customizer by clicking here.

293
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,930
Unfortunately it's not there,

294
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,775
we're just going to refresh the page.

295
00:18:57,775 --> 00:19:00,685
Click there again and as you can see,

296
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:05,200
we've got this new section here for pages with About Us.

297
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,250
Now we can go in and we see this section here,

298
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,940
we can actually go in and edit the section.

299
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:19,990
Store is the Skillshare store or whatever you want to call it on Fake St. Toronto,

300
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,595
Canada and you can add an image there or whatever you want do.

301
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:31,870
That is a great example of maybe you want to insert a section in a certain page.

302
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,490
You don't want it to happen in all pages so you create an alternative template

303
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,515
and then you're able to call that alternate template on any page.

304
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,185
Now remember, I said that I would talk about

305
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:48,340
alternative layouts as well because what's the point of having

306
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:56,650
this layout file here in a folder if you aren't able to change the layout?

307
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,895
The way we do that is also in the page template.

308
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:06,110
We got to use a little bit of liquid at the start of the template.

309
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,960
We're going to use a little bit of liquid at the start of

310
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,995
our template to call the layout that we want to use.

311
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,620
Like I said, by default it's theme.liquid,

312
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,120
but we can choose another one if we so choose.

313
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,290
What I'm going to do is I can do this in either order.

314
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,555
This is probably the backwards order of doing it,

315
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:31,030
but what I can do is I can write the tag first and then create the layout.

316
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,180
I'm going to call this naked,

317
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,000
and the reason why is I'm going to remove a bunch

318
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,015
of stuff from the standard theme.liquid.

319
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:46,075
I'm going to create a duplicate of that and instead of theme.liquid,

320
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:47,560
I'm going to call it

321
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:55,240
naked.liquid and I'm going

322
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,825
to remove the header and footer.

323
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,760
Don't ask me why I'm doing that.

324
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,250
I'm just doing it for demonstration purposes.

325
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,930
If I hit Save on that,

326
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,660
if I go back here, no errors and

327
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,845
I refresh the page because remember we're already using this template.

328
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:20,770
You'll see that the header and footer have disappeared and that's because I have

329
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:28,250
signaled this particular template to use the layout of naked.

330
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,530
Right here we set an alternative layout based off the theme.liquid,

331
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,090
which is the standard layout.

332
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,435
Remove the header and footer from that.

333
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:46,510
Now we're able to update the layout on this particular template.

334
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,975
That's basically the major points with theme templates and theme layouts.

335
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:55,600
Finishing on the diagram here,

336
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,380
hopefully this diagram starts to make a bit more sense now.

337
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,140
We've got the header content that comes

338
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,350
from preferences and other areas coming into our layout.

339
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,035
We have the content for layout,

340
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,055
which brings in the template and then we can stick sections in

341
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:17,785
either the template or the layout and we can also stick snippets in wherever.

342
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:21,310
In the next video, we're going to go further down the chain here,

343
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,680
talk about sections and snippets.

344
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,030
Snippets are quite simple,

345
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,610
but sections are really exciting and powerful.

346
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,415
I think we can cover both of them in the next video.

347
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:35,350
I'm excited to show you that and wrap up this section on the theme code.

348
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,180
I'll see you in the next video.
