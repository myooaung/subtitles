00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
In the previous video,

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.925
we learned how to set up Theme Kit.

3
00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:05.400
But unfortunately, Theme Kit is not compatible with

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.210
the new JSON templating system present in modern themes.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.280
To check if your theme uses JSON templates,

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.640
you can head over to the theme section of your Shopify admin and

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.030
click on "Edit code" on the theme you wish to inspect.

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.620
Then simply look inside the templates directory and see whether

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.585
your templates have.json on the end of them or.liquid.

10
00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:30.980
They may be a few here that have.liquid on

11
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.295
them in the customer section and maybe the gift card template.

12
00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:37.480
But if your major ones have article.json,

13
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.000
cart.json, index.json,

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.245
pageproduct.json, if these ones are all.json,

15
00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:47.750
then you're working with a theme that uses JSON templates.

16
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.535
In this case, you'll want to use

17
00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:54.490
the Shopify CLI instead of Theme Kit. Here's how we do that.

18
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.280
What I'm going to do is head back to the theme section here,

19
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.665
and I'm going to open up the official article on how to use Shopify CLI for themes.

20
00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:08.320
I'm going to type that literally into Google Shopify CLI for themes.

21
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.275
You should find this article comes up towards the top.

22
00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:16.435
Click on that one on the official Shopify developer website.

23
00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:20.405
Here you can read all about Shopify CLI for themes.

24
00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:24.095
Shopify CLI has been around for a while now,

25
00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:29.165
but only recently at the time of recording allows for theme development as well.

26
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:30.890
As you can see here,

27
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.670
Shopify CLI replaces Theme Kit for most theme development tasks.

28
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.935
You should use Shopify CLI if you're working on Online Store 2.0 themes.

29
00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:43.825
That's essentially themes with JSON templates.

30
00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:48.470
Let's go down and look at how we install Shopify CLI.

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.745
I'm just going to open that up in a new tab to keep this one open.

32
00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.525
Here you can see the guide for installing it.

33
00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:59.720
We won't get deep into installation in this video.

34
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.520
Here's the instructions here,

35
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.620
depending on whether you're on a Windows,

36
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.195
Mac or Linux computer,

37
00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:09.830
just make sure you have Ruby 2.7 or higher installed on your computer.

38
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.685
How you verify that is to open up the terminal.

39
00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:15.830
For most users you're going to use the Terminal app.

40
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.305
But I have something called Item,

41
00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.670
which is my terminal app.

42
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.065
I'm going to run the command ruby-v to figure out my version.

43
00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:28.655
As you can see here,

44
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:31.420
I'm running Ruby 3.0.2,

45
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.960
which is greater than 2.7, so we're good.

46
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.130
Here you can see the instructions on Mac.

47
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.690
I've got Homebrew installed,

48
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.820
so I just went through these installation instructions and it was pretty easy.

49
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.810
I'll give you a second to install it, if you haven't already.

50
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.860
Pause this video and come back to it when you finished installing.

51
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.900
To verify that you have installed,

52
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.490
you just type in Shopify version and you should

53
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.520
get back a version number if you have the CLI successfully installed.

54
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.050
Now that we have the CLI installed,

55
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.920
close this window and go back to our getting started guide.

56
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.535
I'm going to scroll down here to the command references,

57
00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:18.590
how Shopify CLI works.

58
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.685
It's a little bit different to Shopify Theme Kit in the sense that Theme kit,

59
00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:27.095
you have this one configuration file, the config.yamlfile.

60
00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:32.330
You pass into that file a password, a theme ID,

61
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.805
and the store that you wish to connect to

62
00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:37.835
and how it authenticates is through a private app,

63
00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:42.935
where you put that password from the private app into that config.yaml file.

64
00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:44.540
You would've seen all of this in

65
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.970
the previous video so if you don't know what I'm talking about,

66
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.155
go back to that one.

67
00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:53.325
But how Shopify CLI does it is they authenticate in the beginning.

68
00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:59.360
Once you're authenticated, you can start to serve themes locally.

69
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.555
How we do that, I'm going to go into the Shopify CLI core command reference first.

70
00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:10.340
Let's click on that one and look at login.

71
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.000
Login authenticates you to the Shopify CLI.

72
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.540
This is the first step to basically doing anything on Shopify CLI.

73
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.804
An important thing to note here is that you can't use the CLI

74
00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:27.365
with development stores if you only have partner staff member access.

75
00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:32.060
What that means is if I go to partners.shopify,

76
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.590
which I often do,

77
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.340
and login to the store via my partner account,

78
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.640
so I'm going to go into stores and then see here, Chris Testing shop.

79
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.495
If I click login through this link,

80
00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:47.900
I'll be logged in through the partner account and I will

81
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.410
likely get an error when I'm trying to authenticate with the Shopify CLI.

82
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.525
That's an important thing to note.

83
00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:55.580
If you are working with a development store,

84
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.085
you can't use your partner login.

85
00:04:58.085 --> 00:04:59.780
What you need to ensure instead,

86
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.634
if I go back to my Shopify store here and go into my settings,

87
00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:08.240
is that I'm logged in with the admin or store user account.

88
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.950
Clicking on plan here,

89
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.120
sorry not plan,

90
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.650
users and permissions,

91
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.680
you can see here that the store owner is Chris Testing shop admin,

92
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.335
and that's the account that I'm logged in as.

93
00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:26.070
This should work. Heading back to online store themes,

94
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.215
let's run the Shopify login command.

95
00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.790
I'm going to go back to my terminal here,

96
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.660
run clear to clear up those previous commands and let's run Shopify login with

97
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:46.940
the perimeter of store and then we just copy the my Shopify address of the store.

98
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.020
I'm going to go in here, copy that.

99
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.885
Hit "Enter" and it'll start to log us in. Now logged in.

100
00:05:54.885 --> 00:05:57.515
Usually a separate tab is open,

101
00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:00.095
I think because I'm already logged into the store.

102
00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:01.730
It didn't come up with that tab,

103
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.880
but just to show you.

104
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.540
So if I log out,

105
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.200
Shopify logout, you can see I've successfully logged out the account.

106
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.105
I'm going to clear again and then run that command,

107
00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:16.870
Shopify login with the store address.

108
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.325
Hit that and you'll see it opens up a new tab for me to login.

109
00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:25.430
From this list of accounts here,

110
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.800
I've got to choose the one that is the store owner,

111
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.240
which I believe is this one and it says now authenticated successfully,

112
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.965
you may now close this page.

113
00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:36.920
I'm just going to look in my terminal and you can

114
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.305
see here it says you've logged into the store.

115
00:06:39.305 --> 00:06:41.935
I should be all good to go now.

116
00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:46.910
That's all we really need from the core commands, login, logout.

117
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.045
You can also populate your store with data.

118
00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:53.270
A lot of cool little features of this tool right here.

119
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.460
I encourage you to check out the documentation.

120
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:03.050
But I'm going to go backwards and go into the theme command reference now.

121
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.350
The button right under the core command reference.

122
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.970
Let's go in here and you can read all about the different commands.

123
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.490
The first one, Shopify theme in it

124
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.520
essentially does what it says here clones a Git repository to

125
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.640
your local machine and it also creates a copy of the Dawn example theme.

126
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.355
If you want to start theme development from scratch,

127
00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:27.440
this is a good little command to use.

128
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.400
But what I'm going to do instead is just like we would in Theme Kit,

129
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.640
I'm going to connect to an existing theme.

130
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.685
The way to do that is through Shopify theme serve.

131
00:07:37.685 --> 00:07:39.840
But we need the code from that theme

132
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.160
downloaded on a local machine first before we can serve it.

133
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.160
If I go back here, you can see even though this store was created before June 29,

134
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.945
2021, I have installed the Dawn theme.

135
00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:58.130
This is the new theme that uses the Online Store 2.0 paradigm.

136
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.630
As we saw before,

137
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.150
it's one of these modern themes that has.json

138
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.180
files in the templates folder, as you can see here.

139
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:13.975
That's what I'm going to use as my theme that I'm going to work on with the Shopify CLI.

140
00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:17.200
What I'm going to do is just like we do with Theme Kit,

141
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.290
I'm going to find the theme ID of that theme,

142
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:28.825
which I can find by going into the customizer and grabbing that part of the URL.

143
00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.910
I've got that in my clipboard now.

144
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.260
What I'm going to write here is one of the commands you can see here,

145
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.035
which is Shopify theme pull.

146
00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:39.835
To use this command you just write

147
00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:44.385
Shopify theme pull and then you put in this parameter --themeid,

148
00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:46.935
followed by the theme ID.

149
00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:53.695
What I'm going to do is first make a directory inside this Skillshare directory.

150
00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:57.740
I can do that through the Command on Mac, MKDIR.

151
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.050
That's the command for making a directory.

152
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.105
I'm going to call it the same as the theme, dawn-main.

153
00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:10.370
Now I have to run the command CD dawn-main to navigate inside that.

154
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.460
From here I can run the command.

155
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:23.620
I'm going to do Shopify theme pull --themeid equals followed by the theme ID,

156
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.230
which I seem to have lost here.

157
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:34.595
Just going to go quickly grab it again and hit "Enter" on that.

158
00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:39.290
You can see it's pulling the theme files from that particular theme.

159
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.660
Pulling just means downloading.

160
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.985
In a few seconds,

161
00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:45.770
we will see that that will finish.

162
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.540
I'll fast-forward and meet you at the end.

163
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.345
That's finished downloading now,

164
00:09:52.345 --> 00:09:55.420
so I'm going to head into that directory.

165
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.805
You'll see in my Skillshare folder here,

166
00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:00.715
there is a directory called dawn-main.

167
00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:07.180
That is the one I created with this mkdir dawn-main command.

168
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.305
Inside it, you can see I have all my theme code.

169
00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:13.525
Now that we're inside this folder,

170
00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:18.790
we can start to run the command Shopify theme serve to serve that theme code locally.

171
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.275
But before I do that,

172
00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:22.840
because we're going to be editing some code,

173
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.360
I'm going to stop using iTerm and start running commands inside my code editor app.

174
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.830
This is a bit different, I think,

175
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.110
from the original videos in the class.

176
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:38.770
But I'm now using a tool called VS Code provided by Microsoft.

177
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.150
I'm going to open up that one.

178
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.855
It'll look a bit different to the other code editors in this class.

179
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.600
But still, all the same principles apply.

180
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.465
We just have this terminal here that we can run inside the code editor.

181
00:10:55.465 --> 00:11:03.895
I'm going to clear this terminal just like we did on iTerm and from within here,

182
00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:07.675
what I'm going to do is run the command Shopify theme serve.

183
00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:12.970
Shopify theme serve and while that's loading up,

184
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.790
as you can see here, I'm going to go

185
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.435
into the documentation and let's talk about what this is doing.

186
00:11:19.435 --> 00:11:21.835
It's going to upload the current theme.

187
00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:24.100
Wherever your terminal is running from,

188
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.660
if there's theme code in there,

189
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.665
it's going to run that and it's going to create a development theme.

190
00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:31.105
Now, this is a new concept.

191
00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:36.655
Development theme is like a Pseudo phantom theme.

192
00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:38.650
You'll see in just a second that it creates

193
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.640
a theme ID and we're able to view it and edit the code.

194
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.210
But you won't actually see it in the theme library on your Shopify store.

195
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.655
You'll see that in just a second.

196
00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:51.025
Instead, you'll get a link to the development theme

197
00:11:51.025 --> 00:11:53.470
and link to the online editor as I just mentioned,

198
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.925
and a preview link.

199
00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:56.500
For all intents and purposes,

200
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.560
you get all the same features as a normal preview theme,

201
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.950
like if you were using and working with themes on Theme Kit.

202
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.160
But this one is generated when you run Shopify theme

203
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.260
serve and disappears when you run Shopify logout as it says here.

204
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.500
Of course, the theme code continues to stay on your computer and you can

205
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.830
also push and publish the code once you're ready to go live.

206
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.600
But we'll see that in just a second.

207
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.630
If I go back to my code editor now,

208
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.465
you'll see that the process has now finished.

209
00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:28.495
I'm just going to open up a terminal so you see more here.

210
00:12:28.495 --> 00:12:34.090
You can see that it's serving to this local address that we can look at in the browser.

211
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.110
What's interesting is here you can see we've got a theme ID.

212
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.630
You can see the preview link has that theme ID

213
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.315
and the theme editor link has that ID as well.

214
00:12:43.315 --> 00:12:47.170
We can go in, we can customize the theme as we usually would

215
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.100
using the same theme editor that we would use on any theme,

216
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.065
and we can preview the theme using this link and share it with people on the Internet.

217
00:12:56.065 --> 00:12:57.610
If we share with them this link,

218
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.625
they won't actually be able to see it because this is a local link.

219
00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:04.240
But this one right here is a public link that we can share with people.

220
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.830
As you can see here,

221
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.125
we've got this strange little theme name,

222
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:11.500
development followed by a little code.

223
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.100
Like I mentioned before, if we go into our theme library here,

224
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.440
even if we refresh the page,

225
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.290
the theme won't appear in our theme library.

226
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.860
It's like a disposable theme that has an ID,

227
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.155
has a customizer, but doesn't actually get stored on your Shopify store.

228
00:13:29.155 --> 00:13:32.215
If we head over back to that theme customizer link,

229
00:13:32.215 --> 00:13:35.440
we can, of course, move some stuff here and edit this.

230
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.400
But what's weird about this theme editor in the development theme is that it doesn't

231
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.335
appear that these changes get stored outside of this session that we're running.

232
00:13:44.335 --> 00:13:46.090
If I switch over to my local link,

233
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.950
you will see that the change occurs.

234
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.545
I'm talking about the theme editor changes here.

235
00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:52.000
You will see that it occurs,

236
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.315
but when we push our theme code changes to the store later,

237
00:13:55.315 --> 00:13:58.780
you'll see that this won't actually push to the store.

238
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.480
We can customize and play around with the theme editor here,

239
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.840
but this won't actually save once we push.

240
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.090
Be very careful with this with the CLI.

241
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.550
I'm not sure what the thinking is here from Shopify,

242
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.305
but I've gone and tested it and the data doesn't actually change where it should.

243
00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:17.185
This is just all throw-away data.

244
00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:19.420
I'm going to close that down and I'm going to close

245
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.230
this public link down as well as we don't need it anymore.

246
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.260
I'm just going to refresh our local development link.

247
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.960
Now the cool thing about Shopify CLI compared to

248
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.540
Shopify Theme Kit is what happens with

249
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.600
Theme Kit is it's not actually running a server at all.

250
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.755
What its doing is editing files directly on your Shopify store.

251
00:14:38.755 --> 00:14:40.060
Then you have to, of course,

252
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.390
click View or Preview on that theme in order to see

253
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.320
those changes and it's all served through the Shopify store.

254
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.710
Shopify CLI changes this now because we can serve that theme

255
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:56.035
locally and what this means is that it gets updated much quicker.

256
00:14:56.035 --> 00:14:58.000
Let me show you what I mean by this,

257
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.300
because this is a little bit of developer's pick and for those beginners out there,

258
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.030
you might not quite understand what I'm talking about here.

259
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.630
But if I go in and let's make an edit.

260
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:12.020
Let's say we edit this bar up here.

261
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.430
We're looking for announcement-bar__message.

262
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.765
I'm just going to use my code editor to find that piece of code.

263
00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:23.470
Instead of block.settings.text escape,

264
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.420
I'm just going to put in.

265
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.395
I just want to show you this side-by-side so you can see this happening.

266
00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:33.370
Close this down, close this down.

267
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:38.065
Let's have a look at what happens when I change this code.

268
00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:42.085
Let's change this to Announcement bar text,

269
00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:43.600
something generic like that.

270
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.795
I'm going to hit Save right now and look at what happens.

271
00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:52.090
You'll see that without me even reloading the page over here, it changes.

272
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:57.025
It's detecting changes and updating it here on our local server.

273
00:15:57.025 --> 00:16:01.285
Now remember this theme does not exist in our theme library over here.

274
00:16:01.285 --> 00:16:04.060
It just exists on our local computer.

275
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.410
Of course, we've got these links here,

276
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.150
we can share with other people.

277
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.600
But we're not actually affecting code on the theme of

278
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.560
a theme that's stored in our theme library here.

279
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.485
This is all just served locally.

280
00:16:17.485 --> 00:16:20.380
I'm saying that a bunch of times just so that it'll sink in.

281
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.635
But you'll see with experience if it doesn't quite make sense yet,

282
00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:29.380
what that means if you compare working with Theme Kit compared to Shopify CLI.

283
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.150
I'm going to make another change here.

284
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.280
Let's just change the background color of

285
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.475
this announcement bar to something random like blue.

286
00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:40.090
Hit Save on that. You'll see that that updates as well.

287
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.895
That's a pretty obvious change.

288
00:16:42.895 --> 00:16:46.660
Let's open up these to full screen again.

289
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:52.330
What I'm going to do is push these changes to our Shopify store.

290
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.625
Let's head back to the documentation.

291
00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:56.275
In our theme commands,

292
00:16:56.275 --> 00:16:58.765
you can see this command here for Push.

293
00:16:58.765 --> 00:17:01.030
Before we do that, however, there's also this command

294
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.235
here that we might want to run called Theme Check.

295
00:17:03.235 --> 00:17:05.275
We've only made a very minor change.

296
00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.640
But if we've made a lot of changes,

297
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.250
maybe we want to run this command which will check our theme for any errors.

298
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:19.150
I'm just going to close down the server because we're ready to make this change live.

299
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.895
Run Shopify Theme Check.

300
00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:26.860
You'll see here there's a bunch of offenses.

301
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:31.555
A lot of this is not particularly critical.

302
00:17:31.555 --> 00:17:38.005
Obviously, these errors were probably running before I even made those changes.

303
00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:41.080
I'm not sure what you want to do with that, but that is an option.

304
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.640
If you want to run Theme Check,

305
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.040
I'm sure it comes up with critical errors.

306
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.945
If you have any in your code,

307
00:17:46.945 --> 00:17:52.135
most of the time now it's pretty clear to see when those errors come up in your browser.

308
00:17:52.135 --> 00:17:56.095
But what I'm going to do now is head over to push

309
00:17:56.095 --> 00:18:01.449
and here you can see we can upload local themes to Shopify,

310
00:18:01.449 --> 00:18:04.255
overriding the remote theme if specified.

311
00:18:04.255 --> 00:18:06.790
We can put in an options object here,

312
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.465
or we can just simply write Shopify.

313
00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:15.770
I think I'm going to run these side-by-side again, so you can see.

314
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.480
Let's increase the size of this.

315
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.010
I'm going to do a Shopify theme, push.

316
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.175
Here, if I don't specify any options,

317
00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:33.970
it will actually ask me where I want to push this code.

318
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:39.415
I can push it to any of the themes already in my theme library, which is pretty cool.

319
00:18:39.415 --> 00:18:44.710
I'm going to hit Command or Control C to break out of that and what I'm going to

320
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:51.050
do is do Shopify Theme push --unpublished.

321
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.495
Hit that and it will now create

322
00:18:54.495 --> 00:18:58.980
a new theme in my theme library to create a new version of this theme with.

323
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.555
It'll push the code that I've created my local theme into the theme library.

324
00:19:03.555 --> 00:19:07.345
I'm going to call it dawn-two, let's just call it that.

325
00:19:07.345 --> 00:19:11.590
Now, it's going to basically deploy that code to

326
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.855
a new theme called dawn-two in my theme library on the store that we're connected to.

327
00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.670
That will take a little bit of time to complete,

328
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:23.000
so I'll see you after that finishes completing.

329
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.950
Now, it says that my theme was pushed

330
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.000
successfully and that I can now view or customize it.

331
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.160
But I can also head to my store,

332
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:43.055
expanding my windows here and refreshing on the store.

333
00:19:43.055 --> 00:19:47.330
You'll now see that I have a new theme called dawn-two here.

334
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.190
If I click Preview on that,

335
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.710
it has all the changes that we made on top of

336
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.370
the original dawn theme that we made earlier in this video.

337
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.550
We essentially just created a new preview theme.

338
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.800
Last step here, and this is not really necessary to use the CLI for,

339
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.280
but we can also use the CLI to publish themes as well.

340
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.355
If I head back into my terminal here,

341
00:20:09.355 --> 00:20:13.745
I'm going to run Clear and then run Shopify theme,

342
00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:16.459
publish with no options.

343
00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:19.085
It's going to ask me which of the themes that

344
00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:21.555
aren't currently published I want to publish.

345
00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:26.285
I'm going to select dawn-two here and it asked me,

346
00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:29.225
are you sure you want to make dawn-two your new live theme?

347
00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:30.590
If I hit Yes,

348
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.435
that'll now complete that process.

349
00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:37.805
If I go back to the theme library and refresh the page,

350
00:20:37.805 --> 00:20:41.840
you'll see that dawn-two is now my live theme,

351
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.380
and dawn-main has been knocked down to my preview themes.

352
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.595
That's how to use the Shopify CLI for theme development.

353
00:20:49.595 --> 00:20:53.440
It's a little bit more complicated than Theme Kit, I would say.

354
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.570
But it has more modern features and it's more developer friendly,

355
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.740
so take some time to get used to it.

356
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.440
If you have any questions at all,

357
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.315
obviously, leave it in the comments.

358
00:21:02.315 --> 00:21:05.224
But that is the Shopify CLI.

359
00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:06.380
In the next few videos,

360
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.400
we'll be learning about

361
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.870
some basic Shopify admin and then getting into our theme structure.

362
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.640
After we talk about our theme structure,

363
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.620
then we will talk more in depth about these new JSON templates.

364
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.300
I'll see you in the next video.
