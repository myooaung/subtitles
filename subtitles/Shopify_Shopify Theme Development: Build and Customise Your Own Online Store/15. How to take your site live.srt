1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
All right, so for this lesson,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,900
I've once again closed down those tabs and I've brought us right back to our store.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,780
We also have the tab for our Shopify partners account still open.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,620
What I'm going do in this lesson is show you

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,450
how to essentially take your site live or migrate it.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,940
Or get it ready to become a live theme on the internet.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,935
To have users come in,

8
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,860
use the theme on a real store front.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,650
So there's a range of different ways we would do that.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,990
So the first scenario, let's say,

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,990
is that this is an existing store.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,435
So Chris's skill share store is a store that's running.

13
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:45,935
There's orders coming through there's products already in here, customers.

14
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:47,780
This is a live store.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,310
All right, so we've done our development in a separate theme,

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,830
which is not live, which is the way we should do it.

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,680
If we're ready for that theme to go live,

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,985
all we need to do is click in Actions and then click Publish.

19
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:06,410
Now if you are working in an existing store,

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,020
you want to be careful about the things that you edit,

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,850
that aren't the theme itself.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,600
So if you're redeveloping a website and you're adding pages,

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,095
those pages are going to be live on the site the moment you create them.

24
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:22,370
But it's not such a big deal unless you really need those pages to be

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,860
private because you're not going to be linking to those pages most likely.

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,980
The other thing, navigation.

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,985
So you might have to create some new menus.

28
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,280
In your theme you're going to link to those menus.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,605
Those menus are going to be there with

30
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:40,790
the existing menus that are in the live store all in the same place.

31
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,240
So stuff like blogs, pages, navigation,

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,320
and products are in your store itself.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,290
All right, they're not specifically related to the theme,

34
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,065
so we need to be careful with that as well.

35
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:56,510
So scenario number two,

36
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,000
you're working with a client store,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,320
but you are developing your theme on a development store.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,860
Now you may want to do that for this particular reason that I've just mentioned,

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,215
because they have their own products,

40
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:11,870
blog post pages and navigation already set

41
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,855
up and you want to create something that's completely separate.

42
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:19,740
So what you're going to want to do is maybe packaged this theme.

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,825
So Download it and then Upload it to

44
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:28,145
the other store and then migrate the other stuff that you want to come across as well,

45
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:31,730
like products, blog posts, pages, and navigation.

46
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,015
That would be the most time-consuming and manual way to do it.

47
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:38,090
So usually you would try to avoid that.

48
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,240
So a good mix in between those two scenarios is to develop on an actual store.

49
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,384
But be careful about what you create in the products,

50
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:50,900
blog posts and pages,

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,455
and where possible, maybe hide them or obscure them

52
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:58,385
or not have them linked to anywhere on your current website.

53
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,895
If they are still in development and not ready to go live,

54
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:07,110
you want to make sure that they're almost invisible to the public.

55
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,550
But if this was your store and you haven't even gone live yet,

56
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,005
you've developed your theme.

57
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:14,965
You just hit Publish. As simple as that.

58
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,685
So let's say scenario three,

59
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:19,640
you only have your partner's account and you've just

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,730
developed this store as a development store and now you want

61
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,475
it to be a real store where you can accept orders

62
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:29,015
and basically become a legit store of its own domain.

63
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:34,190
Or maybe you want to transfer this store to somebody who's going to do that.

64
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,790
So maybe you developed this for a client and you can transfer

65
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,325
this store to their account so they can start paying for Shopify.

66
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:47,885
Now they have a duplicate of the store we just created on their own account.

67
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:51,725
So that's really what development themes are built for.

68
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:54,545
They're built for us to be able to develop a theme,

69
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:56,410
get it ready for the client.

70
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,690
Whether that's another person or it might just be us.

71
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:06,750
Get the theme ready and then it goes over to a paying Shopify plan.

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,490
So, a warning before we demo this,

73
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,975
as soon as you do this,

74
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,215
it's going to be transferred over.

75
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:17,855
There's a likely chance that you will lose access.

76
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:21,455
In fact, I'm actually pretty sure that once you transfer

77
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:27,275
this development store off your list of development stores onto a client's plan,

78
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:31,430
then for as long as they take to actually stop paying for that plan,

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,470
neither of you will have access to that site.

80
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,175
So warning, do not migrate or transfer

81
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:41,285
ownership of a site until somebody is ready to pay for Shopify.

82
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:43,280
So if [inaudible] out of the way,

83
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,085
let's go through the process.

84
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:50,195
So I'll actually close down the store and I'll go to the partner count.

85
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:53,705
Just refresh this because the links actually expire.

86
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:57,710
So we want to make sure that we have the most recent page.

87
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,555
As you can see here, we've got Chris's skill share store under development stores.

88
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,685
Now to make this a real store,

89
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:07,510
we want to transfer ownership to somebody.

90
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,920
So right here it warns us what's going to happen and

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,570
this dot point right here is the warning I gave just before.

92
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,795
The store cannot be accessed until the new owner selects a plan.

93
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:22,190
All right, so we're going to go in here.

94
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,435
Right now, we cannot select

95
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:29,305
any new owner because what we have to do is add a staff account.

96
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:34,540
So I'm going to click "Add a staff account" and it's going to take us back to our store.

97
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:41,725
So I'm going to create myself as a staff account, Freelancer.com.

98
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:45,260
This staff account will have full permissions.

99
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,370
So I'm going to click Send Invite.

100
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,440
I have actually already done this.

101
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,225
So let's see if I can find another email to do this in.

102
00:05:56,225 --> 00:06:01,590
I have a few different emails, luckily.

103
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,650
Now I've sent the invite.

104
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,280
So you can see here the account owner is Chris's skill share store admin,

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,910
which is our partner account,

106
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,385
but now we have this stuff account.

107
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,665
So if I go into my inbox,

108
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:18,655
I can actually accept that invitation.

109
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,495
So let me do that right now.

110
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:23,850
Here we go ahead, it took little bit.

111
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,935
But now it's here and it's asking me to create a staff account.

112
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:31,320
So I'm going to create a staff account.

113
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm going to have to put in a phone number and a password.

114
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,805
Let me generate a new password with my password management app.

115
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:48,070
I'm just going to use this same one actually as we used for the store.

116
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,940
Then I'm going to click Create Account.

117
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,545
Now I am logged into the store.

118
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,260
But as you can see here,

119
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,285
my name is Christopher Dodd and not Chris's skill share store.

120
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:06,825
So same store, different user logged in.

121
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,100
Now I have full permissions to access the store.

122
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,735
I can do whatever I want.

123
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:15,980
But the issue with this is I'm still on a development store.

124
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,410
So if I want to take this store live,

125
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,730
I am going to have to go back to the partner account.

126
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:29,030
So getting out of these stores and I'm going to refresh the page we run before.

127
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,910
Now I should have that option to transfer.

128
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,610
So if I go into the Select box now,

129
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,410
I can see Christopher Dodd, okay?

130
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,345
So I can click on Christopher Dodd,

131
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:44,600
Transfer the store and this is where I will lose access to the whole store.

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:50,010
All right, so you can see here that this Chris's skill share store.

133
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,700
If I go back to development stores,

134
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,170
It's no longer there.

135
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,100
Actually, it's going to go over to manage stores.

136
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,965
Actually, it's right here.

137
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:01,995
I actually did a test one before.

138
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,474
As you can see, it's inactive.

139
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:08,330
But if I click Login,

140
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,090
looks like I still might be able to access it.

141
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,610
No, so I can't access it right now.

142
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,340
What's going to happen?

143
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,115
Like it said, in the warning before,

144
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:25,460
I will have to wait for the account that I transferred it to starts paying for a plan.

145
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,340
Alright? So if I refresh the page

146
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,615
now on that account I was logged into as Christopher Dodd.

147
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:35,410
We will try and log back into the store.

148
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,475
Fortunately, it's not letting me. This is convenient.

149
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:48,870
But let me just go back and type this store name in explicitly [inaudible].

150
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,255
Alright, so we've got this.

151
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,970
Be back soon. I'm going to click Sign in.

152
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,290
Maybe it's because I'm logged in in two different accounts.

153
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,310
So I'm just going to open a private window.

154
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,590
Chris's skill share store.

155
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,410
Was it Chris's skill share store?

156
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,425
Yes. Click Sign in here.

157
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,765
Hopefully, it allows us to sign in.

158
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:16,810
Yes.So now we can sign in with that partner account that we

159
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,330
created and hopefully my password's still saved to the clipboard. No, it's not.

160
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,540
I'm just going to grab that from my text edit.

161
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,665
I have that now. Now it's logging me in.

162
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:36,415
What you're going to see coming right up at this dot is choose your plan.

163
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:39,020
So this is why I warned you about doing

164
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,480
this until you're ready to actually start paying for

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,310
a plan because there are no other options once you login to that staff account,

166
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,050
than to start paying for a plan.

167
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,090
So you would choose and you would go

168
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,615
through the motions and set up your billing and all that.

169
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:56,720
So from the perspective of the partner,

170
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,620
so I'm logged in in the partner account here.

171
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:07,610
It's a managed store that I actually can't log in to or access until this staff account,

172
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,080
the person or the account that's actually going to take the store and go live with it,

173
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,990
chooses a plan, and starts paying for Shopify.

174
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,880
That's what that box is.

175
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,505
But let's just assume the client or yourself or whoever this account is associated with,

176
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,575
chooses a plan and starts paying for it.

177
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:27,800
Well, now you'll be able to access the store

178
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,220
in your partner account still by clicking login.

179
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,310
So it'll go from like it already has done,

180
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,160
from development stores to manage stores.

181
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,035
Then you can start to manage it as a quote, unquote, Shopify partner.

182
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:46,565
So this makes total sense if you are developing a store for a client,

183
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:48,125
you've transferred it to them,

184
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,305
you've told them, start paying for Shopify.

185
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:54,200
Your site's about to go live. They do this.

186
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,805
Then as you're the developer or the partner working with them,

187
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:04,265
you can still log in and collaborate and work on their website as well.

188
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:07,625
So that's how it works with development stores.

189
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,305
Again, like I mentioned,

190
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:12,140
and we're not going to have access to the store anymore.

191
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,735
Are we?

192
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:16,940
Yeah, so we have been totally locked out now.

193
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,950
But as I mentioned before,

194
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,560
unfortunately, I can't show you because I'm logged out at the store.

195
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,015
But as I showed you before,

196
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,810
we could just download the theme file itself and then upload it to another side.

197
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,910
If we didn't want to go through this whole transfer ownership part of the whole process.

198
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,590
So there's a few ways of doing it,

199
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,220
but this is essentially how you would take your site live.

200
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,925
Step number one is you need to actually turn that theme live.

201
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:45,770
Then you need to start paying for a plan if you're not already.

202
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:50,350
Then you have a fully functioning Shopify store.

203
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,615
So that pretty much concludes the whole process from

204
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:56,615
spinning up a Shopify store with a default theme,

205
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,970
going in, exploring the code,

206
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,560
creating a custom section,

207
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,770
customizing it as much as you want, and then finally,

208
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,200
transferring it when you're ready to

209
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,630
another account for you to start paying for Shopify and start running your store.

210
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,510
So that's the whole process.

211
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,200
In the next video, we're going to actually show you

212
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,350
a different process, starting with Slate.

213
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,850
So if you're interested in that,

214
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,805
stick around, otherwise, I'll see you in the conclusion.

215
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:24,185
Thanks so much for watching guys.

216
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:27,180
I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
