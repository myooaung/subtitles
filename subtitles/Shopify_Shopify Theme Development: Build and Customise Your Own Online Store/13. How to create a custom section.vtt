00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.850
For this lesson, I've closed down our liquid documentation and our cheat sheet,

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.870
and I've brought back our online store because in this lesson,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.295
we're going to learn how to develop

4
00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:17.055
our own special Shopify section for our custom theme right here.

5
00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:21.840
I feel like sections are the best place for us to go in and do

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.515
some custom development because sections are really the center of your whole theme.

7
00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:33.420
It's the place where you can actually put in schemas so that you can have

8
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
those customization options within your pages and your templates.

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.710
So as a good little project for this particular class,

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.390
what I want to do is actually create a team member section in our about page.

11
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.555
Okay. So if we go back to here, click on customize.

12
00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:54.175
I'm going to open it up in a new tab.

13
00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:59.285
We go to the About Us page that we created earlier.

14
00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:02.435
Remember we hard coded in a section for map.

15
00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:08.510
I want to replace that with our own section for team members because on our About page,

16
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.975
we might want to have a section on the different team members working at,

17
00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:18.050
let's say we're a firm or some business or some store,

18
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.865
obviously being a Shopify store.

19
00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:26.665
Maybe we want to highlight some key team members or the people that work for our company.

20
00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:30.395
First of all, I'm going to get rid of that layout tag

21
00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:34.940
because I don't think it makes sense to not have a header and a footer.

22
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.340
I'm going to go to page dot about,

23
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.235
remove this layout tag, save that.

24
00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:48.170
I'm also going to get rid of section map and I'm going to take it back to basically,

25
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.455
the exact same thing as the regular page.

26
00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:56.569
Okay. Refresh the page on our customizer.

27
00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.600
You can see here we've got a standard page template and in between header and footer,

28
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.270
we've just got page content.

29
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.350
The content of our page, of course,

30
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.375
we are able to change in our pages menu item here.

31
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.170
Then, click on the page.

32
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.480
This is where we edit that content.

33
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.135
Okay. So what I'm going to do is go into the code editor again.

34
00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:29.720
In sections, I'm going to create a section with the name of the section that we want.

35
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.855
I'm going to call it team members dot liquid.

36
00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.345
You could call it staff dot liquid,

37
00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:37.155
whatever you think is a good name.

38
00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:41.420
Okay. Now in order to build this team members section,

39
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.330
I'm going to reference other areas of our code and we

40
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.435
can copy some structure that's already existing.

41
00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:51.020
To get us started, what we're going to need is some kind of

42
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.820
div where we're going to put in our code.

43
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.020
Then we're going to need a schema.

44
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.030
Now remember what the schema is,

45
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.360
is the options in our customizer.

46
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.570
For this, we don't have a dynamic section in here yet but you saw in other pages,

47
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.130
like the product page,

48
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.695
we have a customizable section here.

49
00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:15.250
This is all defined by the schema.

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.005
Hopefully, that has been hammered home already.

51
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.755
Moving back to the About Us page,

52
00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:28.005
we're going to put in our own schema here, like such.

53
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.155
Then we need an end schema tag.

54
00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:34.295
Within these opening and closing schema tags,

55
00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:37.550
what we want to put in is a JSON object.

56
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.950
Okay. Now you may not be familiar with JSON,

57
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.475
but as I've said in the previous lessons, it's pretty simple.

58
00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:45.530
It starts with curly brackets,

59
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.455
and now we have to define a few attributes of our schema.

60
00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:53.510
I'm going to actually reference the documentation in

61
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.750
this lesson because sometimes it's good to

62
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.295
refresh the memory and I forget all the time what attributes we need for our schema.

63
00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:06.080
Let me just search for themes,

64
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.240
schema and Shopify.

65
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.775
Theme sections.

66
00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:12.170
Let's jump to here,

67
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.935
schema in the theme sections part.

68
00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.110
Okay. Sections should have a name.

69
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:26.865
So put in a name and we're going to call it team members.

70
00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:29.285
What else does it need?

71
00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:31.685
We can put in a class,

72
00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:36.475
and that's the CSS class that will go into the div.

73
00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:45.305
We will give it a class of team members section.

74
00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:48.680
This is the class we can reference in our CSS.

75
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.815
Then, of course, settings.

76
00:04:51.815 --> 00:05:01.015
Now, we can write the settings probably before we even write any of the actual HTML code.

77
00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:03.930
In order to define our settings that are going to be an array,

78
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.395
we need to open and close square brackets,

79
00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:10.755
and then we can add in some more JSON objects.

80
00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:13.010
For each of the settings,

81
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.095
we need an ID,

82
00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:16.625
a type, and a label.

83
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:21.755
There's other things we can put in like a default value but we're going to need an ID,

84
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.800
type and label for every section settings.

85
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.405
The type is the input type which we went over in a previous lesson just briefly.

86
00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:32.450
The label is what shows up in the customizer and

87
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.650
the ID is the variable that we will use within our code in

88
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.350
order to reference what the user has put into

89
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.330
this field or the default in the case that there's been nothing put in there.

90
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.795
You'll see this all happening as we build.

91
00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:49.805
The first thing we're going to need,

92
00:05:49.805 --> 00:05:58.445
ID and the first setting I want for our team members section is a section title.

93
00:05:58.445 --> 00:06:00.835
I'm going to call it title.

94
00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:03.675
For type, it's going to be

95
00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:13.780
text and label is going to be section title.

96
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.695
You can set this up however you want,

97
00:06:16.695 --> 00:06:18.410
it just has to make sense.

98
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.320
The type definitely has to be text because

99
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.649
that's going to be the input type that shows up in the customizer.

100
00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.050
Everything else you can set to whatever you want.

101
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.375
This variable can be called something else.

102
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:32.525
Whatever shows up to the user on the front end,

103
00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.970
that can be whatever you want as well.

104
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.065
Just note that. Time to add in another object.

105
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.990
That's going to be where I define the blocks.

106
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.050
What I want to do is,

107
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.965
we haven't really looked at blocks a lot in this course already.

108
00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:51.380
In fact, we hardly touched on it.

109
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.330
What blocks allow us to do,

110
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.085
and I showed you in the slideshow section,

111
00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:03.290
is allows us to basically add content in blocks.

112
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.730
I don't know how else to say it,

113
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.940
but it allows us basically to add blocks of

114
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.350
content which we can either remove or add multiple.

115
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.390
The limit of how many blocks we can add is defined by us.

116
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.095
I think blocks makes sense in a team member's section because number one,

117
00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:23.630
we're going to have more than one team member most likely.

118
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.440
Number two, we might need to add or remove team members in future.

119
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.470
I think it makes total sense to use a block.

120
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.750
Coming back to About Us.

121
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.950
I don't know why I keep clicking back on this because we don't

122
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.250
have a section imported yet.

123
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.415
Let's actually do that right now.

124
00:07:41.415 --> 00:07:43.310
This isn't fully formed yet,

125
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.220
but I'm going to go jump ahead a bit and throw

126
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.150
that section in here because when it's ready to go,

127
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.400
it'll be right inside this template,

128
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.725
ready for us to customize.

129
00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:58.870
This section is going to be called team members.

130
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:06.140
That word there relates to what we've labeled our section in our sections file,

131
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.830
obviously without the dot liquid.

132
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:14.855
I'm going to actually create a default for this so that as soon as we run the page,

133
00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:18.290
we're going to get a value without us having to write anything.

134
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.975
I'm just going to say,

135
00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:24.435
it's meet our team, team in capitals.

136
00:08:24.435 --> 00:08:26.190
That's going to be the default value.

137
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.790
Let's actually pause here for a sec with the schema.

138
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.130
Close that with just one setting and actually use that

139
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.690
setting now so we can actually see it come through in the customizer.

140
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.170
What I'm going to do for that is,

141
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.394
I'm going to steal the structure from another section

142
00:08:41.394 --> 00:08:46.075
in our sections section. Too many sections.

143
00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:48.520
Let me find a good example here.

144
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.255
Maybe, featured collection, feature columns.

145
00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:57.565
You can see here that if the section title is not blank,

146
00:08:57.565 --> 00:09:00.385
we want to put it out on the screen and we want to use

147
00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:05.635
this HTML structure because there's CSS already associated with that,

148
00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:08.700
we're going to get some automatic styles right out the gate.

149
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.630
Let's do that. In fact,

150
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.410
let's use this page width container as well.

151
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:19.175
That's going to make sure that the content we have conforms to the page width.

152
00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:22.200
We've already got the closing div tag for that there.

153
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.985
I've just basically added the class page width.

154
00:09:24.985 --> 00:09:30.245
Then, inside I've got if section settings dot title is not blank,

155
00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:35.120
then we put it in and we escape any HTML that is put in there.

156
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.605
Because we labeled our title as the ID of title,

157
00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:41.390
this is actually all we need to do.

158
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.445
We don't need to change the variable name.

159
00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:46.950
If I save that, double-check

160
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.215
we haven't made any errors with the theme watch, we are all good,

161
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.260
and I refresh this page in the customizer,

162
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.110
what you'll now see is a team member's section

163
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.520
available for us to customize in between the header and footer.

164
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.780
If I click on this,

165
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.195
you can see our single option that we defined for section title.

166
00:10:07.195 --> 00:10:08.645
Instead of Meet the Team,

167
00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:11.105
maybe I might say our team.

168
00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:15.190
This updates dynamically right in front of our eyes.

169
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.175
How cool is that? I'm happy with Meet the Team.

170
00:10:18.175 --> 00:10:21.680
Now, I want to define some blocks.

171
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:27.880
Let's go and look in here and search for blocks.

172
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.860
Rendering section blocks.

173
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:38.905
That's not we're after. Blocks. Here we go.

174
00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:42.000
Sections can define blocks in their schemas

175
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.750
and their containers of settings and content which can be added,

176
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.150
removed, and reordered within a section.

177
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:52.430
That's a pretty good one sentence explanation of what I was trying to explain earlier.

178
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.310
A block needs to have a name and a type,

179
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.635
and then you give it some settings,

180
00:10:57.635 --> 00:10:59.584
just like you would, usually,

181
00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:03.895
in the same way we've done for our section settings.

182
00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:07.175
After our settings here,

183
00:11:07.175 --> 00:11:10.895
after this little square bracket,

184
00:11:10.895 --> 00:11:15.495
what we're going to want to do is put in blocks.

185
00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:18.645
It works similar to settings.

186
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:22.565
We have to put in an array and so we're going to use square blocks again.

187
00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:26.600
By the way, I just expanded and contracted that just to make it easier for us,

188
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.705
but I'll expand it out again.

189
00:11:28.705 --> 00:11:33.120
Inside blocks, we have an object.

190
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.525
In that object, as it says,

191
00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:37.835
we need a name and a type.

192
00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:43.425
Name is going to be team member because it's a single team member.

193
00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:48.930
Actually, we can just write it in readable English.

194
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:55.900
Then we're going to need to set the type and the type is whatever we want it to be,

195
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.055
because this is a block.

196
00:11:57.055 --> 00:11:59.380
It's up to us to set our own types.

197
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:05.920
I'm going to call it staff-profile.

198
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.950
Now we define settings.

199
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.265
Just like we've done up here with settings,

200
00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:16.225
we're going to put in the settings for each block.

201
00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:24.010
We're going to open up a square bracket and we're going to need ID type and label again.

202
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.945
The first setting is going to be the name of the staff member.

203
00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:32.245
I'm going to call it staff-name.

204
00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:35.635
The type of that is just going to be a text field.

205
00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:39.565
The label will be name.

206
00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:42.730
Because everyone, everyone's name is going to be different there's

207
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.670
no point of having a default.

208
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:51.445
So next option, I'm going to put as the staff title.

209
00:12:51.445 --> 00:12:53.950
This is their role at the company.

210
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.370
Have it type as text as well.

211
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.705
Label is going to be job title.

212
00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:05.005
Scroll down to give us some more space.

213
00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:09.175
We'll give it one more setting and that will be bio.

214
00:13:09.175 --> 00:13:12.740
We will call it staff-bio.

215
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.020
This time, we're going to use text area instead of

216
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.765
text and the reason why we're using text area,

217
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.960
it's the same thinking as in regular HTML,

218
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.530
it's going to be a multi-line bio, most likely.

219
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.665
We don't actually want to have

220
00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:33.340
text because that's just going to give us a one line input.

221
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.400
We want a bit of an area for us to write the bio.

222
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.644
Now that we have these attributes,

223
00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:45.595
what we're going to want to do is put it in HTML up here.

224
00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:50.770
What I'm going to do is use the for loop that we saw earlier.

225
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.080
What we going to have to do is cycle through the blocks in

226
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.855
this section and then put them all out.

227
00:13:55.855 --> 00:13:59.050
I'm going to do

228
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:08.235
for block in section.blocks,

229
00:14:08.235 --> 00:14:12.880
I believe, and then I'm going to end my loop.

230
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.715
This object here in the schema,

231
00:14:15.715 --> 00:14:17.080
if you're following along,

232
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.180
is the section itself and then in here things we can reference.

233
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.590
The section dot name,

234
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.715
the section dot class,

235
00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:27.430
section settings, section blocks.

236
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.655
Actually one thing I'll change is give this a more descriptive name.

237
00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:34.720
I'm going to call it staff in section.blocks.

238
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.260
Because we've only got one type of block and its a staff

239
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.640
profile and we know that all these blocks are going to represent a staff member.

240
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.860
I'm just calling it staff.

241
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.860
Actually, staff can be plural,

242
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.980
so maybe I'll just say member.

243
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.620
Again, you can name this whatever you want,

244
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.790
just whatever makes it more more sense for you and more readable.

245
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:05.500
What I'm going to do is put in a div for each team member and inside that div,

246
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.525
I'm going to output these three variables that we have defined here.

247
00:15:10.525 --> 00:15:14.845
What I'm going to do for that is a h3 for the name of the staff member.

248
00:15:14.845 --> 00:15:16.810
I'm going to do a span for

249
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:24.055
the staff members title and then I'm going to put in a paragraph tag for their bio.

250
00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:28.345
In here, this is where we put our liquid tags

251
00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:32.335
and we just want to output whatever is in the block settings.

252
00:15:32.335 --> 00:15:36.145
So I'm going to take the object of member,

253
00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:38.530
which is what we have up here,

254
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:45.680
go through its settings and select staff name.

255
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.380
I'm going to copy this because the only thing we need to

256
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.410
change is the end part and instead of staff name,

257
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.825
I'm going to put in staff title

258
00:15:55.825 --> 00:15:59.335
probably didn't need to put in the staff at the start of it.

259
00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:03.175
Actually, I might go in and change that now.

260
00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:06.100
Probably doesn't make sense to have.

261
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.415
Just going to go in and get rid of staff because we don't really need it.

262
00:16:09.415 --> 00:16:12.230
We can just do name, title, and bio.

263
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.045
Now we should have enough for a two function.

264
00:16:16.045 --> 00:16:18.039
We're going to need to make a few more changes,

265
00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:20.785
but at least to get it coming out on the screen,

266
00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:22.390
let's have a look after we save.

267
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.060
There's no errors in our theme watch.

268
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:32.635
We should be sweet and if we go to our page in the customizes, refresh the page.

269
00:16:32.635 --> 00:16:35.155
Now if I go into Team Members,

270
00:16:35.155 --> 00:16:37.825
you'll see we can add a block.

271
00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:39.955
I'm going to add a team member.

272
00:16:39.955 --> 00:16:42.550
I'm going to give the team member name of,

273
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.605
let's just give it my name.

274
00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.900
Web Developer.

275
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.025
As you can see, it's coming out right away.

276
00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:53.289
I'm going to add in some Lorem ipsum,

277
00:16:53.289 --> 00:16:58.645
just copy it from the top here as the buyer and there you go.

278
00:16:58.645 --> 00:17:01.210
We have some content inserted in the page.

279
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.860
If I add another team member,

280
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.475
let's just say it's Christopher Dodd again.

281
00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:12.219
I did not come up with other staff member names in preparation,

282
00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:14.650
so you're just going to have to deal with seeing my name twice.

283
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:15.940
But as you can see,

284
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.365
it's adding another div with all the content that we've set here.

285
00:17:20.365 --> 00:17:25.525
It cycles through the blocks and then adds in this content.

286
00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:29.560
Very cool. I'm going to click "Save" even though it looks like crap.

287
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.440
Let's do some styling.

288
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.005
We can take advantage of the grid system in our theme.

289
00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:42.670
This is a slight thing that happens on pretty much every theme that uses

290
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.875
light to be built or the Shopify free themes will be using the slight grid.

291
00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:52.160
What I can do is wrap this in a grid.

292
00:17:52.770 --> 00:18:00.590
'm going to put a div around this, call it grid.

293
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:07.225
For this div, I'm going to give it a class of grid item,

294
00:18:07.225 --> 00:18:10.450
and I'm also going to add a class to define columns.

295
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.140
There's a few screen sizes developed in the grid system.

296
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.930
If you want to learn about the slate grid,

297
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.735
let me just see if there's information available.

298
00:18:19.735 --> 00:18:21.850
Slates grid.

299
00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:26.170
There might be some information available on Google.

300
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.470
Here styles with liquid.

301
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.690
No. Let me get out of the slight documentation.

302
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.410
Click on "CSS Examples". Here we go.

303
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.470
Right here we have our CSS breakpoints, medium,

304
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.610
large, widescreen, gutter is the space in-between grid elements.

305
00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.245
If I scroll down here,

306
00:18:47.245 --> 00:18:50.230
you can see some examples of the grid system.

307
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.770
For instance, if we wanted the column to take up one half of

308
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.460
the page on screen sizes that are medium and up.

309
00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.140
This is the class we would use.

310
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:05.020
In fact, that's the exact class I want to use for our little team members section.

311
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.535
I'm going to put that in there.

312
00:19:06.535 --> 00:19:10.405
As you can see, it's similar to what they've defined here,

313
00:19:10.405 --> 00:19:13.915
they've got a grid and then they've got grid items,

314
00:19:13.915 --> 00:19:18.460
and then they've got the column specification.

315
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.825
You can stack these with small one third, one sixth.

316
00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:28.435
You can have it change how wide the column is based on the screen size.

317
00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:30.460
But for us, medium up,

318
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.875
one half should be fine.

319
00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:37.360
Going to my theme, watch everything sweet.

320
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.540
I'm going to go back here, refresh the page.

321
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:48.310
Now you'll see that our team members section is in this nice two column grid.

322
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.520
If I was to add a third team member,

323
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.430
say it's my name again. You can see.

324
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.180
That we've got another section here.

325
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.565
Obviously there is spacing issues here.

326
00:20:03.565 --> 00:20:12.250
An easy way to fix this is by just giving some margin top to all of these grid elements.

327
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.309
Again, we should probably be doing this in CSS,

328
00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:17.485
but just in the interest of time,

329
00:20:17.485 --> 00:20:21.205
I'm just going to put it here in line.

330
00:20:21.205 --> 00:20:28.665
I'm going to give it a margin top of 15 pixels. Save that.

331
00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:30.600
Theme watch is happy,

332
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.645
refresh the page and now we've got a bit more of a margin.

333
00:20:34.645 --> 00:20:38.290
We can increase that margin by whatever we set in here.

334
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.180
Maybe we want it at 30 instead,

335
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.530
not a big deal.

336
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.025
It's up to you what you want to do with your styling.

337
00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:48.805
Going back to our about us section,

338
00:20:48.805 --> 00:20:52.465
there's one more thing that I feel like our team member profiles need,

339
00:20:52.465 --> 00:20:54.610
and that is an image.

340
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.325
Now I've left image to lost because

341
00:20:57.325 --> 00:21:00.445
it's a little bit more complicated than adding a text field.

342
00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:03.985
Looking at our input options.

343
00:21:03.985 --> 00:21:09.100
I'm not sure if there's input options here, let me have a look.

344
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.035
Input types.

345
00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:14.410
I guess we're on the wrong page for input types.

346
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:19.420
If I search the documentation, is it this one?

347
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.585
Basic input setting types? Here we go.

348
00:21:22.585 --> 00:21:28.700
Here you can see that we can use an image picker for image uploads.

349
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.210
There's two parts to this, obviously,

350
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:37.960
I got to add the option in our block and then I've got to add it into our actual HTML.

351
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.435
I'm going to put it actually above name.

352
00:21:40.435 --> 00:21:46.630
I'm going to create a new object here and inside,

353
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.500
I'm going to have the id of photo,

354
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.355
type is going to be what I showed you before image picker,

355
00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:57.970
and label is photo.

356
00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.395
We can say whatever we want.

357
00:21:59.395 --> 00:22:04.725
I save that and now we have that option in our settings.

358
00:22:04.725 --> 00:22:08.205
The next step will be to put it in our actual content.

359
00:22:08.205 --> 00:22:11.970
I'm going to put in an image tag up here and the way I'm going to do

360
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.480
that is by using a filter that we saw earlier.

361
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.815
I'm going to open up an opening closing curly brackets,

362
00:22:22.815 --> 00:22:28.310
and I'm going to grab member settings.

363
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.715
Was it image or photo that we called it?

364
00:22:30.715 --> 00:22:35.170
Photo. Member settings photo.

365
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:42.200
Then I'm going to run it through the image URL filter to get the URL of that photo.

366
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:49.710
Then I'm going to run it through image tag to get the tag to output on the screen.

367
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:54.770
If I save that, check if I've made any errors, look so good.

368
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.240
On theme watch, refresh the page.

369
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.960
You'll see here that we've got a bunch of No Image.

370
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.165
What we should do actually is first check if there's an image.

371
00:23:07.165 --> 00:23:11.185
Otherwise we're going to get that ugly No Image.

372
00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:13.330
This is an optional step,

373
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.905
but it's going to make it look nicer.

374
00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:21.565
We'll put in a conditional here, member, settings, photo.

375
00:23:21.565 --> 00:23:24.460
We'll put it in and if not,

376
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.570
nothing will come up.

377
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.450
Save that. See if we got any Liquid errors,

378
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.575
no, we're all good. Refresh the page.

379
00:23:35.575 --> 00:23:39.115
Now you can see no images show up,

380
00:23:39.115 --> 00:23:41.755
until we add them ourselves.

381
00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.380
If I go into this section,

382
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.700
I go into a block.

383
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.970
You can now see that I have this photo input.

384
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:53.455
I can actually explore Free images through Shopify's database,

385
00:23:53.455 --> 00:23:56.560
or I can select my own image.

386
00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:04.990
What I'm going to do is find an image of myself and upload that. Here we go.

387
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.055
Once that's in, it will go into the content.

388
00:24:09.055 --> 00:24:12.955
If I go out here and add images for the other sections.

389
00:24:12.955 --> 00:24:15.430
Let's just add the same one.

390
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.780
You'll see it comes up here in the actual block as well, which is pretty cool.

391
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.440
You can identify the different team members easier.

392
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.670
You'll now see that I have the photo,

393
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.730
the name, the title, and a buyer.

394
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.430
Now, of course, we want to fix this padding and spacing.

395
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.930
We can do that in CSS,

396
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.790
but that's not the point of this lesson.

397
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.550
The point is to show you these blocks,

398
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:45.565
and how we can build our own settings in the customizer through our code.

399
00:24:45.565 --> 00:24:48.655
Now there's one more issue that we have with this,

400
00:24:48.655 --> 00:24:51.340
and that the image size is very small.

401
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.809
That's because if you use image URL without any parameters,

402
00:24:55.809 --> 00:25:02.050
it's going to show up with an image that I believe is a 100 by 100, quite small.

403
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.405
What we're going to do to finish off,

404
00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:06.595
is add in a parameter here,

405
00:25:06.595 --> 00:25:10.285
which is going to tell Liquid how big we want the image.

406
00:25:10.285 --> 00:25:12.970
I'm going to say 500x.

407
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:18.140
That will make an image with 500 by 500.

408
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.225
Save that, refresh the page,

409
00:25:22.225 --> 00:25:30.475
and now you can see we've got a 500 by 500 image on each of our team members.

410
00:25:30.475 --> 00:25:32.380
That's actually a bit too big,

411
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.725
so I'm going to scale that down to 300,

412
00:25:35.725 --> 00:25:40.810
and I'm going to add in another team member,

413
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.610
which is just going to be me again,

414
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.990
just to show you the extent of the grid.

415
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:53.275
Christopher Dodd, Job Title: Web Developer,

416
00:25:53.275 --> 00:25:57.715
Bio, we'll just copy from the other ones.

417
00:25:57.715 --> 00:26:00.385
There you go. Save that,

418
00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:06.340
and now you can see we've got this two-column grid with our team members.

419
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.540
We can go in, we can delete blocks,

420
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.370
we can reorder them,

421
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:17.590
or we can add new team members and all of that without using code.

422
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.425
As you can see, we've set it up once in the code.

423
00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:21.970
We've set up our options.

424
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:27.070
We've set up where we want those values that we set to show up in our code,

425
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.800
and we've developed our own section.

426
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.155
Now, there's one more thing I want to show you,

427
00:26:32.155 --> 00:26:33.849
and that's adding a preset,

428
00:26:33.849 --> 00:26:40.090
so that we can use this section in our content for index tag.

429
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.450
Let's go back to our documentation here,

430
00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:48.475
and maybe we'll find it in this place, presets.

431
00:26:48.475 --> 00:26:54.140
No, so we're going to have to go back to the page we were on before.

432
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.630
Configuring theme settings, was that it?

433
00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.510
Theme sections. Here we go.

434
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.915
Presets. Here we go.

435
00:27:04.915 --> 00:27:07.285
If we click on "Presets",

436
00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:09.115
we can see this section,

437
00:27:09.115 --> 00:27:12.700
which we can define a name and a category for us to be

438
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.840
able to use on our content for index section.

439
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:24.625
If we go into our Home page where content for index is running,

440
00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:30.160
and we click "Add section", let's see.

441
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.580
There's Custom content. That's not what we're after.

442
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.935
Rich texts, Map, Newsletter.

443
00:27:35.935 --> 00:27:38.935
See, we don't actually have our team members section here.

444
00:27:38.935 --> 00:27:43.540
If we wanted to add it as one of our sections in content for index,

445
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.645
we just need to add a preset.

446
00:27:46.645 --> 00:27:56.350
I'm going to grab this as an example just to save time. Go in here.

447
00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.340
Close down blocks to make it a bit easier to read,

448
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.140
and put in presets.

449
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:08.230
Now, we don't need blocks because this is just going to set a preset on our blocks,

450
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.990
which we can do if we want to, but not necessary.

451
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:15.010
All I want to do is give it a name and category,

452
00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.900
so that we can use it in our content for index.

453
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.285
That category should match one of these ones here.

454
00:28:25.285 --> 00:28:30.895
I think the most appropriate maybe Store Information. Let's just go with that.

455
00:28:30.895 --> 00:28:34.585
I'm going to call it Store Information,

456
00:28:34.585 --> 00:28:36.340
and because it's in capitals,

457
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.105
I'm not sure exactly whether I should put mine capitals or not.

458
00:28:40.105 --> 00:28:46.795
I'm just going to see how they do it with the map template.

459
00:28:46.795 --> 00:28:52.855
Going down to map and scrolling down to the bottom to see the preset,

460
00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:57.910
we can see the name is Map and the category is Store information.

461
00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.975
Just like we've written it. Category, store information,

462
00:29:01.975 --> 00:29:08.440
and the name is going to be Team Members. Press "Save" on that.

463
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.095
Have we gotten the errors? No, we haven't.

464
00:29:11.095 --> 00:29:14.605
Actually we do. We've got an invalid JSON.

465
00:29:14.605 --> 00:29:18.385
That's because we haven't closed this down,

466
00:29:18.385 --> 00:29:21.475
and we haven't actually closed the square bracket either.

467
00:29:21.475 --> 00:29:23.960
How do we boot that up?

468
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:29.275
Hopefully we don't have any JSON errors now.

469
00:29:29.275 --> 00:29:39.080
Updated. Now, if I refresh our Home page in the customizer, click "Add section."

470
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.605
Now on the Store Information,

471
00:29:41.605 --> 00:29:43.330
I don't know why it's coming up twice,

472
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.505
but at least we have it here.

473
00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:48.925
We can add our Meet the Team section.

474
00:29:48.925 --> 00:29:53.995
Down the bottom, we can add team members just like we did before,

475
00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:57.925
and it'll show up in a nice little grid.

476
00:29:57.925 --> 00:29:59.935
As we update the content,

477
00:29:59.935 --> 00:30:02.275
it will come up automatically,

478
00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:05.875
and we can reorder that section,

479
00:30:05.875 --> 00:30:09.040
within all of our other sections.

480
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.470
There you go. How good is that?

481
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.470
I'm actually not going to save that because I don't want

482
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.840
to meet this Team section on my Home page.

483
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.465
But that pretty much concludes booting your own Shopify section.

484
00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:26.695
Now, as I said before,

485
00:30:26.695 --> 00:30:28.585
you'll want to style it a bit differently.

486
00:30:28.585 --> 00:30:34.975
You'll want to add some either inline styles or go into your theme.scss.liquid,

487
00:30:34.975 --> 00:30:44.410
and add in some styles using classes to target what you've put in this new section.

488
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:49.390
Maybe putting in class of team member, underscore,

489
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:57.055
underscore name, and then doing the same for your title and bio.

490
00:30:57.055 --> 00:31:01.990
This would be a good way to lay out your CSS using BEM,

491
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.170
Block Element Modifier is what that stands for.

492
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.995
If you want to learn more about why we're using underscore,

493
00:31:08.995 --> 00:31:12.565
underscore here and why it's used all throughout the FEM,

494
00:31:12.565 --> 00:31:14.635
BEM is what you need to research.

495
00:31:14.635 --> 00:31:17.665
But that's outside the scope of this class, unfortunately.

496
00:31:17.665 --> 00:31:21.520
What I've just done here is put in some classes that we can go

497
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.500
and target in theme.scss.liquid.

498
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.930
This is not specifically a CSS class,

499
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.025
so I won't get into that.

500
00:31:30.025 --> 00:31:32.080
But yeah, that's it.

501
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.840
That's your custom section built.

502
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.289
Hopefully that shows you the power of sections.

503
00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:40.525
I've worked with other platforms in the past,

504
00:31:40.525 --> 00:31:44.635
and I haven't seen anything like this where you can just

505
00:31:44.635 --> 00:31:50.035
define a bunch of options in a JSON block,

506
00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:53.530
and then suddenly you're able to use it directly above it

507
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.685
and have such a nice user interface for customization.

508
00:31:57.685 --> 00:32:00.220
If we go back to that About Us page,

509
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.680
where we've hard coded this section in there.

510
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.035
We are able to use this lovely user interface which

511
00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:11.160
updates what we have over here in the preview live.

512
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.450
That's really cool.

513
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.840
I hope you guys have enjoyed learning how to do this.

514
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.490
In the next few videos,

515
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.330
we're going to wrap up this side,

516
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.785
show you how to send it off to a client side or to

517
00:32:23.785 --> 00:32:28.975
a proper store where you're going to actually pay for a plan if you so choose.

518
00:32:28.975 --> 00:32:30.565
Stick around for that.

519
00:32:30.565 --> 00:32:33.290
I'll see you in the next video.
