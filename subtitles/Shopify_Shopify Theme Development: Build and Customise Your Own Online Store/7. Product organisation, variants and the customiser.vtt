00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
Before we dive into this code and learn how it's all set up,

2
00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:08.160
there's one thing else store is missing and that is products.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.940
An online store with no content isn't very good,

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.180
and the main content that you would have on an online store by its nature is products.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.450
Right here you can see that at least,

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.195
Shopify gives you some place holders,

7
00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:25.965
but if you click on these,

8
00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:29.805
they're not actual products that you can interact with.

9
00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:32.610
What we're going to need is some products.

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.240
Now, if you are developing your own Shopify theme and you're just following

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.870
along this course to learn more about how you can customize your theme.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.365
Maybe you already have some products.

13
00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:46.340
Maybe now is a good time to add products into your store.

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.820
But if you're just here to learn Shopify theme development,

15
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.415
and you don't have a stored or work on right now,

16
00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:55.489
you're going to need some demo products.

17
00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.140
So lucky for us,

18
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.015
Shopify provides a small set of demo products through their timber theme.

19
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:08.540
If we go and search for Shopify timber or Shopify timber theme in Google,

20
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.510
it should be the first link that comes up.

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.975
I'm going to click on that to give you a little bit of context,

22
00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.485
timber is archives now it's no longer in use,

23
00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:22.010
but this used to be what is now Slate.

24
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.610
It used to be this starter theme that Shopify provided,

25
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.140
now they use Slate,

26
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.714
which I mentioned previously,

27
00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.800
but we'll go into more detail on Slate and in later video.

28
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.415
The reason why I'm bringing you here to the timbre theme Git repository is that

29
00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:39.635
they still have it up and they have

30
00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:44.075
this CSV file for importing some products into your website.

31
00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:47.075
If we download this CSV file,

32
00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:49.670
I've already got it downloaded right there,

33
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.170
so I'm not going to download it again,

34
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.930
and then we go back to our online store.

35
00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.920
We go into our products menu and we click Import, just below products.

36
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.235
We can grab that file.

37
00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:09.360
Click Upload, just click Start Import.

38
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.490
It might take a little bit of time to run that,

39
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.750
but when that's done,

40
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.060
you will now see products imported,

41
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.450
and you've got a bunch of example products,

42
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.070
all of them, basically shoes.

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.385
If we go into any of these,

44
00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:28.255
we can click View.

45
00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:31.295
It'll open up a new tab in which we can view

46
00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:35.215
the product page with this particular product loaded in.

47
00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:37.790
We've got a pretty nice product page already because we're

48
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.430
using a duplicate of the debut theme,

49
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.695
but you can edit this as much as you want.

50
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.315
You can have the layout different.

51
00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.980
It's up to you, you have access to the whole theme code now.

52
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.370
One thing we've got is the input breaks with the variance.

53
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.220
We're going to have to go back here,

54
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.980
and down in variance,

55
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.740
we're just going to delete all variance.

56
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.490
As you're running an online store,

57
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.630
products are central to your store.

58
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.090
This video is going to focus mainly on products.

59
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.905
Here in your products page in the Shopify admin,

60
00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:22.730
you have the ability to duplicate view and promote.

61
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.265
You can change the title, the description.

62
00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:27.560
This is where you add your product images.

63
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.925
Pretty simple, pretty self-explanatory, putting your pricing,

64
00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.570
but the parts of your product page that I want to get into and discuss more

65
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.410
about in this lesson are variance and organization,

66
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.090
so product type, vendor, collections and tags.

67
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.120
First of all, variance.

68
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.995
A variant is basically the different variations of the product.

69
00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:54.570
You'll start to see what I mean by that in just a second.

70
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.420
If I click Add variant,

71
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.775
it gives me the option of setting an option name and a list of possible values.

72
00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.090
A pretty standard one is size,

73
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.610
and it's definitely relevant for a product like this,

74
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.915
not everyone is going to want the same size of sneaker.

75
00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:17.720
What we can do is put in different values separated by a comma,

76
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.330
and you'll see what happens when I put the comma in.

77
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.550
If I press 8, 9, 10,

78
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:34.100
11, 12, you can see that I have this option size and I have five possible values.

79
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.735
So I am saying that these shoes are available in these five sizes.

80
00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:40.130
If you go down here,

81
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.770
a table of variance has been created.

82
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.710
Because I only have one option,

83
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.180
and I have five option values,

84
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.410
I just get five variance because you can only order the shoe in five possible variations.

85
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.770
But if I was to add another option, say for color.

86
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.665
Let's say, I can get all sizes either in red or black.

87
00:05:02.665 --> 00:05:08.090
Then suddenly my list of variance expands and doubles.

88
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.810
That's because we need to multiply the number of values in

89
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.739
one option field with the rest of the option fields,

90
00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:19.520
that will give you the total amount of possible variations

91
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.795
given that we are able to have red in nine, black in eight.

92
00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:28.255
All of these different options combined together create different variance.

93
00:05:28.255 --> 00:05:30.590
We can add a third one in here,

94
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.855
says material by default.

95
00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:36.345
I don't know what material shoes are made out of.

96
00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:40.760
Let's just go with a common material cotton.

97
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.370
That's not going to increase the amount of

98
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.220
variance we have here because there's only one possible value,

99
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.940
defeats the whole purpose of using variance if it's just going to be one value,

100
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.990
so we have to put in more.

101
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.640
Let's say, Lycra, probably doesn't make any sense for shoes.

102
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.885
But I'm just coming up with stuff off the top of my head.

103
00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:03.810
Three options is the max in Shopify.

104
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.065
If I add more values to all of these,

105
00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:10.460
it can start to multiply and get out of hand pretty quickly and actually

106
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.935
Shopify limits to you too 100 possible variance on every product.

107
00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:21.095
This obviously depends on if I do have every possible combination in stock,

108
00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:22.895
and as that product available,

109
00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:29.385
do I have cotton red size eight sneakers and red-black 10 sneakers.

110
00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:35.825
That's up to me to figure out what variables or what variations I have in my own store,

111
00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:37.210
and put those in.

112
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.155
This is irrelevant, so I'm going to remove that.

113
00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:42.500
With these different options,

114
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.695
it's going to create 10 variants for us.

115
00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:47.435
The point I want to get across here,

116
00:06:47.435 --> 00:06:49.325
and the thing that tripped me up is,

117
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.475
these are the variance here.

118
00:06:51.475 --> 00:06:53.775
These are your options. All right.

119
00:06:53.775 --> 00:06:56.430
These are variance, these are.

120
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.160
If I click Save on that,

121
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.990
you'll see that we get this nice little table here and we can update

122
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.570
SKUs here or add in variant images for specific variance.

123
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.435
We can also filter selections by clicking on an option value.

124
00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:18.095
Go in here and just check the ones we want to edit and edit them in bulk.

125
00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:20.465
But to see what that looks like on the front end,

126
00:07:20.465 --> 00:07:22.280
what I'm going to do, we've already hit Save,

127
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.750
so we can click View,

128
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.930
and we can see what that's going to look like to the user.

129
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.140
As you can see here on the front end,

130
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.910
the user just gets two options,

131
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.160
and I want it in size nine,

132
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.025
and I wanted them black.

133
00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:38.460
Then they'll add to code.

134
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.500
For us, in order to fulfill the needs of the customer who can have these options,

135
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.370
we're going to need all of these in black and all of these in red,

136
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.170
so I'll need 10 different shoes in total.

137
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.055
But for the user, they just get to have more customization options.

138
00:07:56.055 --> 00:08:00.165
Hopefully, that clears up variance and makes that pretty clear.

139
00:08:00.165 --> 00:08:04.805
There's one more thing we can do to provide a better customer experience,

140
00:08:04.805 --> 00:08:07.760
and that is to use variant images.

141
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.585
I've got a random picture of black shoes on my desktop.

142
00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:14.095
What I'm going to do is click Black,

143
00:08:14.095 --> 00:08:18.425
and I'm going to update images for all black shoes.

144
00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:20.300
I click on Add Image,

145
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.415
and I've got these Nike sneakers here that are a black color.

146
00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:28.140
It's going to upload them.

147
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:34.870
You're just going to have to ignore the fact that these aren't the exact same shoe.

148
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:44.635
If I save the page and right click on "View" and select "Black",

149
00:08:44.635 --> 00:08:47.560
you'll see that it automatically switches to

150
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.325
that product image that represents that variant.

151
00:08:51.325 --> 00:08:54.610
Size is going to look pretty much the same, so it doesn't make sense,

152
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.695
but color is a perfect example of when you change this,

153
00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:02.365
you want your product images to change.

154
00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:03.595
It only works one way,

155
00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:06.850
I forgot to set this to Red,

156
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.010
so it works backwards as well,

157
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.335
but you get the point, okay?

158
00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:17.305
Actually, I'll just go in there and do that now just to be thorough,

159
00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:19.510
update images of all the red,

160
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.315
and set that as the variant image.

161
00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:28.210
The next thing is Organization and the main ones here are Collections and Tags.

162
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.885
These are the most important by far out of your Organization options.

163
00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:36.850
These are extra Organization options you have for Product Type and Vendor.

164
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.125
Vendor is a good place to categorize your stock by the brand,

165
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:43.675
so maybe you want to make the Vendor of this, Nike,

166
00:09:43.675 --> 00:09:47.560
and Product Type, you might want to put in shoes.

167
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.280
In my experience, what I've found is Collections and

168
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.270
Tags are the main ways that you can categorize your content.

169
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.340
Speaking of the word category,

170
00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.490
you can think of Collections like categories,

171
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:05.170
but unlike categories in some other kind of platforms like WordPress,

172
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.435
for example, which I've worked with in the past,

173
00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:09.670
you can't nest collections.

174
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:15.745
You have to be more strategic about how you nest your products into different categories.

175
00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:20.110
At the very top of your Organization structure should be Collections.

176
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.915
If I go to my store here,

177
00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:24.610
making sure I'm on preview,

178
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:30.505
and I type into my URL collections/all,

179
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:34.525
you'll see that there is a collection that comes default

180
00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:38.395
with the Shopify platform and that is the all collection.

181
00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:40.255
You don't need to set it up in your backend,

182
00:10:40.255 --> 00:10:42.310
you won't actually see it in your backend,

183
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.765
but if you go to collections/all on any Shopify website,

184
00:10:46.765 --> 00:10:50.620
you'll see all the products that are public on that website.

185
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.365
You can go through and check them out.

186
00:10:53.365 --> 00:10:57.190
This, by the way, is showing your collection template,

187
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.190
so we'll get into that when we get into code.

188
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.865
But if you go into your Templates here,

189
00:11:03.865 --> 00:11:05.620
the code that you set here,

190
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.509
it's linking to a section,

191
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:12.310
so let me just go into that section,

192
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.495
this is the code that runs every time you hit a collection page.

193
00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:20.215
Now, obviously, the products and other features might change,

194
00:11:20.215 --> 00:11:26.515
but that is dynamic based on the code that you put in this template file and section.

195
00:11:26.515 --> 00:11:28.525
Sorry, jumping ahead a bit there,

196
00:11:28.525 --> 00:11:31.735
just wanted to make note that anytime you view a collection,

197
00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:34.630
you're viewing it within a collection template.

198
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.370
As I just mentioned,

199
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:42.130
this is an automatic default collection page that you get with every Shopify theme.

200
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.335
But if we want to create our own collection,

201
00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:49.345
we can do so by going into the Products menu and clicking "Collections."

202
00:11:49.345 --> 00:11:55.750
We can go Create Collection and let's call this one, featured products.

203
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.445
We can add a description if we want and then we select the "Collection Type."

204
00:12:00.445 --> 00:12:03.400
You can either manually add the products one by one,

205
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.735
and you can do that either in the product themselves or right here,

206
00:12:07.735 --> 00:12:12.715
after we save, or you can make it Automatic based on certain conditions.

207
00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:15.130
You can use Product Tag,

208
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.590
Price, Vendor, Type, Compare at Price,

209
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:23.275
Weight, to create your custom filter and then put that into a collection.

210
00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:26.590
You could use price to maybe show

211
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:31.420
all products that are on sale for less than $10 and maybe,

212
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.160
that's a collection that you want to create.

213
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.300
But for our purposes,

214
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.930
I'm just going to go with Manual and I'm going to click "Save" and that'll

215
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.695
refresh the page in order for us to add in some products.

216
00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:46.700
You can use this to search or you can click "Browse."

217
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.470
I want to select these ones at the end,

218
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.540
I definitely need to select "Gnarly Shoes",

219
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.865
my God, Good Old Shoes, oh yeah.

220
00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:56.830
I want the Insane Shoes,

221
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.650
my God, that sounds great.

222
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.645
We've got our five different products in our collection,

223
00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:07.120
and it looks like that is automatically saved.

224
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.880
If I go and click "View" now on that collection,

225
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.535
we'll get a similar page to what we saw before,

226
00:13:12.535 --> 00:13:15.535
but now it has our custom collection name,

227
00:13:15.535 --> 00:13:22.750
and it has the shoes or products that we added into that collection ourselves.

228
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:29.170
Now right here, you have sort by and that comes pretty standard with most themes,

229
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.740
but we can filter again using tags.

230
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:39.460
Let's go back to our sneaker and instead of putting Nike,

231
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.320
which appears to be the brand,

232
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.360
with this Nike ticked there,

233
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.965
instead of putting that in Vendor,

234
00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:46.825
which would be a good place to put a brand,

235
00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:51.730
let's just say we want it to be a tag because that's easier to filter

236
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:56.950
with and tags are very powerful as you'll see throughout your Shopify journey.

237
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.920
Let's just put in Nike as a tag.

238
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.615
I'm going to click "Save" on that.

239
00:14:01.615 --> 00:14:06.685
Now, I want you to notice what happens to this bar when we refresh the page.

240
00:14:06.685 --> 00:14:10.450
You'll now see, we can filter by tag,

241
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.060
and this is built into our theme.

242
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.555
We can go in here, filter again,

243
00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:19.870
and the other thing I want you to notice is our URL.

244
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.230
Remember before we went on collections/all,

245
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.420
now we're on collections/featuredproducts,

246
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.640
which is the name of our collection,

247
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.775
and then after that, we have Nike.

248
00:14:33.775 --> 00:14:37.660
We can actually put the tag name in the URL.

249
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.075
If I was to share this with somebody,

250
00:14:40.075 --> 00:14:41.875
then they would see the same filter.

251
00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:44.995
It's a pretty cool way of filtering your products and

252
00:14:44.995 --> 00:14:48.520
building basically almost like nested collections.

253
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.355
Although, this title still says featured products,

254
00:14:51.355 --> 00:14:53.590
it's filtering by Nike here,

255
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.420
so you can see that feedback there,

256
00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.330
but this is a way to filter from within your bigger collections.

257
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.805
At the end of the day, we could also create a new collection for featured Nike.

258
00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:09.745
We can go into Collections,

259
00:15:09.745 --> 00:15:14.110
Create a Collection and let's say,

260
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.675
we call that featured Nike shoes or products.

261
00:15:19.675 --> 00:15:21.250
Let's say, in our mind,

262
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.970
it's a nested category of that other collection.

263
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.840
Well, unfortunately, like I mentioned, Collections can't nest,

264
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.665
but what we can do is set a condition that the product tag

265
00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:37.270
must equal Nike and then we could set up

266
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.960
another condition and tag all of those products in

267
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.955
the featured collection with another tag that says featured, let's say.

268
00:15:45.955 --> 00:15:48.265
Let's just do that now.

269
00:15:48.265 --> 00:15:49.750
I don't have that yet,

270
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.030
so I'm just going to save the Nike.

271
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.385
Oh, here we go, we need to remove that.

272
00:15:54.385 --> 00:16:00.070
This is just going to show all products that have Nike in them,

273
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.140
and you can see here it's autopopulating,

274
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.280
but let's just say that we want all of these.

275
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.115
Again, this is not super clean,

276
00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:15.355
but if I went into all of these products and then gave them a tag of featured.

277
00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:19.490
If, I'm just going to rush through this part.

278
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:29.500
Now that I've added the featured tag to all of the featured products,

279
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.025
I can go into featured Nike products,

280
00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:38.890
add another condition for product tag has featured.

281
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.150
Hit save. Now we can see that

282
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:48.625
awesome sneakers comes through because it is featured and it is Nike.

283
00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:53.995
To go back and apply this same logic to our featured products,

284
00:16:53.995 --> 00:16:56.245
maybe we want to make this automatic.

285
00:16:56.245 --> 00:17:00.040
Fortunately, we've already set it manually.

286
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.070
We'd have to go delete that one.

287
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:14.210
Let's create another one that's called Featured Collection.

288
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.999
When the tag is featured,

289
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:27.085
we will include all of those products in the Featured Collection.

290
00:17:27.085 --> 00:17:30.970
Now we can go into Featured Collection which we had before,

291
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.805
but now it's automatic based on tags.

292
00:17:33.805 --> 00:17:37.285
And we can filter by Nike.

293
00:17:37.285 --> 00:17:40.630
Or if we wanted to have some custom content,

294
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.430
like have a description or we wanted this title to change,

295
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.480
we could go to how, I think it was,

296
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.430
let's go back and we can just view it from within here, Featured Nike products.

297
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.920
As you'll see, this is similar to this,

298
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.665
but it's just set up in a slightly different way.

299
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.985
If we have a collection,

300
00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:08.665
there's more options available to us to show the title that comes up.

301
00:18:08.665 --> 00:18:11.875
We also have access to the collection object,

302
00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:15.850
which allows us to grab all the products within that collection.

303
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.175
Again, that's getting a bit ahead of myself.

304
00:18:18.175 --> 00:18:20.755
But you can see at the very top,

305
00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:24.175
collections is a way to organize your store.

306
00:18:24.175 --> 00:18:29.770
You could always just organize your store with tags alone, like that's possible.

307
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.900
But most themes, they have a collection page and then you filter by tag,

308
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.710
which is the standard shopify way of doing it.

309
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.300
That's essentially how you would usually organize your products.

310
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.230
Like I said, you can also organize by product type and vendor,

311
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.465
but this is not particularly important to us.

312
00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:52.960
Just another way that you can filter and other variables that you

313
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.410
have access to within your theme code.

314
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.565
I spent a lot of time on the product page.

315
00:19:00.565 --> 00:19:04.960
There are other menu items here in the shopify dashboard, obviously.

316
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.285
Orders which isn't really gonna make much sense until somebody orders a product.

317
00:19:10.285 --> 00:19:14.980
Customers are the details of the people who have placed an order with you and

318
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.470
analytics you can go in and see who's using

319
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.890
your store and how many sales you've made, marketing.

320
00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:25.015
All these kind of relate to the day-to-day running of your store.

321
00:19:25.015 --> 00:19:27.175
Not necessarily related to your theme.

322
00:19:27.175 --> 00:19:30.595
But what I wanted to do was go into products because products kind of,

323
00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:33.325
that's like the content of your website.

324
00:19:33.325 --> 00:19:37.150
It very much relates to theme development and that's why I wanted to dig

325
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.710
into products and collections a little bit more.

326
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.235
Going back to our online store here,

327
00:19:45.235 --> 00:19:52.000
you can see that we can also create other content in the way of blog posts and pages.

328
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.090
Now we're going to add a page later in this class and

329
00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.770
a blog post if you've used any other kind of platform that does blogging.

330
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:04.630
A blog post is essentially a page with a timestamp on it and then

331
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:10.000
it's put into a feed that shows the most recent article first.

332
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.620
You're familiar with a blog.

333
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.485
Technically, it is really the same as a page,

334
00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:16.660
but just has a different purpose.

335
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.190
You can also go in here,

336
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.190
and this is where you update your navigation,

337
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.040
which in your code is called a linked list.

338
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.405
You can go in here and add in a menu.

339
00:20:28.405 --> 00:20:30.895
Not sure if we'll get into that in this particular class.

340
00:20:30.895 --> 00:20:34.630
But right now you can see that we're running,

341
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.055
which menu I'll be running,

342
00:20:36.055 --> 00:20:37.705
the Main Menu here.

343
00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:40.855
So in our customizer we've set,

344
00:20:40.855 --> 00:20:43.000
it's to pull in Main Menu.

345
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.610
If we go into navigation here we can see it's got Home and Catalog,

346
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.585
which is what we have there. That matches.

347
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.745
Domains, preferences.

348
00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:59.155
Preferences we saw before when we turned off the password for the site.

349
00:20:59.155 --> 00:21:01.150
There's some other stuff here that you can put in

350
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.395
Google Analytics code or change your SEO data.

351
00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:08.560
But the final thing I wanted to finish on in

352
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.480
this particular lesson and the part of your store that most relates to the theme,

353
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.080
of course, is going to be your theme customizer.

354
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.730
We already went over this customizer briefly in a previous lesson.

355
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.240
I don't want to spend too much time going over the same details.

356
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.825
But essentially, we mentioned the Collection Page before.

357
00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:34.900
You can go in and modify right here it's defaulting to feature Nike products.

358
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.105
But we can go in, change the grid.

359
00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:41.290
We can show product vendors and it's going to show the tets.

360
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.730
I don't know what tets is,

361
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.115
but that's the joy of demo products.

362
00:21:45.115 --> 00:21:48.010
You can show the collection image,

363
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.810
which for this collection we don't have.

364
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:55.675
All of this is setup within a section called Collection Pages or in our back-end,

365
00:21:55.675 --> 00:21:57.685
it's called Collection Template.

366
00:21:57.685 --> 00:22:03.475
I'll show you that all of these options come through a schema that we've written here.

367
00:22:03.475 --> 00:22:07.270
That's just to give you a preview of what's to come in this class.

368
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:11.950
I think that's a pretty good overview of your Shopify back-end.

369
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.330
Obviously, products are the main thing that your site is going to be

370
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.980
promoting and the main thing that you'll be interacting with, with your code,

371
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.760
it'll be your customization of your store is generally going to be

372
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.395
around presenting your products in the best way with the best options,

373
00:22:29.395 --> 00:22:32.410
filtering in a way that makes sense for the user.

374
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.170
Then having good navigation,

375
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.420
which is pretty self-explanatory.

376
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.200
Setting up good pages for that navigation to link to.

377
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.085
If you have an About page or a Contact Us page.

378
00:22:45.085 --> 00:22:48.670
But yeah, that kind of covers an overview of

379
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:54.745
the Shopify online store experience from the perspective of the seller.

380
00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:56.545
Now in the next few videos,

381
00:22:56.545 --> 00:22:58.780
we're going to dig into your theme code.

382
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.490
So this is where we get into

383
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.700
the actual Shopify theme development or

384
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.240
theme customization because we're not developing something from scratch.

385
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.800
But we will be going into the code and how you can basically edit

386
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.170
anything about your theme and actually

387
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.440
where to find the code that you want to go and edit.

388
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.480
I'll see you in the next video.
