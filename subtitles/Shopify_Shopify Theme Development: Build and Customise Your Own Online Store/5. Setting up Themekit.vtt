00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
In this video, we're going to set up something called Theme Kit in

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.160
order to develop and edit our code on our own computer.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.410
If you've done any web development in the past,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.290
you understand that editing from

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.030
a online web browser like an interface like we have here,

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.920
is not going to be best practice.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.600
We can of course,

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.510
if we wanted to make any changes to our theme,

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.550
go in here then we have access to

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.300
every theme file within our theme and we can change things.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.000
But it's a lot cleaner and a lot better workflow usually to develop locally.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.180
That's why we will be using Theme Kit.

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.725
To warn you upfront,

14
00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:46.425
Theme Kit does require a bit of configuration.

15
00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:50.390
I know configuration is my least favorite part of web development.

16
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.420
I'm sure you guys aren't fond of it either.

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.385
But just so you know, this is one lesson here of setting up

18
00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:02.885
Theme Kit and then we'll be straight into developing and changing our online store.

19
00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.950
To learn about Theme Kit and what it is,

20
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.060
I'm just going to type in Shopify Theme Kit into Google.

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740
The first result if you've worded your query correctly,

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.040
is this one right here.This will tell us in one word what Theme Kit does.

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.965
It's a command line tool for Shopify themes.

24
00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:24.740
We just download the application and with a tiny bit of

25
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.690
setup you're off to the theme creation races.

26
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.280
Just to give some context and explain why we need a tool like Theme Kit and what it does.

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.640
Essentially, we are using a third party proprietary system with Shopify.

28
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.240
When you're developing other apps and websites,

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.960
you might spin up your own server on your own computer.

30
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.720
Then you have your code running on

31
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.215
that server and you can edit it directly from within your computer.

32
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.705
The place where your code is being served,

33
00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:59.750
and the place where you're editing your code is the same.

34
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.050
With Shopify you can't exactly do that because you

35
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.575
can't run a Shopify store on your own computer,

36
00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:10.790
and therefore, you can't run a Shopify theme on your own computer.

37
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.585
How it works is we're going to be interacting

38
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:18.560
with the code I just showed you in our Shopify theme.

39
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.995
In order to see all of our changes that we're making to the code,

40
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:26.000
we have to actually run the theme on

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.595
Skillshare servers and go in and view it like we have done beforehand.

42
00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.065
With that in mind,

43
00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:36.425
before you start playing around with your theme and making edits to your code,

44
00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.510
which could break your website,

45
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.760
you will want to do that in a different theme from what you're currently running.

46
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.935
If you're familiar with staging and web development,

47
00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:50.900
this is essentially how you can stage your changes with theme development.

48
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.880
What I'm going to do is instead of editing

49
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.965
this theme which is currently live on the website,

50
00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:57.170
I know this is just for practice and we're using

51
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.870
it just for practice and nobody's going to see this site.

52
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.730
But say for instance, you wanted to edit a theme that was live already.

53
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.815
You don't want to edit the code that's already running,

54
00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:09.090
the theme code that's already running on your website.

55
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.740
Maybe people are already browsing your site and making purchases.

56
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.020
You want to create those changes on

57
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.400
a separate theme and then move them over when you're confident with them.

58
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.320
The way we're going to do that,

59
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.220
is all you need to do is click in actions and then click duplicate.

60
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.740
Now what's going to happen is it's going to create a theme and it's

61
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.220
going to default to copy of, the name of the theme.

62
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.840
But as that's spinning up,

63
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.460
we can rename it.

64
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.845
I'm going to call this Skillshare Dev Theme.

65
00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:45.120
I'm going to rename that.

66
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.480
In order to see what our website or what our store would look like with this theme,

67
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.265
we click on actions,

68
00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:55.810
preview, instead of view.

69
00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.530
Then when we look at it, the URL is going to be the same, which is confusing.

70
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.375
But right here we know we are previewing

71
00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:06.935
our Skillshare Dev Theme because we've got this bar here.

72
00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:09.860
So if you want to share this preview with somebody you can actually click,

73
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.055
share preview and you get this link to share with anyone for the next 14 days.

74
00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.030
You can also hide the bar,

75
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.535
which I wouldn't recommend unless you have to because,

76
00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:22.970
you don't want to get confused about which theme you're currently editing.

77
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.540
Or, you can click close preview,

78
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.550
and this will take you back to your actual store that's running the live theme.

79
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.590
Because we just duplicated the theme and we didn't make any changes,

80
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.140
it's going to look exactly the same.

81
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.075
So, moving back to Theme Kit,

82
00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:44.600
what we're going to do is first install it and then we're going

83
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.490
to configure Theme Kit so that we're interacting with that particular theme.

84
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.610
Then, we are going to download our theme

85
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.520
to our computer and then we can start editing it.

86
00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.530
So the things we're going to need to install it is probably a package manager.

87
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.795
I use Homebrew on the macOS.

88
00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:06.100
You might be using Windows in which they recommend Chocolatey.

89
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.280
I already have the Theme Kit installed,

90
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.400
so I'm not going to go through installation myself.

91
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.725
Hopefully by going through these instructions,

92
00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:15.750
you can figure out how to install Theme Kit,

93
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.100
but it should be pretty simple.

94
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.595
I just ran these commands and it worked for me.

95
00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:22.555
Now I have Theme Kit installed on my computer.

96
00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:26.460
If we go into commands,

97
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.820
we can see the configure command.

98
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.210
Right now if we open up our Terminal.

99
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.570
So it's Terminal on Mac and Command Prompt,

100
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.860
I believe on Windows.

101
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.760
But essentially whatever your command line tool is,

102
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.100
mine is actually iTerm not Terminal,

103
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.865
but it's all the same thing.

104
00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:49.730
I'm going to navigate to the directory that I want my theme to go in.

105
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.799
I'm going to do code.

106
00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:54.650
I think I have it in personal current.

107
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.530
Now we're in this subdirectory of

108
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.750
my code folder where I put my personal current projects.

109
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.570
What we need to do from here is set up a file called config.yml with

110
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.810
these details in order to tell Theme Kit

111
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.980
what theme we actually want to edit because right now we've just downloaded it.

112
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.790
It doesn't know to connect with this theme just yet.

113
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.200
So that's why we need to configure it.

114
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.795
You'll see here, we need a password,

115
00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:25.625
we need a theme ID,

116
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:28.555
and we need the store URL.

117
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.575
So the first one, your API password.

118
00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:35.210
It might be a bit hard to get your head around as a non-developer,

119
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.710
but essentially an API stands for an Application Programming Interface.

120
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.740
Especially with something like Skillshare,

121
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.485
which is a third party proprietary system,

122
00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:52.160
we're going to need access to the API in order to change anything about our store.

123
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.485
Right now, we only have access to what's in this menu in order to edit our store.

124
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:03.650
We only have access to the options that Skillshare gives us through this user interface,

125
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.165
through this back-end dashboard.

126
00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:10.715
But in order to make any changes outside of this,

127
00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:12.635
it has to be done through an app.

128
00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:14.740
So if I click on apps here,

129
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.640
there's a few different kinds of apps.

130
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.730
One of them is a public app.

131
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:26.135
Anyone can create an app and make it available to buy or use on the App Store.

132
00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:29.705
You can see a couple of popular ones here.

133
00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:35.345
These gain access to the Shopify API and can make changes to your store.

134
00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:38.180
For us, we just want to change our theme.

135
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.310
So we need to set up a very basic app,

136
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.720
which just basically provides us the ability to edit our theme files.

137
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.360
If I go down to here and find this link hidden below those,

138
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.395
called manage private apps,

139
00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:56.765
I can head into this interface which allows us to create our own private app.

140
00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.800
You can think of this private app as just the interface for

141
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.855
us to be able to interact with our theme code on our own computer.

142
00:08:04.855 --> 00:08:08.480
I'm going to call this a descriptive name,

143
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.485
Theme Kit connection because that's really all we're using it for.

144
00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:15.620
I have to put in an emergency developer email,

145
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.465
even though we're just playing around.

146
00:08:17.465 --> 00:08:20.000
It just won't let me submit the form otherwise,

147
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.485
and we need to give access to this app

148
00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:29.615
to allow editing of theme templates and theme assets.

149
00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:35.180
Otherwise, this app is going to be useless to us if we can't edit those theme templates.

150
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.570
If I click save, I will see here that it's

151
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.870
warning me that if I create these API credentials,

152
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.685
anyone who has these details can go in and read and write theme code.

153
00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:48.140
That's cool. I understand.

154
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.590
Create the app and now we have the password.

155
00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.370
The other details are going to be your theme ID and your store.

156
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.440
The store is very simple.

157
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.840
It's just when you click view store,

158
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.010
that's the name of it right there.

159
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:14.300
The theme ID can easily be found by going into the customizer.

160
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.980
Let's go back to themes,

161
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.360
got too many tabs open here.

162
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.575
Remember we want to edit this theme,

163
00:09:24.575 --> 00:09:26.605
not the live theme right now.

164
00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:34.410
So, we want to go in here and we want to click here and click customize.

165
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.790
In the customizer, you can see this number hidden away in the URL,

166
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.685
and that's the one we want to use for our theme ID.

167
00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.930
Like I said before,

168
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.970
you can either create this config.yml file yourself or you can use this command

169
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.730
line command in order to automatically create this file for you, given the details.

170
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.455
It's up to you how you want to do it.

171
00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:04.905
I'm going to use the command itself.

172
00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:09.920
Now that I'm in the directory where I want my project to go,

173
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.380
I can run that command.

174
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.720
Just to show you, right now we have an empty directory.

175
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.420
That current directory is completely empty.

176
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.980
Once we run this command it's going to create a new file for us.

177
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.450
So I'll show you that in just a second.

178
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.525
Let's run through, theme configure,

179
00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:33.855
dash dash password equals.

180
00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:35.745
Then we go into our private app,

181
00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:40.600
find the password, we can just click copy here.

182
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.040
Paste that in. The next variable is going to be store.

183
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.380
You can click in here,

184
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.655
grab that store address.

185
00:10:57.655 --> 00:11:01.810
The final one is theme id.

186
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.345
Like I showed you in the customizer,

187
00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:07.490
we can just copy it from the URL.

188
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.850
Let's check our code to make sure that we've got it all set up correctly.

189
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.835
Yeah, looks good. Now, I'll hit "Enter".

190
00:11:15.835 --> 00:11:18.460
In a few seconds, it should come back with no errors.

191
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.740
If we look at our directory,

192
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.470
we'll see the config.yml file is in there.

193
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.560
If I open that with my code editor,

194
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:34.075
I'll be able to see that file that we talked about here is right there.

195
00:11:34.075 --> 00:11:38.260
Now, if I run Theme Kit commands within this directory,

196
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.365
it knows which theme I want to connect with.

197
00:11:41.365 --> 00:11:46.975
The next step is to download our theme.

198
00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:48.580
That's really simple.

199
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.270
The command for that is theme download.

200
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.780
As that's running, I'll just show you it here.

201
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.320
In the documentation, you can run theme download,

202
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.245
and then you can specify specific files after that,

203
00:12:02.245 --> 00:12:08.470
or just run theme download and it will download the entire theme.

204
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.600
Here you can see it's downloading now and it's at 28 percent.

205
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.315
Let's just skip ahead until that finishes.

206
00:12:16.315 --> 00:12:18.625
That finished with no errors.

207
00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:20.635
If we check the directory now,

208
00:12:20.635 --> 00:12:25.435
we can see those folders that we saw.

209
00:12:25.435 --> 00:12:28.570
If I go back, which one do I want to click on?

210
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.505
There are so many different links up here.

211
00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:33.730
We actually don't need the private app password anymore,

212
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.055
so I can use this tab.

213
00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:41.275
Go back, click on "Edit Code".

214
00:12:41.275 --> 00:12:45.010
You can see that we've got the same structure.

215
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.530
If I move this over to the side,

216
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:53.545
you can see that we've got the assets folder in here, config,

217
00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:57.730
locales, sections, all of that stuff that was in

218
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:03.040
the Skillshare Dev Theme code is now here in our directory.

219
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.920
One thing that Shopify Theme Kit doesn't do is put it all into a new folder.

220
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.370
I'm going to call this skillshare-theme,

221
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.150
and I will need to go into my code editor here

222
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.490
and change directories into that skillshare-theme.

223
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:29.180
All right, I should also mention that there's another option called theme new.

224
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.150
You can actually create a new theme.

225
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.935
Instead of putting in a theme id,

226
00:13:35.935 --> 00:13:39.610
you just put in a name of what you want that theme to be,

227
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.260
and it will create it for you.

228
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.960
If you do that, it'll set you up with

229
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.310
a starter theme that doesn't have all the features of Debut.

230
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:53.245
I would recommend that you duplicate the theme it gives you,

231
00:13:53.245 --> 00:13:54.685
and then edit that one,

232
00:13:54.685 --> 00:13:57.400
rather than start a new theme from scratch.

233
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.070
That's my recommendation. In the later video,

234
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.005
we'll be covering Slate,

235
00:14:02.005 --> 00:14:04.510
which is even more complex than this.

236
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.840
If you wanted to actually build your own theme from scratch,

237
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.810
definitely stick around to the end of this class.

238
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.955
There's going to be a bonus video on Slate.

239
00:14:12.955 --> 00:14:17.950
If you want to go the full process of developing your own Shopify themes,

240
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.725
definitely stick around for that lesson.

241
00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:22.825
For this Skillshare class,

242
00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:26.110
I wanted to show you how to get up and running as soon as possible.

243
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.905
I don't think it's necessary to redesign everything,

244
00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.975
to rebuild everything from scratch,

245
00:14:31.975 --> 00:14:36.280
that's why we're using Debut as a starting point.

246
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.230
As I showed you just before,

247
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.125
we have our theme code here on our local computer,

248
00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:44.005
and we can edit these as we please.

249
00:14:44.005 --> 00:14:48.355
What I'm going to do to do that is run atom dot,

250
00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:52.240
but this command completely depends on what software you're running.

251
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.295
I use atom, so I can just select atom dot.

252
00:14:57.295 --> 00:15:00.565
Now, I have access to the whole project.

253
00:15:00.565 --> 00:15:04.735
I can go in, click on different templates, and edit them.

254
00:15:04.735 --> 00:15:06.070
I can go in here,

255
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.305
make whatever changes I want but of course,

256
00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:12.760
I'm going to want to see what that does to my actual theme.

257
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.185
The last thing I'm going to want to do is run theme watch,

258
00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:20.520
so that whenever I make changes to my local theme files,

259
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.920
it's going to update my actual theme,

260
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:29.095
and then I can look at it in the browser and see what changes have been made.

261
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:34.660
In order to do that, all I have to do is run a simple command, theme watch.

262
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.520
As you'll see in just a sec, now says,

263
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.895
watching for file changes to the theme,

264
00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:45.400
and then it has the id there.

265
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.570
Let's just make a simple change to show how this works.

266
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.690
I don't expect you to know how to navigate around the theme

267
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.975
templates just yet as I will show you that in a later video.

268
00:15:55.975 --> 00:16:01.345
But let's just say we want to get rid of these icons in the header.

269
00:16:01.345 --> 00:16:04.600
You can go into the Header.liquid template in

270
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.115
sections and search for that particular part of the header.

271
00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:11.050
It looks like it's right here.

272
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:19.050
I'm going to find the opening and closing div tag and just delete that all together.

273
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.275
I'm going to hit save on that.

274
00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:23.965
If we go over to our terminal,

275
00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:27.130
you will see it started to process that header,

276
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.085
and then it updated it on our live theme.

277
00:16:30.085 --> 00:16:32.485
If you don't have this already,

278
00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:37.525
you need to go into your theme that you are actually working with and click Preview.

279
00:16:37.525 --> 00:16:39.175
I've got it right here,

280
00:16:39.175 --> 00:16:43.165
and you can see I'm definitely previewing this SkillShare Dev theme right here.

281
00:16:43.165 --> 00:16:47.870
If I refresh the page our icons should have disappeared.

282
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.310
There you go, there's no icons there.

283
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.550
Obviously, this is a change you probably wouldn't want to make.We can go

284
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.185
back and control Z to put it back in,

285
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.650
and then those changes are going to update pretty quickly.

286
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.530
I'm impressed at how fast Shopify does this.

287
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.585
It doesn't slow down development too much,

288
00:17:07.585 --> 00:17:09.445
but there you go, they're back now.

289
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:15.025
Now, you can see that we're able to edit code on our local computer,

290
00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:18.460
and it's updating on our theme.

291
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.815
This is the workflow.

292
00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:24.355
We have our development theme running,

293
00:17:24.355 --> 00:17:28.420
which is just a fancy word for a theme that's not the current theme because we

294
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.935
wouldn't want to edit the current theme if it's a live store.

295
00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:34.870
We run our preview,

296
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.795
and then we have theme watch running,

297
00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:42.610
and we just edit the code and do as we please.

298
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.090
We have environment set up essentially.

299
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.670
Now, one final note before we move on to

300
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.960
the next video is you'll still have access to go in here,

301
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.505
and edit your code from within the Shopify website.

302
00:17:57.505 --> 00:18:00.595
I would recommend against this because this would create

303
00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:04.225
discrepancies between the code you have on your computer,

304
00:18:04.225 --> 00:18:07.315
and the code on your actual theme.

305
00:18:07.315 --> 00:18:09.460
You can go in and change this,

306
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:15.085
but it's not going to update in your local files unless you run theme download.

307
00:18:15.085 --> 00:18:18.865
To be clear, this process of theme watch only happens one way.

308
00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:21.070
It's only when you edit your files locally,

309
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.100
but if you edit them on your Shopify website,

310
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.010
it's not going to come through to your local computer.

311
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.880
I would choose where you want to edit your code and stick with it.

312
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.625
If you're going to be editing it on your own computer,

313
00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:35.125
which I highly recommend,

314
00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:36.625
don't edit it here.

315
00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:41.080
If you do, just know that you'll have to update it on your own computer.

316
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.730
Now, we have our environment setup,

317
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.030
and we have all the tools we need in order to

318
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.185
modify our Shopify website and customize our own theme.

319
00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:53.080
In the next video, we're gonna take a break from the actual code.

320
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.300
Talk about the Shopify platform

321
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.120
itself because it's good to have some familiarity with that,

322
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.555
and then in the video after that we're going to actually go in

323
00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:05.725
and explain all this code we just started looking at.

324
00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:08.780
I'll see you in the next video.
