00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
In the previous video, I mentioned that it's

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,805
only the homepage that you can customize and reorder sections on.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:10,815
That's now no longer the case with Shopify's online store 2.0 updates.

4
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:14,090
You may notice that my appearance in his video is quite different to the intro,

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,480
and that's because this video,

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,940
as well as a few others scattered throughout the class,

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,170
have been recorded a couple of years after this class was first published.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,700
That being said, these videos should fit pretty seamlessly into the structure of

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,360
the class and provide a good complement to the existing videos.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,390
Something you may have noticed is that the theme customizer,

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,840
now called the theme editor in most of the videos of this class,

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,065
will look quite different to yours.

13
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:40,565
If you're watching this class in 2021, for instance,

14
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:43,400
you'll notice that blocks appear in this tree view now,

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,410
whereas in most of the videos in this class,

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,210
they'll appear like this.

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,010
It's important to note that Shopify is constantly changing

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,665
the user interface of the theme customizer,

19
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:58,310
and there's no need for immediate concern as the core fundamentals

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,125
of sections and blocks have stayed the same over time.

21
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,030
The big change that theme developers need to be aware of

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,360
is something called "JSON templates".

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,130
We'll go deeper into JSON templates later in this class,

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,065
but for now understand that templates can be of either two types, Liquid or JSON.

25
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,040
This is getting a bit ahead of ourselves here,

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,660
but it's important to note as if you choose to use JSON templates over Liquid templates,

27
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,940
you won't be able to use Themekit,

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,105
which is what I'll show you in the next video.

29
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:31,010
Instead, you can use something called Shopify CLI,

30
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,415
which I'll use in the video directly after.

31
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:37,430
I think it's a good idea to know how to use Themekit.

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,900
If you're working with modern themes,

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,125
those are the themes that created after June 29,

34
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:46,380
2021, you may want to skip the next video.
