00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
To get started building and customizing our own Shopify theme,

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.230
what we're going to need is a Shopify store.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.260
Lucky for us, we can build a free store using a Shopify partner's account.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.990
Now this account is completely free and we

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.545
need to join the partner program in order to get it.

6
00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:23.320
Alternatively, if you do have a store already, this first part,

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.185
where we sign up to partners and log into the store through the partner's account,

8
00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.255
is not going to apply to you.

9
00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.250
But everything from when we get into

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.470
our development store is going to apply to you and your store.

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.380
All you need to do is log into your store.

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.500
Otherwise, if you don't have your own store already,

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.230
you might want to create a development store.

14
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.475
What is a development store?

15
00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:50.660
Well, I've got a article from Shopify right here to look into.

16
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.780
It's basically a theme that we can

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.680
do all the different things that we would do in a normal Shopify theme,

18
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.300
but with some limitations right here.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.595
The idea of a development store is as a Shopify partner,

20
00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:09.170
as somebody who develops Shopify themes or works with Shopify clients,

21
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.780
you would create a store, work on it,

22
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.930
develop it, and then pass it off to the client later,

23
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.925
and then that becomes their store,

24
00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:20.285
at which point then the client or the seller,

25
00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:22.340
whoever it is that's owning that store,

26
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.730
is going to pay for that store moving forward.

27
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.425
It's a way to develop stores without having a Shopify account or Shopify plan yet.

28
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:35.930
This is perfect for our purposes because we are learning how to develop themes.

29
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.040
We don't necessarily want to pay the $30-300 a

30
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.265
month to Shopify in order to play around and develop themes.

31
00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:48.440
I already have a Shopify partners account.

32
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.525
All I need to do is click Login.

33
00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:53.135
I'm not going to go through the whole signing up process,

34
00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:56.660
should be pretty straight forward right now because I am an affiliate,

35
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.880
it'll go into my referred stores.

36
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.075
But if I click on top here at Development Stores,

37
00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:06.620
you can see that we have a button here to create a new store.

38
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.665
I'm going to click on that and I'm going to give

39
00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:16.120
the store a name, Chris' Skillshare store.

40
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.190
I'm going to create a password using my password manager.

41
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.560
This one will do, put it in here,

42
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.610
and make sure you save that password somewhere.

43
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.140
It's going to require your store details,

44
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.440
so I'm going to put in some fake details here,

45
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.780
and I am going to choose a store purpose.

46
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.745
We can choose playing around.

47
00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:51.060
I'm going to click Save and as soon as I click Save,

48
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.185
I'm going to need to save that password, of course.

49
00:02:56.185 --> 00:03:00.180
I'm going to create a new document anywhere,

50
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.680
you can write this down anyway,

51
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:10.120
and I'm going to note this password, Shopify Store, password.

52
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.010
Look how quick that was.

53
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.015
We have a store already,

54
00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:17.620
and this store is free to use.

55
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.305
We didn't have to create a plan or anything.

56
00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:23.109
Obviously, if we wanted this to be a legitimate store,

57
00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.880
we would have to pay for a plan and then probably get our own domain.

58
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.650
But now we can work with pretty much a fully functioning theme and

59
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.060
learn everything we need to know about Shopify theme development within this environment.

60
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.495
At this point, if you had a store already,

61
00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:44.035
this is what it should look like when you've logged into your store.

62
00:03:44.035 --> 00:03:47.195
We should all be on the same page right now.

63
00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:50.080
To get us familiar with the Shopify platform,

64
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.225
I'm going to be talking about these menu items and

65
00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:56.765
what you can do within Shopify in a later video.

66
00:03:56.765 --> 00:03:59.390
But for now, the focus is on themes.

67
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.300
We can find our themes by clicking on

68
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.350
Online Store and going to the first menu item called Themes,

69
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.500
which is automatically selected.

70
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.310
If we want to view our store,

71
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.190
we can click View Your Store right here.

72
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.300
It'll come up with our store names separated by hyphens.myshopify.com.

73
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.045
As you can see, we have a fully functioning theme straight away.

74
00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:30.980
What Shopify have done is they've loaded in a free theme for us to use.

75
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.765
This one is the Debut theme,

76
00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:35.600
but it's not necessarily going to be the case for you.

77
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.325
This is subject to change,

78
00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:41.015
but it doesn't really matter what starting point you start with.

79
00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:44.605
Everything we're learning from this point will be the same.

80
00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:48.245
Currently, you can see that we're running Debut theme,

81
00:04:48.245 --> 00:04:51.195
and over here we have actions,

82
00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:53.415
so we can preview the theme.

83
00:04:53.415 --> 00:04:55.445
We can rename the theme,

84
00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.940
duplicate it, download the whole theme.

85
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.480
We can edit the code,

86
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.115
and we can edit the language file.

87
00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:07.130
We can also click here to customize and that gives us a user interface that

88
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.165
we can change things about a website without digging into any code. It's really cool.

89
00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:13.620
Within our theme development,

90
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.375
we'll show you how to create your own customization options,

91
00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.770
which is really simple and one of the great things about Shopify.

92
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.715
We're going to get into customizing in one second, and I'm going to show you that.

93
00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:26.225
But before we get into that,

94
00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.760
I wanted to quickly cover something

95
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.495
that might trip you up and that's in your preferences,

96
00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:36.095
you will have password protection enabled by default.

97
00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:39.800
That means that if you want to share the store with anyone else to look at,

98
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.945
they're going to need this password.

99
00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:44.450
This is going to be login screen that shows

100
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.785
up and they'll have to put in this password in order to see it.

101
00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:51.365
If you're okay with people seeing it,

102
00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:54.335
you can disable the password protection.

103
00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:59.000
For our purposes, I don't think we really need password protection,

104
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.605
but it's there if you want,

105
00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.230
and it's enabled by default.

106
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.590
Let's go back into our theme section and click Customize,

107
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.805
and I can show you the super powerful customization options within Shopify.

108
00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:16.850
By default, you'll be customizing the homepage of your theme,

109
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.620
but you can click on this list and it gives you all the different templates that you can

110
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.945
edit depending on what theme you're using

111
00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:26.825
or how many templates you've set up within your theme.

112
00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:28.895
This list can get long,

113
00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:30.800
but for our starter theme,

114
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.690
Debut theme, that's all that's available.

115
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.950
To draw your attention over to the left here,

116
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.880
with the first tab selected,

117
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.920
we have access to all the sections within our page.

118
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.755
The header and footer sections that are included with every page,

119
00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:50.810
so if I go into, let's say,

120
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.100
Collection Pages, you'll see header and footer are there as well.

121
00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:02.120
That stays standard across all pages as long as it's set up in the theme file.

122
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.950
We'll get into that, the actual code structure in a later video,

123
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.850
but here is the visual representation.

124
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.695
If I click on any of these sections,

125
00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:12.260
I have customizable options.

126
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.580
I can add a logo image instead of the name of the store.

127
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.170
I can customize the menu,

128
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.470
and this is all set from within the code,

129
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.065
you have access to these customization options, which is really cool.

130
00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:28.850
Obviously, the footer is the same thing,

131
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.275
but down the bottom of the page and here you can see what's called blocks.

132
00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:36.695
We're going to learn how to use blocks in a later video,

133
00:07:36.695 --> 00:07:40.905
but essentially, we can add an extra block here.

134
00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:43.670
I don't know if it's going to update straight away.

135
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.815
Yes, quick links is here.

136
00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:47.705
If we remove that content,

137
00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:52.200
you'll see that we have less columns in here.

138
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.020
We can actually go through, add,

139
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.450
and delete different bits of content.

140
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.530
We can delete the newsletter and then now we have two blocks

141
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.820
and they automatically fill up the space evenly, which is really cool.

142
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.945
I'm going to reload because I don't want that change to save,

143
00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:12.850
and then we'll talk about the sections between header and footer.

144
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.189
Now this part here of our sections

145
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:20.180
customizer is going to be different in different pages.

146
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.105
If we go to Collection Pages or Collections List or any of these,

147
00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:28.910
you'll see that there's a single section and we can't

148
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.375
add or remove that section from the page.

149
00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:35.510
That's because that section is hard-coded into

150
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.965
the page and we will see that later when we look at the code.

151
00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:42.755
The difference between pretty much every other page in your Shopify site

152
00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:48.420
compared to the homepage is we have this content for index section.

153
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.940
I shouldn't use the word section because I'm going to get you confused.

154
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.795
But we have this part of the sections

155
00:08:56.795 --> 00:09:02.785
sidebar that we can add a section through these different presets.

156
00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:05.120
Let's say we wanted to add a map.

157
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.670
If this section is set up in our code,

158
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.385
then we can add it and we have all these customization options.

159
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.635
We can reorder the sections,

160
00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:20.390
so I can put map at the top in case I want to make that prominent.

161
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.670
I can show and hide the section and then I can remove it.

162
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.650
Basically on the homepage,

163
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.160
how it's set up is you have your header, you have your footer,

164
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.770
and then you have a list of sections that stack

165
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.530
on top of each other that you can customize.

166
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.120
Let's try a more practical example,

167
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.320
there's no About page, but let's say that you are on

168
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.050
an About page and you wanted to put that map in.

169
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.690
You could definitely insert that section,

170
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.850
but you would do it from within the code.

171
00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.670
I'll show you how to do that once we dig into our theme code.

172
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:03.305
I'm a bit concerned because this video is probably a little bit long.

173
00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:05.570
But to cover the other tab,

174
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.430
this is your theme settings,

175
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.870
and we can also edit

176
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.760
what settings come up in this section as well through our theme code.

177
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.840
But these cover settings that are going to be used throughout the whole website,

178
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.135
so headings and links, body texts,

179
00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:22.540
sales price, what the color of buttons are going to be.

180
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.380
This is site wide stuff,

181
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.160
so we can put whatever we want in here through our own theme development,

182
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.070
but we've got some standard options here,

183
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.630
and this will affect the entire side.

184
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.080
We've got the Sections tab,

185
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.450
the Theme Settings tab.

186
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:43.280
We've got this selector here to select different pages to customize.

187
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.825
Up here, we can see our website on different screen sizes.

188
00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:48.815
If we want to see it fully expanded,

189
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:53.495
we can click this button and it'll expand the full width of the screen.

190
00:10:53.495 --> 00:10:57.380
The only problem with that one is you don't get access to your customizer.

191
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.020
Alternatively, you can click on this one and you can

192
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.010
see how your website looks on mobile.

193
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:08.585
You might have different customization options for mobile or for desktop,

194
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:13.425
so you might want to preview them or to see how your website's looking on mobile.

195
00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:15.020
A lot of online stores,

196
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.270
the traffic is more than 50 percent mobile,

197
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.335
so it's very important to have a look at that tab.

198
00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:23.705
Then when you're done customizing,

199
00:11:23.705 --> 00:11:25.540
you'll want to click Save.

200
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.760
One more thing that I didn't cover, theme actions.

201
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.370
This is the same menu as what you had.

202
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.685
If we go back to where we were before,

203
00:11:37.685 --> 00:11:40.850
this theme actions is the same,

204
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.105
or maybe a little bit less options,

205
00:11:44.105 --> 00:11:47.465
but it's essentially the same as actions right here.

206
00:11:47.465 --> 00:11:51.515
We're going to click into Actions probably in the next video,

207
00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:54.145
but I wanted to show you the customizer.

208
00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:55.690
If we click Save,

209
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.580
those changes will be live on this theme.

210
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.370
But I don't want to make any changes,

211
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.350
so I'm going to click Reload and then we're all at the same starting point.

212
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.700
Essentially, this is the user interface you have to interact with your theme.

213
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.765
Now what we're going to do is dig into the code of your theme.

214
00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:20.270
In combination with what you do in your code plus what you do in your customizer,

215
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.230
you have virtually full control over your whole theme,

216
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.650
your whole look and feel of your online store.

217
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.265
We went over the customizer in this lesson.

218
00:12:31.265 --> 00:12:35.490
Let's dive into the code in the next few videos.
