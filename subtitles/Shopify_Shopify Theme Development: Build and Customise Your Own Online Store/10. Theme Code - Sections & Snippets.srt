1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
In this lesson, we are going to go over sections and snippets.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,730
Obviously, we have already touched on sections and

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,415
snippets a little bit in the previous lessons.

4
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:11,775
Indeed, there's going to be some overlap in this whole structure,

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,670
but let's dive deeper into talking more

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,245
specifically about sections and snippets in this lesson.

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:22,445
One of the templates that I didn't show you in

8
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:27,965
the previous lesson was the template for the homepage, which is interesting.

9
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:31,130
If I go back into ADaM and you can see here,

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,850
collection uses this selection collection template.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,360
I must have accidentally put that in there, let me save that.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,770
If you go into a lot of them either they have a bunch of

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,510
their own custom content or they just link to a section such as the collection page,

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,430
just links to the collection template,

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,895
the blog page just goes to the blog template.

16
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:03,320
As we will soon find out so that we can use

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,850
the features of sections which include customizing in the customizer.

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,500
We had looked at that a little bit,

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,200
but I want to show you the index.liquid template first.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,670
This is the template that loads on our homepage

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,110
and it includes this dynamic tag content for index.

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,499
If we go back to Owl theme structure,

23
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:27,890
I had this template linked to content from index,

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,160
but I deleted it at the start of two lessons ago.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,040
That's because it's not related to every single template,

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,425
but it does show up in one template,

27
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:38,840
and that is the homepage template.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,780
But you know what, I might be wrong because maybe we could

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,480
put content for index in every template.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,170
Let's just run that experiment right now and honestly,

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,310
I've never tried this before,

32
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,690
so I don't know if it's going to work,

33
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,895
but let's see if we can just shove that in any of our templates.

34
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:58,650
That is the collection template.

35
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,965
If I go into my customizer.

36
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:05,465
Be interesting to see what happens with that dynamic tag.

37
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,640
Any errors in our theme watch?

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,075
No. Let's go into collections list. Sorry, that's the wrong one.

39
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,680
We want collection pages.

40
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,340
Interestingly enough, we have this section

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,060
here which has been hard-coded into the collection.

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,535
But then we also have the selection that we had on our homepage content for index,

43
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:33,325
which allows us to dynamically add,

44
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,245
remove, and order sections.

45
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:41,815
Pretty cool. I've never tried that before and I don't know whether that is too practical,

46
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:43,749
but how it's set up by default.

47
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:46,300
I'm going to revert this to how it was before.

48
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,470
Is on the homepage,

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,805
you have this content for index.

50
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:56,105
Maybe I need to put that thing back in my diagram there we go.

51
00:02:56,105 --> 00:03:02,075
You have access to this super awesome tag called content for index,

52
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:06,130
which allows you to have a dynamic list of sections

53
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,415
and if it makes sense for you to put on any other page other than the homepage.

54
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,820
Feel free to do so,

55
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,250
but on the homepage,

56
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,730
by default, you have content for index.

57
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,460
Now of course, you can go in and make this template like any other template.

58
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,190
This template is here for you to use it does not have to just be content for index,

59
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,520
but content for index is cool because we can,

60
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,315
as I mentioned before, add sections.

61
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:34,790
Now we are going to go deeper into sections in a later video by creating

62
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,740
our own section and then you are going to really learn the power of sections.

63
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,525
But for now, let's dive into the code of one of them.

64
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:48,260
we've gone a bit into this already but if we go into

65
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,920
templates and look at a template for cart,

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,220
everything is contained within a section.

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,085
If we go into here section for cart template,

68
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:06,975
then we have everything that shows up in our cart page with a schema for editing.

69
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:10,730
This is basically the part that separates sections from

70
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,065
any other of the files in Owl theme code.

71
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:18,560
The schema might look a little bit daunting at first,

72
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,000
but it's an amazing way to add in customizable options that we

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,090
use throughout our code here and we allow the user to edit them.

74
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,600
As you can see here,

75
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,110
there's a bunch of different language data and this converts

76
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,685
the label or the name of the schema based on your language.

77
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,005
But you don't have to do that,

78
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:43,230
you can just get rid of this object all together.

79
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,755
If you just wanna do it in one language,

80
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:48,410
you can have cut page.

81
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,830
Most of the themes actually I work on are like this.

82
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,440
There's not so many different options for languages.

83
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,705
I'm going to just get rid of that object and simplify it and you can see here,

84
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:05,090
we've got the top level of our schema.

85
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,185
We've got the name of this section,

86
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:11,225
settings, and then within our settings,

87
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:15,690
we've got all the different settings that we can change.

88
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,855
Just like we had here in our settings.schema,

89
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,150
we can create a schema for

90
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,025
each individual section and then only call in those options when we need them.

91
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:32,945
It works in a similar way to the schema in our setting schema,

92
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,925
this is for the whole theme.

93
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:38,120
If we go into a specific section,

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,060
what did we have before?

95
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,065
We had collection template, wasn't it?

96
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:44,940
Anyway, it does not really matter.

97
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,525
They are all similar in how they operate.

98
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:51,315
It was not this one but let's have a look at this one too.

99
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:53,975
We've got a name, collection pages,

100
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:55,360
and here's our settings.

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,475
We've got different input types here,

102
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:02,915
and the different input types we have available to us we can go over right now.

103
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:06,830
I'm just going to go into the documentation.

104
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,870
Just typing into Google,

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:16,470
Shopify input types, configuring theme settings.

106
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,470
Let me have a look and see if this is the document we are looking for.

107
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,735
Input settings if I click that, here we go.

108
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:26,795
Now we have in the documentation,

109
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:29,195
the various input settings.

110
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:34,040
You can create different inputs based on whether we are going to use texts,

111
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,615
whether we are going to select an image,

112
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:41,030
whether it is going to be a true or false boolean selection like one or the other,

113
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,195
whether it's going to be a select box, checkbox range.

114
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,780
We can see this working if we go into

115
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,515
our customizer and we can look at the rich range of different input types we have here.

116
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,315
This is going to be an image one.

117
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,980
If I go to here,

118
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,165
this is going to be image picker.

119
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:06,250
I go back to my customizer, these are selects.

120
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,835
If I go into here, that's a text.

121
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,445
This is a text area,

122
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:15,155
and this is actually a link or URL field.

123
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:22,980
Let me check the name on that one to see if it's a link or URL, link list.

124
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,675
There was URL.

125
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:29,485
So the input type for that one,

126
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,710
which majorly looks like a standard textbooks, but it's not.

127
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,955
If you actually click on it,

128
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:40,630
some options come up and we can set that by using the input type of URL. Okay?

129
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,935
So let's look at slideshow, okay?

130
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,810
Because that's a pretty good example.

131
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,430
If I go into here and find that section in our theme code.

132
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,535
And I looked down at the schema.

133
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:58,765
This schema will directly represent what's going on here.

134
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:03,070
So if I look at the things at the top,

135
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,965
it has to have a name and it has to have settings.

136
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:08,365
So the name of it is slideshow,

137
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:10,420
and that's what comes up here.

138
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,650
The class, is for setting CSS classes on the actual section.

139
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,045
So we can't actually see it here,

140
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,830
but it's in there.

141
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,245
And then we go into our settings.

142
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:23,635
Okay, this will be our first setting.

143
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:29,800
And it's select the ideal slideshow height and the label is slide height.

144
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,635
So if we go in here, there it is, slide height.

145
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:35,455
And then what defines these options here?

146
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:37,375
Well, that's in the schema as well.

147
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,149
And we can go down to this field called Options.

148
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,445
And then you've got a list of options here.

149
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:49,375
Again, you've got so much language information that's just making it confusing.

150
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:53,770
So I'm just going to delete some of this to just make it simpler for you guys.

151
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,630
We're all speaking English here.

152
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,140
So you'll still be able to understand what's going on

153
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,175
here without setting it to so many different languages.

154
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,380
Alright, so first option,

155
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,210
the label is adapt a first image and the value when they select that,

156
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,395
is going to be adapt.

157
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:14,005
Okay? Adapt to first image.

158
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:18,145
And then it's going to set this value which the user doesn't see.

159
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:22,840
But this is the value we get to look at within our templates.

160
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,285
So if I search for adapt now,

161
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:30,610
I can see that if we look for,

162
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,725
that's not a great example.

163
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:38,190
But we'll have to have a look at where this is being used.

164
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,125
Let's just look for

165
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:44,085
the slideshow height because there's no point in setting it if it's not used in the code.

166
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,715
So this should be somewhere else in the code.

167
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:48,640
And you can see here,

168
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,375
we can call that option by first calling it object section,

169
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,705
then going into settings,

170
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:57,600
and then looking for the slideshow height.

171
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,520
And actually there was adapter right there.

172
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,285
So it's saying if the slideshow height is set to adapt,

173
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:06,305
that option that we looked at before.

174
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:10,975
Here, adapt. Then we want to do all this, okay?

175
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:14,125
So we're using the value that we've set in our schema,

176
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,630
which the user can edit over here.

177
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,240
And we're directly putting that into the code.

178
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,080
So hopefully you guys can start to see that this is really powerful.

179
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,820
You can create a bunch of customizations within your new code that once built,

180
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,290
you can actually go in here and use a user interface to interact with.

181
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,280
And that's going to be good for if you're developing a website for say, a client.

182
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,590
And it's going to be good even just for yourself.

183
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,725
You build it once and then you don't have to go into the code anymore.

184
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,170
It's an option for you to customize.

185
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,315
Maybe you want to switch it back every so often,

186
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,755
that's an option for you to do.

187
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:50,260
So I know the schema might look a bit

188
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,400
confusing and honestly once you start to get nested into deeper levels,

189
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,055
starts to get even more harder to read.

190
00:10:57,055 --> 00:11:00,940
But over time, you should start to relate what you see here,

191
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,485
to what you see here.

192
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:07,315
And it should be easy to create more options. Alright?

193
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:08,995
So just as an example,

194
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:12,430
what's something that we can add to this slide show as a

195
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,060
customization?Maybe we want to change the text size.

196
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,020
That was my idea, but now I can see it's already been done.

197
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,770
Yeah, anything basically you want to change about all

198
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,385
or give us a customization option in the customizer,

199
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:35,035
you can set up in your schema and then reference in your section code.

200
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:38,725
All right, so just to recap how we can use sections.

201
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:45,685
We can either select them in content for index.

202
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:49,630
We can slide them specifically in the code into a template,

203
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,275
or we can slide the section into a lab.

204
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:57,145
And of course, header and footer,

205
00:11:57,145 --> 00:12:02,545
why they appear on every page is because they're sections included in the layout.

206
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:10,585
These headers and footers are going to be on every page unless of course, we went in.

207
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:16,810
And let's say we deleted section header from theme.liquid.

208
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,715
We refresh the page.

209
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:22,405
After we confirm that the page is updated,

210
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,745
we reload the page.

211
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:32,365
We'll now see that header is gone and it's gone for every page that uses that template,

212
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:34,285
which as I mentioned before,

213
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,295
for theme.liquid is standard.

214
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:43,555
So even header and footer that you include in the theme layout is a section as well.

215
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,105
So going back to the diagram,

216
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:50,455
you can insert sections dynamically into content for index,

217
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:54,070
into templates by hard-coding them,

218
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,070
or into layouts as well by hard-coding them.

219
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,815
And just to recap how we do that,

220
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:02,635
it's just with this liquid tag here.

221
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:06,564
The curly brackets, the percentage sign section,

222
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,155
and then the name of the section.

223
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,530
So, hopefully you get it now that sections are

224
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,040
pretty powerful and they kind of sit at the heart of your theme.

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,455
Now, as I mentioned, we're going to build our own section,

226
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:21,130
and that's going to hammer home this theory a little bit more to you.

227
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,460
So you're going to get some experience with this section and really learn the power

228
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,000
and how you can develop your own custom sections.

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,005
But we have one more thing to go over, and that's snippets.

230
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:35,830
So snippets, you can think of as almost like a dumb section.

231
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,270
Basically just a piece of code that you want to reuse on different parts of your site.

232
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,825
So, there's usually nothing too fancy going on in here.

233
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:46,330
All it does is bring in,

234
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,330
let's say this is products.

235
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,875
What's this one called?

236
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,055
Product price.liquid.

237
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:57,955
So if I want to go search in my theme,

238
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:03,310
search in folder for product-price,

239
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,190
it's going to show me all the references and

240
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,175
I can see here where that snippet has been included.

241
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:15,700
So, I can go into Collection.liquid.

242
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,005
And you can see here,

243
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,700
I'm including that snippet.

244
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,030
So, if I wanted to edit the content here,

245
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,800
I will have to dive into the snippet and edit that code within the snippet.

246
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,480
Just to show you basically creating our own snippet based on content we already have.

247
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,450
Let's just say, we wanted to reuse

248
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,725
a section within here and it just made more sense to have it as a snippet.

249
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:46,385
So, let's just say we want this search drawer to be a snippet.

250
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,525
So I could just take all of this, remove it.

251
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:53,490
Put in a liquid tag.

252
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,485
Right. Include search drawer.

253
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,190
So I'll call it search drawer.

254
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,680
Okay, save that and make sure you have that code saved in your clipboard.

255
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,975
Or you can just Ctrl + Z to get it back.

256
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,490
And what I'm going to do,

257
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,785
is go ahead and create that snippet now.

258
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:23,275
So, I'm going to call it by the exact same name that I've put in next to the include.

259
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:26,290
Search drawer.liquid.

260
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,170
Don't forget the.liquid,

261
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,410
and I'll put it in there.

262
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,610
So, now if we go back to our website.

263
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,010
I wonder if this is still using the naked,

264
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,915
that one's still using the naked layout.

265
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:45,995
But if we go back to our homepage we'll have a header again.

266
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:50,825
And the search drawer is what comes up when you click on this I believe.

267
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,040
Let's just check

268
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:02,140
that. It's up here.

269
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,555
Search drawer is this thing that comes up at the top.

270
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:11,665
And you can see, even though the code is not in there anymore,

271
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:14,949
we're including it still from another source.

272
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:19,435
So as you can see, you could really get away with no snippets,

273
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:23,770
but it's a really good practice to use them if you plan on reusing code or

274
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,900
maybe you just want to clean up this file and

275
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,330
not have so many different components in there.

276
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,450
Maybe this reads a bit better for you.

277
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,620
So, you go into your theme.liquid,

278
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,390
you see all includes search drawer,

279
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,550
then it goes into the header. Okay, cool.

280
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,410
On the flip side, it means that you're going to have to go

281
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,410
and find more files if you use more snippets.

282
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,475
So, that's the trade off there with using snippets.

283
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:51,710
Is you get to put them in a nice little place that you can reuse later.

284
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,795
But then you're obviously going to have to go in and find that snippet,

285
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:58,835
which I'm trying to do now.

286
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:01,650
And you're going to have to edit it there, cool.

287
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,510
So that covers pretty much the everything in this diagram.

288
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,730
So, we've talked about layout,

289
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,340
we've talked about these dynamic liquid tags,

290
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,550
header content and content for index.

291
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,660
We've talked about content for layout.

292
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,665
And we've talked about how the four major areas of your theme,

293
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:23,075
layout, template sections, and snippets all interact together.

294
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,090
And once you start to play around with Shopify,

295
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,680
it really starts to make sense why it's created in this way.

296
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,825
And it gives you a good structure for really doing anything you want with your theme.

297
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:36,965
So it's really cool.

298
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:42,710
The one thing that might have confused you through all of this is of course the liquid.

299
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,720
So, we've been seeing a lot of this templating language called liquid.

300
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,115
Here's a great example,

301
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,660
lots of liquid in here.

302
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,980
In the next video,

303
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,780
we're going to dive deep into liquid.

304
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,340
So, don't worry, we're going to cover what's going on with this liquid code.

305
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,560
Maybe not specifically on this template,

306
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,430
but we're going to talk about liquid in the next video.

307
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:11,220
So, I'm excited to continue on this journey and I'll see you in the next video.
