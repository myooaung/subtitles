00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello and welcome to Shopify Theme Development: How

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,015
to build or customize your own online store.

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:09,135
I'm Chris, I'm a top teacher here on Skillshare.com,

4
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:12,765
covering topics such as web development and online freelancing.

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:16,410
And in today's course, I'm going to take you through an efficient process to

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,855
building and customizing online stores using the Shopify platform.

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:24,320
Shopify is one of the leading e-commerce platforms in

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,055
the world with over 800,000 active Shopify stores,

9
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:29,405
and in my opinion,

10
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:33,860
the most ideal place to get started building your first online store.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,860
As a designer or someone with basic web development knowledge,

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,770
all you'll need to unlock the power of Shopify is

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,340
some basic knowledge of the platform itself and its templating language called Liquid.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,840
And that's exactly what we'll get into in this course.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,110
In the following lessons, we're going to focus on building out and

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,010
customizing your store front through the use of a Shopify theme,

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,890
which is basically like a template that determines

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,995
the way that your online store looks and feels.

19
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,710
We'll learn about theme structure including layouts,

20
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,450
templates, sections, and snippets,

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,040
how to edit your code efficiently and instantly update your storefront, and finally,

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,895
how editing your code can not only update the look and feel of your website,

23
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:15,500
but also provide options within

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,925
your Shopify admin to dynamically add and customize content.

25
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:21,440
By the end of the class,

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,560
you should have a solid understanding of what you can do with

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,360
Shopify themes and the confidence to make changes when needed.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,155
Whether you want to sell your own products,

29
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:33,889
or use these skills to help businesses as a freelancer or agency,

30
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:37,685
