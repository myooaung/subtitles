1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,970
That pretty much concludes this class on Shopify theme development.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,385
For your class project,

3
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:08,220
I want you to create your own store and share it with

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,910
the rest of the students in the class projects section below.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,670
Of course, don't be concerned if your store is just for

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,640
practice as we're all here to learn skills.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,934
Just make sure that you either share the password or remove password protection entirely,

8
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,080
so that other students can view it.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,775
In terms of further learning,

10
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:29,580
there's a lot of information about the various aspects of

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,720
liquid and Shopify themes on the official Shopify website.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,480
Plus, you can access the Partner Academy through

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,215
your partner account by clicking on the Education link.

14
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:43,190
That being said, if you need any tips or guidance,

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,620
be sure to leave a comment in the discussion box,

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,560
and I'll do my best to point you in the right direction.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,170
Anyway, guys, thanks for watching and I hope to

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,600
see you again in some of my other courses.
