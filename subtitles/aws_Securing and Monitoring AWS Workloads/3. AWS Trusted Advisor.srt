00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,670
In this clip,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,860
we will take a detailed look at AWS Trusted Advisor and how it is different

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,240
from Amazon Inspector that we saw in the first module.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,340
If Amazon Inspector is for your EC2 instances,

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,330
AWS Trusted Advisor is for your AWS account.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,670
It offers best practice recommendations for your AWS

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,990
resources in five different categories.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,300
Enterprise and business customers can stay up to date and

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,280
get alerted of any if the latest deployments violates these

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,150
best practice recommendations.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,950
This service can also be integrated with IAM to

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,010
control access to specific checks,

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,090
and that is also a rich set of API to integrate this and

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,790
programmatically check the violations.

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,780
There are five different categories where Trusted Advisor

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,110
provides best practice recommendations.

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,340
Cost optimization, performance,

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,830
and fault tolerance are limited to enterprise and business customers.

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,930
Security and service limits are offered to all AWS customers.

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,000
Under cost optimization,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,230
AWS shows you how you can save money on various AWS resources by eliminating

22
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,640
resources that are not utilized and those that remain idle.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,060
You will see recommendations on EC2 instances that have been running less

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,390
than 10% of CPU utilizations for more than 14 days,

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,100
an Elastic Load Balancer that is not actively used,

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,400
and underutilized EBS volumes.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,080
Under the performance section,

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,810
AWS recommends various performance improvements of your service by

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,480
checking service limits and making sure you take advantage of

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,680
monitoring for overutilized resources.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,250
Some of the typical alerts are EC2 instances using more than 90%

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,060
of CPU consecutively for more than 4 days,

33
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,790
a large number of rules in your security group,

34
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,730
and overutilized EBS magnetic volumes.

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,040
Under fault tolerance,

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,630
you will see AWS recommendations to increase the

37
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,360
availability and redundancy of AWS applications.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,890
Some of the typical recommendations include enabling server access logs to

39
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,740
log the details of incoming requests to an S3 bucket,

40
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,700
which will come in handy during a security audit,

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,930
enabling the health check of auto‑scaling group,

42
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,080
and checking the distribution of EC2 instances in an availability zone to

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,440
protect your applications from a single point of failure.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,230
Service limits checks for any service usage that is

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,910
more than 80% of the service limit.

46
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,740
If you signed up for a free AWS account,

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,900
and when your resource utilization exceeded 80% threshold,

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,140
you must have received an email alert indicating this.

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,910
Some of the AWS services that are monitored by

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:20,030
Trusted Advisor are Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EBS,

51
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,080
Amazon EC2, Amazon Route 53, RDS, IAM, ELB,

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,630
VPC, and SES.

53
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,220
Some of the security recommendations offered by Trusted Advisor

54
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,430
includes checking for MFA on a root account,

55
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,070
checking unrestricted ports, S3 bucket permissions,

56
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,450
IAM usage, to name a few.

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,710
We will dive deep and take a detailed look at some of the security

58
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,210
recommendations and how to set up CloudWatch events and monitor any

59
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,910
security changes to your AWS infrastructure.

60
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,360
I just logged into AWS Admin console, and let's search for Trusted Advisor.

61
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,570
You can see the dashboard shows the five categories that we discussed before.

62
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,090
You can see all the actions that are recommended by Trusted Advisor.

63
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,010
Click on Security.

64
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,940
You can see there is a warning and an alert.

65
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,330
Let me click on the alert,

66
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,920
and you can see that MFA is not enabled from a root account and

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,040
the recommendation action suggested by AWS.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,230
Let's click on the warning,

69
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,410
and you can see the list of unrestricted ports and the

70
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:53,020
recommendation suggested by AWS, and links to additional resources.

71
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:00,010
Let me click on Service Limits, and it looks like everything looks good here.

72
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,430
Fault tolerance checks, cost optimization,

73
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,640
and performance checks are reserved for business and enterprise customers,

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,410
like we discussed before.

75
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,020
Let's quickly compare Amazon Inspector and Trusted Advisor.

76
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,640
You should be using Amazon Inspector if you need to assess your EC2

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,690
instances and the network in which it is part of.

78
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,190
Trusted Advisor is applicable for the entire AWS account and to

79
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,710
learn best practice recommendations by AWS.

80
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:41,500
Inspector needs a software agent to be installed for the assessment process,

81
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,080
whereas Trusted Advisor is pre‑built to your account,

82
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,700
and it doesn't need any additional software to be installed.

83
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,360
The first 250 assessments are free while using Inspector,

84
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,000
whereas only security checks and service limit checks are performed freely by Trusted Advisor.
