00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,040
In this clip you will see how to create CloudWatch events that

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,840
detects a state change in Trusted Advisor checks.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,520
I went ahead and took care of all the unrestricted port violations,

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,060
and in this demo you will see how to trigger a

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,290
notification if any such violations reoccur.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm going to set up a CloudWatch event and trigger an SNS

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,360
notification any time a status change occurs in the Trusted

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:37,770
Advisor. Before setting up this rule, please pay attention to the region.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,600
You need to be in Northern Virginia region.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,240
To your left, click on Rules.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,270
Under Service Name select Trusted Adviser.

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:59,600
Under Event Type choose Check Item Refresh Status.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,670
I'm going to leave the default selection on statuses.

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:11,420
You will need AWS Premium Support to select specific checks.

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,000
Choose Add target.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,180
From the dropâ€‘down, select SNS topic.

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,840
And I already have a topic set up with the name NotificationAlert,

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,640
which I'm going to select.

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,190
Click Configure details.

20
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,040
Give this rule a name.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,440
CloudWatch rules cannot have spaces in its rule name.

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,350
Click Create rule to finish creating this CloudWatch rule.

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,740
Let me log in back to Trusted Advisor console.

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,350
Choose Security from the dashboard.

25
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:59,620
Currently, there are no errors or warnings under Security Groups. I'm going

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,090
to simulate an alert by opening up unrestricted ports.

27
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,180
Let me go to EC2 console.

28
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,660
To your left, select Security Groups.

29
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,540
Let me select one of the three security groups.

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,640
Click on Edit inbound rules.

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,890
Under Type, I'm going to select All traffic,

32
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,640
which by default is going to allow all protocol and all port ranges.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,670
Click on Save rules.

34
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,140
In the same manner,

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,290
I have changed the inbound rules in the default security group and in

36
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:49,620
the other Kali Linux security group that ends in 56ab.

37
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,610
Let me go back to Trusted Advisor.

38
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,260
You can see there is an alert for Security Group sections.

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,520
Let me expand the section,

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,910
and you can see the changes that we performed in the

41
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,110
security groups are listed here.

42
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,100
You have the option of selecting the security groups

43
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,290
directly from the Trusted Advisor,

44
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,610
which will take you back to EC2 console where you can

45
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,100
modify the inbound rules again.

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,710
Now this change must have triggered an SNS notification.

47
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,240
Let's go back and validate that.

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,510
I just logged into CloudWatch console again.

49
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,620
Let me scroll down, and you can see a data point under SNS

50
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,310
dashboard for the number of notifications delivered,

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:51,000
which corresponds to an email notification that I received. And there are no data points for number of notifications failed.
