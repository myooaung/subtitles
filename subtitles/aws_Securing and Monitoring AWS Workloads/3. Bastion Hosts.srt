00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,220
Imagine a scenario where you have been told to increase the

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,580
security of the EC2 instances that are in your VPC and to

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,790
monitor all the incoming SSH connections.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,840
This is exactly where a bastion host comes to the rescue.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,230
The purpose of bastion host is to restrict the access to a

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,020
private network from an external network. Since bastion host

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,440
is exposed to external network,

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,980
this needs to be hardened well to minimize the chances

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,580
of penetration and security breach.

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,220
Let's dive deep by presenting an architecture diagram. You have

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,740
one VPC with a private and a public subnet.

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,420
Our goal is to protect the Linux instances that are in

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,220
the private subnet from external users.

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,040
In order to achieve this,

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,140
you launch a bastion host in public subnet that is exposed to the outside

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,230
world, and the Linux instances in the private subnet are accessible only

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,540
through the SSH that is coming from the bastion host.

18
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,440
You need to update the inbound traffic rules to the security group

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,230
in the private subnet to block the SSH access from all other

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:30,760
servers except the IP address of bastion host. As mentioned before,

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,460
bastion host needs to be hardened well so that it is not vulnerable

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,500
to security attacks.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:49,000
This bastion host could also be placed in a separate VPC and set up a VPC peering connection between these two VPCs as well.
