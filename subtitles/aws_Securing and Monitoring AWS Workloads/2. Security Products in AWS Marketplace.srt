1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,060
Let's log into AWS admin console and look at different AMIs in

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,240
the AWS Marketplace and launch an EC2 instance.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,640
Click on EC2.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,900
I currently have one running instance.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,480
Click on AMIs to your left.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,240
From the drop‑down, select Public images.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,100
This lists all the AMIs that are currently available and

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,440
ready to create an EC2 instance from.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,240
The search bar lets you filter the AMIs based on different attributes of AMI.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,140
Let me select Architecture as the key and choose 64‑bit as the value.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,650
Then, let me select the platform as the key,

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,970
and you have the option to choose any Linux images,

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,940
and I'm going to choose Amazon Linux.

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,240
Let me select the first image,

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,320
and you can see that the virtualization type is HVM,

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,690
and the root device type is EBS.

17
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,760
You have the option to launch an EC2 instance directly from here using

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,440
this AMI and selecting one of the machine types.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,480
Let me cancel this as I would like to explore further details about AMIs in

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:38,620
AWS Marketplace. Click on Instances, choose Launch Instance. As a quickstart,

21
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,140
AWS offers AMIs that are eligible for free tier,

22
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,520
but let's go to AWS Marketplace. Under Categories,

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,540
select Infrastructure Software.

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:59,670
Select Security This lists all AMIs that are custom‑built by third party

25
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,540
vendors with security being the primary focus area.

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,440
Let's take a look at Kali Linux,

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,280
which is free tier‑eligible. And this is a Debian‑based Linux

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,740
that is aimed at advanced penetration testing.

29
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,140
Let me select this image,

30
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,630
and you will have detailed information about this AMI, including the

31
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,740
pricing options for different tiers. Under Highlights,

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,800
you can see the standard features of this AMI. Click on View

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,600
Additional Details in AWS Marketplace. A typical, per‑hour

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,840
price is listed to your top right.

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,780
Let me click on Pricing,

36
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,440
and you need to pay special attention that pricing has two components to

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,240
it. First one is software pricing, and the other one is infrastructure

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,590
pricing. And as the infrastructure size grows up,

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,740
the cost increases as well..

40
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,120
Click on Continue to Subscribe.

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,000
After reviewing the software pricing policy, click on Accept Terms.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,010
It will take a few seconds before the subscription gets activated.

43
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:32,340
Once activation completes, you will see an effective date and expiration date.

44
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,800
Click on Continue to Configuration.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,040
Estimated software pricing information is to your right.

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,590
Select the fulfillment option, software version, and region

47
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,400
where you would like to launch this instance.

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,840
Click on Continue to Launch. Choose Usage Instructions under Configuration

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,700
Details to get a brief overview on how to connect to the instance and some

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,840
additional information if you are planning to perform penetration testing.

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,420
Select the drop‑down under Choose Actions, and you have multiple options

52
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:21,630
to launch this instance. I'm going to choose Launch through EC2. Click on

53
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:31,840
Launch, and you'll be taken to EC2 console. Click on Review and Launch.

54
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm going to accept all the default values.

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,710
Click Launch.

56
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:47,640
Select the acknowledgement and choose Launch Instances.

57
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,100
Click on View Instances to see the instance that we just launched. Under

58
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,640
Description, you can see the public IP, the security groups, and the inbound

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,410
and outbound rules. To explain the pricing a little bit more in detail, I

60
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,940
just logged into AWS Marketplace again.

61
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,300
This time, I'm going to choose Machine Learning under Categories.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,870
Select ML Solutions.

63
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,240
Let me select the Deep Learning Notebook that was free tier‑eligible.

64
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,040
Click on View Additional Details.

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,200
You can see that this comes ready with plenty of software that are

66
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,540
required for a typical machine learning modelling process.

67
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:47,040
This AMI has pricing both for software and infrastructure.

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,410
When you are calculating the total cost,

69
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,180
you need to keep in mind to include both the cost and not

70
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,180
just the infrastructure cost alone. Again,

71
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:06,000
as we saw before, the infrastructure price goes up as we move to a larger infrastructure.
