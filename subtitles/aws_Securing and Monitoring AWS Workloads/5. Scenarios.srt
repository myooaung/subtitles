Before we wrap up this course,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,340
let's quickly look at two different scenarios that will help you gauge how well

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,340
you understood the concepts that you learned in this module.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,740
Here is our first scenario.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,040
Steve is a security architect of Globomantics Corporation.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,090
He was approached by his boss because he just learned that some of the EC2

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,850
instances has ports that can be accessed from the internet.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,880
Steve has been asked to run a vulnerability test to make sure all the

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,720
restricted ports are secure. Which rule packages must he include as part of

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,830
his security assessment? Let's look at a second scenario.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,170
Andrew is a security engineer with Globomantics. He has been assigned to a

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,440
new project team where he needs to create user accounts and enforce strict

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,040
password policies that the user needs to adhere to.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,430
It has been a month after he has set up the user accounts,

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,640
and he wants to make sure that the password policies has been strictly followed.

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,020
Which rules package he must include during his assessment

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:22,000
process? Try to come up with your recommendations, and we will review these scenarios in the next clip.
