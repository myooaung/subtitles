00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.840
Welcome to this module on Security Monitoring and Alerting in AWS.

2
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.760
In the first clip,

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.930
we will take a look at AWS Config and understand key

4
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.530
terminologies used in the service.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.090
Before diving deep, let me draw on an analogy.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.690
If you have used Microsoft Word in preparing a document and requested

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.820
your manager or your director for his review comments,

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.740
you would turn on Track change feature in MS Word.

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.360
Once this feature is turned on, any additions,

10
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.930
deletions,

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.240
or review comments are tracked and have a nice history and see

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.710
how the document evolved over a period of time.

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.740
The AWS Config does a lot more from a tracking standpoint,

14
00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:03.140
but the Track change feature for MS Word is AWS Config for your AWS account.

15
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.340
Let's see some of the features and benefits of AWS Config.

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.240
It provides a snapshot of your current AWS resources configuration.

17
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.750
Some of the AWS resources that are supported by AWS Config include EC2,

18
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.720
EBS, security groups, VPC, on so on.

19
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.210
As your configuration changes over a period of time,

20
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.110
AWS Config keeps track of all the changes and maintains an audit trail.

21
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.240
And AWS Config has a nice feature to push SMS

22
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.140
notifications to notify you of any changes.

23
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.780
By setting config rules,

24
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.600
you can run periodic checks and make sure that your AWS resource and its

25
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.190
configurations do not fall out of security compliance. Along with

26
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.480
maintaining the configuration, it also maintains a relationship between

27
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.030
AWS resources, and you can monitor and track the changes as changes

28
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.010
happen to each one of them.

29
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.240
Let's quickly get acquainted to some of the AWS Config terminologies.

30
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.260
Configuration items. For each resource that is part of your AWS account,

31
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.740
configuration items represent the attributes of a specific resource at a

32
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.190
point in time. Configuration history.

33
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.780
It is a collection of configuration items for the given

34
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.110
resource for a given period of time.

35
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.340
For example, if Amazon S3 happens to be one of your resources,

36
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.950
every time an S3 bucket gets created, modified, and deleted, a

37
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.960
new configuration item will be created, and the collection of

38
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.820
all these items will represent the history of that AWS resource.

39
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.910
Configuration recorder.

40
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.220
The configuration recorder records the configuration of all the AWS resources

41
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.940
in your account. This can be fine tuned in the Settings section by choosing

42
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.110
to record all the resources or only a selected few resources. Configuration

43
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.210
snapshot represents a collection of configuration items for the resources

44
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.620
that exist in your account.

45
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.690
A configuration stream is a list of all the configuration items that are

46
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.290
automatically updated every time a change happens to a resource.

47
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:51.000
Configuration stream can publish a notification to the SNS, and you can keep track of changes and identify any potential problems.
