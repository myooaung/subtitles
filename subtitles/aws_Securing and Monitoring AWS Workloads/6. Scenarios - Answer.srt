00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,210
Let's review both the scenarios in this clip. In the first scenario,

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,980
you were asked to identify the rule packages that Steve

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,130
must use in his security assessment.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,810
In this case,

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,810
the key phrase is restricted ports, and you need to use the

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,940
rules in network reachability package to analyze your network

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,140
for access to restricted ports.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,510
In the second scenario,

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,900
you are asked to identify the rules that Andrew needs to use in his

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,680
assessment, and the key phrase here is password policies.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
In this case,

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,350
you need to use the rules from security best practices

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,900
in your vulnerability assessments.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,710
Congratulations on completing this course! Coming out of this

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,810
course, you should have a firm understanding of using

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,210
hardened AMI in your EC2 instances,

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,460
use AWS Systems Manager to open Session and Run Commands, use AWS

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,970
Trusted Advisor to identify and assess security concerns in your AWS

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,160
account, use AWS Config to monitor nonâ€‘complaint and unsecure

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,310
resources, install unified CloudWatch agent on an EC2 instance and

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:32,000
collect logs, and finally, create assessment runs in Amazon Inspector and find system vulnerabilities.
