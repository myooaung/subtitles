00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
in this video,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.990
we're going to create a quick project which uses J Unit using them.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.220
Evan,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.000
Quick start archetype in Intelligent idea On In this way,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.930
we'll have a nice project which we can use to play around with and demonstrate your unit in

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.650
future videos.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.790
So let's get started.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.150
It's the first off.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.850
Just go into idea.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.330
So I'm using intelligent idea as the idea for this demo you might be using Eclipse or

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.920
another I d.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.950
Such as net beans or something That's fine,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.010
Doesn't really matter.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.780
And we just want to get a feel for how j and it works and get a bit of a refresher together

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.780
.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.820
So first thing I'm gonna do is create a project which we can use to demonstrate Gene and it

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.090
in.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.350
So I got to create new project here,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.620
and I'm gonna choose to create American Project on If I just hit next year,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.340
then what's gonna happen is it's gonna use the mirror and quick starts archetype to create

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.990
the project,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.390
which means it'll just create a basic hello world kind of project for us,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.750
which we can use to walk through J and it with so just hit next year.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:02.210
The group I d just put a nice simple group I d fortified,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.680
tidy,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.150
have a nice and simple When we're just gonna use my app tonight for hit next.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.940
Then we could see it's gonna create the project,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.540
my app,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.060
and it's gonna create it on my desktop and that's fighting.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.150
So if I hit finish here,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.260
you could see very quickly,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.710
created the project on my desktop and then immediately opened it.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.880
So I'm just gonna first of all before I do anything,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.540
I'm gonna just select this option down here which is enable auto import on what that does.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.540
That basically ensures that the dependence is which I include in the Pond XML file.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.610
Those dependence is air immediately reflected in intelligent ideas,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.150
class path.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.890
So what I mean by that is,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.180
if I open up my app,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.570
then you see this external libraries section here.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.720
If I open that,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870
you'll see there's nothing in here currently apart from the J.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.010
D.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.350
K.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.090
However,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.590
to include J unit when I add it to the conduct smell far here by adding a dependency which

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.360
will do in a second,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.910
you'll see that this external library section here.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.630
Will that include the Children at library and also the ham crest?

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.630
Likely to which Jay And it happens to bring in a transitive dependency in other words,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.650
the dependency which June itself needs to be able to operate.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.370
So if I just hit command and to generate dependency just like that here and type J Unit and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.360
I go down to this one here and this is actually showing me a filtered view of all the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.480
mayhem repositories that I've chosen to index on my install of intelligent idea at the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.200
various versions that those repositories have,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720
I'm happy with version for that one,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.050
too.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.350
So if I just click add,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.880
you can see it's added that dependency.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.530
And it's also immediately added it here as well,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.990
its on E.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.230
J unit itself,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.570
on also of the hand Chris Libra,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.740
which June it depends on.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.280
So it's been a bit of a space here,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.840
keep things nice and tidy.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.010
So at this stage we now have a project which is set up to use J on it,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.410
and we'll see how we could do that in the next videos
