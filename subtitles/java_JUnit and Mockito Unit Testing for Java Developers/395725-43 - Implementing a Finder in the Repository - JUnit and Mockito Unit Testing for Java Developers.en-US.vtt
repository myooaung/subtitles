00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
So in this video,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.730
we're just gonna flesh out the use of repository class on the user demand object.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.390
Just so we've got a bit of better test data to work with,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.610
you know,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.250
production code.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.620
So if I go to you the use of repository class,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.040
we can see here we've got four uses that we're going to return in the complete set of users

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.040
.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.630
If I had a method that would do that So I said this method in now,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.750
so they just say public,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.610
least of user find all on this is basic.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.660
It is gonna return all the uses that we having.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:47.250
This kind of fake database return uses don't values and put those into a new It's a linked

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.600
list.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.530
So I never call,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.420
find all it's gonna turn all the users.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.540
So that's gonna left now for the use repository and use the domain class.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.510
So let's move on
