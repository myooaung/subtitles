00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
Another aspect as well,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.560
by the way,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.450
is the fact that when you have an assertion,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.260
if you look at the parameter types that in general you have to of learning methods,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.600
you have the method,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.020
which takes the parameters for the assertion itself.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.150
And you also have the same parameter list,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.700
but with an additional message parameter at the front,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.960
which enables you to write something descriptive when the A social fails.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.490
So,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.030
for example,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.150
here I could put in the message.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.650
10 always equals 10.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.340
That's a terrible message,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.750
but you get the idea.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.900
And then when I run,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.360
you can see here that it's also printed that out as well.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.510
10 always equals Tim,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.390
so that's how we could have descriptions to our assertions and unit tests.
