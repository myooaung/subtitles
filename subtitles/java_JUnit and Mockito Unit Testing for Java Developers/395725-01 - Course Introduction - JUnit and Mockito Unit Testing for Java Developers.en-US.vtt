00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
Let's take a quick look now and see what's covered in the cost and how it's structured.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.430
So the first section is really all about covering some foundational theory in this section

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.430
.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.180
We're going to learn about the core best practices,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.300
which we applied to unit tests on Get a foundation of some fundamental concepts we need to

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.460
have in mind to be able to fight them effectively.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.430
Once we've got that under our belts,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.190
we're going to get up and running so that we can actually use Jane it.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.850
So here we'll see how to create a Java project,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.740
which uses J on it with evident griddle.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.960
Then we're going to have a walk through of the project structure,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.990
so we understand what's in there and know where to put our tests.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.320
And then we'll discover some coding conventions we need to use going forwards.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.330
The next section is all about learning.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.100
Julian itself will cover the men German it concepts and show how they're used in context as

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.500
we write some simple test code.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.370
Don't worry,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.470
it's going to be super easy to understand as we show things in context and you'll be able

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.190
to return the concepts in your head that way.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.400
Finally,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.880
we'll look at some advanced concepts.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.570
This includes a look at Hand Crest,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.230
which is a powerful assertions library,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.700
which comes shipped with Jay Minutes.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.840
We'll also have an introduction to the concept of mock objects and mocking in unit tests

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.890
using Makita,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.810
the number one library for this in Java.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.960
And they will wrap up with a look at code coverage,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.790
since this is uses the popular metric in development projects that shows as well.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.050
We have gaps in our testing,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.820
Ongoing says,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.520
where we need to add more unit tests.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.030
The courses get absolute beginners in June and unit testing,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.490
although if you've had some experience of J and it before.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.500
But it's still not sure of things like how to write in structure unit tests,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.720
how a surgeons working,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.550
how to write them,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.420
mocking and mark objects on how that works etcetera.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.160
Then this is also a great course for you.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160
Anyway,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.320
that's the other view of the course,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.490
so let's get started
