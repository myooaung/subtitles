00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.530
so getting back to the code we were looking at before we configured the maven,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.340
compile a plug in.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.990
Let's just do a quick bit of tidy up.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.550
I should say we do a stream here.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.870
Then it feels her and they don't collect.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.780
To me,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.870
that's more kind of readable here as the best practice because we ended with this is the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.350
method which is being executed in the data to get all the users.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.950
This is telling us that we using the job extremes FBI to do some slicing and dicing of data

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.360
then basically would have each intermediate operation underneath that on its online.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.950
,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.600
So we can very clearly see how that pipelines being executed in this case is just doing a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.460
filter operation to,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.790
say,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.480
filter out users that alive on a regular users.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.340
And then finally,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.450
we have the turmoil operation,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.060
which in this case is a collect to collect those elements into a set.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.450
So when this method here is executed,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.920
this get regular users expect that we get a set containing these three uses here because

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.470
they regular uses as we can see.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.950
Let's do a similar thing before the admin users,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:18.150
so Gantman uses sitting kind of thing.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.170
It's just this I'm in user.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.070
So that's nice from a functional perspective,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.300
since we've now got two methods to be able to return a different types of users that we

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.050
have in the system.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.840
But we can go further with this,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.050
which will do in the next videos.
