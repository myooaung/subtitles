00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
in this video,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.230
we're going to explore how we can actually use the range actor certain.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.390
And we're gonna actually write some test code in that form.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.370
A set of the words were writing our first test case,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.380
especially now,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.550
and see how we could do that together.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.540
No.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.590
If I want to stick to my arrange actor serve,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:27.490
I might say that a equals 10 equals 20 results.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:45.850
Equals calculates a toe ad a B on my session might be so equals.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.750
I expected to be 30.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.950
I can pass in the actual result here.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.360
Notice that I can use the static import there as well.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.190
And just type of so equals directly without having to prefix with a certain dot There are

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.000
on this now that should pass.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.850
That's all well and good.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.430
It's a great Now we know how to use a range actor.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.740
Sir,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.650
you should be able to write test like this,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.450
going forwards
