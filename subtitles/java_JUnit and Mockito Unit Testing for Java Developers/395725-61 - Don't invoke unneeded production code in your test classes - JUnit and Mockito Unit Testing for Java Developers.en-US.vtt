00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
So that's that's now with Ham Christ,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.640
it's getting better.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.450
It's looking good.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.250
However,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.160
it's still not perfect and it could be improved.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.670
And the reason is because here we're actually invoking a production method.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.350
And as we know,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.640
whenever we invoke methods which we've created,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.060
then there's scope for books and only that as well.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.130
You're losing that kind of scientific quality,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.910
which you have in unit tests.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.160
We just involve one thing,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.430
which is the method of testing and change different parts around it,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.540
and observed what the effect is if you have multiple methods from the same thing.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.280
So multiple methods from the production class which is being tested,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.380
did you get extra things that could go wrong So you don't have this kind of scientific

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.050
quality and you kind of sacrifice that just for the sake of convenience,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.370
which is not a good road to go down.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.470
So rather than rely on the logic off,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.610
create regular user.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.260
When we're constructing the objects that is gonna do its expectations against.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.890
Instead of doing that,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.220
we can do a different thing,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.080
and we can compose properties that were expecting and we'll see how to do that in the next

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.410
