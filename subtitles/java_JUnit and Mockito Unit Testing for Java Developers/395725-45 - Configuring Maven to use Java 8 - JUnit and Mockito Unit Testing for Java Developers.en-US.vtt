00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
So we're still in the last video that we could quickly configure.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.750
Intelligent idea to use Jedi Kate within the idea itself.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.140
A better way to do this star rather than setting an intelligent idea directly,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.400
is to go to the prom,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.310
the XML file,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.210
and sit in heaven itself.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.790
In other words,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.890
in the palm model itself.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.040
So to do this,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.100
we just need to configure the compiler plug in.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.260
So you can do this.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.780
If you have a build section in the poem file,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:36.270
then within here you can configure the different plug ins that used plug in section I'm

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.400
here.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.030
We can configure an individual plug in,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.630
plug in.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.070
I'm gonna come.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.250
Figure has a group I d off Apache dmelvin doc plug ins.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.730
This is basically where all the default out of the box Melvin plug ins reside.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.630
That's the group I do.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.720
You,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.020
for those the artifact tidy is the may have been compiling plug in and you can see here

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.140
ideas giving us all the artifacts that live within that group party,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.150
which is very useful.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:09.760
So having compatible kidneys to compile a one version 361 and then finally we can put in a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.990
configuration block.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.990
And this is really the reason why we've done this because within here wouldn't give direct

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.330
property values to the compiler.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.720
Plug in itself on the properties,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.220
we're going to use a source 1.8.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.260
This means that you will accept one point needs level source code.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.570
So the words we can use all the job eight new features like streams and then target off the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
same to this defines basically what the outputs gonna be.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.530
Another was the bite could,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.130
so the 1st 1 the source property,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.680
defines the level for the source Good on the 2nd 1 The target one defines the level for the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.350
actual bite,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.480
Code says,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.660
in the way of being able to do that.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.360
And to be honest,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.110
it's a much better way than configuring it by hand in the idea itself.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.840
Because number one it makes things portable.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.950
Since you don't normally check in the configuration files for an I.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.340
D.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.620
So,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.040
for example,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.750
you should never normally see adult idea for all the checked into a project in the case of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.340
idea or dot class path and DOT project file.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.350
In the case of Eclipse,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.060
so should always be generated by the I.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.360
D.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.070
When you important project into the idea itself,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.020
says the first reason on the second reason is that then makes it possible from a build

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.100
perspective as well.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.900
So in other words,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.920
when I build within the I D,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.130
or when I build the command line in the same Julie K level,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.380
settings are gonna take effect.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.450
That's the reason for that.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.340
Anyway,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.360
now that we've done that,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.790
we know we've got portable builds.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.660
We could move on.
