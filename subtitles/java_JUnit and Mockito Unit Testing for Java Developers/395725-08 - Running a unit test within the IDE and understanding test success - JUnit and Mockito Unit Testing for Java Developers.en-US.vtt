00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
So now with mark to protest was being testable with that test annotation in this video,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.820
we're going to see how we can run it in the I d.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.150
So you can see what test success actually looks like.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.450
So let's jump in now and pick up where we left off.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.850
So click that and you can see here.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.920
This is the test class.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.950
These are the test methods which were found in that class.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.360
Because we have these ticks here,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.790
it means that all of the test methods which were included in the test class have passed.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.400
In other words,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.720
they didn't fail on if all of those test methods,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.130
if you imagine if we had a lot of different test methods here,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.700
if all of those test methods passed on in term,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.250
the test class itself is deemed to have passed.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.760
You can also see this.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.680
Here is what's his test passed Once has passed out of a total of one tests.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.490
It took one millisecond.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.290
So that's the at test annotation,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.340
which jamon it provides,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.620
which marks methods in the test class as being actual test methods which will appear in

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.850
this test runner output because they've been marked for inclusion as test methods within

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.580
the test class.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.880
So we've unit tests.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.180
Whenever you see something that's green,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.520
that's generally a good thing.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.620
It means green is good.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.690
Good for Go green for girl or good,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.880
the tests have passed,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.980
so it's always a good thing.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.360
That's what test success looks like we've seen in this video.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.990
So the next video we're going to explore what test failure looks like coming up next.
