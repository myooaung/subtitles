00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
So now we've made that curd quite nicer there.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.080
As a developer,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.640
I feel kind of guilty that we've put in an authentication service.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.090
So let's see what we're gonna do initially.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.710
And let's just break it out into a separate use of service.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.970
Let's call that use.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.350
Ah,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.410
look up service.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.380
I don't know whatever it might be anyway,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.150
and then we'll take these methods here.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.450
Strip those out,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.850
put them in here,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.250
and then we need to use a repository to go as well,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.040
the authentications that the authentication service still needs.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.710
Use repository.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.070
Of course,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.240
it was to leave that in place,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.160
but we just copy across this reference here,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.390
sir,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.820
to use a look upset.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.860
We can use it as well can then go back to authentication service tightly imports you can

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.020
see.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.910
Now it's removed to imports.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.350
That's why it's good practice to get into,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.230
even though we couldn't see that because of the ellipses here,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.950
the $3.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.000
It's still not just to get into that practice and now in user look up service,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.150
we have these of the code.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.510
Let's run all the tests again to make sure we're OK yet no regression be introduced.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.080
That's fine,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.310
so we'll get to go
