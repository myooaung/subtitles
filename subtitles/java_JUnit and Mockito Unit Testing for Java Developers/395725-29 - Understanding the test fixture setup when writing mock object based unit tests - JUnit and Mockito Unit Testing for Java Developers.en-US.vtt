00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
no again.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.850
Another quick point,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.450
which would cut it before.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.450
Is it going to looking controller?

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.330
This one object,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.420
it was one class here Logging controller has a reference to its other classy authentication

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.950
service,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.160
which means in the test for that we have the same object seeing so long in controller on

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.800
authentication service know that we don't have the use repository.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.130
And that's because the use repository has nothing to do with logging controller.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.750
So there is no instance of user repository here.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.250
That's why we don't have it.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.980
However,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.200
if we were testing authentication service that I'd be a different story,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.150
you could imagine having a test for authentication service,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.370
where you set up the authentication service instance itself in the test fixture and then

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.740
this time have a mock off the user repository object in its test fixture.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.680
Then we'll see the in the next video when we called up the test for the authentication

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.090
service,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.530
but I just wanted to point out how you can identify which objects your test pictures need

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.930
when you want in your unit tests.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.540
Anyway,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.330
let's come on now,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.250
concurred up the authentication service test
