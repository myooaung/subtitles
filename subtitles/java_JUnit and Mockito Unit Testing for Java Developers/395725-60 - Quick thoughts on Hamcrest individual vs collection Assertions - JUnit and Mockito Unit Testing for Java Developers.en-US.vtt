00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Now,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.960
at this point,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.050
we don't need this anymore.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.450
So this code we had here before,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.730
we don't need and you can see that all the different assertions we had to do here after we

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.380
retrieve the individual element,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.450
we had to repeat these gets each time we had to repeat them.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.790
So it is kind of like a copy pissed kind of thing,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.440
which is not good.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.650
Whereas the ham Crist one is very readable on it really compresses it down to just the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.750
essence of what we're trying to test fall simply these,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.250
and we'll get to go.
