00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
in this video,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.200
we're gonna write some very basic production card to weaken my unit test for on start

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.190
cutting the unit test itself by introducing you to the at test annotation.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.550
It's less jumping.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.580
Let's go back into calculated test.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.310
So currently.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.510
Now,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.700
if I right click this,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.610
if I go up here and right click,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.370
then you see I can't do anything with it.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.560
There's no run menu,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.500
which I can use,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920
which would enable me to run it as a unit test.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.000
So to fix that,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.620
what I need to dio is to put in a test method public void because it doesn't return

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.110
anything test.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.160
It's not going to take anything either.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.450
So that's going to be empty.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.380
Another different ways of being able to name your test methods,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.780
and we'll cover that in the letter unit.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.360
But for now,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.960
we're just going with an arbitrary convention of taking the method.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.220
We're testing the method name there,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.810
which is add,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.300
because we have in here a calculator,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.930
add method.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.590
You can see I'm just pre fixing it with the word test.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.320
So to make it a test,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.290
J unit gives us these annotations,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.630
which we can use as part of its FBI on one of the annotations.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.030
Probably the most important annotation is the AWG dodgy,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.430
and it don't test sanitation.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.780
So if I just do at test here from or Gadot unit and ends up in Cebu imported it there,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.550
Which means that now,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.550
if I right click,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.230
you can see we have this new option here,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.340
which is running calculated.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.850
Test has now recognized that test case due to the fact that we put the ad to test

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.500
annotation on it.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.420
So now we have a test to run on some production code we can actually test.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.170
Let's see how we can do that in the next video.
