00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
in this video,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.570
we're going to explore a really good way to structure those unit test methods which you

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.890
write,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.810
and that's with so called arrange act assert paradigm.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.450
Let's have a look at this now together.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.220
So where assertions air useful in general or at the end of a test.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.750
So this kind of brings us on to the structure of tests.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.530
So tests in general are structured into what's known as a triple A formula on that sends

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.990
for arrange act in a certain So.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.640
For example,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.050
if we just put the comments here,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.650
arrange act,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.720
that s so This is better than the former that your tests should be taking.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.290
So unit test in general will be split into three sections within the test method.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.590
But we've got arrange section,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.850
and that's basically where we're doing.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.690
Any set up,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.600
which we need to do,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.390
is so that's creating objects.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.920
The system on the test might need,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.960
setting any data that we need,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
setting up any marks on mark objects with any stubbed behavior,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.900
canned answers that we want to return,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.640
join the test,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.630
those kinds of things.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.250
That's the arrange section of the unit test,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.490
then in the act section.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.410
We generally just have one line here,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.560
and that's basically the method that's being tested.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.720
Its summit had been invoked with whatever test input we wanted to run with for this test.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.810
And then after that one method call to the system under test.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.280
We have this assert section,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.730
and this is basically gonna be a few assertions using that Jamie assertions AP,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.650
which we've just seen,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.980
usually in conjunction with a much a LIBRA like ham.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.450
Crist.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.370
You're gonna have those assertions which effectively together check the state of the world

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.590
after the methods being executed with the test input that it was supplied.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.040
So,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.260
yeah,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.140
three sections arrange act,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.480
assert I would remember Tripoli arrange actor,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.750
sir,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.950
and sometimes as well.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.530
By the way,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.030
arrange actor sir can be thought of as given when then,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.690
which is popular in be D D methodology.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.330
That's behaviour driven development.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.850
So you might see this being used as well.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.010
But for now was an implementer A developer of the unit tests.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.780
If you stick to arrange actor sir,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.920
I always have that in your mind.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.080
When you're writing your tests,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.430
then that should give you a good template you can use the structure.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.650
Those tests when you're cranking out those test cases.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.590
Yeah.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.330
Arrange actor,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.600
sir.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.150
Always better in mind and stick to it all the time.
