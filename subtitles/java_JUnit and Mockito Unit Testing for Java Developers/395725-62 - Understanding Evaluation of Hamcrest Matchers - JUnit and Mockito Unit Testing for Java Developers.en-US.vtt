00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
so I cannot replace these to Machu expressions.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.330
So just to take a review in the assert that method here we could see what it takes the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.170
actual collection we're gonna inspect,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.660
and then we're passing in a match.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.920
Er on this mattress contains in any order which in turn also takes a series of matches and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.290
evaluates each muncher and ensures that they both evaluates to true.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.550
But they can evaluate to true in any order.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.420
So what I've used here in this expression is ever used the equal to match and more equal to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.850
does.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.490
If we click into this because he delegates,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.420
one is equal to equal to method.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.810
And when it evaluates the matter,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.950
which is basically this matches method here,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.850
if we drilling to this are equal method,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.850
this is the actual logic of that match of their which pretty much is either comparing the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.570
actual and the expected objects by an array comparison.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.800
If they happen to be raised for the more likely cases,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.820
they're actually objects,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.740
and you can see it's physically just invoking this dot equals method.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.770
So the standard equals method from Java that lund object so to go back out Twitter before

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.050
we now know that the equal to matchup is better.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.680
You're going to use a Java equals comparison with this object here and evaluated against

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.500
objects in this set of objects here on the same thing for this one too.
