00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] So now it's time to dig into the lifecycle

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.003
as a whole by starting with an overview.

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:10.001
There are three primary phases of the Spring lifecycle,

4
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.007
and we're going to spend most of our time

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.002
talking about the first.

6
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.008
That first is the initialization phase,

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.006
and it by far is the most complex

8
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.009
and quite frankly the most interesting

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.004
of all of the lifecycle elements.

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.001
While in reality it is one of the shortest phases

11
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.006
in chronological time of the three,

12
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.000
it is really where we can impact

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.002
the behavior of our application the most.

14
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.001
The next phase is the use phase.

15
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.007
The largest majority of time

16
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.004
is actually spent in this phase,

17
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:43.008
but most of the interaction

18
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:48.006
with the Spring IOC container here is behind-the-scenes.

19
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.005
You may be using abstractions from Spring,

20
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.000
but during the use phase most of the work with the framework

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.006
is through proxies applied

22
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.007
during the previous or initialization phase.

23
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:02.005
And the final phase is the destruction phase

24
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.001
which of course occurs

25
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.004
when the ApplicationContext starts to close

26
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.008
by the calling of the close method on it.

27
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.003
Now again, we're going to spend most of our time

28
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.007
talking about the initialization phase,

29
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.003
so let's take a look at it from a high level now.

30
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.004
The initialization phase begins

31
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:23.003
when the ApplicationContext itself is created.

32
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:26.003
This can be done as in our example manually

33
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:30.002
or via runtime like an application server.

34
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.003
It is further broken down into two phases.

35
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:36.005
The setup of the bean factory via its initializations

36
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.005
is the first part.

37
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.007
The second is the bean initialization itself

38
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:45.001
and instantiation phase where your bean objects

39
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:49.005
are actually created and then managed by the framework.

40
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.002
So we're going to take a look at this phase

41
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.008
as an overview level.

42
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.004
So what you'll see is we have these first two parts

43
00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:58.004
which are the loading of the bean definitions.

44
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.003
So this is when the bean factory itself is created

45
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:04.003
and all of our components come in.

46
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:08.009
Then we go through each bean in the bean factory in order,

47
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.000
we instantiate the bean, we call the setters on the bean,

48
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.004
and then we do some processing.

49
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.002
And we're going to talk about each of these in more depth.

50
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.005
And after all of this is done,

51
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.005
our application is ready to use.

52
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.006
So let's jump into that first part

53
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:25.000
of the initialization phase.
