00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.002
- [Instructor] So now it's time for a challenge exercise

3
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.005
and you're going to get to write your own aspect.

4
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's take a look at the challenge as a whole.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So what I want you to do is create a counter,

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.009
and that counter will count all method calls

7
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.008
so all calls to an individual method.

8
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.002
I want you to report on them by method name

9
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.007
and then apply the counter at method level,

10
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.001
and you can apply it to any number of methods you pick,

11
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.006
one of your methods, all of your methods,

12
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:34.009
that's totally up to you,

13
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.003
but what I want you to do is make sure that you're counting

14
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.001
each time the method is called in the application

15
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.002
and then report it,

16
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:46.003
so name, colon, number of times it's been called,

17
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:50.000
and continually output that every time it's called.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Give you a few minutes, and I'll be back with you.
