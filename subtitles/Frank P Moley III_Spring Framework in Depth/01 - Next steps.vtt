00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Frank] Now that we have gone through

2
00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:02.008
the framework in depth,

3
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.001
we are ready for some next steps,

4
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.006
but let's look at where we have been first.

5
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:09.006
As we begin our review,

6
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.002
we talked about the inversion of control container

7
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.002
and what it means to the Spring framework.

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.001
We then discussed configuring

9
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.006
the application context using Java.

10
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.005
We then diverged from the Java

11
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.005
and talked about component scanning

12
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.006
and using that, especially with simpler classes,

13
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.008
to configure our application context

14
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.006
in order for inversion of control to work.

15
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.000
We then spent a significant amount of time

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.006
talking about the Spring Bean lifecycle,

17
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:43.003
a very important concept on your Spring journey,

18
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:44.009
so that you can understand,

19
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.007
not only how the framework works,

20
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.008
but how to extend that knowledge into other aspects

21
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:54.004
of either contributing or building better applications.

22
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.003
And finally, we walked through the all-powerful

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.004
aspecting in Spring.

24
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.000
So, where do you go next?

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.007
Certification should probably be one of the first things

26
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.001
that you think of.

27
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.003
If you take a look at my

28
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:10.008
Learning Spring with Spring Boot course and this course,

29
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.006
you essentially have about 80 to 85%

30
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:18.006
of all the material covered in the Spring training guide.

31
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.005
So I would highly recommend you go through

32
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.008
that training guide and build your knowledge

33
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:26.002
around all of those topics and go get certified.

34
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.002
You also should take a little bit of time

35
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:31.003
and look at a real world aspecting example,

36
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.000
maybe in a side project you're doing

37
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.003
or maybe in real production code,

38
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.006
and see if you can't implement an aspect

39
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.009
using what you've learned here.

40
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.006
Then, I would take a look at a running application

41
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.005
and see if there's some use cases

42
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.001
where you can inject into the lifecycle

43
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.003
some behavior that you're currently doing in another way.

44
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.003
And as always, continue learning.

45
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.006
Everything in Spring is constantly changing,

46
00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.004
as well as the rest of software engineering.

47
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:00.005
So the more you learn,

48
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.000
the better you'll be prepared for tomorrow.

49
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.003
I want to take a final moment here to thank you.

50
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:08.007
I want to thank you especially for your time.

51
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:11.002
My commitment to you doesn't end here,

52
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:15.006
but I know that your time commitment is significantly more.

53
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.001
I do encourage you to reach out to me,

54
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.009
either through the Q and A section here

55
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.005
or on various social media platforms like Twitter,

56
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.003
GitHub, or Stack Overflow,

57
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:27.005
where my handle is @fpmoles.

58
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.003
If you have any questions, comments,

59
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.003
or want some clarification around anything

60
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:33.008
in the Spring world,

61
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.005
whether it's in one of my courses or not.

62
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.001
Again, I definitely appreciate your time

63
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.000
and enjoy your learning journey with Spring.
