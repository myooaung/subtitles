00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] Before we kick off our learning

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.008
of the Spring framework in depth,

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.001
there are a few things that you need to know

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.004
and have set up on your machine.

5
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.003
The spring framework itself is written in Java

6
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.000
and was designed for the JBM.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.007
We'll be using Java as our development language

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:22.000
in this course. We'll be running Java 11.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.004
Now, you need to have the JDK installed

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.008
for development in Java, not just a JRE.

11
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.007
Make sure your installation on your machine

12
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.002
is a JDK.

13
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.001
It can be either OpenJDK or Oracle JDK,

14
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.002
as long as it's a Java development kit.

15
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.007
Both sources have very good instructions on

16
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.008
downloading and installing the JDK

17
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.004
on your machine and I suggest you follow

18
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.008
the directions for your operating system.

19
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.005
You will need to have some basic understanding

20
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.004
of the Java language.

21
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.008
I won't be using any of the

22
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.005
more advanced language constructs, but you need

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.002
to be able to understand the Java code quickly

24
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.009
to be successful.

25
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.001
I'm not focusing any time on Java.

26
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.002
You also should have a good IDE

27
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.008
that you're comfortable with. I personally am

28
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:11.009
going to use IntelliJ Ultimate Edition

29
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.004
for my development.

30
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.001
I use these tools every day,

31
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.006
so I'm most comfortable with them.

32
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.005
You definitely don't need to use a paid-for IDE

33
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.009
to be successful in this course.

34
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.009
Many of the actions I'm going to use in my IDE

35
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.008
exist in all of the other IDEs natively

36
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.004
or through plug-ins,

37
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.004
including all of the free versions.

38
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.009
Just understand how to use your IDE, that is

39
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.003
the most important aspect.

40
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.005
We will also be using Maven

41
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.003
for dependency management, but we won't really

42
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.006
focus on it very much at all.

43
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.006
Just ensure either you have Maven installed

44
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:54.002
on your machine, or have it as part of your IDE.

45
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.001
Maven provides excellent documentation

46
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.009
of each operating system and the installation

47
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.000
to either package managers or natively.

48
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, there is a little bit of

49
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.008
prerequisite knowledge that you will need

50
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.003
to be successful in this course.

51
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:10.009
The first one is just some

52
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.006
basic Spring knowledge.

53
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.004
You don't need to be an expert, but some

54
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.000
understanding of the framework

55
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.002
and its utilization will help you

56
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.004
grasp the deeper constructs

57
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:24.008
on how the framework itself operates.

58
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.009
I have a course on LinkedIn Learning, called

59
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.002
'Learning Spring with Spring Boot',

60
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.008
that should give you a good jumpstart.

61
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.009
As previously mentioned, you should know Java.

62
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.009
Now, Spring can be used with other JVM languages,

63
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.008
like Kotlin, for instance.

64
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.005
But, in this course, we're going to use Java.

65
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.000
If you need a refresher on that,

66
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
there are several good courses in the

67
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.007
LinkedIn Learning library on Java as a language.

68
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.009
You should also understand the basics of Maven,

69
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.003
just so you can grasp the dependency management

70
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:58.009
that we will be leveraging with our work.

71
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.007
If you want a refresher on Maven, I have a course

72
00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:03.000
on that topic as well

73
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.007
in the LinkedIn Learning library.

74
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.009
Finally, we'll be talking about aspecting

75
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.005
and aspect-oriented programming.

76
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:11.007
It would be good for you to have

77
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:15.003
an understanding of the conceptual level of AOP

78
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:17.005
before we get too deep into how the

79
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:20.005
framework itself operates, as it's critical

80
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.009
to the operation of Spring and we're going to

81
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.008
extend that as well.

82
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:26.003
So just some basic understanding that you can get

83
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:28.001
from reading on the web.

84
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.009
And that's about it, so let's get ready

85
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.000
to jump into Spring in depth.
