00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Narrator] Sometimes declaring multiple Beans

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.003
to express profiles isn't ideal.

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.004
In addition, sometimes you want to look

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.009
different files from the class path

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.004
based on some value or environment variable.

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.003
Sometimes you just want to enter complex

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:21.002
expressions to define things in your configuration.

8
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:25.009
Enter into the picture Spring Expression Language - SpEL.

9
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.009
SpEL gives you the ability

10
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.004
to use expressions in your configuration

11
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.009
to configure your objects.

12
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:38.003
Let's see a very simple case in action.

13
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:42.008
All right, so let's jump into our Application Config class.

14
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.001
And the first thing we're going to do

15
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:48.008
is remove this timeService12 that we just created.

16
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:53.002
And we're going to remove the profile on our Bean

17
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.007
for the time service.

18
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:59.009
And we're going to create a new @value annotation.

19
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.006
And we'll get to the details here in a minute.

20
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:03.009
private boolean is24.

21
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.009
private boolean is24.

22
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.002
And now, instead of sending "true" to our time service

23
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.002
we're going to set is24.

24
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.001
But how are we going to set it?

25
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.003
The way we're going to set it is we're going to use

26
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:19.003
Spring Expression Language to translate

27
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.009
the environment that we're in, the profile that we want

28
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.008
into a Boolean.

29
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.001
So, the first thing that we're going to do here

30
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.002
is we're going to double quote this.

31
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:29.006
And we're going to send #.

32
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.004
And # says, "use spell; use Spring Expression Language".

33
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:37.000
And we're going to create Inner Spring Expression Language

34
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.002
a new Boolean because this is a Boolean value.

35
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.008
So, new Boolean.

36
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.002
And of course that needs to be in parentheses.

37
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.000
So, to pass in a new Boolean

38
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.002
we are going to read from the environment

39
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.000
a value

40
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.001
called spring.profiles.active

41
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.004
called spring.profiles.active

42
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.002
So, that comes from the environment,

43
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.008
which is how we're passing it in.

44
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:06.008
We're going to not equal that to a value of dev.

45
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:08.001
So, let's walk through this one more time.

46
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.002
So, we're going to create a new Boolean.

47
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.008
We're going to use the environment.

48
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.009
And remember, this is the Spring environment;

49
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:18.000
so, this includes the system OS environment variables,

50
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.008
the VM variables or the VM arguments,

51
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:24.009
the application arguments,

52
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.006
as well as any configuration that you've loaded.

53
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.002
So, all of that in appropriate hierarchy

54
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:32.004
will be loaded into this environment.

55
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:37.001
So, we're going to say "is24 is whenever we are not in dev".

56
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.008
So, when our profile is set to not dev.

57
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.009
Which is the same behavior that we saw before.

58
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:46.005
So, let's run our dev application from before.

59
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.006
And we should still see our time in 12-hour format.

60
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:51.005
And indeed we do.

61
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:55.009
And we'll flip over here to Prod and we'll run that one.

62
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.006
And we see it in 24-hour format.

63
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.006
So, of course this is just the tip of the ice burg

64
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.005
of what you can do with Spring Expression Language.

65
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:08.001
One of the most common use cases that I did for this

66
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.005
was before we brought Config Server into play,

67
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:14.006
we would write a Config for each of our environments

68
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.005
and set those in Resources with names like

69
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:18.007
application-dev.properties

70
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:21.001
application-dev.properties

71
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.004
and we would use this expression language

72
00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.003
up here in line 14 on our property source

73
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:29.006
in order to know which application properties to load.

74
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.006
And we would set that profile in our App Server,

75
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:34.008
so this was a long time ago before I was doing

76
00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:37.003
microservices development with Spring.

77
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.007
Instead we were deploying two large application servers.

78
00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:43.001
So, it's very possible for Spring Expression Language

79
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.006
to do a whole bunch of stuff

80
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:47.007
and we're just really touching it briefly here

81
00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.009
to give you some exposure to it.

82
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.004
If you are using Spring development for applications,

83
00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:57.002
you should know SpEL like the back of your hand.

84
00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:00.006
It can save you a lot of extraneous configuration

85
00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:04.004
by just using some simple logic in a value statement

86
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:08.000
or in some other annotation within your class.
