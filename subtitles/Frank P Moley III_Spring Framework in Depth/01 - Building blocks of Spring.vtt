00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Frank] Spring is the most popular framework

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.000
for the Java virtual machine,

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.004
and the lead it has in the market

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.000
isn't getting smaller anytime soon.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Its popularity stems not only from the elegance

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.006
of the abstractions that it provides

7
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.004
but it's strong community of supporters and committers.

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.009
As with any framework, its utility grows exponentially

9
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.002
once you understand its inner workings

10
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.004
because it allows you to build applications

11
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.002
using the framework as it was designed,

12
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.002
as well as extend it to meet your needs.

13
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.002
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

14
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.008
I've been working in the software industry

15
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.004
for over 18 years in various aspects

16
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.004
of the development lifecycle.

17
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:44.008
I have been working with Spring

18
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.009
for almost 12 years of my career,

19
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.009
using it to build and migrate applications

20
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.006
to more modern standards along the way.

21
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.006
I have also been involved with the community

22
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.003
for almost that entire time.

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:01.000
I want to share with you how Spring itself actually works

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.009
and how to use that knowledge to your advantage

25
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.000
as a software developer.
