00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Instructor>Now that we've reached the end</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.380
of this first section,

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.600
I'm gonna do a very quick recap

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.299
and also talk a little bit about what's ahead of us

5
00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.849
on the next one or two sections.

6
00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.270
So over the last 20 lectures or so,

7
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.730
you already learned a bunch of really cool stuff.

8
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.170
So you learned how to read files, how to write files,

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.940
you learned how to import modules from Node's core

10
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.754
or your own modules or even third-party modules.

11
00:00:30.754 --> 00:00:35.352
Then you learned how to create a web server,

12
00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:36.960
like we did here.

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.730
In there we did some nice routing.

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.280
We did templating.

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.819
And we built this really nice website here

16
00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:45.020
which I think is pretty cool.

17
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.320
So that's a pretty great result

18
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.790
for just this small amount of lectures, I hope.

19
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.239
Congratulations really on finishing this section

20
00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.286
and doing great work and great progress.

21
00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:00.110
I hope all of this made sense to you

22
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.224
and that you came out of this very first section

23
00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:06.220
already with some good fundamentals about Node.js.

24
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.140
If you feel like it,

25
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.973
you can go ahead

26
00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:10.660
and create a small demo project for yourself

27
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.765
using what you learned here

28
00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:14.151
and I think that that would be a nice challenge

29
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:17.760
and a great exercise for yourself as well.

30
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.660
Now next up,

31
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.777
we actually have two sections

32
00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:22.900
which are actually a bit more theoretical.

33
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.353
The first one is about backend web development

34
00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:28.888
and the second one is a deep look behind the scenes

35
00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.840
of how Node.js really works.

36
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.450
There's also some coding in there.

37
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.940
But mostly they are really theoretical.

38
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.789
And I did include them

39
00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.735
because I really want you to deeply understand

40
00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.460
how Node.js works

41
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.293
and all my students,

42
00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:43.854
or at least most of them,

43
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:48.000
really love these kind of videos in all my other courses.

44
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.300
So, of course, I had to also include them in this course.

45
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.470
And they are, in fact,

46
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.299
really important for you to understand

47
00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.919
not only how Node works behind the scenes

48
00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.896
but also to get a better understanding

49
00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.067
of all the rest of the material

50
00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:04.780
that's gonna be in the rest of the course.

51
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.030
It took me a lot of time to put together these videos.

52
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.110
Actually a couple of months, to be honest.

53
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.290
And they follow a very logical and clear structure

54
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.544
so one topic builds on top of the other.

55
00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:20.532
So to make your learning experience as smooth as possible.

56
00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:23.660
And so I really hope that you do like them

57
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.360
and that you do not skip them.

58
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.450
Now if you're the kind of person

59
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.910
that really does not like to learn about the theory of stuff

60
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.860
please just go ahead and skip these sections

61
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.610
and go straight into the section

62
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.860
where we start learning about Express.

63
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.982
It's really just better than leaving a bad review

64
00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:40.898
like some people do.

65
00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:42.754
But in case you're interested

66
00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:44.889
in really knowing how Node works

67
00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.950
then come with me into this deep dive

68
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.690
that we're gonna start right in the next section.

69
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.683
See you there.
