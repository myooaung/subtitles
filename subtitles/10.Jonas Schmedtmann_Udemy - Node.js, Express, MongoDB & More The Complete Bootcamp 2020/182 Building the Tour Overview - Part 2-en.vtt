00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.650
<v Instructor>Let's now fill each of the card elements</v>

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.583
with the correct data for each of the tours.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.870
So, just as a quick recap.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.690
In a last video we started by creating this main element

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.220
and an inside a div container element

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.070
then inside of that container

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.670
we want one of these card elements

8
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.740
for each of the tours that comes in the array

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.850
that we pass in to this template.

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.720
And for that we use a Pug array that works

11
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.930
just like this.

12
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.270
So, what is each keyword here

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.580
and the result of doing that looked like this, all right.

14
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.010
And so what we're going to do now is to basically,

15
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.773
fill each of these cards here with the actual data.

16
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.223
And let's start here with the tour name.

17
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.760
So, remember how we put the value of a variable

18
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.983
inside of one element.

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.970
Well, we use equal and then in this case tour.

20
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.310
So, the name of the variable

21
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.370
in current loop iteration, right.

22
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.270
And so that's a tour document and then dot name, remember.

23
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.300
So, let's check that out in compass very quick.

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.900
So, here we have four tours

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.283
and so this is all of the data

26
00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:17.680
that we're going to need now, okay.

27
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.080
And starting with the name here, okay.

28
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.930
And so if we now reload our page that should actually

29
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.203
be reflected in here.

30
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.350
And so this is where the magic starts and it worked.

31
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.740
And so this is the first time that we really see

32
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.470
the data from the database being actually rendered

33
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.240
on the website.

34
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.490
So, here we have the tour name for each of the tours

35
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.170
and again that is now coming right out of our database.

36
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.270
So, fantastic that's really cool

37
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.240
and so let's now actually continue building this card.

38
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.460
So, here about the image now.

39
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.600
Let's also put the alternative text to the tour name.

40
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.530
Now we cannot simply put a tour dot name here

41
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.190
because we're inside of a string

42
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.770
and so that doesn't work.

43
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.730
Now at the same time

44
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.570
if we do it like this it's also

45
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.270
not going to be working because here this Alt

46
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.220
actually expects a string, okay.

47
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.350
So we need some quotes here around this variable.

48
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.230
And so the easiest way of doing that

49
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.093
is to actually use ES6 template strings, okay.

50
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.840
So, just like this and again that's because

51
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.620
this actually here expects a string to be come in

52
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.320
and so with this of course we are creating a string.

53
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.450
Next up let's then specify the image here, okay.

54
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.720
So, let's take a look at compass again

55
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.827
to check out what's that cover image looks like okay.

56
00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:52.550
And so we have a property called image cover

57
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.960
and then in here we only have the name of the image itself.

58
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.760
So, not the path to the image.=

59
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.200
and so that we will actually have to manually specify, okay.

60
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.300
So, but what matters here is that

61
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.603
it's called image cover.

62
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.500
And so let's get rid of all of this.

63
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.730
Start by creating a template string

64
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.170
and then tour dot image cover

65
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.480
and now we need to figure out

66
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.700
the entire path to that image, okay.

67
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.480
And so as we already know the image data

68
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.430
is inside the public folder.

69
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.820
So, the folder from which all the static assets

70
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.400
are going to be served

71
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.790
and so in here we have images.

72
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.130
And then we have a folder.

73
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.833
One for tours and one for users, okay.

74
00:03:39.197 --> 00:03:41.700
And so inside of each of these tours

75
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.423
we then have the three pictures and one cover photo.

76
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.120
So, that's going to look something like this.

77
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.120
And so the path here is image dot tours or slash tours

78
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.863
and then slash the name of the image, great.

79
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.270
So that should make whole websites

80
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.560
look even better now yeah.

81
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.770
Now it's really starting to come to life.

82
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.730
So, that's fantastic.

83
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.460
This makes me feel really great

84
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.993
each time that it works.

85
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.260
Anyway, let's now take care of the rest of the data

86
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.010
which of course still looks the same

87
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.680
across all of these cards, okay.

88
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.550
And so let's now use the data in our collection

89
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.600
to build this string here.

90
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.550
So, you see that this actually is a combination

91
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.010
of a different data.

92
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.630
So, we have the difficulty and the tour duration

93
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.710
and so let's here now create a template string.

94
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.093
So, basically assign this template string to this element.

95
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.083
And so we start here with tour dot difficulty,

96
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.410
remember, then the space and then the tour duration,

97
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.763
tour dot duration day tour, okay.

98
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.030
So, that's the translation of this content.

99
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.413
Then next up what we have here is the tour summary, okay.

100
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.700
So, equal tour dot summary, all right.

101
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.870
Then next up we have the start location

102
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.720
and so this tour for example

103
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.470
starts in Banff Canada and so again

104
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.520
let's take a look at compass here

105
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.520
just to see how the data looks like

106
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.740
or actually we don't need to always be switching

107
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.520
back and forth to compass.

108
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.340
We can also just open up or or import data here.

109
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.850
So, on the tours we can simply use this data here

110
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.980
instead of always going to compass.

111
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.810
So, before we use the summary

112
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.400
now let's go ahead and use the start location

113
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.040
which is actually up here.

114
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.083
So, now we want start location dot description, okay.

115
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.570
So, tour dot start location dot description.

116
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.090
And so now you start to see

117
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.480
why it made sense to actually create

118
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.450
all of this different data that we created here.

119
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.010
Right, next up we're gonna use to start dates

120
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.520
and so keep in mind.

121
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.010
That this is an array, okay.

122
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.900
Because now what we want in our overview

123
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.680
is basically the date where the next tour starts.

124
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.710
So, that's what is icon with a calendar here

125
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.923
means in this case.

126
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.470
So, that's basically the first element

127
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.710
of that start dates array.

128
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.680
So, start dates at position 0.

129
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.960
Next up we have this piece of data which says

130
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.320
how many stops there are in these tours.

131
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.670
And so basically that means

132
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.000
how many locations we have

133
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.210
and so again we're going to use the locations

134
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.120
and this time not start location

135
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.770
but really this locations

136
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.350
and so if you want to specify how many locations we have.

137
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.493
Well then we need to count the length of this array, okay.

138
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.560
And so that simple as well.

139
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.370
So, equal and then set it to this template string

140
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.830
because we also want to add this stop

141
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.807
and so tour dot locations dot length stops

142
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.740
and finally the amount of people

143
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.070
that are part of each of the groups.

144
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.990
So, the people that can participate in one tour

145
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.110
and so that is stored at tour

146
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.053
but max group size, remember.

147
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.953
And then people.

148
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.990
Great, so that part is done now

149
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.550
and so let's actually go back to our website

150
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.743
and test that out.

151
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.150
And yeah beautiful at least almost beautiful

152
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.030
because this date looks kind of weird here.

153
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.030
So, we really just want June twenty twenty-one

154
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.550
so we don't need to be all that specific here

155
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.630
in this overview, okay.

156
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.630
And so what we want is to look like is again June 2021

157
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.620
and so right now it's all of this mess

158
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.560
and so let's fix that

159
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.910
and thankfully that's actually very easy

160
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.640
with JavaScript which includes a couple

161
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.640
of very nice functions to work with dates.

162
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.100
And keep in mind that each of these start dates here

163
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.920
really is a date object in or database

164
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.120
and so now we can use a function like this one

165
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.120
to local string, okay.

166
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.260
So, basically it will convert this date

167
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.440
into a nice readable string

168
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.580
and in here we can now pass an option for the language.

169
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.080
And so that is English for US

170
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.580
and then also an object with some options

171
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.481
and so here we can now specify that we want

172
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.093
a month to be long.

173
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.870
So, instead of just an abbreviation

174
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.940
like we had here.

175
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.910
so, one April, one Aug

176
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.970
it will now print it out like this.

177
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.560
So, really the name of the entire month and okay

178
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.557
and then also saying that the year should be numeric

179
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.757
and if you want to learn more about this function here

180
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:55.180
then just go ahead and Google that, okay.

181
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.810
So, let's try that out again

182
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.930
and now it looks really nice, awesome.

183
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.980
So, let's keep it moving and finish this last part here

184
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.723
with the price and the rating details.

185
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.700
And so that's down here in the card footer

186
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.150
and so here that's just the price.

187
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.240
So, equal to let's actually leave it there

188
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.810
because now we still need a template string

189
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.910
because the price is not only this number

190
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.120
but actually we need an extra dollar sign here

191
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.250
for the dollar price.

192
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.433
So, this one, right.

193
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.410
Next up we have the average rating here.

194
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.300
So, that's this and so we already know

195
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.300
that this is called tour dot average rating.

196
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.560
So, we used that so many times at least I believe.

197
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.240
Let's just confirm it so actually it's ratings average

198
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.490
and then also ratings quantity.

199
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.488
So, let's just copy this.

200
00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:05.890
So, ratings average

201
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.073
and now here we want ratings quantity.

202
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.270
All right, but of course this needs to be a template string

203
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.560
and then here set it to equal

204
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.450
and then of course interpolate the variable name in here

205
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.490
and now finally we need to build the URL

206
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.220
to the detail page, okay.

207
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.180
So, remember that when we click on one of the cards.

208
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.280
It then takes us to the detail page

209
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.550
and so of course here we now need to specify that link

210
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.800
because of course that will depend on each tour.

211
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.380
So, we want to link to be slash tours

212
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.760
and then remember how I mentioned before

213
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.530
that for rendering these pages we actually

214
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.050
will want to query tours by their slug

215
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.870
and not by their ID.

216
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.620
How we did it in the API okay,

217
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.620
because that actually makes the URL look a much nicer, okay.

218
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.973
And so let's use that here now.

219
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:18.130
So tour dot slug

220
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.200
and so just to explain you

221
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.110
why we start this URL here with a slash.

222
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.230
It is because building a URL like this

223
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.140
so starting only with the slash is called a relative URL

224
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.620
and what this will do is that

225
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.020
it will then add at this piece of the URL

226
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.640
after the host name.

227
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.540
So, that host is right now one to seven point zero zero one

228
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.170
but that is not necessary to specify here

229
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.710
because again when writing a relative URL like this

230
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.663
it will then add what we have here to that host name, okay.

231
00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:56.490
So, let's reload that again

232
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.930
and so we're almost finished here

233
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.250
not quite ready.

234
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.750
So, here you see undefined

235
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.820
and so we probably did something wrong there.

236
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.490
And also you see that there is no space here

237
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.650
between the price and the per person

238
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.440
and also here the same now.

239
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.360
If you hover this button here

240
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.550
then down there in the left corner.

241
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.400
So, down here you will see the URL

242
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.780
that we just build.

243
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.040
Can actually click it

244
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.010
and it will then give us this error

245
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.470
because of course we didn't define this route yet

246
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.390
but you see that it looks really nice here

247
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.660
with the tours slash the forest hiker

248
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.660
instead of having that ugly looking ID up there, okay.

249
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.270
But anyway let's now fix this undefined

250
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.563
in this missing space.

251
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.550
So, let's take a look at this one.

252
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.270
Well, it looks correct actually ratings, quantity

253
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.690
but of course we're missing this tour dot, okay.

254
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.770
You probably were already seeing that one.

255
00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.360
Now about that missing space.

256
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.950
There's something new that I need to show you about pug

257
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.050
which is this so-called empty piped lane

258
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.950
or a line, actually.

259
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.080
So, whenever we need a real space

260
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.220
between two inline-block elements

261
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.610
which are these bands then we need

262
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.210
to manually create that space

263
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.840
using this piped line here like this, okay.

264
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.180
And the same thing down here

265
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.260
because otherwise as we just saw

266
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.660
it will simply glue all of these elements

267
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.120
then together, all right.

268
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.880
So, now all of that should be fixed

269
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.260
and that space is still not there

270
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.070
and that's actually because we forgot something.

271
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.750
And so let's go back

272
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.080
and we actually need to manually add

273
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.600
that empty space here and here.

274
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.290
So, this empty pipe line here basically,

275
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.390
creates a space for us where we can then create content

276
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.020
outside of an element

277
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.690
and so that's basically what this space is.

278
00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.930
So, this space here that we just put here.

279
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.180
So, this empty space it's content that's not inside

280
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.830
of any of these two elements.

281
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.690
And so again in order to be able to do that

282
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.880
that's what we need this pipeline for.

283
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.423
So, these two pipelines.

284
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.020
So, try that again

285
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.870
and now indeed here goes the space

286
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.670
that we just created, perfect.

287
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.010
And with that we actually wrap up this lecture

288
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.140
and this stunningly looking first website

289
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.110
or part of the website that we just built here together.

290
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.651
So, a moment to appreciate how cool this really is

291
00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:38.280
and also how all of this code

292
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.340
that we wrote it together actually works, okay.

293
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.560
And then after that come right back

294
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.693
so that we can build together the tour overview page.
