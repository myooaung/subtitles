00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.770
<v Narrator>In this last part of the section,</v>

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.160
we're now gonna accept credit card payments

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.770
in our application using Stripe

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.233
in order to allow our users to actually buy tours.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.320
And so, let's open up a new tab here

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.730
and then on there open stripe.com.

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.080
So Stripe is the best and most popular

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.910
and also easiest to use software platform

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.810
to integrate payments into any website.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.210
And a lot more about how it actually works a bit later,

11
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.040
but for now let's start by creating our free account.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.540
So click here on free account

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.303
and then open up your own free account.

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.810
And once you are successfully signed in,

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.990
you should see a dashboard that looks something like this.

16
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.210
So when you open up a brand new account,

17
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.150
you will initially always be in test mode.

18
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.250
So that's what you can see down here with this test data.

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.380
Now, as soon as you really want to start

20
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.250
accepting real payments involving real money

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.530
from real customers, you will then have to activate

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.960
your Stripe account.

23
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.350
And for that, you will then have to provide Stripe

24
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.220
with a bunch of data about your business.

25
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.580
But of course in this project,

26
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.360
we're not gonna do that, so we will always just work

27
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.680
in this kind of test development mode, okay?

28
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.010
But otherwise, you just click here on start

29
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.940
or activate your account up here.

30
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.980
Now this dashboard is really easy and super intuitive

31
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.890
to use in my opinion.

32
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.660
So here you can see your payments,

33
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.360
which again is very easy,

34
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.280
and remember that this is all test data.

35
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.270
So all of these amounts here are, of course,

36
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.110
just fake amounts.

37
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.460
But anyway, you can see your customer here,

38
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.463
you can see the amount.

39
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.440
And when you open them up, you get even more information,

40
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.670
like the payment method here, so the credit card number.

41
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.640
And by the way, we actually never do get access

42
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.420
to the real credit card number of the customer.

43
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.230
So we will always just see these last four digits,

44
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.630
but never the real credit card number, okay?

45
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.620
Then you also get the overview

46
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.110
about what was actually purchased.

47
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.630
So, for example, The Snow Adventurer Tour.

48
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.360
And all of this here was, of course,

49
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.410
from when I was first building

50
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.133
the Natours application, okay?

51
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.570
So all of these are just test purchases.

52
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.420
Then we can also see our entire balance,

53
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.150
so basically all the money that we received.

54
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.610
And again, all of this is just test data.

55
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.060
Then we have our customers with a nice list of all of them.

56
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.653
And, yeah, all of this works really fine.

57
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.500
Now before we can get started,

58
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.830
we actually need to define a couple of settings

59
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.400
about our account.

60
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.867
So in your new account, you should see something like

61
00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.120
"Unnamed Account", or something like that, here.

62
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.740
And so, you should also have, like a pen icon or something

63
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.010
where you can then create a name for the account.

64
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.160
And so please call that "Natours" or something else.

65
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.700
And if you have more businesses, then you can add

66
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.690
one account for each of these businesses, okay?

67
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.510
Or if you don't have the pencil icon here,

68
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.220
we can also go to the settings,

69
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.570
and then account information.

70
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.030
And so here is where you should put in the name

71
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.610
of this kind of business.

72
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.150
We can also define a couple of other settings,

73
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.350
so let's define the branding here,

74
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.390
which will make the Stripe Checkout pages

75
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.233
match our brand, basically.

76
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.383
So let's add our images.

77
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.850
So public, image, and then for the icon,

78
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.163
let's use this one.

79
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.140
And we can also upload a logo,

80
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.033
and for that, let's use this one.

81
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.913
Oh, and now we need our password in order to continue.

82
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.033
And now let's also change our color here.

83
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.640
So quickly open up the CSS file in public

84
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.150
and then find our typical green,

85
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.663
which is this one here.

86
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.623
So that looks a bit better.

87
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.950
Let's now save it here

88
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.150
and so with that, we're good to go.

89
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.130
Next up, let's take a look at our API keys.

90
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.660
So, click here on API keys

91
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.550
and if the website looks a bit different

92
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.690
by the time you're watching this video,

93
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.113
then maybe the keys are here at developers.

94
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.180
So here you also have something called API keys, okay?

95
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.860
Anyway, there is one publishable key and one secret key.

96
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.270
And so this one is basically a public key

97
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.820
that we can use on the front-end,

98
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.430
and a secret key is the one that is needed on the back-end.

99
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.020
And so more about that

100
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.420
once we actually start implementing it.

101
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.310
And finally, I also wanted to

102
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.120
take a quick look together with you at the documentation.

103
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.940
And so that's up here,

104
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.390
and actually Stripe is known

105
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.470
for its excellent documentation.

106
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.700
It's really easy to find what you're looking for

107
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.170
in this documentation.

108
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.470
But of course, when you're only getting started,

109
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.740
then it's very hard to even know

110
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.830
what you're looking for, right?

111
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.550
And so that's why we're implementing

112
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.270
this payment feature together here, right?

113
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.530
So we're gonna use the payment features of Stripe

114
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.000
and they have a couple of different options.

115
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.630
Now on the web, we can use Stripe Checkout

116
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.820
which is basically using a preformative Checkout page.

117
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.170
And so this is the one that we're gonna use,

118
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.800
or you can also use Stripe elements

119
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.633
when you really want to

120
00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:46.400
build your own Checkout experience, okay?

121
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.640
But we will just use this Checkout

122
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.110
which is actually brand new

123
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.633
and so it's really future-proof at this point.

124
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.060
So these are the two options for the web,

125
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.850
but you can also Stripe on iOS, Android,

126
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.563
and really any other platform.

127
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.840
Then on Checkout, we can actually use it

128
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.223
on only the client or together with the server, okay?

129
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.593
So down here there is some comparison.

130
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.600
And so when we only use it on the client side,

131
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.000
then we don't even need a server at all.

132
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.890
But this way of using Stripe is only, really,

133
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.060
for really, really small stores,

134
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.600
so where you only have a handful of products

135
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.420
that never change their price

136
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.040
and where you actually have to

137
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.730
add all these products manually to your Stripe dashboards.

138
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.250
And so we want something a bit more complex

139
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.460
and so for that, we use the server integration, okay?

140
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.160
And so, of course we still need

141
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.010
to do something on the client side,

142
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.720
but most of the code will actually be on the server side.

143
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.220
Okay, so you see that there really is a lot of stuff

144
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.930
to do with Stripe, and we can even do a lot more.

145
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.210
So we could have billing where we have subscriptions

146
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.050
where we have invoices and all that good stuff.

147
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.040
So really, you could build a huge business

148
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.330
on top of Stripe and accept subscriptions,

149
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.350
save customers to databases,

150
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.543
and all that integrated into Stripe.

151
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.850
But again, what we're gonna do here

152
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.040
is to simply use the Checkout,

153
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.090
but the more complete version of it

154
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.963
by using the server Checkout.

155
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.130
Alright, but now before we actually start

156
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.690
to integrate the Stripe Checkout product

157
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.210
into our application,

158
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.353
I just wanted to quickly layout the entire workflow

159
00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:37.920
that we're gonna implement over the next couple of videos.

160
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.200
So it all starts on the back-end

161
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.850
where we're gonna implement a route to create

162
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.600
a so-called Stripe Checkout Session.

163
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.170
And this Session is gonna contain a bunch of data

164
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.970
about the object that can be purchased.

165
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.070
And in our example, that's the tour.

166
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.480
So The Session will contain the tour price,

167
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.640
the tour name, a product image, and also some other details

168
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.450
like the client e-mail.

169
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.530
So we will see that actually in the next video.

170
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.370
Then, on the front-end, we're gonna create a function

171
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.580
to request the Checkout Session from the server

172
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.120
once the user clicks the buy button.

173
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.550
So once we hit the end point

174
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.350
that we created on the back-end,

175
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.360
that will then create a Session and send it back

176
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.720
to the client.

177
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.590
Then, based on that Session,

178
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.010
Stripe will automatically create a Checkout page for us

179
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.640
where the user can then input all the details

180
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.670
like credit card number, expiration date, and all that.

181
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.760
Then, again, using The Session,

182
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.360
we will finally charge the credit card.

183
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.700
And for that, we're gonna need the public key,

184
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.830
so the one that we just saw before.

185
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.270
So the secret key we will need on the server

186
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.330
as you'll see up there in the first step,

187
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.820
and the public key is gonna be used on the front-end.

188
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.730
And what's really important to note here

189
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.180
is that it's really Stripe,

190
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.930
which will together with The Session,

191
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.480
charge the credit card, and so therefore,

192
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.720
the credit card details never even reach our server,

193
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.800
which makes our lives as developers a lot easier

194
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.870
because then we don't have to deal with

195
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.500
all the security stuff that's related with

196
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.000
managing and storing credit cards, okay?

197
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.450
So Stripe takes all that away from us,

198
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.030
we basically just use their API like this.

199
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.840
Anyway, once the credit card has successfully been charged,

200
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.460
we can then use something called Stripe Webhooks

201
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.210
on our back-end, in order to create new bookings.

202
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.090
Now, this part of the workflow

203
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.710
will only work for deployed websites,

204
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.900
so websites that are already running on a server.

205
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.770
And so this part of the workflow,

206
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.690
we're only gonna be able to implement

207
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.830
by the end of the next section, okay?

208
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.310
But for now, we will actually find

209
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.270
a temporary work-around to this,

210
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.770
which is not really secure,

211
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.870
but it's gonna work just fine for now, okay?

212
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.060
So keep this diagram in mind and also this concept

213
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.410
that we actually use The Session to charge a credit card

214
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.940
and we don't really do that directly.

215
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.803
So, see you in the next video.
