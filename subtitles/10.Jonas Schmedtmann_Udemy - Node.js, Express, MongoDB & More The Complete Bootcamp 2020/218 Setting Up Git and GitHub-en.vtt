00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.900
<v Instructor>So, the Heroku platform,</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.940
where we're gonna deploy our project,

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.210
works very closely with Git,

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.690
and so, in this lecture, we're gonna install

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.960
and set up Git on your computer

6
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.730
and also open an account at github.com.

7
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.270
Now if you're already familiar with Git and GitHub,

8
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.780
then please feel free to mark this video

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.890
and the next ones as completed,

10
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.530
and move on to the ones

11
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.603
where we actually deploy the project to Heroku.

12
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.570
So, in order to install Git, let's search for Git,

13
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.990
and then the first result that shows up,

14
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.890
which is git-scm should be the one that you're looking for.

15
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.300
Now, what actually is Git?

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.710
Well, Git is a version control software,

17
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.530
so a software that runs on your computer

18
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.400
and which basically allows you to save snapshots

19
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.130
of your code over time,

20
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.240
so that you can go back in time in your code if you need to.

21
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.210
And that is really only the surface.

22
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.006
So Git really is an incredibly complex and huge topic

23
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.300
and which could be a whole course on its own.

24
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.180
So, in this lecture and the next ones,

25
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.170
I will really just give you the very, very basics of Git.

26
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.340
All right.

27
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.090
So again, what you really need to know about Git

28
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.530
is that it's a version control software

29
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.930
which allows you to save your code over time

30
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.580
in different commits and branches.

31
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.400
And all of this happens inside a repository.

32
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.940
So, for each of your projects,

33
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.560
you will create a repository, and then, in there,

34
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.130
you will create commits and different branches,

35
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.400
and you will learn all of that in the next video.

36
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.540
All right.

37
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.970
Anyway, for now, let's actually go ahead and download Git.

38
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.430
And I will not do it now because, of course,

39
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.053
I already have Git installed.

40
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.790
So once you're done installing it,

41
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.253
let's open up the Terminal.

42
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.650
And to check if it's actually installed on your computer,

43
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.290
type git dash dash version.

44
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.270
And then, if you get any output,

45
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.180
well, then it means that your installation was successful.

46
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.970
Now, there are a bunch of different

47
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.590
graphical user interfaces

48
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.470
in order to interact with Git on your computer,

49
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.520
but I will show you everything you need to know

50
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.780
in order to get started with Git using the command line,

51
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.700
because I believe that it's actually a way better way

52
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.810
of learning to work with Git.

53
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.820
And also, once you're comfortable with most of the commands,

54
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.910
it's actually much faster and easier

55
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.470
to just use the command line

56
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.930
instead of messing with a graphical user interface.

57
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.070
All right.

58
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.610
Anyway, let's now go ahead

59
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.363
and create an account on github.com.

60
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.760
So that's GitHub, and so github.com

61
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.650
is where we want to now sign up for a new account.

62
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.070
And GitHub is basically a platform

63
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.490
where you can host your own Git repositories for free,

64
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.780
in order to share it with other developers

65
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.500
or just to keep it secure for yourself.

66
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.640
So, every single developer that I know

67
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.030
actually uses Git and GitHub,

68
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.430
and so, if you haven't used it up until this point,

69
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.800
then it's really a great time to join all the developers

70
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.770
that really rely on the service every single day.

71
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.670
So, of course, I'm not gonna create a new account here,

72
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.340
because I already have one,

73
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.950
but please go ahead and do that now.

74
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.983
And then, once you're ready, let's go back to the Terminal.

75
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.710
So, what I want to do now is to, very quickly,

76
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.340
configure your local Git installation

77
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.400
with the name and email address

78
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.230
that you just used on GitHub.

79
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.230
So that's git config, then dash dash global,

80
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.823
then user.name, and then your name.

81
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.063
So let's say that's Jonas Schmedtmann,

82
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.097
and then hit Enter, and that's it, all right?

83
00:03:58.097 --> 00:04:01.420
So that's the name, and then also the email.

84
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.170
So that's git config, global, again,

85
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.170
user.email, and then your email here, also in quotes.

86
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.883
All right.

87
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.400
So, that's it for this video actually.

88
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.330
In the next one, we're then gonna learn

89
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.950
the real basics of Git.

90
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.520
All right, so after this video and the next two one,

91
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.480
I hope that you will really be able

92
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.010
to start using Git in your own projects,

93
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.020
which I believe is really important for you

94
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.673
as a professional developer.
