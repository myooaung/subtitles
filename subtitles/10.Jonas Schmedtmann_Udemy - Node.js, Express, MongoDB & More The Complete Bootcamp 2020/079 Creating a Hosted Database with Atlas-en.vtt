00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Instructor>Hey there,</v>

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.700
let's now create a remote database

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.410
hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.280
So, for developing our project we will actually not use

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.830
a local database on our computer,

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.610
like we've been doing in the section until this point.

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.300
So, instead, we're gonna use a remote database

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.200
hosted on a service called Atlas,

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.550
which is actually owned by the same company

10
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.650
that involves MongoDB.

11
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.280
And again, on the MongoDB website,

12
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.180
let's move over to Products,

13
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.603
and then here you have MongoDB Atlas.

14
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.740
So Atlas is a so-called database as a service provider

15
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.790
which takes all the pain of managing

16
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.460
and scaling databases away from us.

17
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.677
So that already is a huge advantage for us

18
00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:51.500
but it's also extremely useful to always have our data

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.820
basically in the Cloud, because this way

20
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.390
we can develop our application from everywhere

21
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.280
and, even more importantly, we don't have to export data

22
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880
from the local database and then upload it

23
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.150
to a hosted database, once we are ready

24
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.900
to deploy our application.

25
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.060
So instead we simply use this hosted database

26
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.501
right from the beginning, instead of even messing

27
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:15.350
with local databases in the first place, all right?

28
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.320
Now, of course, if you are one of the students

29
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.490
who doesn't have access to the internet

30
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.560
then you just have to keep using a local database

31
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.580
just as we learned until this lecture.

32
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.040
So that's no problem at all, I will of course teach you

33
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.030
how to connect our application later,

34
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.490
with both a database hosted on Atlas

35
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.420
and also a local database, all right?

36
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.290
Anyway, let's now go ahead and start your free account.

37
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.430
Okay, so just Start Free and then down here

38
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.560
you should create your account.

39
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.510
Of course I already have my account,

40
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.060
so I'm not gonna do that.

41
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.610
So please just pause the video here, at this point,

42
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.850
and once you're ready, just come back here

43
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.190
to set up our first remote database.

44
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.000
All right, so when you log in, into Atlas,

45
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.100
it should look something like this.

46
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.340
I'm not sure how it looks the first time when you log in

47
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.970
but at some place you will be able to create a new project.

48
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.290
So in this case, I have here the button

49
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.550
or you can also come here to the left side

50
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.640
and then down here create a New Project.

51
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.368
Now I already have two natours projects here

52
00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:20.860
simply because I had to build of course this application

53
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.850
before creating the course.

54
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.803
And so, let's now create yet another one.

55
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.290
So let me call this one natours-app, okay

56
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.260
but you can call yours just natours,

57
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.510
so just like this or, if you want to have the same name,

58
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.860
then just go ahead and call it natours-app, as well, okay?

59
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.313
So, create a new project.

60
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.060
You should then give yourself the Project Owner Permission

61
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.790
which should by default be enabled already

62
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.180
and then just create the project.

63
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.323
Wait a little bit until it's ready.

64
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.890
And here we go.

65
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.670
So we have our project created,

66
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.210
now it's time to Build a Cluster.

67
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.260
And a cluster is basically like an instance

68
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.610
of our database, okay?

69
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.760
So now it's time to configure the cluster.

70
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.070
I'm simply using the default settings here

71
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.320
because that is gonna allow me

72
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.370
to create a free cluster, okay?

73
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.720
So that's what I want to do for this application.

74
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.820
So all of this fine by me,

75
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.920
so this M0 here stands for the free cluster

76
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.090
which is gonna give us 512MB of storage

77
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.420
and a maximum of 100 simultaneous connections, okay?

78
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.590
If you want more, then of course, you can start paying

79
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.660
for this, but in this case of course

80
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.120
that's not what we want.

81
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.193
So we want to just build everything for free for now.

82
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.750
Now it's asking me for this stupid capture here.

83
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.330
So our cluster is now being created,

84
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.500
which usually takes some time

85
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.560
and so I'm just gonna come back to just

86
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.583
once this is actually ready.

87
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.552
And it's done! So, this is how your project

88
00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:10.260
and your brand new cluster should look like at this point.

89
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.610
Okay? And so this step is ready,

90
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.500
now you have a blank empty database, ready to connect

91
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.710
to your own development computer.

92
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.030
And so that is exactly what we're gonna do

93
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.313
in the next video.
