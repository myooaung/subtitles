00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,240
<v Narrator>In this video you are gonna learn how</v>

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,040
to install MongoDB on a Windows computer,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,690
so if you're using a Mac

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,780
please just mark this video as completed.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,920
Now since I personally don't own any Windows computer and

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,170
this installation involves a couple of

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,770
Windows specific steps,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,620
I asked my teaching assistant Aleksander,

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,730
to take you through the process.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,173
So everyone say hi to Aleksander.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,250
<v Aleksander>Hello guys my name is Aleksander and</v>

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,930
in this lecture I will show you how

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,693
to install MongoDB on your Windows machine.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,510
First you need to open your browser and

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,970
go to the MongoDB.com website,

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,720
you can see the address right here.

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,420
Then you need to click on products and

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,783
choose MongoDB server, okay?

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,483
Now click on this green download button.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,183
And once again choose server from here.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,525
Okay, now we want to install this

22
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,330
MongoDB Community Server and

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,980
we have a couple of options here,

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,200
so please choose the current release,

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,200
which at this point of time is the 4.0.9, okay?

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
As the operating system please choose Windows,

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,610
and I would just stick with this default MSI package, okay?

28
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,540
So after setting this up you can just hit

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,440
this download button, or

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,050
in case it doesn't work for you,

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,640
just copy the link below and

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,433
paste it in the address bar, okay?

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,610
So now we should see this pop-up that will ask you if

34
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,090
you want to save this file,

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,320
just click save file and

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,083
it should start downloading okay?

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,730
So I will just stop this because

38
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,173
I already have this file.

39
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,230
Okay? But after downloading it you can just

40
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,160
close the browser,

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,763
open your File Manager,

42
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,530
go to Downloads.

43
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,070
And you can see the installer is already there, all right?

44
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,413
So double click on that,

45
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,370
and now you should see the Setup Wizard okay?

46
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,070
Click next,

47
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,300
accept the license,

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,093
and click to install this complete version, okay?

49
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:16,600
And now it will ask you if

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,920
you want to install MongoDB as a service,

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,330
which basically means that

52
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,530
Mongo's server will run in the background,

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,650
so you can check this, click next.

54
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,560
It will also ask you to install MongoDB Compass,

55
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,360
which is the graphical user interface,

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,623
so we can also check this and click next.

57
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,823
And now just click install,

58
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,040
and you may see some windows pop-up that

59
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,820
will ask you if you want to allow this App to

60
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,540
be installed on your device, okay?

61
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,713
So in that case just click yes.

62
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,330
And now it should start the installation process,

63
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,733
it will take about five to ten minutes,

64
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,143
So I'll be right back to you after the installation.

65
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,123
All right, now just let this compass install,

66
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,663
okay you can see the shortcut right here,

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,400
and this is basically the compass community window,

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,083
so you can close this,

69
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,463
click this finish button,

70
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,210
and now we have two more things to do.

71
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,870
First we need to create a directory in

72
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,550
which MongoDB will store our data.

73
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,363
For this please open your file manager once again,

74
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,120
and go to the disk where MongoDB was installed,

75
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,423
so in my case it's Local Disk C.

76
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,330
Here create a directory called data,

77
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,910
so right click here,

78
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,350
new

79
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,183
folder

80
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:50,403
and call this folder Data, okay?

81
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,400
Now inside this data folder,

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,633
create another one called DB.

83
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,170
All right, so this is the place where

84
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,320
MongoDB will store our databases.

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,020
Now let me quickly show you that

86
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,830
MongoDB actually works,

87
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,593
so I'm going to Local Disk C,

88
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,173
Program Files,

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,963
find MongoDB here,

90
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,610
go to server,

91
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,280
4.0, and we are interested in this bin directory, okay?

92
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,500
So we can see there is a lot of files here,

93
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,330
but basically we are interested in this MongoD file,

94
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,450
which is Mongo's server and

95
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,363
in this Mongo.exe file which is Mongo Shell, okay?

96
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,610
So let me just copy the path from here and

97
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,023
open my console,

98
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,250
and by the way I'm using PowerShell but

99
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,480
you can also use the Command Prompt, okay?

100
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,030
It doesn't matter in this case.

101
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,500
So I'm using the CD commands to

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,670
go to this directory,

103
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,970
you can also write this DIR command to

104
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,590
list all the files,

105
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,420
and if you compare them you can see that

106
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,760
all these files are the same, okay?

107
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,623
So we are in the same bin directory.

108
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,833
And now let me just run this MongoD server,

109
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,823
so Mongod.exe, you can hit tab to auto complete this,

110
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,807
and I'm just hitting Enter and you can see that

111
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,733
the server is starting, okay?

112
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,150
So if you take a look at this line you can see that

113
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,510
it's waiting for connections on port 27017,

114
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,360
so we've basically started a server and

115
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,530
now we need a shell to connect to the server to

116
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,940
be able to manipulate our databases, okay?

117
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,330
So we'll be able to create databases,

118
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,480
delete databases,

119
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,560
to records, etc.

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,393
All right,

121
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,620
I will just open another PowerShell window to

122
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,987
demonstrate it to you.

123
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,860
And just CD to the same bin directory,

124
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,010
but now run this Mongo.exe, okay?

125
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,653
So this is the Mongo Shell,

126
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,450
and you can see that we've automatically connected to

127
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,400
the same port okay?

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,680
And now I would just run the DB command

129
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,680
and I should get the test database in return, okay?

130
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,220
And that's right.

131
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,380
So now you see that everything works, okay?

132
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,750
In this PowerShell we are running the server,

133
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,320
in this PowerShell window we've connected to the server,

134
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,153
okay?

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,633
And now we can just close this process using Control + C.

136
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,253
I will also close the server, okay.

137
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,250
And there is actually one more thing to do,

138
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,250
so what if I would like to run this Mongo server from

139
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,920
another directory, okay?

140
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,270
Let me just show it to you.

141
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,633
I will open another PowerShell window,

142
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,380
and now we can see that I'm currently in my user directory,

143
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,540
so I'm in C:\Users\Aleksander and

144
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,290
I want to open MongoDB server from here,

145
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,140
let me just write this command,

146
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,420
so Mongod.exe

147
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,480
and there is an error, okay?

148
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,230
So it says "The term mongod.exe is not recognized as

149
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,200
the name of cmdLet, function,

150
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,257
script file, or operable program."

151
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,510
So basically Windows don't know where to look for

152
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,840
this MongoD.exe file, okay?

153
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,560
So it thinks this file should be in

154
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,140
my user directory,

155
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,020
but of course this file doesn't exist here,

156
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,720
because it comes from MongoDB bin directory.

157
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,010
So we need to find a way to tell Windows to

158
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,070
look for this file in that

159
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,680
bin directory, okay?

160
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,120
And we can actually do this using system variables.

161
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,083
So let's close these windows for now,

162
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,323
and I will open settings,

163
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,863
And here in the search bar just write Env, okay?

164
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,453
And click on this "Edit the system environment variables"

165
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,560
so now you should see this small window,

166
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,970
it's called System Properties,

167
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,210
we are in the Advanced tab,

168
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,727
and here just click on this

169
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,063
Environment Variables button, okay?

170
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,040
And we are interested in the system variables,

171
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,730
Path variable, okay?

172
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,850
Click edit, and you can see that

173
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,770
there is a couple of Paths added here,

174
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,430
for example, I have added NodeJS and Git,

175
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,040
so I'm able to run Node from anywhere,

176
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,920
and we will add MongoDB here as well.

177
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,093
So let me just copy the Path from here,

178
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,303
so this is this bin directory okay.

179
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,770
And I will just create another variable here and

180
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,820
paste this Path here.

181
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,600
Now we can just click Okay,

182
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,740
once again click Okay,

183
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,040
you can close this window,

184
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,123
and let's test it in PowerShell, okay?

185
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,310
So you can see that I'm currently in my user directory,

186
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,923
and I will run MongoD.exe once again.

187
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,640
And you can see that everything works just fine, okay?

188
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,780
So the server is running on the same port as before

189
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,293
and it's ready to use, all right?

190
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,460
So you can close this,

191
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,890
and this is all.

192
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,930
So we've installed MongoDB and MongoDB Compass on

193
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,760
our Windows computer,

194
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,470
we've created a directory called Data to

195
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,710
store our databases,

196
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,470
and we've also added MongoDB to the Path,

197
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,580
so we are able to run MongoDB commands from

198
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,963
anywhere in our system.
