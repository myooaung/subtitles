<v ->All right.</v>

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.500
In this video, I will show you how to use

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.180
one of the most important

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.440
and also most complex features of Pug.

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.940
And that are extends.

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.280
With extends, we will be able to use

7
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.000
the same base layout for every single page

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.770
that we want to render.

9
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.280
Right now, we have our base template kind of finished

10
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.210
with a nice header and a nice footer.

11
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.760
So now, let's actually start filling out its content.

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.670
Now, of course, we want to load

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.560
different content for different pages.

14
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.550
And to start, we want to have a overview page

15
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.860
with all the tours, and then a page

16
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.763
with all the tour details for one specific tour.

17
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.080
So let's now implement some routes

18
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.713
for both of these pages.

19
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.640
And I'm going to do that right here

20
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.840
below the first one that we already created.

21
00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.510
So, /overview

22
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.750
And then something very similar to before.

23
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.430
And again, a bit later, actually in the next video

24
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.910
we will then put these routes

25
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.863
into their own separate file.

26
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.560
So, render, and now on this overview page

27
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.030
we will actually want to render

28
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.223
a template called overview.

29
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.000
That doesn't yet exist,

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.903
so let's now quickly go ahead and create one.

31
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.010
So, overview.pug

32
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.640
And actually let's also pass in some data.

33
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.080
And we will pass in the title of the page

34
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.113
which in this case, we'll say,

35
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.063
All Tours.

36
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.130
Now let's just grab this code

37
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.503
and copy it for the tour.

38
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.270
So we also want a route for a specific tour again.

39
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.770
And here, we will want to have

40
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.160
a template which is also called tour.

41
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.260
And then the title of that, for now,

42
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.300
let's do it again,

43
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.950
The Forest Hiker Tour.

44
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.990
So for now, this is just a placeholder,

45
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.470
and of course a bit later we will

46
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.360
then actually make this dynamic.

47
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.120
Because at this point, we are still

48
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.723
kind of learning how Pug really works.

49
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.323
Let's now create that tour template as well.

50
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.810
And that's it.

51
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.363
Okay, now with these two new templates here done,

52
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.680
this is what we're going to do.

53
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.960
In each of these templates, and in this case here

54
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.820
the overview, we only want to put

55
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.500
the content for that specific page.

56
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.720
So we want no footer here and no header

57
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.260
and none of the stuff that we have in the base.

58
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.040
So, again, really just the content

59
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.900
for the overview page.

60
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.890
So that's exactly what we're going to put in this file,

61
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.000
and then, we will basically inject this content

62
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.300
into the base template, which we can call

63
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.316
the parent template.

64
00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:21.620
This process is then called extending.

65
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.750
So whenever the overview template is rendered,

66
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.550
we then take the base template

67
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.560
and fill it up with the content of this file,

68
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.353
and so we extend it.

69
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.080
Here is how we implement that.

70
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.203
First off, in the base, we need to put a block.

71
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.560
I will actually do that here.

72
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.180
So let's delete all of this,

73
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.900
and here, put a block.

74
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.320
And that block, I'm going to call it content.

75
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.260
Then inside that block, we can actually also

76
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.303
have some content.

77
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.520
So let's just put a h1 here.

78
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.740
But this content will then later be overwritten.

79
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.600
But anyway, let's put it here

80
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.230
just as a placeholder, basically.

81
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.630
So, This is a placeholder heading.

82
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.600
Okay, so we have our block here,

83
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.280
and now we can go to our overview page

84
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.473
and say that we want to extend our base template.

85
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.053
So, extend base.

86
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.420
Or actually, that's called extends.

87
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.823
So this file extends the base file.

88
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.528
And of course, if this one here

89
00:04:33.528 --> 00:04:36.157
would be called, for example, index.pug,

90
00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:38.853
then here we would say extends index.

91
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.510
Now what exactly is the content

92
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.083
that's going to be extended in the base template?

93
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.203
Well, that's whatever we put in the content block.

94
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.573
So, also here, we create a block called content.

95
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.063
And then in there, we can as always put our content.

96
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.243
So let's just say, This is the tour overview.

97
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.075
Here, we basically redefine the content block

98
00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:14.073
that is in the base.

99
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.900
So again, we have this block here

100
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.450
which is called content, and now by putting

101
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.400
the same content block right here in this page,

102
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.370
which is then extending the base,

103
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.293
we are basically redefining that block.

104
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:31.820
Each file can only extend one other file.

105
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.860
So we can only extend the base here,

106
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.390
but we can have different blocks in each of the files.

107
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.730
So we could have a block for the head here as well.

108
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.760
And then we could extend that also

109
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.790
in the overview template.

110
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.330
And, actually, we will do that a bit later.

111
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.260
But for now, of course, let's keep it simple.

112
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.923
Okay, does this make sense?

113
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.020
Let's now go ahead and actually do the same thing here.

114
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.190
So this extends the base layout.

115
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.083
And what exactly does it extend?

116
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.900
Well, it will extend the content block.

117
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.660
And so this one we'll put on the h1,

118
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.180
This is the tour detail page.

119
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.830
So, before testing this, let's quickly recap

120
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.020
what we just did.

121
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.100
So, we want to use this base template here

122
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.330
kind of as our starting point.

123
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.600
So, as a skeleton that has all the HTML stuff,

124
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.815
like this head,

125
00:06:32.815 --> 00:06:36.360
and also the header and the footer,

126
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.610
but not the specific content for each page.

127
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.720
Then, in each of these pages here,

128
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.933
we only have the content for that page itself.

129
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.650
And we can do that because we can

130
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.913
basically inject this content here

131
00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:53.650
into the parent base template by using extend.

132
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.353
So basically, think of this as the opposite of including.

133
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:03.298
Here, this template included two parent templates.

134
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:07.424
This template here included two child templates,

135
00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:10.293
the header and the footer.

136
00:07:12.284 --> 00:07:14.200
So, again, the base is the parent,

137
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.140
and the header and the footer are the children.

138
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.890
So here, the parent included the children.

139
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.740
But with extends, it's the other way around,

140
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.660
where the children, as we can say,

141
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.300
so we can kind of say that the overview

142
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.570
is a child as well of the base,

143
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.160
but here its the child that kind of includes the base.

144
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.883
So, basically, everything that's around this block content.

145
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.960
You can imagine that all of this code here,

146
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.750
all of this which is not the block content

147
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.090
is then copied right into this file.

148
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.843
That's a nice way of imagining how this works.

149
00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:55.360
That allows us to then use here in our route

150
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.430
the overview and the tour templates instead of using base.

151
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.750
But still, of course, using all of this HTML

152
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.620
that we have in here.

153
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.460
Okay, so I hope that makes sense now.

154
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.653
Let's actually go ahead and try this out.

155
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.783
I'm just going to copy the URL.

156
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.913
So now let's write overview.

157
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.350
And so, indeed, we get the h1 which says

158
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.460
This is the tour overview.

159
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.810
And actually let's also use the title variable

160
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.683
that we passed into these templates.

161
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.096
Remember that here we have the title All Tours

162
00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:37.320
on the overview, and then on the tour,

163
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.310
we have The Forest Hiker.

164
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.563
So let's actually put that on the title.

165
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.860
In fact, we can actually do that

166
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.110
right here in the base template.

167
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.850
So when right here in the overview

168
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.140
we extend the base template,

169
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.970
the base template still has access to the locals,

170
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.843
so, to the variables, that we passed into the template.

171
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.300
Here, we can do what we did before,

172
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.973
so, interpolation with the variable, so with the local.

173
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.580
So, all we need to do is put the title here, like this.

174
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.400
And if we now reload,

175
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.823
then you see All Tours here on top.

176
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.573
Now let's try tour.

177
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.420
And so this is the tour detail page,

178
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.833
and up here you see The Forest Hiker Tour.

179
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.660
Now if we load this one

180
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.540
then we should get that placeholder

181
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.230
that we put in the block.

182
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.113
Remember that?

183
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.430
And, indeed, This is the placeholder heading.

184
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.570
Great.

185
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.466
This is a powerful and very important mechanism

186
00:09:44.466 --> 00:09:47.220
for us to understand and to use

187
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.200
for all of the templates that we're going to build

188
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.550
in the rest of the section.

189
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.250
In the next video, we will then finally

190
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.710
clean up a little bit this mess that we have here,

191
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.328
and refactor all of this code here

192
00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:01.303
into some different files.
