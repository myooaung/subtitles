00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.440
<v Instructor>In this video, let's take a look</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.200
at the two types of packages that we can install

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.193
with npm, and also the two type of installs that there are.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
So the two types of packages that we can install

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.419
are simple dependencies or development dependencies.

6
00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.419
Now simple, or regular dependencies, are simply packages

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.880
that contain some code that we will include in our own code.

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.598
So code upon which we built our own application,

9
00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:37.390
and that's why we actually call them dependencies,

10
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.580
because our project and our code depend on them

11
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.130
to work correctly.

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.920
For example, Express, which is, again,

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.050
the Node framework that we're gonna be using

14
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.943
later in the course,

15
00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:50.478
that'll be a dependency.

16
00:00:50.478 --> 00:00:54.637
So let's now install our very first dependency

17
00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.580
just to show you how it works.

18
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.410
And the package that we're gonna install is called Slugify,

19
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.780
which is a small tool that we can use

20
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.490
to make more readable URLs out of names.

21
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.410
For example, like product names in the case

22
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.698
of our node form example.

23
00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:16.579
So in order to install a simple dependency in npm,

24
00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.579
all we have to do is say npm install,

25
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.760
and then the name of the package,

26
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.187
which is simply Slugify.

27
00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:31.629
In previous versions, you would also have to say

28
00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:35.660
dash dash save, like this,

29
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.196
but right now that's no longer necessary.

30
00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:42.440
So if you just specify npm install slugify,

31
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.250
it'll then install this package as a regular dependency.

32
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.020
And watch what happens to our package.json file

33
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.803
once that installation is done.

34
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.060
So we'll hit return now, and let's see what happens.

35
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.340
And actually, that was really fast

36
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.690
and it installed our package right away,

37
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.650
and then created this new field here called dependencies,

38
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.163
and put our first dependency, Slugify, right in there.

39
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.240
It also then has the version of the package,

40
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.480
but we're gonna talk a bit more about that later

41
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.353
in this section.

42
00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:23.410
This is our first dependency,

43
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.960
and again, this is just a regular dependency.

44
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.973
And we will use Slugify right in the next video,

45
00:02:30.863 --> 00:02:35.863
so just to get a sense of how we use these

46
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.910
third party dependencies in our code.

47
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.720
But right now, what I want to show you

48
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.650
is that besides these regular dependencies,

49
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.390
we also have development dependencies.

50
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.140
And these are usually just tools for development,

51
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.540
for example like a code bundler like Webpack,

52
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.310
or a debugger tool or a testing library.

53
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.200
So these are development dependencies.

54
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.330
They are not needed for production,

55
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.290
so our code does not really depend on them,

56
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.910
we simply use them to develop our applications.

57
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.640
So let's now install a dev dependency,

58
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.350
which is just a short name for development dependency,

59
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.090
and the tool that we're gonna install

60
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.160
is called nodemon.

61
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.160
So npm install nodemon, like this,

62
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.030
and then what we have to do to specify

63
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.473
that this is a development dependency is to say save dev,

64
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.390
and so this will then add an entry to this package.json

65
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.160
in the dev dependencies.

66
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.661
So let's actually take a look at that

67
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:46.360
once this is done installing.

68
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.330
Now nodemon is a very nice tool that helps us develop

69
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.749
Node JS applications by automatically restarting

70
00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:58.250
the Node application whenever we change some files

71
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.870
in our working directory.

72
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.850
So remember that in the project,

73
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.300
I was actually closing down the server all the time

74
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.530
and then restarting it each time

75
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.240
that I was changing the code.

76
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.810
But with this tool, that's no longer necessary.

77
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.200
So it will automatically restart the server each time

78
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.283
that we do a change.

79
00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:21.290
So it's now done installing,

80
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.850
and it created a new field called dev dependencies,

81
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.720
and then of course added nodemon in there.

82
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.473
And so our project now basically knows

83
00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:34.805
that we depend on this tool here to develop our application,

84
00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:38.853
and this package here to actually build our code base.

85
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.470
So these are the two types of packages.

86
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.050
Now let's also talk about the two types of installs

87
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.330
of these packages,

88
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.250
because right now all we did was to install

89
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.010
these packages locally,

90
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.658
so they only work in this project

91
00:04:57.658 --> 00:05:00.010
and we can actually see that right here

92
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.390
in our project folder

93
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.800
because npm created this new folder

94
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.963
called node modules for us.

95
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.329
It has all the dependencies of our project.

96
00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:13.501
But now you might ask, well we only specified

97
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:16.214
Slugify and nodemon,

98
00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:20.658
so what are all of these packages doing here?

99
00:05:20.658 --> 00:05:23.490
Well, that's simply because they in turn

100
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.573
are dependencies of our dependencies.

101
00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:31.400
If, for example, Slugify needs one of these packages,

102
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.130
well, then npm will install these dependencies as well.

103
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.090
And so we end up with all of these dependencies here

104
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.443
in our project.

105
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.600
So these are for local modules,

106
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.720
so Slugify and nodemon, again,

107
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.360
we just installed them locally in our project folder

108
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.790
and they're not gonna work anywhere else.

109
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.170
But with npm, we can also have global installs,

110
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.460
and global installs will then be available anywhere,

111
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.980
not just our project folder,

112
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.490
but in every folder across your entire machine.

113
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.360
So a package should be installed globally

114
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.530
when it provides an executable command that you can run

115
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.000
from the command line interface.

116
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.260
And nodemon, for example, is one tool like that.

117
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.000
So I use nodemon in all Node projects that I work on,

118
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.530
and so I have nodemon installed as a global dependency

119
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.710
because that way I don't have to install it each time

120
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.830
that I'm creating a new project.

121
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.880
I can simply use it in a new project

122
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.083
because it's already installed globally.

123
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.620
So let's now actually do that.

124
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.560
Clear the console here,

125
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.780
and then install it globally.

126
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.480
So npm install,

127
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.290
and there's actually a shorthand for install.

128
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.963
It actually is enough to just write i, like this.

129
00:06:58.963 --> 00:07:02.990
That's actually usually how I do it.

130
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.990
So npm i nodemon, and then flag global.

131
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.283
Hit return now,

132
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:18.010
and so now it is being installed globally.

133
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.460
But it actually gives us this error,

134
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.480
and if you're on a Mac and did it like this,

135
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.370
then it will also give you an error

136
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.635
simply because you don't have the permissions

137
00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:30.446
to install this package.

138
00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:34.190
If you're on a Mac, it doesn't work,

139
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.090
and I believe on Windows it should work,

140
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.770
at least that's the experience that I have,

141
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.370
but if you're on a Mac, you have actually put sudo

142
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.890
in front of it and then put in your password

143
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.750
basically just to give it permission.

144
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.704
Well in my case I have Touch ID,

145
00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:55.720
but if you don't have that,

146
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.560
you can use your user account password.

147
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.700
Anyway, now that works, and we can now start using nodemon

148
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.470
on this project.

149
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.380
So let me actually show you how it works.

150
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.459
So before to run our app, we did it like this.

151
00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:14.459
We wrote node and then index.js.

152
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.460
What I did here now was actually an autocomplete,

153
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.900
and I think I hadn't talked to you about that

154
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.170
at this point,

155
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.030
so let me go ahead and delete this.

156
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.680
So I started typing the i here,

157
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.200
and since there is no other file which starts with an i,

158
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.550
I can now hit tab,

159
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.950
and so it will automatically complete

160
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.613
the rest of the filename for me.

161
00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:40.279
We used to do it like this, then hit return,

162
00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:42.890
and then whenever we wanted to do some change,

163
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.200
we would have to exit it like this,

164
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.370
and restart everything again.

165
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.963
But that's no longer the case because now we have nodemon.

166
00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:55.900
So all we have to do is to instead of writing node,

167
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.293
we write nodemon and then index.js.

168
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.910
Okay, and so now it's watching every file

169
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.093
with every extension.

170
00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:10.892
If we go now back to our file here,

171
00:09:10.892 --> 00:09:13.100
we don't even need to change anything,

172
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.160
all I have to do is to give it a save

173
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.790
and take a look at what happens down here in the console.

174
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.750
So I'll save it now,

175
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.146
and you see restarting due to changes.

176
00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:28.340
Now it start again, node index.js.

177
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.880
So you see that behind the scenes,

178
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.860
it is actually still running the original command

179
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.370
that we used to do, so node index.js,

180
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.210
and so nodemon is basically just a wrapper

181
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.320
around that node command

182
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.642
simply to make our lives a bit easier.

183
00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:48.530
This is an extremely, extremely handy tool

184
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.990
for us to work with Node,

185
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.670
and for rest of the course, I will always be using nodemon

186
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.083
instead of the node command.

187
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.230
And now just to finish, there's one more small thing

188
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.450
that I wanted to show you here.

189
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.120
So let's say we didn't install nodemon globally.

190
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.120
Well, how would we then use our dev dependency here locally?

191
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.800
So the local nodemon that we have installed.

192
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.730
Well, we couldn't simply run it from the command line

193
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.200
because the local dependencies, they don't work like that.

194
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.240
We cannot simply use them right away in the command line,

195
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.990
but what we can do is to specify an npm script

196
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.130
and we do that here in this script field.

197
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.500
When we did npm in it,

198
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.400
it actually put this one script here for us,

199
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.960
which is for testing,

200
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.760
and then simply said that we don't have any test specified.

201
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.800
So that is just like a placeholder for us now,

202
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.143
which we can replace now with start,

203
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:02.420
and then nodemon index.js.

204
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.680
And this nodemon that I'm using here

205
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.690
will actually be the nodemon

206
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.622
coming from the dev dependencies.

207
00:11:09.622 --> 00:11:14.110
Instead of writing the command down here in the command line

208
00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:17.100
like I did here,

209
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.100
I will simply put the same thing into an npm script.

210
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.464
The script is called start in this case,

211
00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:28.660
and now we will be able to run that.

212
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.970
So let me finish this one here.

213
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.880
So this is how we run an npm script,

214
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.763
npm run and start,

215
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.640
and indeed it gives us the command here nodemon index.js,

216
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.858
and now everything works the exact same way as before.

217
00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:50.557
Right?

218
00:11:50.557 --> 00:11:52.580
And this has nothing to do with the fact

219
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.733
that we installed nodemon globally before,

220
00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:58.270
it simply works like this because, again,

221
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:03.210
nodemon is our dev dependency right here in the npm script.

222
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.870
We can then write something

223
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.785
like a command line interface instruction

224
00:12:07.785 --> 00:12:10.640
that it's gonna use that local dependency

225
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.610
and not the global one.

226
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.770
Again, this would've worked just fine

227
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.203
without nodemon installed globally.

228
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.780
This is how you specify npm script,

229
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.666
and we will do a bunch more throughout this course

230
00:12:24.666 --> 00:12:27.750
and we can give them all sorts of names.

231
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.849
Start is kind of a default one for development.

232
00:12:31.849 --> 00:12:33.870
So actually for start,

233
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.973
we don't even have to write npm run start,

234
00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:41.680
but writing npm start is actually enough

235
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.143
to trigger this special command.

236
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.010
So you see again, it works just fine like this.

237
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:49.843
Perfect.

238
00:12:49.843 --> 00:12:52.040
So in this video, you learned the difference

239
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.990
between regular dependencies and development dependencies,

240
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.680
and then you also learned that you can install them

241
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.040
either locally or globally,

242
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.950
or you can also install them in both places, right?

243
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.850
But actually, usually the global dependencies

244
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.370
that we install are usually always development tools

245
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.500
because they are the ones who make more sense

246
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.810
to install like that, again because they usually provide us

247
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.240
like a nice command line interface program.

248
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.070
In the next video, we will then use this dependency

249
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.650
that we installed here actually in our code

250
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.263
so that you learn actually how to include

251
00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:33.733
a third party module into your code.
