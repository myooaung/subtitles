00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.535
<v Instructor>So before moving on to implementing</v>

2
00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:07.060
some more API features, let's now very quickly import

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.120
the rest of our development data.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.913
So data on users, and on reviews.

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.130
So, in our dev data folder,

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.340
we already imported all the tours, right?

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.920
But, we also have a users, and we also have reviews, okay?

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.360
So, I have created a bunch of users for us to work with

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.200
throughout the rest of the course,

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.110
so all of these, I think it's about 20 users,

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.400
and then also a bunch of reviews, okay.

12
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.840
And so, all we need to do now is to basically update

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.840
or import dev data script, so basically duplicate this here.

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.200
So, tours will become users,

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.860
and here tours will become reviews.

16
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.793
Then, we also need to import the other two models,

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.423
so review, and here as well.

18
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.683
Now all right, and now then here,

19
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.393
also, basically duplicate this, user,

20
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.843
and review.

21
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.733
All right.

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.410
And that should probably do with the job, all right.

23
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.160
So, let's go to our other terminal window here, clear this,

24
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.173
and actually the last operation that we did was this one.

25
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.853
So, we need to start by deleting everything we have.

26
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.663
Oh, and I see now that we actually only deleted the tours.

27
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.660
All right, and so we also want to get rid

28
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.600
of all the current users that we have right now

29
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.523
because they are really all just test users, all right.

30
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.440
And the same of course goes for reviews.

31
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.533
So, a gift is a save,

32
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.403
and now deleting all of them,

33
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.223
just taking a quick look into Compass,

34
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.130
and so you see that, indeed, all the users are gone,

35
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.623
and so the same should be true for the other collections.

36
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.470
All right, and so now let's go ahead

37
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.500
and import all of the data.

38
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500
That's gonna take a little bit of time,

39
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.370
and now, we get this validation error here.

40
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.470
Okay, so please confirm your password.

41
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.770
And so, that's basically because we're creating a new user

42
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.353
without specifying the password confirm property.

43
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.140
So, the solution to that is to actually explicitly turn off

44
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.420
the validation in this case, okay?

45
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.160
And, I'm not sure if we have done that before,

46
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.480
but it's actually very easy.

47
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.730
Okay, so all we need to do is to pass in

48
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.370
an additional object with some options,

49
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.260
and actually in this case, just one.

50
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.567
And, the option that we want is validateBeforeSave,

51
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.040
and set it to false.

52
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.080
Okay, and so with this, all of the validation that we do

53
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.790
in the model will basically just be skipped, okay?

54
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.780
Also, another thing that we need to do

55
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.790
in the model is to turn off the password encryption

56
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.360
because the users that we provide already have

57
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.620
an encrypted password here, all right.

58
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.690
And so, here in our user model,

59
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.770
we now basically just need to comment out

60
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.920
all of these (mumbles).

61
00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:42.340
Okay, and so now,

62
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.030
the password encryption step is also gonna be skipped.

63
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.380
So, we'll give this a save,

64
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.573
and now lets, actually, first of all, delete the data again,

65
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.990
just so we don't create any duplicates,

66
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.890
and now let's try it again with import, and yeah.

67
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.750
This time we didn't get any error,

68
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.950
and so let's take a look at that in Compass,

69
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.103
so we have all the users,

70
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.853
we should have all natours as well.

71
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.790
And, indeed, here they are, and also a couple of reviews.

72
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.530
And, you'll see 60 reviews actually I created, okay?

73
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.670
And let's just confirm

74
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.150
that the passwords for users were not encrypted,

75
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.780
so I'm just copying this one here, just this entire line.

76
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.880
Oh, that doesn't work.

77
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.960
So, let's just copy this string here

78
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.950
and then compare with the one we have in our adjacent file.

79
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.083
So, just the first one here,

80
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.060
and yeah, indeed, you see that it looks

81
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.220
exactly the same as this one, right?

82
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.770
And so, just as we wanted,

83
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.920
the passwords were not encrypted this time.

84
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.260
Okay, so let's close all of this,

85
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.010
make sure to remove the comments that we now put here,

86
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.270
so that in the future of course,

87
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.140
new users will then get their passwords encrypted properly.

88
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.500
So, save this, and now I want to quickly take a look

89
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.703
at the data here.

90
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.850
So, in Postman, and the first thing

91
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.323
that I want to do is to actually log in as an administrator.

92
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.740
All right, so let's take a look at the email address,

93
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.233
and so you see it's actually admin@natours.io, okay?

94
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.650
And, of course the password, we cannot retrieve from here,

95
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.460
but I know, of course, what password I specified,

96
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.893
and so we can use that.

97
00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:50.766
And so, the password

98
00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:54.443
for all of the users here is always test1234, okay?

99
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.320
So, that worked.

100
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.530
So, again for all of the 20 users that I created,

101
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.710
the password is always the same, always test1234.

102
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.403
Great, now let's quickly get all tours here as well.

103
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.090
And so, let's actually just remove this filter here.

104
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.000
Okay, and so we get all our natours,

105
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.830
and now you see that all of them now will have guides.

106
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.253
Okay, so this is a lead guide and a normal guide,

107
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.183
and also all of them will have a bunch of reviews.

108
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.310
Somewhere, so that should be here,

109
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.920
but I believe we only populated the reviews

110
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.523
when we get just one tour,

111
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.560
so that's try that here with the (mumbles).

112
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.233
So, I copied the ID so that I can now put it in here.

113
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.733
Let's send that,

114
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.160
so the guides' locations,

115
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.363
and indeed, now we get all of the reviews.

116
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.900
And of course, just like we configured before

117
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.547
here then the user also gets populated,

118
00:07:09.547 --> 00:07:10.803
and the tour does not.

119
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.140
So, everything still works the same,

120
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.460
but now we have a bunch of more real world data

121
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.780
that we can now start working with

122
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.480
throughout the rest of the course.
