00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.530
Congratulations on finishing the complete Node.js, Express

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.860
and MongoDB bootcamp and I hope that you had

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.840
a great time and a lot of fun building this huge project

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.530
and that you walk away from this course now

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.360
really proud of all the new skills that you have learned

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.620
over the last couple of weeks.

7
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.140
However, as you probably know, this is only the beginning

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.990
because now it's really your turn to put in the work

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.793
and practice your new Node.js skills.

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.290
So a good idea is to complete all the challenges

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.150
that I left you in an earlier section,

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.570
or even better of course, start your own project

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.720
that you maybe already had in mind

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.310
before actually taking this course.

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.870
Or if you didn't come into the course

16
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.760
with a clear idea of what you actually wanted to build,

17
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.910
well just let me give you four app suggestions.

18
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.010
So first, you could build a simple quiz application

19
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.390
which would be a nice place to start using your new skills.

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.700
Second, and a bit more complex, you could build

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.593
a forum application. So a bit like Reddit for example.

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.970
Then my third suggestion is

23
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.200
a restaurant management software

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.460
complete with menus, orders, bills, and more,

25
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.160
which of course is usually complex.

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.050
And so if you decide to do this one then really make sure

27
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.490
to take a lot of time to build it

28
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.830
because it won't be easy at all, okay.

29
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.860
And finally number four, if you want to go really crazy.

30
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.030
You can build like a fully-fledged social networking app

31
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.840
like Facebook or Instagram.

32
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.840
So complete with users, posts, comments, likes, et cetera.

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.890
So this one again would be a real challenge.

34
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.060
Anyway, no matter what you end up building,

35
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.590
I really can't wait to see your results.

36
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.390
So please make sure to share your projects

37
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.200
right here on Udemy in the Q&amp;A section

38
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.310
so that we can all take a look

39
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.533
and maybe even give some feedback.

40
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.980
Now another thing that's really important

41
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.870
as a Node.js developer, and really any web developer,

42
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.570
is to keep on top of our ever-changing industry.

43
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.020
And I really know how challenging that can be.

44
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.110
So, in order to help you keeping updated,

45
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.310
I actually created a newsletter where I share

46
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.790
some news, tutorials, and other interesting articles

47
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.440
once per month. So if you want to check that out,

48
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.680
you can just subscribe over at Jonas.io

49
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.550
And now, no matter what your goal is after this course,

50
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.030
I'm absolutely sure that you can achieve it

51
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.530
because I've actually seen students from my other courses

52
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.100
getting real jobs and starting real careers in the industry

53
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.970
right after taking one of these courses

54
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.870
and of course practicing a lot in order to get better

55
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.833
every single day.

56
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.200
Anyway, let's now wrap up the course.

57
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.000
So it was really nice having you here

58
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.490
and to be able to take this journey with you.

59
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.370
So now, good luck with your new Node.js skills,

60
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.253
take care, and I'll see you next time.
