(gentle music)

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.175
<v ->Now that our project is basically finished</v>

3
00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.650
let's deploy it to production onto a platform

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.310
called Heroku.

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.470
Because what good is any project if we can't share

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.200
it with the whole world, right?

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.470
So in this section we're gonna start by setting up Git

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.580
and GitHub.

9
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.600
So in case you're not familiar with these tools yet.

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.995
We then prepare the application for deployment

11
00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:30.100
and then finally really deploy it to Heroku.

12
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.010
So, are you ready for this last step?

13
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.830
Then let's get started.
