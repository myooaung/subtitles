(gentle electronic music)

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,780
<v ->Welcome back to the next section.</v>

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,410
In this one, we will finally start to build

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,680
our big course project,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,010
and the first step in this project

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,180
is to build our own API

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,160
using the most popular Node.js framework

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,700
which is called Express.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,440
So, in the real world,

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,890
everyone uses something like Express

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,360
to actually build Node applications

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,980
because it makes development a lot easier and also faster.

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,890
Now we're still using Node.js, of course,

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,310
and everything that we learned before still applies.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,220
We simply have an easier way of writing Node code,

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,943
and so that's obviously a big win.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,950
So this section is a really exciting one,

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,593
and so let's get started.
