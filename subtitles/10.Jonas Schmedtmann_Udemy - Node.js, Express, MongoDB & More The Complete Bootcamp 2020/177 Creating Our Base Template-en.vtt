00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.290
<v Instructor>Let's now start</v>

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.750
to really create our base template.

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.490
So the template upon which all other templates

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.360
will be based on later.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.723
So basically, we will be converting a regular html file,

6
00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:16.163
that is in the starter files to a Pug template.

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.830
So basically, we're gonna start creating

8
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.850
the layout of this page.

9
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.450
So this header here and also the footer.

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.650
Okay, not the content of course,

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.710
because that we will then build more dynamically

12
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.440
a bit later, okay.

13
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.220
But we will leave everything ready,

14
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.920
so that we can then inject all of this real content

15
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.053
into that overall base template.

16
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.440
So, let's do that now.

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.650
And let's actually start by getting rid

18
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.090
of all of this content that we had here.

19
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.810
So this was really just to show you

20
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.550
the different features of Pug.

21
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.070
And now, let's open this overview.html file,

22
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.463
so that we can basically convert it here to Pug.

23
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.370
Okay, so that was the original html file

24
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.360
that I created to design the overview page

25
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.610
that we just saw dynamically rendered.

26
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.810
Okay, so this is what we have in the head

27
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.950
and actually let's go ahead and copy this entire code,

28
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.053
so that we can then convert what's missing here.

29
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.573
Okay, so the content of our title is this,

30
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.973
and so let's copy it, then get rid,

31
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.980
and so this is the content of the main page, right.

32
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.150
Then we already have the favicon, and also the style.

33
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.980
So what we're missing is basically this stuff here,

34
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.990
for response of web development,

35
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.143
and also this Google font link, okay.

36
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.563
So, starting with that,

37
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.123
so instill a style sheet,

38
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.610
and then let's just grab this reference

39
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.803
and replace it with single quotes.

40
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.650
Okay, then I also want to define these two

41
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.273
so let's cut them here,

42
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.323
and let's simply convert whatever we have here.

43
00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.932
All right.

44
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.473
Oh and also the single quotes.

45
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.223
Okay, let's actually put this one at the end,

46
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.730
and so, that is our hat for our template.

47
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.993
Next up, let's take a look at the header.

48
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.143
Okay, so basically we have this whole element here,

49
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.600
with just a header so that dark gray bar

50
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.140
that you saw there at the top of the page.

51
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.430
And so let's copy this

52
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.530
and put it right here.

53
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.180
So, that's a lot of code

54
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.800
and you will see how little code it will actually be later,

55
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.920
once we translate this to Pug.

56
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.480
Okay, and here let's now actually put a visible comment

57
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.370
into our html, saying HEADER.

58
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.070
Okay, and so actually, that's without the dash.

59
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.020
So in VS code, when I hit the comment shortcut,

60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.860
then it automatically creates a Pug comment.

61
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.320
But here, I really just want one comment,

62
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.833
that's also available in the html output.

63
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.690
So anyway, let's now create the header element,

64
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.040
and let's see what we have here.

65
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.120
So we have header with the class of header.

66
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.680
And all we need to do to specify a class,

67
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.330
is DOT and then the class name.

68
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.410
So, header again.

69
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.530
Then, in there, we have an element nav.

70
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.480
And so, indentation, and then nav.nav

71
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.537
which is the class name here again,

72
00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:22.200
and then we also have another class name,

73
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.880
and so, another dot.

74
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.713
And that's it.

75
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.550
So nav tours.

76
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.290
So, if you're familiar a bit with CSS architecture,

77
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.620
maybe you're seeing that I'm using the BEM architecture.

78
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.660
And so, nav is the block

79
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.260
and then here this tours is a modifier.

80
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.500
And here these underscore underscore

81
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.180
means that this is a block

82
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.560
or actually an element.

83
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.293
So block, element, and modifier.

84
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.290
Okay, so that's not really important,

85
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.890
but I just wanted to mention it.

86
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.120
Anyway, inside of the navigation,

87
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.270
we have a link element.

88
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.920
So, a, with the class of nav__el.

89
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.330
Then here, we have this href attribute,

90
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.973
and so, remember for that we use parentheses,

91
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.063
and then href,

92
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.890
and set it to nothing.

93
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.020
So basically, that's what this hash here means.

94
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.470
And then, simply the content,

95
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.673
so all tours.

96
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.450
Next up, we have this form here,

97
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.720
but actually we're not going to implement that

98
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.240
at this point.

99
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.543
So let's get rid of it.

100
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.090
All right and so this is our navigation.

101
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.230
So, this code here

102
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.200
is basically equivalent to this.

103
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.993
And so next up, we have this header logo.

104
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.350
So, new line, but one level back,

105
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.100
in the indentation so that it's on the same level

106
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.680
as the navigation.

107
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.930
So, just as it is here, right.

108
00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.980
Now when it's a div,

109
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.980
we don't even have to say div.headerlogo, in this case.

110
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.350
So, when it's a div,

111
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.820
which is kind of the standard block element in html,

112
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.980
all we need is the dot

113
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.873
and then that will automatically create a div element.

114
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.713
Then in there, we have this image,

115
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.980
and so that of course needs a couple of attributes,

116
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.693
which is first, the source.

117
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.937
So image, logo, white.png,

118
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.433
and then also the alternative text, okay.

119
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.690
Next up, we have this other navigation here,

120
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.820
and so again, that's on the same level

121
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.293
as the first navigation and this div.

122
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.750
So one level back in the indentation

123
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.680
and create a new nav element with the class nav

124
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.763
and the class nav user.

125
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.950
Then in there, there's a link,

126
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.130
very similar to this one,

127
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.160
so let's just copy it to save ourselves some time.

128
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.293
And then here it says, My bookings.

129
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.470
Then another one, and actually let's just copy it again

130
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.380
with the difference that it doesn't have this content,

131
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.070
but instead it has some more content inside of it.

132
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.470
So, this.

133
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.023
So, very easy again,

134
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.633
image, with the source, .jpg.

135
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.853
And it also has a class name,

136
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.420
so let's edit here with the dot.

137
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.713
So, nav, user image.

138
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.810
And then simply a span saying Jonas.

139
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.120
And, as you can see,

140
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.960
this is actually going to be the dynamic part

141
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.350
of this header.

142
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.000
And so actually all of this here will become a dot

143
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.675
in the beginning.

144
00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:11.675
Okay, but anyway, let's now finish coding up this part here.

145
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.620
So basically, these two buttons,

146
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.520
so the login button and the sign up button.

147
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.120
So, of course you will not have the login

148
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.920
and the sign up button at the same time

149
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.680
of having this user navigation here.

150
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.590
So my bookings and then the name of the user, okay.

151
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.250
But again, let's put that here for now,

152
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.553
and then comment out what we don't need.

153
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.860
So, button, nav element, and also nav element

154
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.043
and then the modifier cta for sign up.

155
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.847
And actually there's also one before that for login, right.

156
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.837
So, that's this one.

157
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.730
Okay and so that's actually it.

158
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.940
So that's the header,

159
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.010
and you see that this code here

160
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.550
is equivalent to all of this what we have here

161
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.070
which looks a lot more confusing,

162
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.653
if you ask me at least.

163
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.690
So, delete that, and so as I said,

164
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.920
this user navigation here,

165
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.200
this part is only gonna be available

166
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.010
when someone is logged in.

167
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.123
And so for now, let's completely comment all of this out.

168
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.370
All right, so next up we have the content

169
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.350
and so let's add another comment here

170
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.050
and in our html,

171
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.010
actually all that we're gonna add now

172
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.350
is this section here with the class of overview.

173
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.430
Because then in there is where we have

174
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.160
all of these content cards,

175
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.070
which again, for now, we will not include there.

176
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.400
So again, what we're doing now

177
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.623
is really just a skeleton, so to say.

178
00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:03.123
All right, so section.overview.

179
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.243
Overview.

180
00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:12.500
And for now, let's simply put an h1 here

181
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.040
with the name of the tour that's coming in as a variable.

182
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.270
Okay and of course this section here

183
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.103
needs to be at the same level as this header, great.

184
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.820
So all we're missing now is the footer

185
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.700
at the end of the page.

186
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.690
So let's go there and here we go.

187
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.790
Let's grab all of this.

188
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.040
And this should actually be a footer element,

189
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.393
not just a regular div.

190
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.730
So a footer element with the class of footer,

191
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.573
then a div, with the class of footer logo,

192
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.493
and so again, I don't even need to specify the div element.

193
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.323
Then we have an image here,

194
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:12.810
.png and so I hope that typing all of this out by yourself,

195
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.820
by hand basically, makes you keep this knowledge

196
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.030
on how all of this works a bit better.

197
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.330
Okay, so this is alt

198
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.520
and now this footer navigation,

199
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.033
so an unordered list,

200
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.483
and now in there, we have a couple of list item elements.

201
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.620
So list item, and then in there

202
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.470
there is a link in each of them.

203
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:46.470
So, a with the href of nowhere basically.

204
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.490
And then, About us.

205
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.170
Now, here in this situation,

206
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.298
needing this extra line only for specifying this li,

207
00:11:57.298 --> 00:11:58.640
is not really ideal.

208
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.010
And so what we can do here,

209
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.310
is to use a colon, like this,

210
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.840
and then basically put it all on the same line.

211
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.730
And so this will then still work

212
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.570
as if there was a new line with an indentation,

213
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.910
but basically allowing us to do it all on the same line.

214
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.810
Okay, then for some reason,

215
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.180
the syntax highlighting stops working,

216
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.343
but well, that's not that important.

217
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.453
So download the applications,

218
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.873
become a guide, careers.

219
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.053
And that's actually it.

220
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.520
Next up, we have this footer, copyright,

221
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.100
and so in here we have just a bunch of text.

222
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.943
So it specify the copyright symbol here,

223
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.670
and that's by Jonas Schmedtmann.

224
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.100
So, that's me and just like in all my other courses,

225
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.290
I want you to know that you are free

226
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.120
to basically use this project for yourself.

227
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.550
So basically to put it in your portfolio

228
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.270
or to show anyone that you want,

229
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.630
that you built this project in my course.

230
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.030
Now what you cannot do

231
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.310
is to create your own course based on this project.

232
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.970
And it's sad that I even have to say this,

233
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.980
but of course there have been people who used my project,

234
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.270
basically to put some free courses on YouTube,

235
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.410
where they copied my projects, one by one.

236
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.473
Okay, so let me just write that out here.

237
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.593
For your own purposes,

238
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.850
except producing of course, your own courses or tutorials.

239
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.213
Okay and that's actually it.

240
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.500
All right, so that is the translation

241
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.400
of the skeleton basically that we have here,

242
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.560
of course excepting the content.

243
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.753
Okay, so we don't longer need that.

244
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.000
And, just to finish, let's take a quick look

245
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.640
and indeed, here goes our content.

246
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.650
Now this here looks a bit out of place

247
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.883
because this copyright text here is so long.

248
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.330
So, this footer navigation basically.

249
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.540
But since that is a flex container,

250
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.270
we should be able to fix that

251
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.270
with justified content, flex-end, not this one.

252
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.660
Okay, and don't worry if you're not familiar with CSS,

253
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.180
or even Flexbox this is just

254
00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.200
to just simply visually fix the small problem

255
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.050
that we had here.

256
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.723
So let's search for footer here.

257
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.893
Here we are.

258
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.303
Fix that here,

259
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.790
and if we now reload,

260
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.993
yeah then we're good, perfect.
