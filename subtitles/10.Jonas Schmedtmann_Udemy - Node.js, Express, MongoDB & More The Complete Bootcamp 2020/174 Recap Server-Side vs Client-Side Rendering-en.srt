1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,660
<v Instructor>And before starting,</v>

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,610
let's just do a quick recap of server-side

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,440
and client-side rendering.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,860
And also, I wanna show you in this video

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,850
the server-side rendered website that we're gonna build

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,393
over the next couple of hours.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,680
So, remember how in client-side rendering,

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,600
the actual building of the website

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,720
happens on the client side.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,330
And for that, we need a data source,

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,722
which is usually an API that sends data

12
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:30,590
to the client as requested.

13
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,600
So, that is what we've been building up

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,490
until this point in the course.

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,750
But now that you've mastered that part,

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,900
it's time to move on to server-side rendering

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,030
and actually build the website on the server.

18
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,780
And the main aspect of server-side rendering

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,930
is building the actual HTML,

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,140
basically because that's where all our data will be stored.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,480
And for doing that, we use templates,

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,090
which have placeholders

23
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,960
where we will then inject our data as necessary.

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,200
So, whenever there is a request,

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,170
let's say for the homepage,

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,172
we then get the necessary data from the database,

27
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,280
inject it into a template,

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,410
which will then output HTML,

29
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,610
and finally send that HTML,

30
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,890
along with CSS and JavaScript

31
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,990
and image files, back to the client.

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,320
Pretty straightforward, right?

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,290
Now, we can still then use the API

34
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,640
for some of the things on the front end,

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
and actually, we're also gonna be doing that.

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,600
Okay, anyway, let me now show you

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,150
what we're actually going to build in this section.

38
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,900
So, this is the final rendered Natours website,

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,000
and it's actually live at www.natours.dev,

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
and so if you feel like it,

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,193
just go ahead

42
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,150
and open this page in your browser now,

43
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,500
and take a look.

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,360
You will have to specify this W-W-W, okay?

45
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,320
Otherwise, it's not going to work.

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,760
Anyway, here you see all of the tours

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,060
that we've been working with

48
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,020
as we were building our API,

49
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,940
and all the data here really is the exact same.

50
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,133
So, all of our nine tours are here,

51
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,920
right,

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,800
and so again, this is exactly

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,700
what we're gonna be building in this section.

54
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's take a look at one of the detail pages here.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,100
So, the Park Camper,

56
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,170
and so indeed, you have the average rating.

57
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,773
You have all the tour guides.

58
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,600
You have then some pictures.

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,870
You have all the locations and displayed on a map, actually.

60
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,610
And you also have the review.

61
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,060
And these, again, are the real reviews

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,380
coming from real users in the database.

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,940
So, if you were to check out this tour

64
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,363
here in Postman, let's say,

65
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,250
so let's get all tours here first

66
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,100
just to get the ID of the Park Camper.

67
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,393
So, Sea Explorer,

68
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,003
City Wanderer,

69
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,880
so where is that?

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,233
Ah, here's the Park Camper.

71
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,123
So, if we get this tour now,

72
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,650
then you will see that, for example,

73
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,690
the tour guides are the exact same people.

74
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,123
So, there's Aarav, Ben, and Kate,

75
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,410
and so, indeed, they are the people

76
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,080
who are actually the tour guides.

77
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,730
So, these three,

78
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,210
and again, the reviews are also the ones

79
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,890
from Ayla, Laura, Isabel, and Alexander,

80
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,690
plus these other ones over there, as well.

81
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,640
And so, if we check out the reviews here,

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,807
then indeed, they are coming from Ayla

83
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:43,090
and Laura and Isabel and...

84
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,150
Yeah, so really, you see that this data

85
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,520
really is the underlaying data from which

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,023
this website here is dynamically generated, okay?

87
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,260
Then, we can also log in,

88
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,890
and any of the users that we have

89
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,353
in the database will work for that.

90
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,723
So, if we take a look at one of our users,

91
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,620
so, for example, let's use Steve here,

92
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,593
which is actually a tour guide.

93
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,093
So, we take the example,

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,630
use the email,

95
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,563
and the password is, as always,

96
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,010
test1234.

97
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,070
Okay, so we log in,

98
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,880
and this actually happens behind the scenes

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,390
using our API.

100
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,120
Okay, and so now, here we have Steve.

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,663
We can even open his account.

102
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,780
We can then change the password,

103
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,720
and that, again, is going to happen

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,840
behind the scenes using the exact API endpoint

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,083
that we built for a user changing his password.

106
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,610
You can then also check out the bookings

107
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,460
of this particular user,

108
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,180
which in this case, shouldn't be any

109
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,170
because he's a tour guide.

110
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,773
So, you see it's empty here,

111
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,970
but anyways...

112
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,520
Yeah, that's what I wanted to show you

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,800
because this is what we will be doing

114
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,130
throughout the rest of this section.

115
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,980
So, I hope you're excited about that,

116
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,000
as I am,

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,573
and so let's now get started.
