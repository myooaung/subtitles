1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,760
<v Instructor>All right, in this lecture,</v>

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,720
we're going to talk about something called

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,910
nested routes, what they are,

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,690
why we need them, and how we can

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,163
actually implement them in Express.

6
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:15,470
Let's think for a second how in practice,

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,566
we actually want to create a new review.

8
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:21,520
Up until this point, when creating new reviews,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,020
we always manually passed the tour ID

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,920
and the user ID into the request body,

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,300
and then created the review from there, right.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,180
That's okay during development, but of course,

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,980
that's not how a review will

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,433
be created in the real world.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,610
So, in the real world, the user ID

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,010
should ideally come from the currently logged in user

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,740
and a tour ID should come from the current tour.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,700
That should ideally be encoded

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,877
right in the route, so in the URL.

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,300
When submitting a post request for a new review,

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,140
we will want to submit that to a URL like this.

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,143
Let's write that down here just as a comment.

23
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:08,869
Ideally, we will want to do a request

24
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:13,869
for post, for tour, and the ID of the tour,

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,343
it doesn't really matter here, and then reviews.

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,100
Okay, so now, just like this,

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,580
we have the tour ID right in the URL

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,030
and the user ID will then also come

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,913
from the currently logged in user.

30
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,330
What we see here is now a so-called nested route.

31
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,330
They make a lot of sense when there is

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,570
a clear parent-child relationship between resources.

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,840
That is clearly the case here, right.

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,530
Reviews is clearly a child of tour.

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,320
This nested route basically means

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,580
to access the reviews resource

37
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,810
on the tour's resource, all right.

38
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,420
In the same way, we will actually also want to

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,193
access reviews from a certain tour in the same way.

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,560
Let's say then a get request,

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,650
and again for tour slash tour ID and slash reviews.

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,390
This would then ideally get us

43
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,583
all the reviews for this tour.

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,110
We could go even further

45
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,653
and also specify the ID of the review.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,490
So again, just a random string here,

47
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,703
but you get the point.

48
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,550
In this case, we would get review

49
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,420
with the ID of this here

50
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,603
on the tour with this ID.

51
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,520
This is what nested routes are all about.

52
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,220
This is a way more easier way of reading

53
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,795
and understanding how the API works for our API users.

54
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:47,130
It's way easier then messing around with

55
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,100
query strings and all that stuff like that.

56
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,580
Also, it really shows how there is

57
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,850
this clear relationship between these resources,

58
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,610
again, reviews and tours.

59
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,410
All right, but enough talk.

60
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,510
Let's now actually implement this

61
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,600
starting with the post route.

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,100
Now, since the route actually starts with tours,

63
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,150
it will be of course redirected to our tour router.

64
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,600
We're going to have to implement this functionality

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,890
at least for now, in the tour router,

66
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,530
even though that seems a bit counter-intuitive

67
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,793
since we're in fact, dealing with reviews.

68
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,650
But again, for now, let's implement it like this.

69
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,690
We come to our user router

70
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,550
and first, since we're actually

71
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,870
going to use reviews here,

72
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,483
we need to import the review controller.

73
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,140
Controller require.

74
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,763
Maybe I should have just copied the line from before.

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,693
Controllers, and review controller.

76
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,010
All right, now here at the very bottom,

77
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,730
and let's actually get our code

78
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,970
for this example from here

79
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,223
just as a reference.

80
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:15,750
So that we can now actually implement it.

81
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,910
The route that we're going to implement here is

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,673
slash ID and then reviews.

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,600
This tour part here, as you already know,

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,457
is where we mounted this router

85
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:33,300
and so therefore, we do not have to repeat it here.

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,090
But then, we have the tour ID and then slash reviews.

87
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,590
In order to make this really clear,

88
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,440
let's actually call it tour ID

89
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,040
since we're now dealing with

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,440
different resources here.

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,363
So it's a bit clearer to really call it what it is.

92
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:55,844
We now want to implement the create review.

93
00:04:55,844 --> 00:04:58,094
Authcontroller dot protect.

94
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,403
We also want to restrict access only to users,

95
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:15,805
and then of course, our review controller dot create

96
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,033
review, all right.

97
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,000
Again, it is a bit weird and counter-intuitive

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,880
to actually call the review controller

99
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,593
here in the user route.

100
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,273
Well actually, it should not be in the user route.

101
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,990
For some reason, I opened the user routes

102
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,140
and not the tour routes, so sorry for that one.

103
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,403
Let's cut it from here, come to our tour routes,

104
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,320
and actually do it here at the bottom.

105
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:52,523
Of course we also need to get the review controller.

106
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,580
So now we should be good to go.

107
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,640
That was a stupid bug.

108
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,920
But anyway, what I was saying is that

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,610
it doesn't make much sense to actually call

110
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,720
the review controller in the tour route,

111
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,300
but again, for now, we need to do it like this

112
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,000
because the route starts with tour.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,680
It's this router that will get activated.

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,460
In the next video, we're going to fix that,

115
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,350
but for now, we just want to make it work

116
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,870
and to become familiar with

117
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,840
this whole concept of nested routes.

118
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,540
Anyway, we now got our tour ID right in the route,

119
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,880
but of course, we need to let

120
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,250
the controller know that it should now use this tour ID

121
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,113
and also the currently logged in user's ID.

122
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,240
We now need to go ahead

123
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,400
and update our review controller

124
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,433
right here at create review.

125
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:56,370
What we're going to do is this.

126
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,360
We will say, if there is no request dot body

127
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,210
dot tour, so basically if we didn't specify

128
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,180
the tour ID and the body,

129
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,870
then we want to define that

130
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,603
as the one coming from the URL.

131
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,373
Req dot body dot tour equals request,

132
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,910
and now remember how that URL parameter

133
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,850
is on request dot params and then of course,

134
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,603
the name of the parameter itself, so tour ID.

135
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,640
This is the first part and second,

136
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,060
we also need to do the same with the user.

137
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,740
If there is no request dot user,

138
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,710
or actually, request dot body dot user,

139
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,180
well then the request dot body dot user

140
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,910
should be request dot user dot ID.

141
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,520
And again, we get request dot user from

142
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,193
the protect middleware, and that's actually it.

143
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:11,130
Let's just put a comment here, nested routes.

144
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,120
With this, we actually make it so

145
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,700
that the user can still specify manually

146
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,603
the tour and the user ID.

147
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:21,860
What we're doing here is simply

148
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,250
to define them when they are not there

149
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,343
or when they are not specified in the request body.

150
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:32,263
This should be enough for us to test this now.

151
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,320
All right, so let's take a look

152
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,853
at the users that we got at this point.

153
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,610
We have these two regular users,

154
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,610
we have the test user and we have Jonas here,

155
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,390
but we forgot his password.

156
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,550
Let's go ahead and delete this user

157
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,730
and create a new one.

158
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,730
All right, so in Compass, the users,

159
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,773
and it's this one.

160
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,723
Let's recreate this user basically.

161
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,793
All we really need is these two pieces of data.

162
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,543
Actually that's sign up.

163
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,310
The same name, the same email

164
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,743
and the same password as well.

165
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:38,690
At this point, we are already logged in as this user,

166
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,170
so-called Jonas, let's keep that in mind.

167
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,950
Next up, we need to choose which tour

168
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,600
we actually want to create the review on.

169
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,790
Let's again do it here at The Forest Hiker

170
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,773
so that then we get multiple reviews on the same tour.

171
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,090
What we're going to now

172
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,380
is to basically access that nested route

173
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,430
that we just created.

174
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,350
We have the tours.

175
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,980
Now we need to get the tour ID,

176
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,050
and again, we're going to use this one

177
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,323
for The Forest Hiker,

178
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,430
and then slash reviews,

179
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,283
and then remember a post.

180
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,963
Then we also need to specify the authorization,

181
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,010
so bearer token, and then now in the body,

182
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,610
all we really need is to

183
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,673
specify the rating and the review.

184
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,860
The rating is five

185
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,160
and then some text here.

186
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,913
So this should actually already be enough to try this out.

187
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,753
Let's send it.

188
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,520
Now we don't have permission to perform this action,

189
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,100
for some reason, so that's weird.

190
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,460
We signed up as this Jonas,

191
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,610
and it's actually just a normal user

192
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,203
like it's supposed to be.

193
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,533
Let's take a look at our router.

194
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:17,170
Here, oh okay, it's user, not users.

195
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,930
A small bug like that can, as you see,

196
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,333
crash this entire route, so let's try it again now.

197
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,750
And now we actually get the final review

198
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,300
with both the tour and the user correctly defined.

199
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,140
At least I hope so.

200
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,250
The tour ID, you see, ends here in 951,

201
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,260
and so it's exactly the same here.

202
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,640
The user is this 1f3, and so indeed,

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,343
it is this exact same one.

204
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,280
All right, and so now we should actually be able

205
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,170
to confirm that, and so this get tour here

206
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,230
is actually already the one that we were

207
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,165
creating the new review on.

208
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:04,460
Let's take a look, and indeed,

209
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,660
we now get two reviews.

210
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,140
This one is the one that we just created.

211
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,790
It is on the correct tour and of course,

212
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,450
also the correct user with the name of Jonas.

213
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,973
Awesome, that's really cool.

214
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,520
Let's go ahead and save this.

215
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,720
I'm going to create a new folder here again.

216
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,473
I'm going to call it tours slash reviews.

217
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:33,663
Now in here, let's create,

218
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:39,705
create new review on tour.

219
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,537
That should actually be outside and just like this.

220
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:56,103
Let's actually put that one here.

221
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,293
It doesn't really work as it should for some reason.

222
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,403
And here we go.

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,260
All right, that worked just fine,

224
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,870
but as I mentioned before, the implementation

225
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,450
is a bit confusing at this point.

226
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,890
And again, that is because we technically defined

227
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,333
a review route in the tour router.

228
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,650
That's a bit confusing, and so in the next video,

229
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,193
we are going to fix that.
