(light playful music)

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,520
<v ->So now that you know all about back-end development,</v>

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,310
it's time to dive really deep into how Node.js

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,003
actually works behind the scenes.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,970
So you're gonna learn all about the Node.js architecture,

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,810
events and the event loop,

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,480
streams, modules, and more.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,650
And the kind of knowledge that you will gain

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,030
from these videos will really set you apart

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,530
from other Node developers out there.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,170
And that is the whole reason

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,150
why I always include these kind of more theory lectures

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,750
into my courses.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,780
Now, most people absolutely love them.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,400
But some students just want to write code

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,010
as fast as possible, which also kind of makes sense.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,860
But no matter how you feel about theory lectures,

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,240
I invite you to at least try out some of them.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,700
And this is actually more of a mix

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,200
of theory and code lectures,

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,923
so that you can immediately apply what you learned.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,670
Anyway, I'm actually really happy

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,810
with the quality of this content,

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,960
and also really excited about sharing this with you now.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,180
So again, I'm sure that this kind of content

26
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,370
can absolutely give you a competitive edge

27
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,641
over some other junior Node developers.

28
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:22,808
