1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,350
<v ->Hello and welcome to this complete Node.js, Express</v>

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,920
and MongoDB bootcamp.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,290
I'm really happy to welcome you to this huge course today.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,130
And I promise you came to the right place

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,210
if you want to start building your own modern

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,610
and powerful backend applications

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,453
with Node.js and all the related modern technologies.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,820
Now before we really start this course,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,140
let's take five quick minutes or so

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,482
to talk about what's included in the course,

11
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,430
how the course is gonna work

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,160
and also how to ask questions

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,370
and let me start by giving you a quick overview

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,270
of how the course is organized,

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,580
the projects that we're gonna code together

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,090
and also what exactly you are going to learn.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,290
So, the course is basically divided into four big parts,

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,600
the absolute Node.js basics,

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,970
how backend development

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,070
and Node.js actually work

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,006
and then part three and four

22
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:06,750
are for the complete real-world Natours project

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,350
which really is the main part of this course.

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,490
And this project has two parts

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,660
because the same application contains both a RESTful API

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,990
and a server-side rendered website based on the same data.

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,183
So, let's now look at each part in more detail.

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,120
And we're gonna kick off the course in part one

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,920
which is section two

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,480
by building this small fun project

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,040
with will teach you the fundamentals of Node.js development

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,440
so that you get a solid foundation

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,700
for the rest of the course.

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,970
Then in part two, you're gonna learn the fundamentals

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,660
of backend development

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,640
and also how Node.js actually works behind the scenes

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,110
and this is gonna be a mix of theory

38
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,170
and coding lectures designed

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,190
to give you the knowledge that many other Node developers

40
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,700
out there simply don't have.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,693
And this content is in sections three and four.

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,970
Section five then is just a quick optional section

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,440
to bring you up to speed

44
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,820
with JavaScript promises and async await.

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,714
So, just in case you're not familiar

46
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:15,763
with these modern tools yet.

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,950
In the third part,

48
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,240
we finally start building the Natours project.

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,060
So, in this part three,

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,650
from section six, all the way to section 11,

51
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,110
we design and build the API

52
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,350
and for that we take a deep dive into the Express framework,

53
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,000
MongoDB and Mongoose.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,970
You will also learn all about real network applications,

55
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,570
routing, CRUD operations, data modeling,

56
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,410
geospatial data using the MVC architecture,

57
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,470
modern authentication with JSON web tokens,

58
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,730
authorization, security, error handling

59
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,683
and so much more.

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,950
Then in part four of the course

61
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,110
after the finished API,

62
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,570
we are ready to build the rendered website

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,210
using PUG templates

64
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,430
to really bring the project to life

65
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,530
with a beautiful user interface

66
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,960
and by the way, I decided to do the API first

67
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,450
and the website later

68
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,780
because this way we already have all the work related

69
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,760
to data out of the way.

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,520
And can then focus exclusively on building the website.

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,700
So, section 12 and 13 are for exactly that

72
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,980
plus you will learn how to accept credit card payments

73
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,870
with Stripe, how to upload files

74
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,895
and how to send emails using multiple tools

75
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:41,420
and finally, to finish,

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,310
we will also deploy our application to production

77
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,430
with Heroku, so you see,

78
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,720
there is so much content coming up

79
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,247
and this is really just an overview.

80
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:57,070
Now anyway, this is probably not the first online course

81
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,230
that you're taking

82
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,290
but I still want to say a few words

83
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,483
about how I think that this course should be taken.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,507
So, first and this is pretty obvious,

85
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,270
in all the coding videos,

86
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,650
you should always code along with me

87
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,300
so that we really build all the projects together.

88
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,180
However, in some videos,

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,700
I also included some challenges

90
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,550
that you should really try to solve by yourself.

91
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,491
Now in all videos, coding or non-coding,

92
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:30,380
I really advise you to take as many notes as possible

93
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,630
because there is so much content in here

94
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,400
and so writing your own notes

95
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,670
can really help you retain the knowledge

96
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,710
as you move through the course.

97
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,570
Finally, I also believe that it's a good idea

98
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,090
to take the entire course from start to finish

99
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,012
so that you don't miss any topics

100
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:50,870
and so that in the end,

101
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,563
your project is exactly the same as mine.

102
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,610
However, I do also understand

103
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,910
that this course runs pretty long

104
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,700
and so, you might not really be interested

105
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,010
in all the topics

106
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,720
and so you can of course just skip videos

107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,820
or entire sections that you don't need

108
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,133
but again, I do advise you to watch all the videos.

109
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,890
And now let's talk about questions.

110
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,410
So, in all the videos,

111
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,790
I always explain every single detail

112
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,870
of the technology that we're using

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,340
or the techniques that I'm showing you

114
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,578
but of course at some point

115
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:28,508
you might still have some questions

116
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,550
or even worse,

117
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,300
you might actually get stuck

118
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,550
because of some problem in your code

119
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,190
or some error message

120
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,580
that you do not really understand

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,220
and nothing is worse than investing all this time

122
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,050
and then not be able to move on in the course

123
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,100
and so, that's why you can always get help here

124
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,430
in the Udemy Q and A area.

125
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,359
So, at the bottom of the video that you're watching,

126
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,500
you will find the question section

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,430
for that specific video

128
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,050
and whenever you do have a question or a problem,

129
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,120
you can first check if another student

130
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,500
has already asked the same thing

131
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,800
and if not, well, then just post your own question

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,270
and of course with as much detail as possible.

133
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,220
And you will then get friendly support

134
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,140
from me or from my team

135
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,333
so that you're back to writing code as fast as possible.

136
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,120
So, I hope you're gonna have a ton of fun

137
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,570
with the course now

138
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,990
that you become a real advanced Node developer

139
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,480
and that you're gonna be able

140
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,465
to build your own amazing backend applications.

141
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:35,460
And with that being said,

142
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,614
let's now finally get started.

143
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:40,197
(upbeat music)
