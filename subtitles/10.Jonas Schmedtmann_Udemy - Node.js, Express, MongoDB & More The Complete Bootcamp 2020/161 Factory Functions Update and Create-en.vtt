00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.270
<v Jonas>Let's continue creating some factory functions,</v>

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.793
this time for updating and for creating some resources.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.750
And so, now that we already know how it works,

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.640
it's really simple to just continue doing the same

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.543
for updating.

6
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.413
So exports.updateOne,

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.520
and let's actually go ahead and copy the code again

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.993
from the tour controller.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.832
Okay.

10
00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:30.740
And we have a ton of files now open

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.022
because we're actually changing all of them

12
00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:34.573
kind of at the same time.

13
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.253
So let's copy this,

14
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.850
and paste it here.

15
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.953
And so, what we're interested in is, again, this part.

16
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.530
Okay.

17
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.950
And now, of course, we need to create that factory function

18
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.130
because we don't want to return this.

19
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.120
Instead, we want to return a function,

20
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.210
which is then, in turn, going to return this.

21
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.043
Right?

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.240
So that's very simple.

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.480
We use a simple arrow function where we pass in the model

24
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.300
and then implicitly return whatever comes after the arrow.

25
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.773
So, all of this.

26
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.663
All right.

27
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.010
So just like before, let's replace the specific model

28
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.460
with a general one,

29
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.453
and then replace all of this here with document.

30
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.030
Or actually, with doc, as we did it before.

31
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.443
And here it's no document,

32
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
and then down here, where we actually send the data,

33
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.730
it would be nice to actually give it the property name

34
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.370
of the data that we're sending.

35
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.370
For example, reviews, and then the document, or tours.

36
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.173
Okay.

37
00:01:49.173 --> 00:01:52.600
But that's a bit too much work to implement it right now.

38
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.630
And so, I'm simply going to leave it like this

39
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.670
where I sent, again, data.

40
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.660
All right.

41
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.010
So went went our data here,

42
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.600
and then the envelope in there is, again,

43
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.923
going to be called data.

44
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.443
All right.

45
00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:08.650
And so, this should work now

46
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.240
because everything else is really just the same.

47
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.936
And so, we can go ahead, get rid of all of this,

48
00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.320
and simply say

49
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.137
factory.updateOne,

50
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.993
pass in the Tour model, and call it a day.

51
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.060
All right?

52
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.323
So, really simple.

53
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.643
Next, the same thing for the users.

54
00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:36.920
So again, we have updateUser.

55
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.190
This route is not yet implemented.

56
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.790
And so, let's simply replace all of this here

57
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.237
with our factory function updateOne.

58
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.850
All right.

59
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.030
And so, just like before, this updateUser function

60
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.600
is only for administrators, okay?

61
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.640
And only for updating data that is not the password,

62
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.640
because remember, whenever we use, where is that,

63
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.240
so whenever we use findById and update,

64
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.890
all the safe middleware is not run.

65
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.160
So remember how we talked about that a couple of times.

66
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.990
And so, again, it's really important

67
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.498
that we do not attempt to change passwords here

68
00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:19.710
using this updateUser.

69
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.810
Okay?

70
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.360
Let's actually write that here.

71
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.473
With this.

72
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.903
Great.

73
00:03:30.903 --> 00:03:32.460
And now, finally, also,

74
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.593
let's put it in the review controller.

75
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.533
All right.

76
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.507
So exports.updateReview,

77
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.260
and then our Review.

78
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.060
So that one is very simple.

79
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.573
Let's now go ahead and add these routes to Postman, as well.

80
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.703
So we have Delete Review,

81
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.840
and now let's simply add it here as PATCH.

82
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.830
And the thing we also need to still implement the route

83
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.280
in the review router.

84
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.130
So let's do that as well.

85
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.130
But first, I'm going to save it here in reviews.

86
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.443
So Update Review.

87
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.263
So here, in the review routes,

88
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.223
we should add the patch method,

89
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.203
and then reviewController.updateReview.

90
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.443
All right.

91
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.410
So let's take a look at one of these reviews here,

92
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.913
let's say this one, and update the rating to four.

93
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.103
Okay.

94
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.783
So the body,

95
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.700
set it to four.

96
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.093
And send it now.

97
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.530
Okay, and as we can see, we get our new review back

98
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.070
with the rating updated, just as expected.

99
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.950
And again, we're going to take care of authorization

100
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.300
a bit later in the section.

101
00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:29.963
For now, I just wanted to make this work.

102
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.280
So users, let's now also update users.

103
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.933
Okay?

104
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.963
So GET, and PATCH.

105
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.583
So let's Get All Users here.

106
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.383
Let's say this one.

107
00:06:04.991 --> 00:06:06.413
And let's change the name

108
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640
to Administrator,

109
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.443
which before was simply admin.

110
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.513
All right?

111
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.960
And so, this one worked as well.

112
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.010
Okay, so again, I'm saving all of this here in my collection

113
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.320
because then, a bit later,

114
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.880
I can actually go ahead and create documentation

115
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.673
from all of this collection data that we have here.

116
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.863
So Update User,

117
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.740
put that one here, and this one here.

118
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.710
Perfect.

119
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.800
So updating users is now working

120
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.350
for all of our three resources using the factory function.

121
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.980
And so, let's go ahead and add the next one,

122
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.767
which is gonna be createOne.

123
00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:59.770
So exports, createOne.

124
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.983
And again, we pass in the model.

125
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.820
And from there, we create a new function.

126
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.280
And that may, once again,

127
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.103
actually copy it from the Tour here.

128
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.713
All right.

129
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.373
And so, what we need here is only this part.

130
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.400
So model, and document.

131
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.897
And down here, we again call it data.

132
00:07:30.897 --> 00:07:32.450
All right.

133
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.890
And so, that's actually it.

134
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.620
That is our factory function.

135
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.253
And so, again, let's come here and replace it.

136
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.377
So factory.createOne, Tour.

137
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.910
So you see that our code in the controllers

138
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.040
is now getting really clean, right?

139
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.970
But actually, we're not gonna be able to replace

140
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.710
all of the functions that we have here with factories,

141
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.670
because otherwise, we wouldn't even need

142
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.480
this controller file, right?

143
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.750
We could then simply create these handlers on the fly,

144
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.270
basically, in the router file, right?

145
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.947
And so, we could basically skip this entire step

146
00:08:13.947 --> 00:08:16.320
of the controller file.

147
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.600
But again, we still need it

148
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.730
because we have some other stuff in there.

149
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.080
For example, these methods here

150
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.418
for getting the tour statistics, or this monthly plan,

151
00:08:27.418 --> 00:08:29.560
and yeah.

152
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.750
So it makes sense to actually keep this file, okay?

153
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.130
So next up, for the Users,

154
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.930
we actually do not need the createOne

155
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.460
because, for creating new users,

156
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.630
we already have the signUp function,

157
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.290
and we cannot really replace that with a factory

158
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.240
because it really is different from this generic one.

159
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.073
Okay?

160
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.140
But we can do it in the review controller, okay?

161
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.230
So basically, we want to replace this createReview.

162
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.990
Now you see that also, in this one,

163
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.840
we have some additional step.

164
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.170
So we have this code that is also not

165
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.330
in our generic createOne function.

166
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.165
And so, how can we fix that?

167
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:11.800
Well, we can actually create a middleware

168
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.610
that is going to run before the createReview, okay?

169
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.170
And so, that actually also makes it a bit more decoupled.

170
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.610
So basically, this code here is then gonna be

171
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.960
in its own function,

172
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.430
and really decoupled from createReview,

173
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.550
because actually, it doesn't have much to do

174
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.400
with creating the review.

175
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.630
It simply sets some data, right?

176
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.627
And so, let's actually call this set tour and user IDs.

177
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.173
So request, ah, the response is missing.

178
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.504
Okay?

179
00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:50.110
And all we're gonna do here

180
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.730
is to basically set these IDs on the body

181
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.100
and then move straight to the next middleware,

182
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.660
where then the review is actually created.

183
00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.650
Alright?

184
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.350
So before we forget it,

185
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.430
let's then actually add this middleware.

186
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.993
So in the review routes, it's right here in post.

187
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.467
So reviewController, setTourUserIds.

188
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.533
Okay?

189
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:20.073
So yet another middleware function in this stack.

190
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.853
Okay.

191
00:10:22.853 --> 00:10:26.620
Anyway, let's then get rid of what we have here

192
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.610
because this is easily replaceable

193
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.300
with our factory function, once more.

194
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.300
So createOne, then the Review, and that's it.

195
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.493
Okay.

196
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.483
And just to test if this still works,

197
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.883
let's simply go ahead and create a new review on Tour.

198
00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:50.489
Okay?

199
00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:52.463
And for that, we need the tour IDs,

200
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.903
so let's also say Get All Tours.

201
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.500
And now we get the user belonging is no longer existing,

202
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.600
so let's simply go ahead and log in again.

203
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.753
So get a new token here.

204
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.933
And so, there we go, as an admin.

205
00:11:12.253 --> 00:11:16.490
So now, Get All Tours, here we go.

206
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.423
Let's just choose one of them.

207
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.980
So let's say, The Forest Hiker.

208
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.720
I think this one already has some reviews, doesn't it?

209
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.830
Oh no, it doesn't.

210
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.343
So this one is a good one to try it out now.

211
00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:34.773
And so, Create New Review on Tour.

212
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.110
Remember, we have to change the ID here.

213
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.610
And now we can post this review

214
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.520
only with the rating and the review.

215
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.330
But I think it's actually not going to work

216
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.260
because we're logged in as an administrator,

217
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.410
and only regular users can post reviews.

218
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.243
Okay?

219
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.163
All right, so let's still do this here.

220
00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.963
Mind blowing.

221
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.850
But we're gonna get this error that I was just saying.

222
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.850
So you do not have permission to perform.

223
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.620
And so, we need to log in again,

224
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.670
this time as a different user.

225
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.093
And let's take a look at which one we have, actually.

226
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.110
Ah, okay.

227
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.433
So let's just use test.

228
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.563
Or maybe test was the one with the wrong password.

229
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.963
But let's see.

230
00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:34.310
Ah, yeah.

231
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.473
So let's experiment with testuser.

232
00:12:39.206 --> 00:12:40.290
And this one works.

233
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.700
And so, actually, we can go ahead and delete this other one

234
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.063
because I kind of forgot his password.

235
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.137
Okay.

236
00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:51.060
And in this case, that's no problem.

237
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.110
We can simply delete users as we like

238
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.012
since we're only in development.

239
00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:57.200
Okay?

240
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.203
Now we should be able to actually add this review.

241
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.310
And indeed, here we go.

242
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.143
Perfect.

243
00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:08.560
So that wraps up this lecture.

244
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.200
All we need to do in the next one

245
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.160
is then create the factory functions

246
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.490
for getting one and getting all documents

247
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.973
of a certain resource.
