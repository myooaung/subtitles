00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.910
<v Narrator>Let's now refactor our code a little bit.</v>

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.800
So basically, reorganize some of our route

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.693
to make the code a lot better.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.990
So right now, we have all these routes here.

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.580
So the http method plus the url

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.080
together with the route handler,

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.020
which is this callback function.

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.860
Right?

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.020
And we have these routes and route handlers

10
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.340
kind of all over the place.

11
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.690
So we have this and then this and all after the other,

12
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.240
but it's kind of difficult to see

13
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.080
what route we actually have in our code.

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.990
So all the routes should kind of be together,

15
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.500
and then the handler functions also together.

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.730
So separate from these routes here.

17
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.563
Okay.

18
00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:43.300
So what I'm gonna do is to go ahead

19
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.500
and basically export all of these handler functions

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.510
into their own function.

21
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.830
Okay?

22
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.710
First of all, let's also get rid of this

23
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.183
old code that we had here.

24
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950
And so, yeah.

25
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.783
Take this.

26
00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.600
Or actually, not just this.

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.033
So all of this.

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.293
Take this, and create a new function out of it.

29
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.077
So I'm calling this one getAllTours.

30
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.170
And then I'm assigning it this function.

31
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.430
Give it a save, and now here

32
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.330
instead of passing the callback function directly,

33
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.483
well, I just do getAllTours.

34
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.760
And that's it.

35
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.593
Okay?

36
00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:29.540
And so right now, if I'm gonna hit this route here.

37
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.280
So this endpoint.

38
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.750
It will then simply call this getAllTours function.

39
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.220
So the functionality didn't change at all,

40
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.303
but I did slightly refactor my code.

41
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.343
Okay.

42
00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:43.220
And you will see how nice this is gonna be

43
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.800
when all of the routes are together

44
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.983
and all these route handlers are also together.

45
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.510
So...

46
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.093
This one is getTour because this is only to get one tour.

47
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.893
Right?

48
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.983
Add to here, getTour.

49
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.153
So.

50
00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:11.220
And we're starting to see different routes

51
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.343
that we have in our project at one glance.

52
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.243
So.

53
00:02:16.243 --> 00:02:19.320
This is the next one, and it's gonna be createTour.

54
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.270
Const createTour equals all of this.

55
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.230
And here then createTour.

56
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.400
Next up we have...

57
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.533
Not like this.

58
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.993
We have updateTour.

59
00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.330
All right.

60
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.820
And so this also actually makes our code

61
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.310
a little more clartive.

62
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.143
Right?

63
00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.480
So we can see very easily what happens here

64
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.420
when we're actually reading the code.

65
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.670
So when we read this line of code,

66
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.550
we immediately see, oh, this will update to tour

67
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.950
because we actually have the function name here.

68
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.613
Okay.

69
00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:15.200
And now finally, we have deleteTour.

70
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.545
Okay.

71
00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:24.462
DeleteTour.

72
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.353
So.

73
00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:28.690
This looks a lot nicer already,

74
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.030
but it's still not perfect.

75
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.240
We can do even better.

76
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.280
Because, let's say, that we want to, for example,

77
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.150
change the version or the resource name.

78
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.430
We would then have to change it

79
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.440
in all of these five places,

80
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.980
and that is not ideal.

81
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.600
And so instead of having all of this,

82
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.750
we can do something better.

83
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.280
So let me actually start it from scratch,

84
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.870
and write app dot route, so that's a new one.

85
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.570
And so here we specify the route that we want.

86
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.893
So let's start actually with this one here.

87
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.070
And then, on there is where we specify

88
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.843
what we want to happen on get.

89
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.533
Dot get.

90
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.533
Well, we want getAllTours.

91
00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:13.690
So.

92
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.750
What we have here is right now

93
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.850
exactly the same as we have here.

94
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.170
Okay, so that's coming out this part.

95
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.670
So it's exactly the same.

96
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.470
Now, the thing is, that here we can now

97
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.593
actually chain the post method.

98
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.373
And then we can say createTour just like this.

99
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.163
Okay?

100
00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:35.640
And so just like this,

101
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.360
we have now actually created an even better way

102
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.750
of writing a route because right now,

103
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.970
this is not repeated for the get and the post.

104
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.803
Okay.

105
00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:46.210
Let's give it a save.

106
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.513
It's nicely formatted, and even easier to read than before.

107
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.293
Okay.

108
00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:52.126
So.

109
00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:53.920
The two route handlers that we use

110
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.690
on this kind of route here.

111
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.190
So without the id, is only for get and for post.

112
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.323
So for getting all tours, and for creating a new tour.

113
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.550
And now, as you can imagine,

114
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.790
let's do the same for the other route.

115
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.723
So basically at this url here.

116
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.580
So we add this url, and now,

117
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.733
we will have get, patch, and delete.

118
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.200
So this one is getTour.

119
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.270
This one is updateTour, ah it's already there.

120
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.727
And finally, I have deleteTour.

121
00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:31.560
So deleteTour.

122
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.780
Give it a save.

123
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.050
And we can now go ahead and...

124
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.040
Well, I'm not gonna delete it.

125
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.840
So that we can keep the old code here as well.

126
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.350
But, this is gonna work just the exact same way,

127
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.380
but making the code a lot better,

128
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.590
and also easier to read.

129
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.230
Right?

130
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.510
So again, just to recap, we separated our handler function

131
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.890
of the route itself so that we can later actually,

132
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.220
even export these into another file.

133
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.220
Okay, so that will then make the code even better.

134
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.603
But for now, let's keep it at this.

135
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.160
So with the handlers nicely separated from the routes.

136
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.570
And then, we specified all the actions

137
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.900
for each of our two routes.

138
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.420
Which are simply tours

139
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.963
and then tours slash the id parameter.

140
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.753
So.

141
00:06:21.753 --> 00:06:23.630
Just to make sure it still works,

142
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.363
let's use this one here.

143
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.890
And with a tour that actually is this.

144
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.140
But you can see already it's not giving us an error

145
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.083
and so it actually still works.

146
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.720
Same four getAllTours because that's another url.

147
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.930
And just to make sure it still works as well.

148
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.563
Indeed, it does.
