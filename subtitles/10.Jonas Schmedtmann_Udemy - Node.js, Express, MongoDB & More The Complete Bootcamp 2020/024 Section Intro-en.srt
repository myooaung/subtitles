1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
(calm music)

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,010
<v ->Now, before we dive really deep</v>

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,490
into Node.js, Express, databases and more,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,420
it's important to get a good understanding

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,000
of back end development in general,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,300
because that's what we actually use Node.js for

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,253
in this course.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,950
So you're gonna learn things like how the web works,

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,950
the request-response model, HTTP, TCP/IP,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,160
static versus dynamic websites, what APIs are,

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,080
(chuckles) and much more.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,750
And I hope that with the sections,

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,210
some of the things that we did in the last one

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,590
will then start to make more sense.

15
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,757
(gentle upbeat music)
