1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,680
<v Jonas>So now that you know the</v>

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,850
absolute fundamentals of Node.JS.,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,820
let's take the rest of the section

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,350
to talk a little bit about npm,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,713
so the node package manager.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,490
So the node package manager is a command line

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,200
interface app that automatically comes

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,520
included with Node JS

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,770
in which we use to install and manage

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,870
Open Source packages.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,350
Now these packages that I just mentioned,

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,020
they usually come from the package repository

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,467
that is also npm.

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,250
So at npm.js, you can take a look

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,880
at all the modules or packages

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,530
that are included in the npm repository.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,100
So npm is actually both the command line interface app

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,650
that we use to manage the packages

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,873
and also the repository itself.

20
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:55,050
And actually, it's the largest software

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,700
registry in the world,

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,530
no matter what language we're talking about.

23
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,130
And by the time of this recording,

24
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,210
it has about 800,000 packages.

25
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,880
So sometime, in the near future

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,940
it will probably have over a million packages

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,800
here on npm.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,450
So, let's for example,
search for express,

29
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,250
which is the node framework that we're going to use

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,870
throughout most of the rest of the course.

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,940
And so, for example,

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,620
you can then click on it,

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,430
and here you have all the information

34
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,160
about each of the modules.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,890
So you can see that, for example,

36
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,550
this one is download almost eight million times

37
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,410
in the last week.

38
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,803
So you see that it's a hugely popular package.

39
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,350
Then, here, usually you have some documentation.

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,870
But for now, that doesn't really matter.

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,514
So for now, we're just interested in what npm actually is.

42
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:53,260
Probably, you have used npm, yourself,

43
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,870
before when working on front-end development.

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,580
Because these days, npm is actually not just used

45
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,860
for node development,

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,130
but really across the entire Java's stack.

47
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,920
So, for example, if you'll search for react,

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,950
it's also gonna be here.

49
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,890
So really, all these popular libraries

50
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,860
and frameworks,

51
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,813
they are all really on the npm registry.

52
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,490
Basically, npmjs.com is where all these packages are hosted.

53
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,150
Now, about the command line interface, itself,

54
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,220
it actually comes already pre-installed with NodeJS.

55
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,190
So, let's now actually start using it,

56
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,400
and go back to our project.

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,550
So here we have still our terminal open,

58
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,000
but I'm gonna quit now this process here,

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,160
so I hit control c and then clear the terminal.

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,850
Npm is a software that we basically use to manage

61
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,710
the third party Open Source packages that

62
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,390
we choose to include and use in our project.

63
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,190
And the first thing that they usually do

64
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,400
whenever we start a new project,

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,550
is to start with npm init.

66
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,570
So we use npm as the command and then init.

67
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,020
And this will basically create a package.jason file.

68
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,110
Which is kind of a configuration file of our project

69
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,780
where all kinds of data about the project is stored.

70
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,190
We're gonna see more about that once that is finished.

71
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,670
So npm init is now asking us a bunch of questions

72
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,510
as you see down here.

73
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,160
And, maybe, if you're not seeing it,

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,630
I will increase this a bit.

75
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,760
So, first thing that we need to specify

76
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,400
is the package name.

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,253
And this one is called node farm.

78
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,790
So we need to use a url friendly name here,

79
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,490
so that's why I have the hyphen.

80
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,580
And what you see here is the suggested name,

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,020
but I don't want the one in there,

82
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,630
so I just retype node farm here.

83
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,110
Then we have the version,

84
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,247
so we can just hit return here on this one.

85
00:03:56,247 --> 00:04:01,247
And in the description, learning node js.

86
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,940
The entry point is the next.js,

87
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,840
but again, this doesn't really matter.

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,420
We don't have any test command,

89
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,053
so just hit return again.

90
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,810
Now we'll get keywords,

91
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,460
doesn't really matter again.

92
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,913
The author is me.

93
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,400
You can put your own name, of course,

94
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,470
and license and so,

95
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,240
one that's okay, to confirm that this is the file

96
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,073
that we want.

97
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,473
Actually, it created it right away here on this left side.

98
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,193
Bring it down again here.

99
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,370
So, indeed, this is our package Jason file,

100
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,180
with this very basic information

101
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,200
about the project for now.

102
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,780
But there is a lot of stuff that can be added

103
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,290
to this file and we will do so later in another project.

104
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,750
Also, right in the next video which is where we're gonna

105
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,260
installing packages.

106
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,610
And these packages are then also registered here

107
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,300
in this file so that we can keep tract of all the packages

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,623
that we're actually using.

109
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,380
So, in our next video we're then going to finally install

110
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,263
some real packages here.
