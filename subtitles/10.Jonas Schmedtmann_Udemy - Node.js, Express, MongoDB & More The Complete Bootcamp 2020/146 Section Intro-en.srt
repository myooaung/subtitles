00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,441
<v ->Knowing how to work with data</v>

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:06,824
is one of the most important and valuable skills

3
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:10,190
that you can have as a backend developer.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,898
And that's why in this section

5
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:14,420
we're gonna dive really deep into

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,580
data modeling concepts and techniques,

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,550
the model, or the data, for application in multiple ways,

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
and also learn how to implement, or data model,

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,730
using advanced Mongoose features.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,990
And so, all this will really take your backend skills,

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,260
and also Mongoose skills, to a whole new level.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,069
So by the end of this section

13
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:40,140
our API will actually be fully functioning

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,930
with all routes and all resources,

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,876
a complete authentication and authorization,

16
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:48,636
and also all established relationships

17
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:50,543
between all the data sets.

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,386
So, with that being said, let's now get started

19
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:56,916
with MongoDB data modeling.

20
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,499
(upbeat music)
