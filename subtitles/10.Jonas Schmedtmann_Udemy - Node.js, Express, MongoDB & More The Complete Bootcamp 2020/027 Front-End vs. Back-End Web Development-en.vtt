00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:02.250
<v Narrator>So now that you have</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.410
a good overview of how the web works

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.290
behind the scenes, let's learn

4
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.913
about what back-end web development actually is

5
00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:11.796
and how it compares to front-end development,

6
00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:14.415
because this is a very important distinction

7
00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:17.666
in the web development world.

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.330
So in order to distinguish between

9
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.730
the front-end and the back-end

10
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.980
of a website and of web development

11
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.619
as a general, we still consider

12
00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.767
the same client-server architecture

13
00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.950
that we talked about before.

14
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.269
So in general terms, front-end development

15
00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.830
is about everything that happens in the web browser.

16
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.010
So it's about designing and building

17
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.940
the final website that's gonna

18
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.371
be visible to the user, and therefore,

19
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:44.123
the name front-end.

20
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.188
The front-end developer uses

21
00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:50.024
the basic technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

22
00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:54.028
which together form the front-end technology stack.

23
00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:56.510
Now, many modern front-end developers

24
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.660
add more stuff to the front-end stack

25
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.010
like React or Angular or Redux or GraphQL

26
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.715
or whatever is cool these days.

27
00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:09.150
So these technologies make front-end development easier

28
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.950
and all these technologies together

29
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.930
that a developer or a team decides

30
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.090
to use on the front-end, is their

31
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.169
front-end stack, okay?

32
00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:19.170
And you probably already know most

33
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320
of this stuff anyway, but I still wanna give you

34
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.070
a brief overview of how everything fits

35
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.931
into the bigger picture here.

36
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.605
All right, and now moving on to the back-end.

37
00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:31.890
This part of web development is

38
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.313
about everything that happens on the web server,

39
00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:36.350
so everything that is invisible

40
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.912
to the final user and therefore

41
00:01:37.912 --> 00:01:40.768
the name back-end, okay?

42
00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:43.624
And since we're talking about the server site now,

43
00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:47.800
let's actually define what a server really is.

44
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.745
Well a basic server is really just a computer

45
00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:52.880
that is connected to the internet

46
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.990
which, first, stores a website's files

47
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.670
like HTML, CSS, and images,

48
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.340
and second, runs an HTTP server

49
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.073
that is capable of understanding URLs,

50
00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:07.600
requests, and also delivering responses.

51
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.167
So this piece of HTTP server software

52
00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:13.480
is what actually communicates with the browser

53
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.220
using requests and responses.

54
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.230
Therefore, it is like the bridge

55
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.160
between the front-end and the back-end

56
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.140
of a website or web application.

57
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.430
Now a simple web server like the one

58
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.275
I just described is called a static server,

59
00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.530
because all it can really do is

60
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.660
to serve static files to the client via HTTP.

61
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.293
If you just need to host a simple website,

62
00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:39.570
then this is really all you need.

63
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.900
But if you wanna take it to the next level

64
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.950
and create dynamic web applications

65
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.365
that talk to databases and all that good stuff,

66
00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:49.720
we use a server that is also capable

67
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.548
of running OR dynamic applications,

68
00:02:51.548 --> 00:02:53.520
just like the code that we wrote

69
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.779
and executed in the intro section of the course.

70
00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.800
This is then called a dynamic server,

71
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.500
where we have OR app running,

72
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.610
an HTTP server, and of course,

73
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.380
the files all talking to each other.

74
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.400
And in some cases, that's all we need

75
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.323
for OR applications, but usually

76
00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:12.310
when we build dynamic websites or apps,

77
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.610
we will also use a database,

78
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.379
which we can access right from our applications.

79
00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.342
By the way, if the term static

80
00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:21.820
and dynamic websites or applications

81
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.894
are a bit confusing for you, no problem.

82
00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:26.487
We will talk about that right in the next video.

83
00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:28.843
Anyway, we can use the database

84
00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:32.004
to store stuff like users or application data

85
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:34.778
or text to fill up a website template.

86
00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:38.160
In any serious application, there will always

87
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.370
be a database and our back-end code

88
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.676
will communicate with that data base.

89
00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:45.090
So, some usual stuff that is handled

90
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.200
on the back-end or the server side

91
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.088
as we can also call it to create user profiles,

92
00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:53.406
perform log-in's, send emails, handle payment,

93
00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:56.810
retrieve and send request data from a database

94
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.850
to a client, manipulate data in the database,

95
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.517
fill up website templates, and so much more.

96
00:04:02.517 --> 00:04:05.020
And we will do many of these exciting things

97
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.233
throughout the course, actually all of them really.

98
00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:10.800
Now about the technology as you can guess,

99
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.235
we are gonna use NodeJS as a dynamic web server

100
00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:17.400
and MongoDB as our database,

101
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.294
so datas or back-end stack.

102
00:04:19.294 --> 00:04:22.670
But there are so many different back-end technologies

103
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.040
and stacks available for the back-end.

104
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.025
Things like PHP with MySQL database

105
00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:31.123
or Python with PostgreSQL database

106
00:04:31.123 --> 00:04:33.750
or some people use Ruby on Rails

107
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.120
maybe with even some other database.

108
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.430
But, since you wanna learn NodeJS

109
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.980
well we are gonna use exactly that.

110
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.230
And the most popular database that is used

111
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.070
with Node is, without a doubt, MongoDB.

112
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.007
And, so, that is our choice for a back-end stack.

113
00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:52.237
Now, you might have heard the term full stack before,

114
00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:54.180
and that simply is the front-end

115
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.710
plus the back-end stacks together.

116
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.180
So, the developer that does both front-end

117
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.209
and back-end development can call himself

118
00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:04.117
a full stack developer, but these developers

119
00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:06.410
are getting increasingly rare,

120
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.150
especially because the front-end

121
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.110
is becoming more and more complex these days.

122
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.630
Finally, another thing that I wanted to quickly mention

123
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.150
is that, as you can see, we're gonna use Node

124
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.400
applied to back-end web development

125
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.930
and not something like hardware programming.

126
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.670
So, you can technically use Node for stuff like

127
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.240
flying drones, programming robots,

128
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.300
or developing software for IFT devices.

129
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.610
But, that is outside the scope of this course.

130
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.670
If you want to program IFT devices with Node,

131
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.550
well this course is still going to be useful for you,

132
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.650
it's just not the focus of the projects

133
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.528
that we are gonna build, okay?

134
00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:46.100
All right and I guess that summarizes the difference

135
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.425
between the front-end side and the back-end side

136
00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:50.734
of web development, so that going forward,

137
00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:52.970
you have a good idea of the domains

138
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.753
where NodeDS is actually used in the real world.
