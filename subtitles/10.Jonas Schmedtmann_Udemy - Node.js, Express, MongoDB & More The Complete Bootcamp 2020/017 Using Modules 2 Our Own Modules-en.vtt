00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.770
<v Instructor>So what I wanted to show you</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.210
in this last video about the project

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.360
is that we can actually create our own module

4
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.137
and export something from them like for example a function.

5
00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:16.710
Then import this function into another module

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.150
and then use that function there.

7
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.653
Okay, and so that is what we're gonna do in this lecture.

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.680
So let's say that we actually had

9
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.816
a bunch of different JavaScript files

10
00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:32.613
in which we used this replace template function.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.710
So right now we're just using it here in index.js.

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.240
We use it twice and that is why we have a function,

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.062
but imagine if we wanted to use this function

14
00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:44.960
in multiple files.

15
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.930
Okay, so what we can do is to create a new module

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.790
and export that function from it

17
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.210
and then import it back here.

18
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.330
So, the first thing that you need to know

19
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.900
is that in Nodejs

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.420
actually every single file is treated as a module.

21
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.210
And so this index.js here actually is also a module,

22
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.780
which in this case imports other modules

23
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.663
and particularly these three.

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.090
Let's now create a new folder here,

25
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.800
which I'm gonna call modules

26
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.105
and then in here

27
00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.050
I'm gonna create a file

28
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.707
which will be our module called replaceTemplate.js.

29
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.793
Okay, so let's grab our function here.

30
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.000
Actually, cut it out from here

31
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.863
and simply paste it here.

32
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.560
All right, now how do we actually export this function

33
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.350
from this module?

34
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.110
Well, there are different ways of exporting something

35
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.166
from a module

36
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.040
and we're gonna talk in depth

37
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.013
about all of this in another section later on.

38
00:01:59.013 --> 00:01:59.904
But for now

39
00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:04.303
all we're gonna do is to use module.export.

40
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.000
So in each module,

41
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.950
we have access to a variable called module

42
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.360
and on there we can set the export's property.

43
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.230
And that we then set to whatever we wanna export.

44
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.943
In this case, that is just this function.

45
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.940
So we're gonna get rid of this name

46
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.940
and so basically

47
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.940
what we're gonna assign to this export property on module

48
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:36.423
is simply this anonymous function.

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.050
I said anonymous

50
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.110
because right now this function does not have a name.

51
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.184
And so it's just an anonymous function

52
00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:47.867
to be assigned to this export property

53
00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.750
on the module object.

54
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.500
Again, that is an object that we have access to

55
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.820
in each and every Nodejs module.

56
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.250
And again,

57
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.410
later on you will learn

58
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.020
how that actually happens behind the scenes.

59
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.853
But for now,

60
00:03:02.853 --> 00:03:04.050
let's just use it

61
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.070
and don't worry about why it works this way.

62
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.750
So this exports this function from the module.

63
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.423
Let's just go to index.js and import it.

64
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.410
And imports usually always happen at the top of the file

65
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.400
and after the core modules.

66
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.100
First, we have the core modules

67
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.462
and then we have our own modules.

68
00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:30.462
We will do require and then our own module,

69
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.640
which is dot...

70
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.534
And remember in the require function,

71
00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:39.534
the dot actually means the current location of this module.

72
00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:43.660
So remember when we talked about the dir name variable here,

73
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.330
which is usually the one that points to the module's folder.

74
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.860
But in this case in the require function,

75
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.678
remember there is an exception

76
00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:55.567
where this dot actually points to the location

77
00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.740
where this module is in.

78
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.660
And so right now,

79
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.960
that is this root folder here.

80
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.410
And so from here we go to modules

81
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.333
and then in there we have replaceTemplate.

82
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.313
And again,

83
00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:15.220
just as with the other modules,

84
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.193
we don't need the .js.

85
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.700
Now that is gonna return what we exported here

86
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.929
with module.exports.

87
00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:28.321
What we have here, this code, this function,

88
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:33.321
is what will be exported from this require function call.

89
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.620
And so we can now save that into any variable

90
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.870
and give it a name that we want.

91
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.460
So we could just call it X if we wanted

92
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.850
or really whatever we wanted.

93
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.960
But instead I am just giving it this name

94
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.420
that we already had here

95
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.670
so that I don't have to change my code here.

96
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.770
So replaceTemplate is the name

97
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.160
that I wanna give to this variable

98
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.040
which is now this function.

99
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.580
And just like this,

100
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.900
we exported something from one module

101
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.203
and imported it into another one.

102
00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.941
And so now if we restart our server,

103
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:13.900
everything should still be working.

104
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.000
But it actually does not.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.300
We have some kind of error here.

106
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.920
And it says it cannot find the module.

107
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.630
And that's because I was stupid enough

108
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.150
to call this folder here modules.js.

109
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.600
I am sorry for that.

110
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.611
This one is of course

111
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:32.363
only supposed to be called modules.

112
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.350
And that's why it wasn't giving me the auto-complete here.

113
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.194
I was wondering why that was.

114
00:05:39.194 --> 00:05:40.973
And now we know.

115
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.540
If it doesn't work for you,

116
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.119
just change the name here of this folder

117
00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.413
and then everything should match and work as it should.

118
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.730
Let's reload and it still replaces everything as it should.

119
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.716
The same here of course.

120
00:05:57.716 --> 00:06:02.716
And so yeah, we are now done with this project.

121
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.380
Congratulations, well done.

122
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.974
You are well on your way of learning Nodejs.

123
00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:11.500
Now in the rest of the section

124
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.770
we're gonna talk a little bit

125
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.510
about the node package manager or npm.

126
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.380
And so we're gonna keep working a little bit

127
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.770
with this project

128
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.786
but not really adding any functionality.

129
00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:24.890
Anyway, see you in the next video

130
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.973
where we're gonna start talking about npm.
