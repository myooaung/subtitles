00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.950
<v Jonas>Over the next couple of lectures</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.940
we will add the login functionality to our website.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.940
And in this lecture,

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.420
we will start by actually rendering out

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.610
the login screen to make it easy

6
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.083
for users to login.

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.620
Once more, I actually want this to be a challenge for you

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.810
so that you can actually practice some of the skills

9
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.890
that you've been learning.

10
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.230
What I want you to do is to create a

11
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.463
slash login route.

12
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.240
Then create a controller,

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.930
and, of course, a template.

14
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.720
And that template is really easy.

15
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.610
It's just some static html and we don't need

16
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.783
to pass any variables into it.

17
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.050
There's a template for that, actually,

18
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.375
here in the template folder.

19
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:50.623
So that should be, then, really easy for you to complete.

20
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:55.133
So pause this video and come back once you're ready.

21
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.850
Okay, welcome back.

22
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.300
I hope you completed this challenge successfully.

23
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.963
So here is my take on it.

24
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.670
Router dot get

25
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.360
the route is

26
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.380
slash login

27
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.223
and then we use controller dot get

28
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.650
login form.

29
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.783
So that's the route handler that I'm going to create next.

30
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.150
Export dot get login form

31
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.680
response

32
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.540
and here we don't need any more than just the

33
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.590
request and response.

34
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.100
Actually up here I'm seeing

35
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.563
that we're missing the next.

36
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.360
Always, when we have async functions wrapped in

37
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.833
catchAsync we should always specify next.

38
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980
But here, all we really need to do

39
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.270
is to now render a login template.

40
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.950
So we didn't create that template just yet.

41
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.320
But, it's going to be called login.

42
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.240
So, let's say res dot status

43
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.113
200,

44
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.940
render template called

45
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.640
login.

46
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.790
Then as with all our other pages,

47
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.090
we actually want to give it a custom title.

48
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.010
For that we've always passed in an object

49
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.240
with the title property.

50
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.090
Right?

51
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.010
So the base template will then read that title

52
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.543
and put it in the title html element.

53
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.480
In this case, the title is simply

54
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.770
log into your account.

55
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.690
And that's it for the route handler.

56
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.963
Now let's go 'head,

57
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.520
open the login template,

58
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.230
select all,
copy all,

59
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.663
close it and create the new view in here.

60
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.923
Call, of course, login dot pug.

61
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.380
Then, pasting that code here,

62
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.900
and now comes again that trick where we extend

63
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.063
our base template.

64
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.740
This one extends to base file extend don't forget

65
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.660
that in here we need to create a block with the

66
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.443
exact same name as we have in the base file.

67
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.163
So that is content.

68
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.130
And with this we're actually done,

69
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.963
I believe.

70
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.770
Of course, we need to indent to make it a child

71
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.913
off this block.

72
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.233
But, that's actually it.

73
00:03:43.602 --> 00:03:46.110
Now, just one more thing that we need to do

74
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.160
is to actually set a link to the login page

75
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.163
so that we can actually access that.

76
00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:57.480
Right now, the login and sign up buttons are actually

77
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.393
using the button element.

78
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.260
But like this, we cannot really specify

79
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.110
the href attribute.

80
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.360
So let's change them actually to a real link.

81
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.763
And in here, we can specify the href.

82
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.543
So this one simply points to login.

83
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.400
And a second one here,

84
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.540
the sign up we will actually not implement

85
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.080
so you can implement this on your own

86
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.660
if you feel like it.

87
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.190
So basically a sign up form.

88
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.490
But, since all that,

89
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.440
so the whole process of signing up is going to be

90
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.220
very similar to logging in,

91
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.130
I decided not to include that here in this section

92
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.800
because that would just be a lot of duplicate content

93
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.663
and I don't want to make the course unnecessary long.

94
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.480
Give this a safe,

95
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.730
I don't know if this now restarts the server,

96
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.730
actually it doesn't,

97
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.113
so let's save one of these java script files.

98
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.763
Now

99
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.470
this is our reference website.

100
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.450
Remember, that's what we want,

101
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.357
is this one.

102
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.890
Let's come to all tours

103
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.320
and now let's try our login route.

104
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.550
And, indeed, here goes our form.

105
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.383
Great.

106
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.950
Now here we can put in some email

107
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.730
let's say admin

108
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.140
dot naders

109
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.100
dot io.

110
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.100
And you see that it nicely formats

111
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.790
this input here whether the email address

112
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.860
is actually valid or not.

113
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.770
For example, if I don't have the extension here correct,

114
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.100
then it will become orange

115
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.580
telling me that something is wrong.

116
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.730
And the same thing for the password.

117
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.400
As long as I have less than eight characters,

118
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.200
this will always be red,

119
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.423
basically telling me that there's an error.

120
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.260
That now that I have eight characters,

121
00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.690
it turns green.

122
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.970
And if you're interested in how to do this

123
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.020
kind of magic with css,

124
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.670
then please feel free to check out the css file that I coded

125
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.390
just for this course.

126
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.270
Anyways, of course, clicking this button here now

127
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.200
does absolutely anything, right?

128
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.390
So in the next video, we will actually really

129
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.390
start to implement the login functionality

130
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.570
actually by doing a request to our api end point

131
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.823
that we already created.
