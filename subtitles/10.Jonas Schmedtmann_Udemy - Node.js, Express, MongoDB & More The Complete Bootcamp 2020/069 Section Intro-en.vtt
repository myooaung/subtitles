00:00:00.172 --> 00:00:02.510
(light playful music)

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.800
<v ->Hey there, this section is all about the super popular</v>

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.200
MongoDB database system.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.210
So over the next couple of videos,

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.910
you will learn how to install MongoDB on your system,

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.820
how to create databases,

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.220
how to then insert data into a database,

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.210
query data in multiple ways, and much more.

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.360
So, we're gonna take a step back

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.840
from the native's app in this section,

11
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.280
and really focus on learning just MongoDB,

12
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.700
which itself is actually really fun to use.

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.293
I really love working with this database system.

14
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.393
So without further ado, let's now move on.
