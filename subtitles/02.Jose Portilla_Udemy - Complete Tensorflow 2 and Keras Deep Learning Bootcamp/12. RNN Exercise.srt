00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,600
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,520
Let's go ahead and test your new skills on recurrent neural networks through an exercise in this lecture.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,680
We'll just do an overview of the exercise notebook and in the next lecture we'll go through solutions.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,670
Let's get started.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,870
All right.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,980
Here I am at the exercise notebook.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,020
This exercise should pretty much feel very similar to the previous lecture.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,400
We're essentially asking you to given a time series and this time series kind of a fun one it's frozen

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,530
dessert production and it's from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System again that Fred

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,390
dataset.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,100
We want to figure out all the information on it.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,560
You can click on this link but we keep track of the industrial production of ice cream and frozen desserts.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,920
So clearly there is a seasonality to this.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,530
And notice that the seasonality is based on the summer months because when it's hot outside you usually

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,660
want some ice cream.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,440
So kind of a fun day to set the play around with here and come back to the exercise where you're going

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,950
to be doing is essentially the same series of steps that we did in the previous lecture.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,370
So feel free to reference previous lecture although try your hardest to do this maybe not from memory

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,660
but from Google searching on your own and not referencing the code in the previous notebook precisely.

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,110
Instead try to see if you can think about it on your own.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,790
See if you can figure out those loops on your own etc. They'll be really helpful for you.

22
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,940
But as always you can always reference our previous notebooks if need be.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,330
So we ask you to read in the data and then go ahead and rename the column to make sure it's easy to

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,140
read plot out the data and then do the train test split you have a lot of flexibility here on figure

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,100
out the length of the data set but the test set should be at least the last 24 months of data.

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,090
Again you can always play around with this and make it less it's up to you.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,300
You can take 18 months of data they don't want you to scale the data and then create the time series

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,250
generator object.

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,870
Create the model and again you have all the leeway you want.

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,620
As far as Alice time units you can see what we actually used here we use 100 Alice Tam units very similar

31
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,050
to the lecture then create a generator for the test set and validation set.

32
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,090
The main thing to note here and this where you actually may get a little bit of trouble is the length

33
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,780
for that test validation generator.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,950
Recall that the batch length needs to make sense for the size of the test set.

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,780
So we mentioned that in the previous set of lectures and basically the main thing to note here is that

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:31,500
the length of your actual batch size it has to be less than the length of your test set because if you

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,050
have a batch length that's the exact same length as your test set you won't be able to grab that extra

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,420
forecasted all point into the future.

39
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,920
So if your test set for instance is one month and your batch length was one month you need the extra

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,010
month in order to forecast one month into the future.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,150
So again make sure that your batch length is less than your test length.

42
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:55,770
OK.

43
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,900
So we discuss that in the previous lecture.

44
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,430
So go ahead review that if you have any trouble creating that validation generator then we want you

45
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,040
to create an early stopping callback.

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,900
Go ahead and fit that generator using the early stopping.

47
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,200
It should end around 10 epochs or so plot out the history.

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,720
So you'll see that it's pretty noise in the beginning but then starts to flatten out and then we want

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,610
you to evaluate on the test data.

50
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,660
So go ahead and get the prediction the predictions etc..

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,400
And in general you should be able to at least get a model that more or less shows the trend.

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,720
You may feel a little better a little worse in this due to the random initialization of the recurrent

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,470
neural network.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,540
But your model should at least be able to tell that during the summer it tends to peak and then in the

55
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,740
winter it tends to go down.

56
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,160
If you got a model that got that general trend then you should be pretty good.

57
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,780
OK.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,160
And then the last tasks and this is something we actually didn't show you how to do.

59
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,760
But I know you know how to do it based off what we learned throughout the entire course is calculate

60
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,410
your route means squared error on this actual data set.

61
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,680
So if you get stuck on this you can go ahead and check out the solutions but you should be able to do

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,910
it given everything we know about psychic learn test predictions et cetera.

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,940
OK so coming up next we're going to go ahead and go through solutions.

64
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,450
I'll see you there.
