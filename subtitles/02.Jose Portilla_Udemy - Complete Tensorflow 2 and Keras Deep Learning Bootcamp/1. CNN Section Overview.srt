Welcome everyone to this section on conversational neural networks so compositional Neural Networks

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,100
are a specific architecture of neural networks that are extremely effective at dealing with image data.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,330
In this lecture I just want to quickly review what we're going to be learning about in this section

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,640
of the course we're gonna start off by trying to understand the theory behind convolution of neural

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,070
networks and what makes them different than artificial neural networks.

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,190
We'll talk about image kernels and filters convolutions as well as pulling layers.

7
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,540
Once we understand the theory behind accomplished neural networks we'll go ahead and tackle two really

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,620
famous datasets.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,840
The M this dataset learning how to apply convolution on neural networks to grayscale images and then

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,680
we'll move on to color images such as the Safa 10 dataset.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,110
Essentially expanding it out to three color channels red green and blue.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,010
Once you understand how to work of those basic datasets we'll expand to working with real image files

13
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,960
something you'll encounter in the real world.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,770
How did the of pick files or PMG files etc.

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,170
So we'll also be using accomplished on your networks for analyzing things like images of malaria blood

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,640
cell classification.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,740
So we'll have various images some blood cells will be infected with malaria others will not and we'll

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,270
build a compositional network that will actually be able to detect just based off an image whether or

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,930
not a blood cell has an infection.

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,170
After that we'll go ahead and test your new skills with a compilation on the URL that we're exercise

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
on a fashion image dataset.

22
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,060
OK let's get started by learning about the theory.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,960
I'll see you there.
