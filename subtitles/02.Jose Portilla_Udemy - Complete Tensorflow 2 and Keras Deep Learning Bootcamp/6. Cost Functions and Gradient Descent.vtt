00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.520
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.930
In this lecture we're going to be talking about cost functions which is going to allow us to measure

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.090
how far off we are in the output predictions of our neural network.

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.990
And then we'll talk about gradient descent which is going to help us minimize that cost or minimize

5
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.740
that error.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.960
So often cost functions you also hear them label as lost functions or error functions.

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.690
So we don't talk about all that really interesting topic here.

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.630
And it really fundamentally is gonna help us understand better how the neural network will actually

9
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.870
learn so we already understand that neural networks they taken inputs in that first layer then they

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.150
multiply them by weights and then add biases to them and then maybe that gets passed on through an activation

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.640
function like the sigmoid function or the rectified linear unit and then that ends up going into another

12
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.020
layer and then you add another set of weights and biases and then so on and so on all the way to that

13
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.870
last output layer so that last output layer we can maybe call that or refer to it as y hat.

14
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.970
That's essentially the model's estimation of what it predicts the label to be.

15
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.600
And so we have two main questions after the network creates that prediction.

16
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.840
How do we actually evaluate it against the true label.

17
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.410
And then after the evaluation how can we update the networks weights and biases.

18
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.000
So really we're going to focus on this lecture is how do we evaluate how far off our prediction is for

19
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.130
updating the networks weights and biases.

20
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.830
We'll have to learn about back propagation which is coming up in a future lecture.

21
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.880
So right now let's focus on that first question so what we need to do is we need to take the estimated

22
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.760
outputs of the network and then compare them to the real values of the label and keep in mind what I'm

23
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.490
referring to right now is happening during the training or fitting portion of the supervised learning

24
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.530
process.

25
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.150
So right now what we're doing is we're using just the training data set that way we can go back and

26
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.970
update our weights and biases during the test set.

27
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.700
We're not really updating weights and biases.

28
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.910
Instead we're just again evaluating overall on the entire dataset.

29
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.710
How does our neural network perform.

30
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.840
Right now we're doing these small evaluations on these training batches in order to actually then go

31
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.190
back and update weights and biases in our network.

32
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.860
So keep that in mind OK.

33
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.380
So in order to actually compare our neural networks output to the true value we're gonna be using what's

34
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.150
known as a cost function.

35
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.630
And this is also often referred to as a lost function or error function.

36
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.400
Essentially it's just something that measures how far off you are from the true value based off your

37
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.570
prediction.

38
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.170
And one important caveat is it should be an average that we can output a single value then you can keep

39
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.400
track of that loss or cost during training to monitor network performance.

40
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.140
So hopefully during each epoch of training your loss or cost goes down down down until you kind of like

41
00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:00.000
converge to some minimum cost value so we're going to here is I want to introduce a couple of variables.

42
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.940
We're gonna be using Y to represent the true value and then we'll be using a to represent the neurons

43
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.600
prediction.

44
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.160
So in terms of weights and biases what we have here is recall we set Z to be a representation of weights

45
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.760
times x plus B and then we pass that Z into an activation function such as the sigmoid function so that

46
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.110
Z passed into the sigmoid.

47
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.530
Is that equal to a.

48
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.400
So all I'm trying to say here is that a represents kind of that final output of a neuron which takes

49
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.490
into account what the activation function was.

50
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.350
And that also then takes into account Z which in turn takes to account w which are the weights and the

51
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.050
biases.

52
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.160
So a just keep that in mind holds a lot of information.

53
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.690
It holds information about the activation function the weights and the biases so probably the most common

54
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.190
cost function you'll see is known as the quadratic cost function.

55
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.680
And if you've done any machine learning this probably looks really familiar to you because it looks

56
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.430
like root mean square error which is kind of essentially what it is.

57
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:06.080
Here is just not notated for multidimensional data so all we're doing here is that the other day we're

58
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.610
calculating the difference between the real values here we label it y of x.

59
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.340
So if you add some X input we specify Y is the true function so that would be the true value.

60
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.760
And then we're subtracting our predicted values.

61
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.170
So here we have a level of X.

62
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.740
And keep in mind that a of L that notation just signifies that that is the activation function.

63
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.450
Output of the L layer where L is your last layer which means the layer before that in the network is

64
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.470
L minus 1.

65
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.950
Then the layer before that is L minus 2 and so on.

66
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.840
Later on we'll see why it's more convenient to kind of Mark L as your last layer and then work backwards

67
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.820
from there instead of starting from the beginning.

68
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:55.650
So again AFL of X that's essentially your predicted output so keep in mind the notation again shown

69
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.070
here kind of corresponds to vector inputs and outputs.

70
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.400
Since we're really dealing with a batch of training points and predictions as we go along but the main

71
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.830
idea is you have C as the cost function you're doing some sort of averaging so that's we have one over

72
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.730
two times and so n is the number of points there.

73
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.740
Then you're taking the sum of all those differences and squaring them so really come question is why

74
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.720
are we actually squaring this into this two useful things for us.

75
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.980
1 It keeps everything positive because well you have a positive air or negative error.

76
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.130
If you square it it becomes positive which is good because we want some sort of absolute measurement

77
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.350
of error.

78
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.980
If we weren't squaring this and we had stuff that was negative and positive when you average it out

79
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.010
that could hover around zero which is actually not a true indication of the absolute value or absolute

80
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.480
units of how far off you are.

81
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.120
So squaring it make sure that everything's positive the other and much more important thing it does

82
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.620
is it's gonna punish really large errors.

83
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.250
So sometimes you have some data points that you're gonna be really off on and if you actually square

84
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.610
that error then it exponentially grows as terms of your cost.

85
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.550
So maybe you're off by ten dollars in whatever unit you're trying to measure but your cost is going

86
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.420
to report that and unit squared.

87
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.910
So it's going to say you're off by one hundred instead of just ten.

88
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.570
You're going to really punish your network for being really off on certain points which is good because

89
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.630
you don't want your network to suddenly be able to not predict well on even just a few points where

90
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.370
it gives you a huge error.

91
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.380
You'd rather suffer a little bit on all the other points and not be totally off on those few kind of

92
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.320
edge cases.

93
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.970
So that really helps punish large errors now in general we can think of the cost function as a function

94
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:47.340
of four main things so the cost function is going to be a function of W which is our neural networks

95
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:54.060
weights B which is all the biases in our neural network SFR which is the input of a single training

96
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.230
sample and each of our which is the desired output of that training sample.

97
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.300
And that makes a lot of sense because the cost is dependent on what the current weights and biases are.

98
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.950
It's also dependent on what you passed in as the actual training example.

99
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.850
And then it's also dependent on what you're comparing it to which is e of our so notice how that information

100
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.500
was actually all encoded in that simplified notation that we had.

101
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.790
So I showed you this as the cost function and you may be wondering didn't you just say that the cost

102
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.890
function is a function of W and B was W and B in the quadratic function here.

103
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.680
Well it's actually encoded within a of X because remember a of X holds information about weights and

104
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.940
biases because of X is Z passed into the activation function where z then contains information about

105
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:48.600
W and B Ok so this means that if we have a huge network we can expect the actual cost function to be

106
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.010
really quite complex with a huge vector or tensor of weights and another huge tensor of biases.

107
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.860
So for example if we were just to take a small network and start labeling every way and every bias and

108
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.260
every output as kind of the output of the activation function which is a you can see all the parameters

109
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:12.090
labeled here you get really complicated really fast and this is a really small network.

110
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.880
There is only kind of four layers here two hidden layers and those hidden layers aren't even that big.

111
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.880
We can see here if we start noticing everything it can become quite complex.

112
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.580
You already have quite a large matrix of weights and biases so how do we actually calculate this.

113
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:35.520
How do we calculate that cost function and then figure out how to minimize it so in a real case this

114
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.080
means that we have some cost function C dependent on lots of weights that cost function is going to

115
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.950
dependent on the weight of that first input than weight.

116
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.210
Second one weight on third one all the way to W M and we do is when you figure out which particular

117
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:54.360
weights lead us to the lowest cost because we want to go back here and figure out for all these weights

118
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.590
how do we change them to minimize my cost function.

119
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:05.420
At the very end so for simplicity and just thinking about this let's imagine that we're dealing with

120
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.400
a really simple network that only has a single weight essentially just one year on.

121
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.400
So what we want to do is we want to minimize our loss or cost essentially our overall error which again

122
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:22.700
that means we need to figure out what value of W do we use that's going to result in the minimum of

123
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:31.940
C of value so here is our plot it out really simple cost function where it's a really simple network

124
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.840
it only contains one weight well what we want to do is we want to figure out what value of W minimizes

125
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:44.910
this cost function and while this is a really simple example you can probably just tell that in order

126
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.690
to minimize the cost function here you can see that the minimum probably fall somewhere where that arrow

127
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:55.850
is so that's the weight that is going to minimize that cost function.

128
00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:01.580
Which means that's probably the weight we want in the actual neuron or that input to the neuron.

129
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.060
Because that reduces the cost to its minimum.

130
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.640
Now students of calculus know what we could do is we could just take the derivative of this cost function

131
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.840
and then solve for zero.

132
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:18.650
But recall our real cost function is gonna be super complex and it's not going to be one dimensional

133
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.720
two dimensional and three dimensional.

134
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.670
If you take a look back at that network it's gonna be as many dimensions as there are W..

135
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:31.060
And that's not even something I can actually plot so again it's going to be n dimensional which means

136
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.810
taking that derivative and setting it equal to zero is actually not going to be you're not gonna be

137
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:43.160
able to calculate that without spending kind of a thousand years of computational time so our networks

138
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.730
especially when we build out really large networks are gonna have thousands of weights to them hundreds

139
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.480
of weights.

140
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.910
We're not gonna build take that derivative.

141
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:55.850
So instead what we do is a stochastic process to what we can do is we can use gradient descent to solve

142
00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:02.100
this sort of problem so let's again go back to this kind of simplified version of our network we just

143
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.970
have one wait and see how gradient descent would work on this simple example.

144
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.630
And then we can easily expand it to more complex examples.

145
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:17.440
So what we do is we just start off at one point on this cost function and then again what we're searching

146
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:26.300
for here is that w value that minimizes this cost function so what we do is we calculate the slope at

147
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:34.030
one point and then we move in the downward direction of the slope and you keep repeating this process

148
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.760
until eventually you're going to converge to zero indicating a minimum.

149
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.330
So what we could have done is keep in mind we could've changed our step size to find the next point

150
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:54.010
so here we kind of took equal step sizes and if you take smaller step sizes it takes longer to find

151
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.430
the minimum if you take larger steps sizes you'll go faster.

152
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.430
But what happens is you risk overshooting the minimum.

153
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:08.850
So if you go too large of a step size you may actually miss that minimum weight or a minimum weight

154
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.170
tensor and then kind of overshoot and you don't end up converging.

155
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.340
So that's step size is known as the learning rate.

156
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.980
So if you ever see in your own networks that they're editing the learning rate what they're really doing

157
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:25.560
here is they're editing how fast they're going to try to find that minimum weight value and it works

158
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.930
the same for biases you're finding those minimum weights really the values of the weights and biases

159
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.300
that minimize that cost function.

160
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.050
Now in those previous examples something I should know is that the learning rate was constant.

161
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.670
That is to say each step size was equal.

162
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:47.670
So regardless of which one we're actually looking at such as the smaller step sizes or the larger step

163
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:52.570
sizes the actual step is equal for all of these.

164
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.810
Now we can be actually be a little clever and adapt our step size as we go along.

165
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:04.580
You can imagine that since you're starting off kind of an around the position in this and dimensional

166
00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.880
space of possible weights and biases if you start with larger steps well you can do is you can then

167
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:16.990
go smaller and smaller in your step size as that gradient or that slope gets closer to zero.

168
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:23.240
And this is known as Adaptive gradient descent depending on that gradient you get back you're going

169
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:32.150
to adapt your step size so in 2015 Kingman and Bob published a paper called Adam a method first stochastic

170
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.490
optimization.

171
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.570
And Adam is a much more efficient way of searching for these minimums.

172
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.130
So you're going to see us actually kind of sometimes state Adam as our optimizer during the code.

173
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:49.160
So keep that in mind if you ever see Adam all we're really referring to is this optimized way of performing

174
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.780
this gradient descent where we have kind of this adaptive step side.

175
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.700
So we kind of start off large and then depending on where we are maybe go smaller and smaller.

176
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.810
So you kind of get the best of both worlds.

177
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.500
You get to use the larger step sizes and kind of speed up finding that minimum.

178
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.490
But then as you get closer and closer to it and you don't want to overshoot you can go a smaller step

179
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:13.280
sizes so you can actually then compare Adam versus other gradient descent algorithms.

180
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.190
And here it's showing you the training cost versus iterations over the entire dataset and you can see

181
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.540
Adam here is outperforming these other adaptive gradient descent algorithms.

182
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:29.030
So all the ones listed here that are not Adam they're also actually adaptive gradient descents however

183
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.640
Adam performs better than all these.

184
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.450
So we're going to be doing is we'll be using Adam since it's really quite common to use it for neural

185
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.290
networks.

186
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:41.120
So if you see that all we're doing here is we're kind of saying OK optimize the way we find this minimum

187
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.950
now realistically we're showing you that illustration of gradient descent on just a single W..

188
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:54.380
So that was kind of a one dimensional W. or really doing is we're calculating gradient descent in an

189
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.710
end dimensional space for all our weights.

190
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:02.660
Here you can see calculating gradient descent in a two dimensional plane including the weights and the

191
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.680
bias.

192
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.380
Realistically I'm not even gonna be able to illustrate the end dimensional space because it's gonna

193
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.210
be end dimensions of tens or hundreds of weights and biases.

194
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.730
So there's really no way we can illustrate that for you.

195
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.710
Which is why we simplify it down to kind of a single way you can understand gradient descent is doing.

196
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.980
And then what we're actually doing or what the computer will be doing for us is doing the same sort

197
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:31.830
of calculations that on an n dimensional space that we can't really realistically illustrate for you.

198
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.920
So when dealing with these n dimensional vectors otherwise known as sensors the notation changes from

199
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.390
derivative to gradient.

200
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.720
So that's why you've heard me say a gradient a couple of times instead of the term derivative.

201
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:47.690
So when we're dealing with n dimensions instead of saying the derivative that actually the correct term

202
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.860
becomes gradient.

203
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.920
And so that means we calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to all these weights.

204
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:59.540
So if you see that upside that upside down triangle that's essentially kind of the way you notate gradient

205
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.790
instead of just saying derivative.

206
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:08.030
Now before we finish up and wrap up this lecture on loss or cost functions and gradient descent on a

207
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:13.820
quickly I mentioned that for classification problems instead of using the quadratic cost function we

208
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.260
end up often using is the cross entropy loss function.

209
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.520
And what's nice about this cross entropy loss function is that basically what it does it assumes that

210
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.470
your model predicts a probability distribution for each class.

211
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.330
So maybe it has a distribution for class one class two plus three and so on.

212
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:38.360
And the way this formula actually works out is for a binary classification that is only two classes.

213
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:45.380
You have the top formula resulting and then those logs actually represent natural logs and then for

214
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.500
any number of classes greater than two you are using the formula below.

215
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.420
And the worry too much about this formula because essentially more coding it out we're just going to

216
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.320
specify use cross entropy.

217
00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.620
So when we're performing classification especially multi class classification that's greater than just

218
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.950
binary classification.

219
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.720
We'll be calling upon cross entropy to be our cost function.

220
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.490
Okay.

221
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.320
So just keep that in mind if you ever see us coding and we specify cross entropy.

222
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.990
These are the actual formulas we're specifying the computer to use in order to figure out a probability

223
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:21.170
distribution for each of those classes so as a quick review we talked about cost functions.

224
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.740
We talked about gradient descent.

225
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.000
We talked about the fact that there's different optimizer is like the atom optimizer and then we also

226
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.590
talked about quadratic cost and cross entropy so far we understand the networks take an input affect

227
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:38.050
that input of weights and biases and activation functions to produce an estimated output.

228
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.020
Then we learned how to evaluate that output against the true labels.

229
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.150
The last thing you need to do in our theory discussions is the following question.

230
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.470
Once we actually get that cost or loss value we understand how far off we are.

231
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:56.100
We still haven't really talked about how we go back and adjust all those weights and biases.

232
00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:01.040
Still kind of this magical thing and that magical thing and just the second will no longer be so magical.

233
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.600
So it'll be mathematical and it's called Back propagation.

234
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:09.650
You essentially propagate backwards through your network and then update all those weights and biases.

235
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.290
So that's exactly we're going to cover in the next lecture.

236
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:12.770
I'll see you there.
