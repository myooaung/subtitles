00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,710
Welcome back everyone to generative adversarial networks.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,520
In part one we're just going to briefly go over uploading our data now to save on train time or we're

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,840
actually going to be doing is working off the m this dataset.

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,590
A data set that we're very familiar with.

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,870
That way we can focus on how the generator and discriminator actually work instead of focusing on learning

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,310
about a new dataset.

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,960
But the other thing we're going to be doing is to save on training time and to really see how the generator

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,630
and discriminator work we're going to be filtering out the m this dataset to only select a single digit

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,450
so we'll select all the zeros for instance and then we can clearly see the generator be able to generate

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,340
images that look like a zero.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,680
OK let's head over to the notebook and get started.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,670
All right.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,360
Here I am at the notebook I've already imported an umpire S&amp;P pandas as PD and map pup lived up pipeline

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,580
SPL T.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,910
And let's load up our end this data set.

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:09,020
We can do this by saying from tensor flow dock carries that data sets import amnesty so this a data

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,910
set that already actually very familiar with.

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:18,560
So we'll go ahead and do is will simply use the tuple unpacking TO GRAB IT WE'LL GRAB THE X train y

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,250
train subset of those tuples and then the X test and white test and we run this with M this stop load

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,540
data.

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,980
OK so we load up our data.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,110
Let's go ahead and use peel to show the display at one of these to the arrays let's go ahead and grab

23
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,590
that first image X strange zero and we can see it's a five.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,600
Okay.

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,910
And recall that the actual y data is essentially just the actual number itself.

26
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,050
So we can see on y train the first one was the five corresponds to this image.

27
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,970
So what I want to do is want to filter out the data for two reasons.

28
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:01,130
One is to get a little bit of a smaller dataset for faster training and 2 so we can clearly understand

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,770
the generator is working or not.

30
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:12,280
So what I want you to do is choose one of these numbers to actually feed and generate data from.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,370
So what I mean by that is for instance I'm going to select only zeros.

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:26,530
I can go ahead and follow along with me by saying X train where y train is equal to zeros.

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,700
So notice here I have white train and if I were to say where's white train equal to zeros then I get

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,150
this tuple of excuse me this num pi array of billions false true false false etc..

35
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:47,190
And so I'm going to use these actual boolean indices to then only gram those corresponding X train images

36
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:56,400
essentially allowing me to only grab the zero images and now if I take a look at only zeros dot shape.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,920
Notice now I have around 6000 images the actual size of my full dataset recall is about ten times as

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,630
much sixty thousand images.

39
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,280
So we're dealing with a much smaller dataset.

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,340
And what's nice is now all of these numbers essentially look more or less the same.

41
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,320
So any of these for example loops not only train only zeros.

42
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,170
So any of these guys just go ahead and choose any random number between zero and five thousand nine

43
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,550
hundred twenty three.

44
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:30,690
And if you actually show it feel to team show they're all essentially these kind of zero looking things.

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,380
So they should be kind of looking like doughnuts or these rings which is kind of nice because that way

46
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,470
we can be able to tell if our generator is actually learning from our very particular data set.

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,810
So I would encourage you to choose a number and if you want you can choose zeros like us because it's

48
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,920
a very distinct shape.

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,400
We can see here that there's essentially no values on the outside.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,670
Then we suddenly have our values as the string and then no values on the inside.

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,850
It's a very particular shape and it's gonna be hard for the generator to mistakenly make this from just

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,990
random noise.

53
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,490
So there's a very distinct shape.

54
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,960
So we'll be able tell whether or not our generator is learning from it.

55
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,270
OK so that's it for the data.

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,800
What we've done here is we just loaded up our data set and then only using the x train data set.

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,570
What we did is we filtered down and chose one particular number if you want to follow along exactly

58
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,780
if us go ahead and just choose zeros.

59
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,380
But what's fun about this is then you can change this white train to equal any number from the M this

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,100
digit dataset.

61
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,240
OK.

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,090
Coming up next we're going to focus on is actually creating the generator and the discriminator.

63
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,620
I'll see it there.
