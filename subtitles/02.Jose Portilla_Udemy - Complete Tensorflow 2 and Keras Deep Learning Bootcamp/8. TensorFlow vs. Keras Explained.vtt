00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.440
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.310
In this lecture we're going to discuss the difference between tensor flow and carries.

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.470
So before we begin learning how to code our own neural networks I want to quickly clarify the differences

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.540
between tense flow and cares.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.220
Since this is a common point of confusion for students.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.410
So we already learned all the theoretical aspects of neural networks.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.990
Now right before we start coding I want to clarify a few things tensor flow is an open source Deep Learning

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.850
library developed by Google with tensor flow 2.0 being officially released in late 2019.

9
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.260
TENSOR flow has large ecosystem of related components including libraries like tech support for visualization

10
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.810
deployment options and production API side as well as support for various programming languages not

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.830
just Python cares is a high level python library that can use a variety of Deep Learning libraries underneath

12
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.060
so it can operate on top of libraries such as tensor flow C A.K. or Athena tensor flow one point X or

13
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.120
any of the one point versions had a complex python class system for building models and because it was

14
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.660
a little more complex.

15
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.870
The Caris library ended up being a simpler more abstract API that could run on top of tensor flow so

16
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.570
Caris ended up becoming very popular and it was so popular that when the developers for tensor flow

17
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.770
ended up releasing 2.0 they adopted Caris as the official API for tensor flow.

18
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.270
So while Caris still also remains as a separate library from tensor flow it can also now be officially

19
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.670
imported through tensor flow so there's no need to do an additional installation of carers cares is

20
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.900
now officially part of tensor flow in it's the official API for tensor flow 2.0 and going forward because

21
00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.170
it's simpler to use than the more complex subclass system that was used in tensor flow one point X versions

22
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.530
the curious API.

23
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.760
It's easy to use and build models by simply adding layers on top of each other through simple calls.

24
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.230
So in the next lecture let's begin exploring the basics of the cares API for tensor flow.

25
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.850
I'll see you there.
