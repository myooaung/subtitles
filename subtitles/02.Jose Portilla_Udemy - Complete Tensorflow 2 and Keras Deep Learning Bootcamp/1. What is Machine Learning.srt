00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,210
Hello everyone and welcome to this section of the course that focuses on just general machine learning

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,830
and in this particular lecture we're going to try to get an understanding of what is machine learning

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:23,630
so before we jump into neural networks tensor flow the caris API etc. It's a good idea to understand

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,300
a few fundamental general concepts regarding machine learning.

5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,780
So in this section we're going to cover some important theory and concepts surrounding machine learning

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,180
so we'll be covering things like in this lecture what is machine learning as well as answering the question

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,650
what is deep learning.

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,930
Then we'll talk about in future lectures differences between supervised and unsupervised learning the

9
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,600
actual supervised learning process and then how do we actually evaluate performance and how do we evaluate

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,700
performance for different tasks.

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,230
If we're performing a regression task like trying to predict the price of a new house on the market

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,110
or performing a classification task such as trying to predict whether we have an image of a cat or a

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,630
dog there's different ways to evaluate how well our actual machine learning models are performing or

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,920
doing so we need to take that into account and then we'll also discuss things like overfishing.

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,600
So all of these concepts can apply to just general machine learning algorithms.

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,660
So it's part that we have a general understanding over a lot of these things before diving into things

17
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,850
like neural networks and deep learning so let's first briefly discuss what is machine learning machine

18
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:37,390
learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building using algorithms that

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,430
it really learned from the data.

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,440
Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly program ought to

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,360
look.

22
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,310
So typically a lot of times when we're trying to program something using Python for instance we have

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,810
to tell the program what to do.

24
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:59,740
In each case maybe with an if statement or an if l statement however with machine learning what we do

25
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:06,520
is we follow a general process and then allow the machine learning algorithm to figure out what the

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,550
best approach is dependent on the data.

27
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:17,360
So really ends up learning from the data and that is what automates the model building so was Machine

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,600
Learning used for well machine learning is used in a wide variety of topics and use cases everything

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,590
from fraud detection to web search results to credit scoring.

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,240
So if you're ever applying for a mortgage there's machine learning happening behind the scenes to see

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,530
if your credit worthy.

32
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,350
Or maybe you're traveling abroad and ease your credit card and you get a call indicating a possible

33
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,880
fraud on your credit card.

34
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,930
That's also machine learning attempting to detect fraudulent use cases.

35
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,060
Then there's things like recommendation engines.

36
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,480
So if you're shopping on something like Amazon.com or even viewing some online streaming video service

37
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,920
and it's recommending new videos or new movies or new TV shows to you.

38
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,840
Machine learning is used for that as well and things like e-mail spam filtering so the e-mails that

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,850
actually go into your spam folder that's using natural language processing to figure out what is the

40
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,470
actual spam email and then things like pattern and image recognition.

41
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:18,170
Now there's certain use cases where the only possible approach is to use deep learning.

42
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,820
So keep that in mind later on the course especially during things like convolution on neural networks

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,210
for image analysis.

44
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,310
We'll be learning techniques where the only way to actually conquer this task so to speak is by using

45
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,570
the capabilities of deep learning and neural networks so are these neural networks.

46
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,360
We're going to go into a lot more detail about how neural networks are constructed in the next section

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,090
of the course.

48
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,240
But for the basics Neural Networks are a way of modeling biological and you're on systems mathematically.

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,790
And these networks can then be used to solve tasks that many other types of algorithms can't.

50
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,280
So for example that image classification it's really hard for other machine learning algorithms to perform

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,640
well on things like image classification.

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,730
And this is the kind of task where neural networks perform very well.

53
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,990
So deep learning simply refers to neural networks with more than one hidden layer.

54
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,930
Now there are many different types of machine learning tasks and in the next section of the course we're

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,240
really going to be focusing on two specific types of machine learning tasks and those are supervised

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,720
learning tasks and then unsupervised learning tasks.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,180
So we're gonna cover supervised learning and then briefly talk about unsupervised learning in the next

58
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,450
sexual course and we talk about things like classification and regression.

59
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,680
Those will fall under supervised learning so it's important understand the distinctions between these

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,210
two various topics.

61
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,200
And then as a final note sometimes students get confused between machine learning neural networks and

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,760
deep learning and what the differences are between them.

63
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,270
As a quick review machine learning those are just a general terms for those automated analytical models

64
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,270
neural networks is actually a specific type of machine learning architecture or algorithm that specifically

65
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,660
modeled after biological neurons and then deep learning.

66
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,470
Put simply is really just a neural network with more than one hidden layer.

67
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,480
And we'll discuss what that means and what a hidden layer actually is in the artificial neural network

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,430
section of the course.

69
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,370
Coming up next.

70
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,480
So let's go ahead and begin by learning about one of the most common machine learning tasks which is

71
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,890
supervised learning.

72
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll see you in the next lecture.
