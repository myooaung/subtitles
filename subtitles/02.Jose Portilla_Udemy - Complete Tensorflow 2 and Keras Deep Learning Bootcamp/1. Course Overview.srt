00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,070
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,450
Welcome to this course.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,610
As a quick introduction to the course we're going to have a course overview lecture and I ask you one

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,980
favor that you Please don't skip this lecture.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,140
We're going to quickly cover just a lot of important topics to give you the best course experience possible

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,470
so in this lecture we'll talk about some useful tips for going through the course how to get help during

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,280
the course.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,380
Advice on how to approach the course where to find the course notebooks and notes and how to use our

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,190
student chat channel so a couple of useful tips to use the video player settings to speed up or slow

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,270
down the videos.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,100
All you need to do is look at the bottom bar of the video player and you should see either a little

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,700
gear icon or just a setting icon to actually speed up or slow down the videos for playback speed.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,180
Also I would highly encourage you to make sure to view the videos in 10 ADP quality.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,970
You can use the Udemy app to download videos of course lectures.

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,360
Also please make sure to make use of our current question and answer forums.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,290
There's lots of previous discussion already available there free to check out now let's talk about getting

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,460
help during the course.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,520
If you're experiencing issues with the Udemy platform then please email support at to me that com or

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,400
go to their support page and open up a new ticket.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,650
These are issues like video playback issues.

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,320
If you experience blurry video or audio issues if you experienced choppy audio or things like getting

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,170
your certification or issues if your payment I don't control that you give me those.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,480
So you can send them an email that support you to me that com also.

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,310
As far as getting help of the course before actually posting to our question and answer forums inside

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,700
the course please make sure that you are using our provided environment file and that you've tried running

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,960
or provided notebooks directly not just copying pace individual cells but running our entire notebook

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,930
often simple typos can cause errors and if you follow the two steps above that pretty much guarantees

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,000
that the notes should work because we have the right environment file for you.

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,070
Our notebooks will run with no errors.

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,450
If you're running them inside the provided environment file so if you ever get an error while you're

31
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,430
coding along the course please make sure to follow these two steps in order to fix any of those typos

32
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,060
other things you may want to do besides double checking against the course notebooks is if you're exploring

33
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,460
other technical things with tensor flow or programming usually quick Google search or stack overflow

34
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,360
search of your error code will bring right away.

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,860
The most relevant answer also I encourage you to search the CUNY forums in the course and you can also

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,010
check out the FAA queue lecture for general questions.

37
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,140
If you still haven't found the answer to your question with all those steps please submit a new question

38
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,740
in the community forums including details on what you've tried as well the screenshot of your error

39
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,530
or your code.

40
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,310
Please keep in mind that we cannot help with your personal deep learning projects outside of the course

41
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,210
material.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,520
However if you do want to talk to somebody about your own personal work projects or fund projects involving

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,900
tensor flow or deep learning we have a discreet chat channel and it's a great place for you to share

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,690
your questions on your personal projects.

45
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,500
You can use the link and the automated welcome message to join our discourse server.

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,170
Upon enrolling in this course you should have received an automated welcome message.

47
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,410
It has all this information as well as a link and includes a link to a YouTube video describing how

48
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,590
to use and log into the chat server when you check your utility messages.

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,280
Please make sure to check all messages not just unread ones in order to actually see our welcome message

50
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,300
remember that the purpose of the chat channel is to connect students for other students technical questions

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,610
related to the course material are still best suited for.

52
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,890
Question Answer forums as far as approach in the course.

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,610
The best way to approach the course is to review the notebooks along with the video notebooks contain

54
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,190
code used in every lecture and are organized in the same order they appear in the course.

55
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,730
So upon downloading the zip file of the notebooks that goes with this course everything is essentially

56
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,490
in the exact same order organized by the same sections they see here in the unit.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,680
Of course the videos usually contain explanatory concepts that can't be shown through code resource

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,010
links.

59
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,720
The notebooks can be found in the FIA queue lecture.

60
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,960
We provide all the notebooks used inside of this as a zip file.

61
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,240
There is no get hub link.

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,370
It's all organised for you as just a simple download zip file the resource folder is a little blue folder.

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,420
Next the lecture title will actually show you all this through video in our course setup lecture.

64
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,630
So again we discuss all this in detail in the setup and installation lecture so you can follow us with

65
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,440
the video.

66
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,940
All right.

67
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,800
That's it.

68
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,750
Thank you so much for enrolling and let's get started with your course setup.
