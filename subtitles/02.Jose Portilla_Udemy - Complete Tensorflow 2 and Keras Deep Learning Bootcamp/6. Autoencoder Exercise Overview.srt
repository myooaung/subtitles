00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:12,150
Welcome back everyone to the auto encoders exercise so the purpose of this exercise is to really answer

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,520
the following question.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,470
Given a data set of average eating habits between countries in the United Kingdom does any particular

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,140
country stand out as different from the others.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,300
So keep in mind this particular question doesn't entail any specific discussion of dimensionality reduction.

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,530
In fact this question could possibly just be answered by taking a close look at the raw data itself.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,950
And we're going to actually explore that throughout the exercise.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:43,890
But we'll first try to answer the sort of question by visualizing the data and then we'll see how dimensionality

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,330
reduction can help us figure out which country is the standout.

10
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,520
So let's head over to the exercise notebook and explain where you're going to be doing OK.

11
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,460
Here we are at the exercise notebook to begin.

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,130
You're first going to run these imports and then read in the CSB file by running this command.

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,930
And essentially what this is.

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,740
It's a table of the average consumption of 17 different types of food in grams per person per week for

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,330
every country in the United Kingdom.

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,660
And so you'll notice that while the table after your reading data shows some interesting variations

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,680
the overall differences are actually not clear because what we have here are 17 different categories

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,520
across four countries England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,770
So what's going to occur here is from a normal just person perspective you're not actually going to

20
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,090
yield to take a look at this table and instantly figure out which country or which set of countries

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,110
is very different from the others.

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,520
So next logical choice is to try to visualize this and maybe decide to choose a heat map.

23
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,950
So we'll go ahead and have you transform or transpose the data frame to look like this where the countries

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,380
are the actual rows and then create a heat map that looks like this.

25
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,480
So this is one approach to answering this question and you'll see that this heat map still doesn't really

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,360
quite answer the question of which country is extremely different from the others.

27
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,200
So in that case you may want to try to perform dimensionality reduction because really the hard part

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,830
here is that we are dealing with 17 different categories of food across four different countries.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,970
So that's almost 80 different little cells here that we have to look at.

30
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,560
So instead of we're going to do is see if we can create an auto encoder that goes from seventeen to

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,850
eight to four to two and then back out from that two to four eight to 17 and you have flexibility over

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,800
what hidden layer neurons you want to choose but then you'll combine the encoder and decoder create

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,010
the auto encoder and eventually we should be able to do is after training on a set number of epochs

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,140
then you should get something that looks kind of like this.

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,070
Essentially what we did when we first discussed our encoders for dimensionality reduction and after

36
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,940
plotting this out you should notice that Northern Ireland is quite different than the other three countries.

37
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,950
Keep in mind you will most likely not get this exact plot especially if you use a different type of

38
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,110
auto encoder.

39
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,380
So we should notice is some differentiation between Northern Ireland versus the other three countries

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,560
and it does have that actually happened like this.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,820
It could be that Northern Ireland maybe centred around zero and the other three countries are not centred

42
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,410
around zero.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,190
OK so go ahead and take a look at this and follow along.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,330
The exercise coming up next we're going to work through an example solution.

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:35,900
We'll see whether.
