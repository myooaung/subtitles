00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,440
If you look at a typical response that comes back from the web server,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,040
you can see a number of headers with Spring Security included by default.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,290
These instruct the browser on how to communicate

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,440
more securely with the application.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,440
They are added by the header filter,

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,840
which can be conveniently altered using the headers builders

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,340
method on the HttpSecurity builder object.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,630
If we use the disable method,

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,010
then this filter will no longer be added to the filter chain,

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,440
and hence none of the headers will be included.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,080
Additionally, you can use the defaultDisabled,

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,550
which still adds the filter to the chain, but disables all the

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,680
default headers, and then you can add your own.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,360
As you can see, it's very easy to disable these headers,

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:59,000
and I have seen many code samples online doing so. Now let's go through these filters and learn why they are important.
