00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.640
The main takeaway from this module is don't reinvent the wheel.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.970
Increased adoption of frameworks like Spring Security have resulted in many

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.810
of the common security threats like cross‑site scripting,

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.140
cross‑site request forgery, dropping out of the OWASP top 10 as you're

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.700
getting a lot of protection right out of the box, often threats you don't

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.910
even know about. You're also joining a large group of security nerds with

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.190
a vested interest in keeping the framework up to date with the latest

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.130
security threats and trends.

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.010
And as you have seen, Spring Security is very configurable,

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.590
and it's easy to unintentionally disable some of

11
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.740
the default security protection.

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.670
Hence, before disabling anything,

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.000
make sure you are confident and are aware of the risks to your users before going ahead.
