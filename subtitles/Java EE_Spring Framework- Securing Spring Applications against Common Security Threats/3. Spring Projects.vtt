00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.060
Spring Security by design is very modular.

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.280
It has solutions for many of the challenges an

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.640
enterprise application might face.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.490
There are many projects from Spring Data that deals with data

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.440
access, Spring Cloud for building microservices, and,

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.340
of course, Spring Security, which is the topic of this course.

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.340
If you drill into the Spring Security project,

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.070
it is made up of multiple modules that can be added as

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640
dependencies to your application.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.980
Spring‑security‑core and spring‑security‑config are the main modules

11
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.670
responsible for the core authentication and authorization functionality and to

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.840
enable custom configurations via annotations or via XML.

13
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.250
Then, you can add spring‑security‑test if you need to

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.640
test the security implementation.

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.510
If you're securing a web application,

16
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.310
then you need to include spring‑security‑web.

17
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.740
Other modules include spring‑security‑oauth, ldap, and so forth.

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.740
As you can see, you can mix and match to get the level of security you require.

19
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.340
Okay, now that we have gotten some of the terminology and theory out of the way,

20
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.000
join me next in the next module where you will see just how easy it is to configure Spring Security using spring Boot.
