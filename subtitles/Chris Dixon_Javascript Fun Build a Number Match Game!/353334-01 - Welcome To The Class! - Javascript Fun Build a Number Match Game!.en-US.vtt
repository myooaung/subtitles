00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.115
Hey, welcome to this class.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.680
If you are a web development beginner and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.590
wants to just jump in and build some fun projects,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.840
you've came to the right place.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
The idea behind these series is to show you what you can do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.550
with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.830
We're not going to be using any frameworks,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
any bolerplate, any libraries or any templates.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.970
Instead, we're going to be building everything completely from scratch,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.065
step-by-step to show you how these free technologies all work together.

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:46.405
This particular project is going to be a number match game.

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:48.640
The rules are pretty straightforward.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.200
If we click on the play button,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.180
we are then presented with a series of images,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.230
and then the user needs to decide if the number of items in

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.025
the image is the same as the question over on the left.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:03.145
If we think this is true we click on the tick,

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:04.930
If we believe this to be incorrect,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.560
we click on the cross and our score is then adjusted depending on the correct answer.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.415
We have a certain number of images which are all unique.

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:20.210
Also, we can change the time duration between each one of these images too.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.785
At the end of the game we'll also get the opportunity to begin

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:27.510
a new game and also see our total score too.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.860
As with all of the rest of the projects,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.989
we create the user interface using HTML,

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:37.355
and then we use our CSS for the styling and also the layout too.

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:39.845
We'll work with arrays of objects,

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.450
working with time delays,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.450
functions, working with the DOM.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.535
Randomly setting the source of the image element,

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:50.330
generating and display in random numbers, comparing numbers,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.525
working with timeouts, updating the user score

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:57.580
and also some nice little touches such as some fade, animations too.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.050
This is a great project,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.880
if you are a beginner and a newcomer to HTML,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.645
CSS, and JavaScript, and I hope you're interested in this course.

00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:08.610
I'll see you in the first lesson.
