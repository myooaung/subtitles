00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.485
For this next project, which is the number match game,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.800
we're going to rely on using quite lots of images.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.980
You can use your own images for this course,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.570
but I also have provided a Images folder if you want to use the same ones as me.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.715
If you head over to github and head over to the repository for this course,

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:24.270
which is fun-javascript projects.com.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.290
You will then be taken to a page where you can download the full code,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.050
which will include all of the projects and also

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.530
these steps solutions and also any assets.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.960
From here we can download the zip files,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.595
get the complete bundle.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:42.055
Then once downloaded, if we go into the number match game,

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:44.300
you'll see an images folder.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.715
There will also be the cold solutions for each video too.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.430
This is going to be the game which we're going to creating.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.130
It's a pretty simple user interface,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.780
we just have two sections.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.790
We have a welcome section,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.410
where we're going to click on the play button and to get started.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.044
The whole idea of this project is we're going to cycle through a number of images,

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:11.645
will then have a certain amount of items in each one of these images,

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:15.305
such as two cards or eighth birthday candles.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:17.900
Then the user needs to decide if the number on

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.135
the left is the same multiple items as in the picture.

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:24.905
For example, we have two peppers,

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:26.285
so this would be correct.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:30.020
We click on the tick. This is seven paint brushes,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.145
so that will be wrong, I'm going to click on the X.

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:39.245
The timescale for each one of these images is going to be also set inside the project.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:41.525
This is completely adjustable.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:43.610
If you want the game to be more difficult,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.425
we can reduce the time down,

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:48.980
and we can also increase it to make the game more simple.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.840
The game is effectively overwhelm,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.700
we cycle through all of the images.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.480
In our case, we provided 20 images in the Images folder.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.030
Once we get through 20 of these,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.060
will then get a screen at the end which tells the user how many they've got correct.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.120
Over to the desktop and let's create a new project folder.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.770
The name of this one is going to be a number match.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.425
Drag this over into your text editor.

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:21.620
We can begin with a new file,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.440
which is going to be the index.HTML.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.530
Again, we need our HTML structure and I'm going to use the built-in emmet command,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.190
which is HTML5, and then add a document title,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.210
which is number match.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.775
Let's right-click and copy the path,

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:48.780
and paste this into a new browser tab.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.655
Let's get to work inside of our body section.

00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.715
This is going to contain one main section,

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:59.940
which is going to be the main wrapper for all of the content.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.830
We're also going to make use of this inside of

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.260
JavaScript so we can give this a unique ID.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.290
I want to go for game area.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.770
This main section is going to consist of two main areas.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.870
We're going to have the start section,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.220
which is on the left,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.120
and on the right, we're going to have the image area.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.830
This go into two separate divs.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.700
The first one is for the left hand side.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.310
The class all starts.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.110
The second div is going to be for the image area to the class of image area.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.540
These are our two main wrappers for our game area,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.505
and we're going to begin on the left-hand side,

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:45.355
which is these stats.

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:47.510
Taking a look at the final version here,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.000
we're going to have a score which is going to be

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.965
updated dynamically as the user gets these right or wrong.

00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:58.160
We're then going to have a number which is going to be randomly generated,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.675
the name of the image,

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:01.660
and then our two buttons.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.860
Also just as a side note too,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.630
when we get to this later.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.480
The number which is generated just here.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.950
This is going to be either the exact amount of items in the image,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.980
or it's going to be one higher, one lower.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.649
This is to make the game a little bit more challenging.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.235
For example, we don't want to see 10 items on the screen.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:24.560
Then a number of one's compared to,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.415
since this would make the game pretty simple.

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:31.065
In the starts area, let's open up this div.

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:34.915
I'm going to begin at the very top with a level 3 heading.

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:37.665
This post the text of score.

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:41.554
The user score will be something such as 2 over 20.

00:04:41.554 --> 00:04:44.195
But these two areas are going to be dynamic.

00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:47.630
The first one we can create a span element.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.780
Let's give it an ID, which is going to be our current score.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.030
Just after the forward slash,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.400
this can be a dynamic Section 2.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.635
A second span elements.

00:04:58.635 --> 00:05:00.590
This is going to have the ID,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.295
which is going to be equal to total available.

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:08.209
This is going to be the total amount of points which is available,

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:11.405
which is the same number of images we're going to have.

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:15.605
We can also add some placeholder values just to make this more visible.

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:18.870
Let's go for two and 20.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.465
This is how it looks inside the browser.

00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:27.575
The next thing to do is to move down to our next section.

00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:30.470
If we click on "PLAY " this is going to be the number of

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.590
items in the image followed by the two buttons.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.315
Let's do this under the level 3 heading.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:41.600
The text is going to have the class of items.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.460
This is so we can add some styling inside of the CSS.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.140
Again, this is going to be two dynamic sections.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.930
We're going to have the randomly generated number,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.990
which is either the number of items one higher or one lower.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.750
Let's do this inside of a span with the ID of number.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.760
We can add a place holder value inside here.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.040
Then a second span with the ID,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.845
which is equal to item name.

00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:13.880
A placeholder value inside of here,

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:21.555
so this will be the images so let's go for six ducks and a space in-between.

00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:24.220
Next up, just after the p element,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.050
we can add a new div section,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.260
which is going to be the wrapper for our two buttons.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.159
The class which is going to be used in the CSS,

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.799
this is going to be equal to much buttons.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.520
Then our first button, the first symbol we're going

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.155
to use or the first character is going to be the tic,

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:49.940
which is going to be used as a hedge small entity with the code of the ampersands,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.425
the hash 10003 followed by the semicolon.

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:57.500
The second button, which is going to be across,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.630
and this is going to be a HTML entity code,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.025
which is the ampersand,

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:05.999
the harsh 10007, and the semicolon.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.160
The next stage is to add the image area,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.490
which is going to be the right-hand side.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.530
Currently when we're just starting the HTML this may look a

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.365
little messy because we need to create two sections.

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:20.320
We need to create this welcome screen,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.795
and we also need to create the image section once the game is in play.

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:29.975
We use JavaScript to show and hide these two sections.

00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:34.235
Let's start if we go down to our second div just after the stats,

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:36.020
which is image area,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.250
will get to work with our welcome screen at the beginning.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.015
At the very top, we're going to add a level 3 heading,

00:07:42.015 --> 00:07:44.880
which is going to have the ID of message.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.255
This is going to be empty level 3 heading,

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:51.455
and we'll use JavaScript later on to add a message,

00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:53.930
which is going to tell the user desk call.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.570
This section will also only be available at the end of the game.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.005
Next up a div section,

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:04.640
and this is going to be the wrapper for our start screen.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.960
Inside here, this is just going to be all the content we see at the beginning.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.400
We'll then hide this and then begin the game.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.390
To keep this unique, we can add an ID which is equal to the start screen,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.395
and the contents to begin will be a level 1 heading.

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:27.455
This is the text which we'll see right at the very top.

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:33.810
Also notice how the word number match is also emphasized. That's our descend.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.960
Then we can wrap the number match in the m elements.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.710
The next section is also emphasize too.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.900
We can say the rules are simple.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.110
Again inside the m elements.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.885
Then all of the rest of the text is going to be in the p elements.

00:08:56.885 --> 00:09:02.600
The next two lines are going to be prefixed with a HTML entity for this little arrow.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.265
This is going to have the entity code which is equal to the ampersand,

00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:10.795
the harsh 96, 54,

00:09:10.795 --> 00:09:12.620
and then the semicolon,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.770
followed by the text, all of hit thumbs up.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:22.740
If the number of items matches the displayed number.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.240
After this, a second p elements,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.365
we're going to again use the same HTML entity code as above.

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:38.580
We can now descend, on the text is thumbs down if no match.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.620
The third one, which is the last line of text is you

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.415
have a certain number of seconds to decide.

00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:51.590
This number is also going to be dynamic,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.725
so we can change this in the JavaScript.

00:09:53.725 --> 00:10:00.695
We need to wrap this number in a span which is going to have the ID of time setting.

00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:05.140
In the p element you have,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.570
then create a span element with this ID.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.020
You can add the number inside here if you want,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.060
followed by seconds to decide.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.805
Let's see how it looks inside browser.

00:10:23.805 --> 00:10:27.600
This all looks fine, it just help us out with the CSS later on.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.310
We're also going to add a class each one of these lines of text.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.950
This is going to be a spacing class where we're

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.240
going to add some spacing on the top and bottom.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.520
Let's go over to our lines of text,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.220
and we'll start with the first line underneath the title.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.690
I'm going to give us a class,

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.000
which is space dash y,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.340
since this is responsible for adding some space and on the y-axis.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.735
Copy this and paste this in the p elements just below.

00:10:55.735 --> 00:11:00.110
This will give us some consistent space in when we add our styling.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.195
After this, we also have a play button down at the bottom.

00:11:04.195 --> 00:11:06.435
Stored in this div section,

00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:15.135
a button with the ID of play button, text to play.

00:11:15.135 --> 00:11:19.220
This is now all the content we need for all this welcome screen.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.420
The next thing we need to do is to add a placeholder image,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.420
which is going to be for effectively the next screen.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.195
It will take a look at the finished version just here.

00:11:29.195 --> 00:11:35.160
All we need to do here is to rotate or cycle through any of these images.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.830
All we need, and this is just a placeholder,

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:44.750
go underneath the button and then outside of our starts screen section.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.660
A new div, which is going to be the wrapper for

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.240
this image with the ID of image container.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.395
We're going to create an image dynamically using JavaScript.

00:11:57.395 --> 00:12:00.410
But for now we can add a placeholder image just so we

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.195
can see how everything looks when we come to add our CSS.

00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:07.475
First of all, we can go to the images folder,

00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:12.185
and then forward slash and the name of any of our images.

00:12:12.185 --> 00:12:14.810
I want to go for the macaroons.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:19.260
We can leave the alt text for now since this is going to be removed very soon.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.370
Next, we need to actually add these images into our project folder.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.175
We can use the same images which I've used in this course,

00:12:28.175 --> 00:12:30.065
or you can download your own.

00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:34.530
I'm going to paste these into our number match projects.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.645
This should now leave us with an image.

00:12:39.645 --> 00:12:43.700
It does look a little messy since these two sections will be swapped.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.145
We also need to add some CSS styling,

00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:49.110
which we're going to do in the next video.
