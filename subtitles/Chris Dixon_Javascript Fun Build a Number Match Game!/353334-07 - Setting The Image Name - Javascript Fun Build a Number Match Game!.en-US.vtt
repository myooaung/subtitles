00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.060
When the user is playing on the game,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.915
we have now handled one path of this display section.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:10.520
We've now linked the image to the number of items.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.520
The next thing I want to do is to also display the name of the image,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.010
so for example, say eight eggs,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.335
and what changes for each image.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.935
If we go back to our code in the script.js,

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.095
inside of our generate function,

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.635
we already actually have access to our random image name,

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:31.785
and we store on this inside of this constant.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.605
Here it says, crop in our images array,

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:36.510
as in our random number,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.640
and then select the new image name property as we can see just here.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.495
What I'm going to do now, we could,

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:49.895
if it uses random image name to add the functionality to this generate function,

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:54.520
but instead to keep things more separate I'm going to create a new function.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.305
Let's add this into our generate function and let's call this one set image name.

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:05.660
This function is going to take in our random image name,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.460
so let's grab this and paste this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.090
in and we can use this outside of our generate function.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.085
Let's say columns. The function name of sets,

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:21.020
image name and this is taking in our variable of random image name.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.435
This is a arrow function.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.030
Before writing our code into this function,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.880
let's do a console log and check we're receiving the random image name.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.830
Open up the console, and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.395
we "Click on play" to see the eggs dot jpg, because dot jpg.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.820
What we now want to do is to take

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.745
this name and display this inside of our user interface.

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:52.405
Before we do this, though, we need to trim

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:57.200
the dot jpg extension of the end of this image.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.140
The way we can do this is by using a JavaScript method which is called Slice.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.750
Slice is going to take a string of

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.425
text and we already have a random image name for our string,

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:13.750
and then we'll call this slice method,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.770
and this will return a new string with a certain part removed.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.310
So let's remove our console log.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.160
We can access our random image name called the Slice method.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.560
Slice is going to take in two values,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.180
which is going to be the start on

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.735
the imposition of the characters which you want to remove.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:37.105
If we had eggs dot jpg,

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:39.965
we want to remove the word which is eggs,

00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:42.230
so we'll begin at the very first character,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.485
which is the position of zero,

00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:47.225
and then the second value, which is optional.

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:48.590
If we were to leave this out,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.230
this would go right through to the end of our string,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.655
but instead we want to go back four places.

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:58.190
The way we can do this is by getting the full length of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.045
our string and then go back four places.

00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:04.625
First of all, we can get the full length of

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:09.090
the string by using the random image name, dot length.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.420
Currently this goes from the start of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.515
the letter E right through to the end of our string,

00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:21.965
which is the letter G. We want to go back four places,

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:24.155
so let's use negative four.

00:03:24.155 --> 00:03:28.475
We can check this is work in a bystander list inside of a constant.

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:31.260
Let's call this the image name,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.470
so this equal to the new value which is returned from our splice method,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.800
and then we can do a console log with our new image name.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.360
Back over to the console and inspect. Click on play.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.790
We now see dot jpg has been removed from each one of our names.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.120
This is good and this is all now are working.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.080
The next thing we need to do is to obtain the user interface inside of our index.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.215
Let's go to our placeholder and remove this.

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:17.270
Then we can target the span with the ID of item name, so document.getElementByID.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.490
The ID which was item name,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.619
and then we can say to the inner HTML,

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:25.330
which is equal to our variable of image name.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.120
Just after this I'm also going to add onto the end of a string,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.725
which is a question mark.

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:33.460
Just let the user know that this is a question,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.445
so this will say seven ducks and then a question mark,

00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:39.755
so the user knows that this is a question's answer.

00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:42.990
Let's try this out over inside the browser.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.580
Click on play, see two cars,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.030
that's good, bananas, ducks.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.365
This is all now working fine.

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:57.210
With this now taken care of,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.270
now let's move on to the next video,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.730
where we're going to handle the user's guess.
