1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,850
And that's it.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,630
We've reached the end of this module, introducing you

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,730
to the world of Amazon Web Services.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,950
There was quite a bit to cover in the first module to prepare you for

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,420
going even more in depth with AWS throughout this course.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,440
So let's go over what we learned in this module.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,550
We started by discussing web application hosting and the

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,340
main drivers for moving it into the cloud.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,210
Amazon grabbed on this new paradigm and developed a

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,730
business to support and profit off of cloud computing in

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,790
the form of Amazon Web Services.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,730
The two major drivers of AWS popularity continue to be pricing and scalability,

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,470
and we talked more in depth about the geographical

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,140
reach of AWS throughout the globe.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,520
We talked about how AWS services interact and what you

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,640
can expect when working with them.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,150
Finally, we discussed a few of Amazon's competitors like Azure,

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,230
Google Cloud, and Heroku.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,000
Hopefully,

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,250
this helped you identify AWS as the best solution for your use case

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,240
because there's a lot more for us to cover in this course.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,540
In the next module, we're going to look at what I call the core services of AWS.

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,280
These are the basic services that you are likely to use no

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,410
matter your type of web application.

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,920
This is going to be a slightly more technical introduction into

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,000
what is really going on in that web of services.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,310
We'll look at EC2, Amazon's cloud computing service,

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,900
which is the most commonly used service on AWS. Next is S3, the

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,940
essential service for storing static files.

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,720
And actually, I might have been wrong because this

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,140
might be the most used service.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,380
Most web applications also require some sort of database.

33
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,650
So we'll look at the Relational Database Service. And finally,

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,260
we'll look at Route53,

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,840
which is a service for configuring URL routing to your application.

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:01,000
And with these four core services, we'll cover the main things that you will need to get started with Amazon Web Services.
