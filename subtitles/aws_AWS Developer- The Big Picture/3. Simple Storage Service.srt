00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,440
Simple Storage Service, which is also called S3,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,640
thankfully because, man, Simple Storage Service is a tongue twister.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,890
It is a service that stores files.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,510
Although you can host files to end users, that's not all it's used for.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,970
S3 is sort of a catch‑all service used by other services in AWS,

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,040
like CloudWatch and Elastic Beanstalk, for instance.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,960
It's widely used throughout AWS as the place to store files.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,650
S3 can be used for any type of file,

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,630
and the only limitation is a maximum size of 5 TB,

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,180
and that was not a mistake.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,200
The maximum object size is actually 5 TB.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,320
According to AWS documentation, I haven't actually tried this,

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,980
the largest file size that you can upload in a single put operation is 5 GB,

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,330
but there are other methods to upload a larger object in separate operations.

15
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,700
Buckets are the foundational structure in S3.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,510
A bucket is your root resource to which you can add, delete, or modify objects.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,030
There are all sorts of configuration options that you can set on buckets,

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,840
like permissions, hosting options, and logging.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,820
Buckets can be configured to trigger events when changes happen,

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,160
preserve old versions of any objects,

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,240
and automatically replicate objects to different regions.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,290
Once created,

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,310
buckets are assigned URLs to which you can access

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,540
the objects contained within them.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,970
When the permissions for objects are modified to allow anonymous access,

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,580
S3 can be used to host static files for websites.

27
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,870
There are a lot of options Amazon has added to S3 that make it

28
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,940
extremely flexible and useful in a variety of situations.

29
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,440
S3 makes it simple to use for hosting a static website.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,860
Within the bucket configuration options,

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,540
there is the ability to enable static website hosting for the given bucket.

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,600
You still have object‑level permissions to give access

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,100
to anonymous or authenticated users,

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,990
but the bucket itself will respond to requests and be

35
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,480
enabled to interact with Route53 URLs.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,370
This is a quick and easy way to get a static website up with very minimal cost.

37
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,680
If hosting a site like this or even just assets for a

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,330
website‑like images sounds like your use case,

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,420
you may be wondering how to solve the latency problem

40
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,140
I mentioned in the last module.

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,450
With S3, you can automatically replicate files to other regions,

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,240
but AWS provides a better solution.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,040
By using another service from Amazon called CloudFront,

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,310
you can cache your content, sometimes called edging your

45
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,910
content, at locations around the world.

46
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,640
We'll talk about CloudFront more in the next module.

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,960
Now let's talk about how much this is going to cost you.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,490
S3 is price‑based on three aspects, amount of data stored,

49
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,340
number of requests for objects made, and amount of data

50
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,470
transferred. Prices are different per region, and base

51
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,440
costs get cheaper as volumes go up.

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,490
But here are the prices for the first tier of each in the Oregon region.

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,140
Also note, these prices are per bucket.

54
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,440
AWS charges 2.3 cents per gigabyte of data stored.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,320
Pretty reasonable. Requests are priced differently based on the

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,940
type of request, but put requests are basically half a cent per

57
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,580
1,000 requests. And for data transferred,

58
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,360
the first gigabyte per month is free and then 9 cents per gigabyte up to 10 TB.

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,670
Overall, I think S3 is pretty reasonably priced for storage and

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,330
has a low barrier of entry, not to mention that there is a free

61
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:54,000
tier giving you 5 GB of storage and some free requests and data transfer for the first year.
