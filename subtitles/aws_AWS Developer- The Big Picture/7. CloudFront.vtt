00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.060
I previously mentioned CloudFront in the clip on S3 as a way to combat latency.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.640
Well, now we're going to take a closer look at CloudFront and how it works.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.900
CloudFront is a content delivery network that allows you to

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.280
serve files globally with very fast connections.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.230
CloudFront works seamlessly with S3, EC2, AWS load

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.230
balancers, and Route53 to serve your content from the

7
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.840
location closest to incoming requests.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.830
CloudFront is probably the easiest of all the services to set up.

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.940
You start by creating a CloudFront distribution.

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.640
A distribution defines a set of content to be served from CloudFront.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.850
For each distribution,

12
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.400
you will need to specify an original location for the content,

13
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.740
such as an S3 bucket.

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.160
Once the distribution has been created, a unique CloudFront URL will

15
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.750
be assigned to the distribution, and that is what you will use to

16
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.840
access the content. On this distribution, you can configure which HTTP

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.450
methods are allowed, which edge locations to use, and even configure

18
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.470
your own SSL certificate.

19
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.420
CloudFront pricing is fairly convoluted and differs depending on

20
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.840
which edge locations a user makes a request to.

21
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.730
For instance,

22
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:24.380
the first 10 TB of outgoing data in the United States is 8.5 cents per gigabyte.

23
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.020
Any requests for outgoing data from Asia,

24
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.790
however, is priced at 14 cents per gigabyte.

25
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.340
If your customer base is focused in a particular region,

26
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.330
it would make sense to choose which edge locations to use to keep

27
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.890
your costs down. If you want to get a taste of CloudFront, AWS is

28
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.000
currently offering 50 GB of data transfer out and 2 million requests per month for the first year.
