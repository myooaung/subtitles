1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,640
Amazon was not the first or only player in cloud computing.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,330
In fact, there are many, many companies providing robust solutions for the cloud.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,750
It can honestly get a little confusing sometimes trying to understand the

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,110
differences between them to make an informed decision.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,970
In this section, I thought it would be good to talk about some of the more

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,640
popular competitors and the differences between them and AWS.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:23,960
First.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,840
Let's talk about the elephant in the room, Microsoft Azure.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,970
Both companies residing in the Seattle area only makes the

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,140
competition between them that much more fierce.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,330
Azure was started by Microsoft around 2010 as the cloud

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,480
became a major player in computing.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,830
The general model of Azure is kind of the same as AWS.

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,750
Provide a range of computing services with onâ€‘demand

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,340
scalability and flexible pricing.

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,580
Speaking of pricing,

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,790
it can be difficult when comparing pricing between the two services

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,280
since they don't offer the exact same sized offerings.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,030
It does appear that Amazon's pricing is more competitive,

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,490
but that really shouldn't be the main factor when

21
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,480
deciding on a computing platform,

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,140
especially since the pricing is close enough between the two.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,350
So what are the differences between Azure and AWS?

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,330
In the past few years,

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,200
Azure has caught up to AWS in terms of cloud service offerings and global reach.

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,540
Those aren't as much differentiators as they once were.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,750
One of the main differentiators is running Microsoft products,

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,940
such as Windows Server and SQL Server in the cloud.

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,000
A recent announcement from Microsoft,

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,720
removing the option for customers to migrate their licenses

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,170
for these services to competitor clouds,

32
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,630
indicates to me that Microsoft is likely to begin

33
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,410
consolidating their products onto Azure,

34
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,640
making it the easiest and cheapest place to run these products.

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,020
So if you currently use or would need to use Microsoft products in the cloud,

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,140
Azure is probably the best provider to use.

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,980
Beyond that,

38
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,540
I've noticed that working in both of the consoles feels quite different.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,010
Perhaps it's just that I'm extremely familiar with AWS's UI.

40
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,320
But I've found Azure's interface to feel much more

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,640
cluttered as they try to provide a more unified experience

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,240
with all their available services.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,460
Navigating the AWS console does require more clicks because

44
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,330
each service has its own dashboard portal,

45
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,540
but I actually prefer that over Azure's approach.

46
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,530
This is really just a personal preference though,

47
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,740
so try both out and see what you like.

48
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,480
There is a lot more to compare between Azure and AWS,

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
and Pluralsight has a great course comparing the two.

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,240
Definitely check it out if you're torn.

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,830
It's called Understanding the Difference Between Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS.

52
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,800
In Gartner's 2019 Infrastructure as a Service Magic Quadrant report,

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,580
they added Google Cloud, sometimes called Google Cloud Platform,

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,540
to the leader section, joining AWS and Azure.

55
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,320
It's a big win for Google as they continue to grow their market share,

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,820
attempting to take the third place spot from Alibaba Cloud.

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,140
So let's take a closer look at Google Cloud.

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,660
Google unveiled their first cloud offering,

59
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,940
App Engine, in 2008 and released it to the public in 2011.

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,220
Since that time,

61
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,350
they've added more services and consolidated them into

62
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,240
a single cloud platform offering.

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,440
While there does seem to be some specialization in the big data,

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
AI, and Kubernetes spaces,

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,340
it's hard to see the real differentiators between AWS and Google Cloud.

66
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,140
Their data reach and locations seem similar.

67
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,940
The market share of AWS does dwarf Google's at this point,

68
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,030
and I think the Google Cloud web console needs some more time to mature.

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,010
As Google Cloud grows,

70
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,950
it should be interesting to see how they

71
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,740
differentiate themselves from AWS and Azure.

72
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,100
The last service provider we'll look at is a little different than the others,

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,420
but it should be familiar to many developers,

74
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,340
and that is the provider Heroku.

75
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,490
Heroku originally started as a cloud computing platform for Ruby on

76
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,320
Rails applications back in 2007 when Ruby was one of the hottest web

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,810
languages of the day. For many years,

78
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,150
it was exclusively Ruby before expanding and now

79
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,110
supporting just about any major web language.

80
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,940
In addition to languages, it also began to introduce more and more

81
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,040
connected services like database and enterprise solutions.

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,940
Its main value proposition is the simplicity to deploy and scale an application.

83
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,580
I've used Heroku myself, and I can attest it is

84
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,340
really easy and quick to get started.

85
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,920
There's a really slick command line tool that can

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,320
deploy your app in a couple of commands.

87
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,390
I do highly recommend Heroku for new developers getting their

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,430
feet wet with deploying hobby applications. But with simplicity

89
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,240
comes a tradeoff, lack of options.

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,930
Heroku focuses on doing one thing well,

91
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,510
simple and streamlined application hosting. And they

92
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,810
succeed over many of their competitors, even AWS.

93
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,540
Unfortunately, their services don't offer many of Amazon Web Services options,

94
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:21,000
and their global reach, with only eight regions, falls far short from AWS.
