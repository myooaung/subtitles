00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,860
Welcome back to the final module in AWS Developer: The Big Picture.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,230
In the last two modules,

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,240
we've covered 10 different services in AWS that you'll be using regularly.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,220
In this module, we're going to look at how you'll be interacting with,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,640
developing for, and monitoring those services.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,940
We'll start by looking at the web console.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,050
This will likely be your most commonly used interface to AWS.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,010
You can do everything from spinning up new resources to configuring

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,340
and monitoring those resources with the web console.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,640
Next, we'll look at the available software development kits supported by Amazon.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,390
These kits are the main way you'll program your applications to interact

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,870
with services in AWS. And finally, we'll cover the AWS command line tool,

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,360
which can achieve most of the same operations as the web console, but in a

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,390
terminal capacity. Throughout the module,

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,440
I'll be showing you examples of each method.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,220
But since this is still a big picture course,

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,690
we won't get too far into how you'll be using each.

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,000
This module will just give you a good overview that will help you understand how and when to use each method.
