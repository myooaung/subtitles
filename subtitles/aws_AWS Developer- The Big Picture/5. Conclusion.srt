We've reached the end of this module and this course on AWS.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,780
Thanks so much for sticking with me through it.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm really hoping you've learned a lot about AWS and

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,300
are inspired to keep going with it.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,840
Let's recap the AWS access methods that we covered in this module.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,690
We first took a look at the web console. Depending on

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,100
what role you'll be playing with AWS,

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,490
this may be where you spend most of your time.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,510
I seem to learn something new about the console every day

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,100
because there's just so much in there.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,470
Next,

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,240
we looked at the software development kits supported by Amazon. With

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,260
these SDKs, you can do almost anything in AWS with your language of

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,390
choice. Using the code that Amazon provides,

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,740
you can interact with AWS services as if they were in your own application.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,470
And finally,

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,680
we looked at the AWS CLI. Although the syntax can be a bit

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,000
more obtuse than the console or SDKs,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,250
the tool really expands the possibilities of how you can manage and use AWS.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,600
It's a welcome addition to Amazon's robust suite of tools

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,100
for working with AWS. And that's it.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,480
There's so much more to learn with AWS, and Pluralsight has many,

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,400
many more courses available that can help you learn the

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,000
skills you need to work with AWS. Again, my name is Ryan Lewis, and I hope you enjoyed this course.
