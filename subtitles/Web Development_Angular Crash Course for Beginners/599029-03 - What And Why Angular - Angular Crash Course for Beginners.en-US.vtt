00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
In this lecture,
you will learn what

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.700
AngularJS is and why
we should use it.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.020
Angularjs is

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.450
a single-page application
development framework.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.955
Our platform that is built
using HTML and TypeScript.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:18.000
The reason for anglers
popularity comes

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.580
from its architectural
features that it has to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.605
offer using which we can build

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.890
single-page applications
quickly and easily.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.560
The first of those
architectural features

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.825
is the component.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:33.510
Every Angular
application is made up

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.230
of at least one component.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.885
A component is a
combination of data

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:41.855
and logic and associated

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:43.820
HTML template that renders

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.960
that data using the logic
onto the web browser.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.750
Every application will have
a root component followed by

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.400
several other
components to render

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.835
the different parts of our
application onto the browser.

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:01.490
This HTML template then can

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.105
use to other cool features
Angler has to offer,

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:09.230
namely the angular
directives and data binding,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.535
which are very important

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.620
for every single
page applications.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.545
Using Angular directives,
we can define

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.040
logic in our HTML page
using data binding,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.930
we can bind that data to
the HTML DOM elements.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.270
And there are two
different types

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.890
of data mining, even binding,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.350
that is button clicks
or when the user places

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.200
is mouse on a text
or input field, etc.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.900
And property binding,
which will bind

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.810
the HTML input properties to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.840
the model in our angular
application component.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.700
Service is a class
that we create.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.855
Usually services are used to
fetch data from the backend.

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:53.660
Angular knows how
to use services.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.715
Whatever services we write.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.905
We can use dependency
injection to

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:00.440
inject that service
into a component.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.780
And then the component can
use the service to fetch

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.615
the data and render
it onto the UI.

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:07.640
So dependency injection and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.585
services are other cool
features of Angular.

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.030
Last but not the least,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.865
navigating is a key feature of

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:19.970
any web application, especially
single-page applications.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.010
As the user clicks
on a button or

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.245
a link or the
browser's back button,

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:27.965
we need to route him to
the appropriate View.

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:30.185
Angular provides routing module,

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.390
which can be used to easily map

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.710
URL paths to views
instead of pages.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.815
When you look at the
versions of Angular,

00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:43.420
you can get confused
because there are

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.350
so many versions,
456.7 coming soon.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.955
But Angular two is
a major upgrade.

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:53.710
An Angular two is completely

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.350
different from
Angular one dot 0.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.645
Angular one is now legacy.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:04.750
But once you learn Angular
245.6 are just minor upgrades.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.360
Each of them add a small feature

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.405
or a couple of features
to the Angular platform.

00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:13.840
Angular three is not mentioned
here because Angular three

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.190
was released and it had

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.710
performance issues and
it was taken back.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.785
And then Angular for two, etc.

00:03:20.785 --> 00:03:23.300
came out. To summarize,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.490
angular is a super
cool framework to

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.355
develop single-page
applications easily.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:31.730
And the reason for Anglos
popularity is because of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.070
its architectural features
such as components

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.755
which represent the
data and the logic,

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:38.810
as well as HTML template that

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.540
renders that data onto the UI.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.405
Then Angular directives
that can be defined

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:47.180
user to define
logic, data binding,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.650
which will automatically bind

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.320
the events and data in HTML to

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.805
our modal services
dependency injection,

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:58.070
as well as routing to navigate

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.590
from one point in the
application to another.
