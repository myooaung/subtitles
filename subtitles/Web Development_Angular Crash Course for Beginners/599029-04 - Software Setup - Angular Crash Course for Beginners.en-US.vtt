00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
In this lecture, I
will show you how easy

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.665
it is to install AngularJS.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:06.720
To do that, launch
your web browser,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.770
launch a new tab, and search
for Angular Quickstart.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.585
Angular Quickstart.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.765
Click on the second link which
says angular Quickstart.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:20.350
Angular dot slash guide
slash quickstart.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.470
Once you are in there, there

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.895
are detailed instructions here,

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:25.005
but it's very simple.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:30.075
The first thing we need
is to install node.

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:34.885
Right here it says install
Node and npm install that,

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:36.845
open that in a new tab.

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:39.170
You can download
the installer for

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.030
your appropriate
operating system,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.390
Windows, Mac, or you can get
the source code as well.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.490
Once the node is installed,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.290
if you go to your
command line on

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.915
your Windows or terminal on Mac,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:53.690
do npm hyphen v,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.700
n b, m hyphen B or node
hyphen v. You will see

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.190
the version information that

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.720
confirms that node has been

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.640
successfully installed
on your machine.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.364
This npm stands for
Node Package Manager.

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:12.320
It's a command line
utility that we can use to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.385
install various JavaScript
frameworks and node modules.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:20.615
Next step is to install
the Angular CLI.

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.085
That's all we need.

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:28.940
If you do npm install hyphen
g at angular slash CLI.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.755
So grab this command,

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:32.960
based it on your command line.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.430
And if you execute it,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.030
that will install the Angular
command line interface.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.295
And that's the easiest
way we can create

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:42.860
Angular projects
and add components,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.355
services, etc, using
the Angular CLI.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:47.720
So only two steps.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.440
The first step is to
install Node and npm.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.920
That second step, once you
have a note on your machine,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.580
make sure the installation
worked by typing in npm hyphen

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.695
v. Then install Angular
CLI using NPM space,

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:08.525
install hyphen g space
at angular slash CLI.

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:10.490
All those commands
are listed out on

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.445
this angular Quick Start Guide.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:17.689
Npm, which stands for
Node Package Manager,

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.055
was the utility to install
several node modules.

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:25.355
But it is steadily being
replaced with Yan,

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.425
which performs better
and which is where

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:29.990
improved or nor
packaging manager.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.015
So when you work with express

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:33.965
an order later on
in this course,

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:37.775
you will need to install
certain node modules.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:40.850
Installing and is very easy to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.870
Google and search
for an installation.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.410
Click on the very first
link and you'll be taken to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.700
the download page based on

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.740
your operating system
automatically,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.140
the OS will be selected
and you can download

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.750
the appropriate version of Yan.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.630
And you can also do it
from the command line.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.480
If you scroll up, if you
change this to Windows,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.995
you will find the Windows

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:05.690
installer that you can download.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.625
Once download it, install it.

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.560
And once you finish
the installation,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.230
you should be able to
run the command by

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.440
going to the command line
if you say hyphen v,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.360
which would show
that washing off.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.145
And for you.

00:03:19.145 --> 00:03:21.500
Visual Studio Code is

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.750
a free IDE Integrated

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.790
Development Environment
from Microsoft,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.905
which can be used
to develop Angular,

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:29.180
React, TypeScript,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.400
and several other
types of applications.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.620
It makes our life
as $1 per super

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.915
easy by providing
cord existence,

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.270
running our tests,
running on applications,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.570
et cetera, from within
Visual Studio Code.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.190
To install Visual Studio Code.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.215
It's very simple. Launch
your web browser.

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:51.005
Go to Google, search
for Visual Studio Code.

00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:54.140
Download Visual
Studio Code download,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.760
click on the very
first link that says

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.170
download Visual Studio Code
for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.250
Once it opens up, click on
the appropriate version.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.065
If you are on Windows,
click on this.

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:09.110
If you are on Mac, this and
for Linux, the following.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.535
Once you download the installer,

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:11.810
just double-click on it and

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.385
it's a straightforward install.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.905
Once installed, if you
click on this icon,

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:18.350
it will launch Visual
Studio Code and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.990
we're going to use it
throughout this course.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.120
The database that
you are going to use

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.820
throughout this
course is my SQL,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.255
which is a popular open-source
data source database.

00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:32.180
And also it will be
installing MySQL workbench.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.710
When you install MySQL.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.915
Mysql Workbench is a client,

00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:37.595
which is a GUI-based tool,

00:04:37.595 --> 00:04:39.095
which we can launch,

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:43.175
connect to the MySQL and
execute our SQL statements.

00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:45.690
You're going to do it
in three simple steps.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.465
Will download the installer.

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:51.095
It will install the MySQL
as well as MySQL Workbench.

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.644
And you will configure MySQL,

00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:57.755
although it sounds like
a lot of work, it isn't.

00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:59.240
Once you download the installer,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.835
you've just keep clicking
on the Next button.

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.845
And there are a couple of
things you need to do.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.420
You need to choose that you also

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.925
need the workbench when
you are installing.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.730
And when you are in the
configuration step,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.730
you need to make sure that
you enter a password.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.515
It'll prompt you for entering

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:18.395
a root password so that
you can log in later on,

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:20.615
make sure that you give
a simple password,

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.805
which you will remember.

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:24.920
I will also give you.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.400
Link, which has very
good instructions

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.685
on how to install MySQL
search for MySQL,

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:37.250
Install and scroll down.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.500
There are many links, but I

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.150
found one of these very useful,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.685
which says caudally
solutions.com,

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:46.040
how to install MySQL Server

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.490
5.6 on Windows seven
development machine.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.160
This works for different
versions of Windows and Mac.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.590
Click on that link and it

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.025
lists out all the important
steps to download,

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:01.430
install, and to configure.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.550
Again, all these
instructions are nothing

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.125
but clicking on the Next button

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:07.835
only if you have any issues,

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:10.475
you can come back
here and refer to it.

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.140
In the very first step,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.485
you can click on the link
here, Control click it,

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:18.560
and it will go to the
MySQL downloads page,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.475
scroll down, and select

00:06:22.475 --> 00:06:24.020
your operating
system if you are on

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.450
Windows, select
Microsoft Windows.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.220
I don't want you to download

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.095
the ZIP files which are here.

00:06:30.095 --> 00:06:34.190
Click on this goto download
page that will take you to

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.470
the MSI installers and

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.140
download one of these depending
on your operating system.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.120
Once downloaded,
double-click on them

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.255
and just keep clicking
the next button.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:47.420
Once the installation
completes, it will ask you,

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.480
if you want to configure the
MySQL server, click on that.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.550
And that is where
it'll prompt you for

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.435
a root password and make
sure while installing,

00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:58.970
you check the Workbench
option as well so

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.880
that you will have the
workbench installed as well.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.820
And at the end of it,
it will be running

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.565
as a Windows service
automatically for you.

00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:09.335
Every time you were
machine restarts,

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.540
MySQL server will
be up and running.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.735
You can manage that Going
to your Windows Services.

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.075
Same on Mac, on Mac as well.

00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:18.830
It will boot up as soon

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.600
as you are Mac starts
and it will be up

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.830
and running on a port
3306 by default.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.200
Please do not
forget the password

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.810
that you are entering
during installation for me,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.665
I use a password
called test BST,

00:07:33.665 --> 00:07:35.720
so that it'll be
easy to remember.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.060
Hoping that your
MySQL installation

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.605
has completed successfully.

00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:43.325
Use your MySQL up and running
and the MySQL Workbench

00:07:43.325 --> 00:07:48.110
installed on your machine to
connect to the MySQL server.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.350
From MySQL Workbench
launched the MySQL workbench

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.290
by clicking on a
shortcut like this here.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.479
And that will launch
the MySQL Workbench.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.915
You start by creating a new
connection to the database.

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:04.990
Click on this plus button
that will open up a pop-up.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.125
By default, the host name
is my local machine.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:12.085
The default port for
MySQL server is 3306,

00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:16.465
and the username is
root. Give it a name.

00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:18.505
I'm going to call it local.

00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:20.260
That's my connection name.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.120
Click on Test connection.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.580
And it will prompt
you for a password.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.800
This is the password which
you would have entered when

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.885
you configure the MySQL server.

00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:30.370
In my case it is.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.085
Just click, okay.

00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:36.790
And it says successfully
made the MySQL connection.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.100
Okay?

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.720
Okay, again, and it
will be created,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.310
you can now connect
to the database

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.690
by simply double-clicking

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.795
on this will open
up at query window.

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:49.040
Since I have been using it,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.480
I see all this.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.160
But you can always create

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.090
a new query window by
going here, New Query tab.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.590
And let's start by creating
a database called my DB.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.105
To create a database,

00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:06.305
create database my DB.

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:08.255
So this is the name
of the database.

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:12.245
Select, click on the
lightening button here.

00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:15.170
And that will create a
database called my DB,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.800
which we'll be using on
in lectures later on.
