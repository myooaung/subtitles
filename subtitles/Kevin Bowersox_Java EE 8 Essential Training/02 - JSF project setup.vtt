00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Let's get started with JSF

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.005
by building out a new project in Eclipse.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.008
To do that, we can open the new dialog

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.006
by pressing Control + N

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.009
and then typing dynamic,

6
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.007
and then we'll just select dynamic web project.

7
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.003
Go ahead and hit Next,

8
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.007
and this is going to open the next screen in the dialog,

9
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:24.002
which will ask us for our project name.

10
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.000
In this case,

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.009
we're going to name the project hsports-catalog-jsf,

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.008
and then we need to select some additional information.

13
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:38.008
So make sure that we have the Wildfly runtime selected.

14
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.004
We're using dynamic web module 4.0.

15
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.000
And then here in the configuration,

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.005
be sure to select JavaServer Faces v2.3 Project.

17
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.009
That's going to cause Eclipse

18
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:57.004
to configure our application as a JSF project.

19
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:01.009
Next we will proceed in order to specify our source folders.

20
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:06.004
I'm going to go ahead and switch these over to source main Java

21
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:12.005
as well as source main resources.

22
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.001
And we'll hit OK there

23
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.002
and proceed in the dialog,

24
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.002
and then we'll switch our content directory

25
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.000
to source main web app.

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.008
And then we just go ahead and hit Next.

27
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.008
And then here's an important screen.

28
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:30.001
This is asking us for the URL pattern

29
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.006
that we would like to map the Faces servlet to.

30
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.001
So every request matching the pattern

31
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.008
will be routed through the Faces servlet

32
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:42.008
so that it can conduct the JSF life cycle.

33
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.004
Let's go ahead and remove the default pattern

34
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.003
and we'll specify a new pattern.

35
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:52.007
So this pattern's going to be asterisk .xhtml.

36
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:59.001
So any URL that is ending with an xhtml extension

37
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.000
will be routed through our Faces servlet.

38
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So we can go ahead and put that in place

39
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.008
and then hit Finish,

40
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:11.007
and that's going to create our new JSF project.

41
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.000
What I'd like to do from here

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.008
is add a facelet to our project.

43
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.004
You'll remember facelets are the view technology

44
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:22.004
that is used within JSF.

45
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.003
So what we can do within the content directory,

46
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:29.006
open up the New dialog and then type xhtml,

47
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.006
and you'll see that we get some support here

48
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:35.003
from JBoss and its tooling.

49
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:37.005
So let's go ahead and hit Next,

50
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:43.001
and it's going to ask us for the name of our new facelet.

51
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.008
In this case, it's going to be form.xhtml.

52
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.009
We can then go ahead and hit Next.

53
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.003
And then if we would like,

54
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.008
we can use a template.

55
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.003
So we're going to use a template,

56
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:56.006
but you'll see that we're going to modify it.

57
00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:58.004
So right now we're going to use

58
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.009
the blank facelet page template.

59
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.003
So just go ahead and hit Next there.

60
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.000
And then we do not need to include

61
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.008
any of these taglibs for the moment.

62
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:12.005
And here we see our first facelet.

63
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:14.009
Now, the thing that we're going to modify,

64
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.002
you'll notice we're not using HTML5.

65
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:23.001
So I'm going to go ahead and switch up this doctype,

66
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:28.005
and that will cause us to use HTML5

67
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:33.000
instead of using an old doctype.

68
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.003
And once we switch that over,

69
00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:39.003
we need to leverage some different tag libraries.

70
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:45.006
So here you see the UI tag library for facelets.

71
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:48.005
We're going to switch that out

72
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:51.001
and just highlight that value

73
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.007
and hit Control + Space,

74
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:56.003
and you're going to see the new URIs

75
00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:59.002
for these different tag libraries.

76
00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:04.008
So make sure you switch them over to the jcp.org URL,

77
00:04:04.008 --> 00:04:06.009
because that's what it's been updated to.

78
00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.008
Sun hasn't been around for a while.

79
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.008
And then we'll just go ahead and switch the core over,

80
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:18.009
and then finally, we'll switch out the HTML tag library.

81
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.002
Okay, so at this point we have our first facelets page.

82
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:27.008
We'll work with this to build out our JSF application

83
00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:30.000
in the upcoming lessons.
