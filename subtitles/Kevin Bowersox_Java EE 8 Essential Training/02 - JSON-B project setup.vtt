00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:04.006
we're going to configure our JAX-RS project

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:09.000
and our EJB project to use JSONB.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.001
In order to do that,

5
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:14.005
we're going to have to include the JSONB API.

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.002
So we can easily include dependencies

7
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.006
within our projects using Maven.

8
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.009
To enable Maven on your project,

9
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.006
just right click on it,

10
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.003
go to Configure and then Convert to Maven Project.

11
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:33.001
This is going to add a pom.xml file to the project

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.004
and if you click on the Dependencies tab,

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.006
Maven allows us to easily manage the dependencies

14
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:43.006
or different libraries that our application needs to use

15
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:49.000
and we just need to enter a group ID of javax.json.bind

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.002
and then for the artifact ID,

17
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:56.009
we want to specify javax.json.bind-api

18
00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:01.000
and then we're going to be using version 1.0

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.004
of the API, so let's go ahead and add that.

20
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.005
And then you're going to do the same thing

21
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.009
for the EJB project.

22
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.008
So I'll just add the Maven configuration.

23
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, if it pops up this screen,

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.006
just click on Deselect All

25
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.008
and then hit Finish.

26
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:25.000
And then we'll see the pom within our EJB project.

27
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.001
We can open that up

28
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:40.006
and we'll go ahead and just add in the API for JSONB.

29
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.006
Okay, so we'll go ahead, hit OK.

30
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.006
We can then save our poms.

31
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.000
Now we have the API included within our projects

32
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.001
and let's talk a little bit about what we're going

33
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.009
to be doing within this chapter.

34
00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.000
I've added an OrderEndpoint to our JAX-RS project

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.002
and you'll notice this OrderEndpoint

36
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.002
now handles an order resource

37
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.000
and it's pretty simple.

38
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.004
If we take a look at that order resource,

39
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.003
you're just going to see an orderId, a storeName,

40
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.003
there's this Customer type we'll get to in a second.

41
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.007
And then there is a list of items.

42
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:22.000
A very simple POJO and the same with the Customer.

43
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.007
We just get the CustomerId, FirstName, LastName

44
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:27.006
and then in order to test out

45
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:31.008
and send JSON to our JAX-RS API,

46
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:33.003
I've included two things.

47
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:36.006
The first is an order.json file

48
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:40.003
and you'll notice this JSON object corresponds

49
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.005
with the Java POJO we just looked at

50
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.000
so we're going to be able to serialize and deserialize

51
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.004
between these and then the other thing I've included

52
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:50.006
is a PowerShell command

53
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:53.006
and this PowerShell is basically going

54
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.001
to send an HTTP request

55
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.000
to the order endpoint or the order resource

56
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.003
on our JAX-RS API.

57
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:04.000
And it's going to be a POST

58
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.001
and then it's going to send that JSON we have

59
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.005
in the order.json file.

60
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:13.001
So I just wanted to walk you through that so you understand

61
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.001
what's going on when we test.

62
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.002
The order.json file

63
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:21.007
and the PowerShell command are included

64
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.007
within the source main resources directory

65
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:28.000
of the JAX-RS project

66
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.009
and you'll see within the LinkedIn package

67
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.009
in our projects,

68
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.009
I've included the inventory item,

69
00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.001
the order and the customer

70
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:43.002
and I did the same thing over in the EJB project

71
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:46.003
so that we have those objects available as well.

72
00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:48.008
Okay, so our project's all set up.

73
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:51.003
We got an understanding of what we're going to be looking at.

74
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:54.000
Let's proceed into the lessons with JSONB.
