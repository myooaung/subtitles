00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] In this lesson, we'll take a look

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:06.005
at how navigation occurs within a JSF application.

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.000
First we're going to set our headers to be links

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.004
so that we can navigate between the form

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:18.003
and the catalog, so within the HTML tag library,

6
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:24.001
you'll find a link tag and that's basically going to create

7
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.001
an anchor tag in the HTML so that we can navigate

8
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:33.004
between the pages, and we can set the value to our property

9
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.008
pulled from the resource bundle that we created

10
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.002
and then we need to provide an outcome

11
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:44.002
and the outcome is simply the name of the page

12
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.007
we would like to navigate to, so in this case we want

13
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.006
to navigate to the form and we can go ahead

14
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:56.000
and close out that tag and then we're going to copy it

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.006
because we're going to create another link

16
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:06.006
for our catalog so just organize that HTML a little bit

17
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:11.007
and then we'll reference the list property

18
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:16.000
and then we'll just change the outcome over to list

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.004
I'm then going to copy this page header,

20
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:23.001
because we can place it over on the list page as well

21
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.004
so that we have the same navigation,

22
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.007
and let's also just put a pipe in there to add

23
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.006
a little bit of style.

24
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.006
Okay so there we'll be able to navigate

25
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:40.000
between those two pages, let's look at another way

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.003
that we can navigate within JSF.

27
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:47.001
So what if we need to path some data when we navigate?

28
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.001
We're going to take a look here in the list,

29
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.002
you'll notice I've started a column for us

30
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:54.005
and we're going to add another link,

31
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:58.009
and for the value of this link it's going to be remove.

32
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.007
Because we're creating a link that's going to allow us

33
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:05.008
to remove an item from the catalog

34
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:10.004
and the outcome is going to point to a confirm facelet

35
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.008
that we've created.

36
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.007
So if you take a look within the project

37
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.008
you'll see a confirmation page

38
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.005
and it's basically going to ask an end user

39
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.001
if they're sure they would like to delete the item.

40
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.004
Now we need to know what item they're attempting

41
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.009
to delete, that information is important

42
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.006
for the confirmation page.

43
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.002
So what we can do within the body of the link

44
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:38.008
we can pass a parameter using the facelets tag library.

45
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.004
You'll find a parameter tag

46
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:45.005
and we just set the name of that parameter

47
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:51.005
and then we can bind this to our backing bean

48
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:55.009
and in this case it's going to be the item ID

49
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.006
of the item that we'd like to remove.

50
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:03.009
So we have our link set up and now once that parameter

51
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:08.009
is passed, we need to do something on the confirmation page

52
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.004
in order to grab that parameter

53
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:16.000
and select the appropriate item.

54
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.001
So within the confirmation page we're going to use

55
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.003
another tag and that's the metadata tag

56
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:27.004
and this allows us to extract information from the request

57
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:29.002
and do something with it.

58
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.005
So the first thing we're going to do is add,

59
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:35.002
a view param tag and here's where we specify

60
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:40.000
that we'd like to get the item ID that was passed over

61
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.006
from the confirmation page and then we're going to bind that

62
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:49.003
to a field on our backing bean.

63
00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:53.002
So you'll notice that the catalog item delete bean

64
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:57.002
has been created and if we take a look

65
00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:00.000
you'll see that there's an item ID field

66
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.003
on that bean that is along.

67
00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:06.002
So right here is that bean that's been prepositioned,

68
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:08.006
that way we can quickly work through this lesson.

69
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:10.008
We've already covered backing beans.

70
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:13.009
You'll notice that we have this fetch item method

71
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.004
and that's basically going into our collection

72
00:04:17.004 --> 00:04:22.007
of items found within the catalog item form bean

73
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:27.005
and selecting the item with the corresponding item ID

74
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:30.006
so we need to invoke that when we come into

75
00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:32.006
this confirmation page.

76
00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:35.009
So to do that we use another tag,

77
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.009
and that's the key event tag.

78
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.003
So let's add that on to our confirmation page

79
00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:45.000
and we specified the type of event

80
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.006
and this is going to be a pre-render view event

81
00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:53.008
and this event will be invoked before we display

82
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:56.006
the view so if we need to do that sort of logic

83
00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:58.008
where we grab the item from the collection,

84
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:01.001
it's the perfect place to do it.

85
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.001
And then what we do is we assign a listener

86
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:09.009
and we're able to bind to a method on our backing bean

87
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.006
that will be invoked when this event occurs.

88
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:17.008
So there is the fetch item method

89
00:05:17.008 --> 00:05:22.006
that we just took a look at and now we have that in place.

90
00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:25.007
Now if we look at our confirmation page,

91
00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:28.008
you'll see that we display the details of the item.

92
00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:32.005
That item is going to be assigned to this item field

93
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:37.007
on our backing bean and the fetch item method

94
00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:42.002
is going to cause that item field to be populated

95
00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:44.002
and then if we look further down you'll see

96
00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:47.009
the remove item method and we can take a quick look at that.

97
00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.005
It's simply going to remove the item from the collection

98
00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:53.009
and then navigate us back to the list.

99
00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.008
So with this in place let's go ahead

100
00:05:56.008 --> 00:06:01.000
and we can run our application, I'll just right click,

101
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.002
run as run on server, see it start up here.

102
00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:08.009
I'll just start opening a browser.

103
00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.009
We can then go to our form, so let's go ahead

104
00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:18.002
we can add the gloves in and we can say super gloves

105
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:22.009
are the manufacturer, we'll add in our date

106
00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.004
and then we'll just add a quick description.

107
00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:30.007
We can place that into the list, let's go back now.

108
00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:32.009
We'll navigate to the form

109
00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.004
and now we're going to put in mittens

110
00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:44.001
and we'll just say super mittens.

111
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.008
You'll notice that gets added to the list

112
00:06:46.008 --> 00:06:48.009
and then I'll click on super gloves.

113
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:52.002
You'll notice it populates the item which is bound

114
00:06:52.002 --> 00:06:56.001
to our confirmation page and then we can go ahead

115
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.002
say we do want to remove it, and there go the gloves.

116
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:03.003
So we saw several ways we can navigate as well as pass data

117
00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:04.007
during that navigation.

118
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.004
It's going to be critical that you understand this

119
00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:09.000
when building out JSF applications.
