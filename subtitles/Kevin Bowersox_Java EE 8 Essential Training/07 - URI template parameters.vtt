00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Narrator] In this lesson, we're going to take a look

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:07.007
at how to use URI template parameters within JAX-RS.

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.006
We're going to add them to a resource method

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.005
and also see how to call them with the client.

5
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.006
So, the first thing we're going to do is

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:22.005
navigate to our find by catalog ID resource method

7
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:26.008
and you'll notice right now we are using a Query Param.

8
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.004
We're going to switch that up

9
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.003
and use a URI template parameter.

10
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:37.002
Now, to do that we modify the path to include a parameter

11
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.005
in curly braces and we're going to name

12
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:44.007
this parameter Catalog Item ID.

13
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.008
At this point, we can go ahead and switch out

14
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:51.008
our query parameter with a path parameter

15
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.003
and this is very typical within REST APIs

16
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.002
that you may build or use,

17
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.004
so just kind of switch in the semantics.

18
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.006
And then we can navigate to the remote inventory service,

19
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:08.002
because we'll need to adjust the code

20
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:12.008
that is causing our client to call the REST API.

21
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:17.005
So, now instead of using the query pram method,

22
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:22.001
we're going to switch that to resolve template

23
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:27.001
and that will cause the template URI parameter

24
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:33.002
to receive the value of the catalog item ID field.

25
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:35.002
The other thing that we need to do

26
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.009
is we need to modify the path.

27
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.007
So, we need to actually add the template parameter

28
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:42.007
into the paths.

29
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:46.000
So, we're going to extend the path some

30
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.008
and let me drop that down to another line

31
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.009
and then here we're going to put our template parameter,

32
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.000
which is the catalog item ID.

33
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.007
Okay, so now our JAX-RS client is set up to call

34
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:06.009
the new API endpoint that we established

35
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.008
on our resource method, which uses

36
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:11.008
the URI template parameter.

37
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.001
Okay, let's go ahead.

38
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:16.005
We'll run our application.

39
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.003
There we see it's starting up

40
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:24.007
and then we'll navigate to the form.

41
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:31.000
And once again we can make an item.

42
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.009
There we see the item was created.

43
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.000
There's our 201.

44
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.007
And now we can see we get a quantity.

45
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.000
So, just a little bit different semantics.

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.001
You will need to use those template parameters quite a bit

47
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:49.000
if you're calling REST APIs with the JAX-RS client.
