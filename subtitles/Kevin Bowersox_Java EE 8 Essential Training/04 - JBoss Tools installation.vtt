00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Instructor] Throughout the course,

2
00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:04.004
we'll be using Eclipse as our IDE.

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.000
Before you move forward, you will

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.005
need to install Eclipse and a JDK.

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:14.001
I'm using Eclipse Version 4.13 and JDK 11.

6
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.002
I'd highly recommend matching

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.001
these versions for best results in the course.

8
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.004
With the JDK installed and Eclipse up

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.007
and running, we're going to go ahead

10
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.009
and add some tooling into the IDE.

11
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.003
JBoss provides some additional tools

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.004
for Eclipse that helps developers

13
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.006
build Java applications with WildFly.

14
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's go ahead and install these tools.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.009
So to do so, click on Help,

16
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.001
and then go to the Eclipse Marketplace.

17
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.007
And within the Eclipse Marketplace,

18
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.004
we're simply going to search for JBoss

19
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.001
and that will pull up the tooling

20
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.000
and there they are.

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.007
So you see the JBoss Tools 4.12.0.final version

22
00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.003
and we're going to go ahead

23
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.005
and install these tools.

24
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.004
So just hit Install.

25
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.009
And it's going to load all of the packages

26
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.009
and then from there, we're just

27
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.000
going to go ahead

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.001
and confirm that we would like to install.

29
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.001
Next, we'll need to go ahead

30
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.001
and accept the licenses for these technologies

31
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.003
and then just hit Finish.

32
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:23.001
At that point, the tools will begin to download

33
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.001
and install within Eclipse.

34
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.005
You may be prompted that the tools

35
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.007
contain unsigned content, just go ahead

36
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.006
and click on Install anyway

37
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.000
to continue the installation

38
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and then once they have installed,

39
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.004
you'll be prompted to restart Eclipse.

40
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.005
When Eclipse restarts, you'll notice

41
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.004
that you're asked to provide information

42
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.007
about the JBoss tools, you can go ahead

43
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.002
and make your selection.

44
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.006
But it is an indicator that we have

45
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.009
installed the tools successfully

46
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.009
and you'll also see that the IDE

47
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.005
will open up to the Red Hat page.

48
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.005
So we've successfully installed

49
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.003
the JBoss tooling for Eclipse

50
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:12.000
and we can leverage that throughout our lessons.
