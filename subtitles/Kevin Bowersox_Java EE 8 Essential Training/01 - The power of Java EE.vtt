00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Kevin] Java EE is an essential toolbox

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.004
for Java developers that provides a standard approach

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.006
for developing web-based systems

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:12.001
that require API enablement, data persistence,

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.008
messaging, and the basic application concerns.

6
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.000
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.002
I've been a full-stack Java developer for over 10 years.

8
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.004
I can show you how to deliver systems

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.002
with Java Enterprise Edition

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.003
that meet the demanding expectations of modern enterprises.

11
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.004
In this course, I'll guide you through hands-on lessons

12
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:36.007
that teach you 15 of the most relevant Java EE technologies

13
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.000
and the concepts behind them.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.005
We'll go in-depth into the Java EE Web Profile

15
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:46.001
and other APIs like JMS, Bean Validation,

16
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.008
JSON parsing, and JSON binding.

17
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:52.000
After taking this course, you will have the skills necessary

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.003
to build or maintain the most complex Java EE systems.

19
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.007
So join me on my LinkedIn Learning Course

20
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:04.000
to build enterprise quality systems with Java EE.
