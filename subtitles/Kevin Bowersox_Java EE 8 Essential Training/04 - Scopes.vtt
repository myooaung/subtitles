00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] When using CDI,

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.005
it is important to understand the concept of scopes.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.002
Scopes allows us to associate a bean

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.000
with a context which determines the visibility

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.002
of the bean and helps manage its lifecycle.

6
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.009
The default scope for a bean is dependent.

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.002
Since we have not provided a scope

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.009
for our LocalInventoryService bean,

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.004
it is dependent scope

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:27.001
and will assume the scope of the bean it is injected into.

11
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.007
So if we take a look at our CatalogItemFormbean

12
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.009
where we are injecting our inventoryService,

13
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.003
you'll notice that it is SessionScoped

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.007
and that will cause our inventoryService

15
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.008
to be SessionScoped as well.

16
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:42.008
Now, we can see this in action

17
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.007
if we open the application in two browsers.

18
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.001
So let me just expand our console

19
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.008
and then we're going to go ahead

20
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:56.001
and enter a product into our application running

21
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.007
in Internet Explorer.

22
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.006
So we'll use Gloves

23
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:05.000
and we'll say it's produced by SuperGloves

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.002
and then provide a date

25
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:11.002
and then just a description

26
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.004
and you'll see

27
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.008
that our Local inventory contains gloves.

28
00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:20.009
Now, we're going to hop over to Chrome

29
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.006
and we're going to run another test,

30
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.004
this time we'll use mittens.

31
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:29.005
So SuperMittens and we'll say Test2.

32
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:33.003
And now when we see the output

33
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.005
from our LocalInventoryService bean,

34
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.006
you'll notice that it contains mittens.

35
00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:42.001
And if we were to add another item,

36
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.006
let's say that we want to go with soccer ball

37
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.005
and it's made by Sports Balls.

38
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.000
And we'll just keep those fields the same.

39
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.001
There you can see that once again,

40
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.002
it goes into that local inventory service

41
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:01.002
that is scoped to the session associated

42
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.000
with the browser.

43
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.002
So that explains session scope within CDI.

44
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.006
There's also RequestScope.

45
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:13.005
So we can change our LocalInventoryService

46
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.000
over to RequestScoped.

47
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.005
It doesn't make a lot of sense

48
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.002
but it'll just be good to see it in action

49
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:24.002
and it will help you better understand the scopes.

50
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:28.004
So here we're switching to RequestScoped

51
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:33.003
and you want to use the javax.entreprise.context package.

52
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.000
And with that in place,

53
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.009
I'm just going to go ahead

54
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:41.004
and here I can republish our application.

55
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:45.002
And we can run that test again

56
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:48.004
once the application loads.

57
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:49.009
So I'll clear a console

58
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.009
and what you'll notice this time

59
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:56.000
is that we won't maintain any state.

60
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.001
So for example, I'm going to go ahead and our gloves back in.

61
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:03.007
Okay.

62
00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:06.002
So we have the gloves

63
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:12.007
and now let's go back and we're going to enter the mittens

64
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:17.007
and we can say they're from SuperMittens

65
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:19.006
and this time you'll notice

66
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:21.001
that we lost the gloves

67
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.004
and that's because the bean

68
00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:25.000
is scoped to the request.

69
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.004
So it's not going to maintain any state over the session

70
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:32.006
for the browser.

71
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:38.003
And that's because of the lifecycle and its scope.

72
00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:41.002
Now, we can take a look at the final scope

73
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:43.009
which is ApplicationScoped.

74
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.006
So we'll go ahead,

75
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:49.008
go back and modify our LocalInventoryService bean.

76
00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:53.007
We can switch it over to ApplicationScoped.

77
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:55.007
We'll import that annotation

78
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:59.000
and this is basically going to cause a single instance

79
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.009
of this bean to be used throughout our application.

80
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:10.008
So once again, I'll go and I'll publish our application.

81
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:14.001
And then looks like it's deployed

82
00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:17.002
and we'll go, click on our form.

83
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.007
Now here we are in Chrome.

84
00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:25.003
So let's go ahead, we'll add the gloves.

85
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:27.007
K, there we can see we've got the gloves

86
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:31.003
and now if we navigate back to Internet Explorer,

87
00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.004
we can go back to our form

88
00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:39.009
and this time, we're going to add in mittens.

89
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.009
And then we're going to set our date.

90
00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.000
And here you'll notice

91
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.006
that because our LocalInventoryService is ApplicationScoped,

92
00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:53.006
that state or that instance

93
00:04:53.006 --> 00:04:57.000
of the bean is persistent across both browsers.

94
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.002
It's no longer tied to the session.

95
00:04:59.002 --> 00:05:01.004
So that's a look at scopes

96
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:06.008
within CDI and we can use them to control the lifecycle

97
00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:09.000
of our beans.
