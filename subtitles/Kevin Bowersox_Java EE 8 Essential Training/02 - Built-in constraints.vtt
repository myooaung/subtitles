00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.002
- [Instructor] Java EE support for bean validation

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.002
makes it simple to validate the data populated

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.003
within the fields of our beans.

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.006
Within the API, there is support

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.007
for several built-in constraints

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:16.009
that can be applied to bean fields using annotations.

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.004
Let's take a look at those in action.

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.001
So within our CatalogItem bean,

9
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.006
we're going to go ahead

10
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:31.003
and apply a built-in constraint to the ItemManager's field.

11
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:35.002
The constraint we're adding is the Size annotation

12
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.004
and this is going to allow us to specify a minimum number

13
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.007
of items within our collection

14
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.007
and a maximum number of items.

15
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.001
So here we're allowing anywhere from zero

16
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:52.001
to three items within the ItemManager collection.

17
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.007
And then we're going to move on to the name field

18
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:56.001
and within the name field,

19
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:01.000
we're going to annotate that with the NotBlank annotation

20
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.007
and this is a combination of several annotations.

21
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:07.004
First, it's going to check that the field is not null.

22
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.004
Then it's going to check that the field

23
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:12.007
has a length to it.

24
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.003
So it's not just an empty string.

25
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:16.007
And then it's also really nice,

26
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.006
it's going to make sure it's not just white space.

27
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:24.006
So it's a very powerful annotation for strings.

28
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.003
And then moving on, we're going to leverage

29
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:31.002
the Pattern annotation of the manufacturer.

30
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.000
So here we can go ahead

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.001
and specify a regular expression.

32
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.006
And the regular expression just goes within a string.

33
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.001
And we're going to enter an expression

34
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:48.009
that basically constrains this to alpha characters

35
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.009
so we can allow those

36
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.002
and nothing else.

37
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:59.008
And then we can also specify the message element here

38
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.009
so we can just it must be letters

39
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.006
and we can give the user some information.

40
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.005
And then I'm just going to go ahead

41
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.003
and copy this and we're going

42
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.007
to apply the Pattern annotation

43
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:13.002
on our Description.

44
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.003
We're going to go ahead and change this up a little bit.

45
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:20.004
We'll just modify our regex to only allow between five

46
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:25.004
and 10 characters.

47
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:26.007
Okay and then you'll notice

48
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:28.008
that we have a date field.

49
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:30.007
So our availableDate

50
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:34.005
and what we're going to do here add the Future annotation.

51
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:38.002
This is one of the new annotations within Java EE 8

52
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:39.007
and if you've ever had to check

53
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:42.001
to make sure date is past or present,

54
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.004
this is extremely convenient.

55
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.008
Next, we're going to flip over to our ItemManager

56
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:50.003
and you'll notice that I've added a field

57
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.006
on the ItemManager.

58
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:54.000
This is the email field

59
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.009
and that's also now on our form.

60
00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.006
And all we need to do in order to check an email

61
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.002
is add the Email annotation.

62
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:05.005
And if you've ever validated an email,

63
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.005
you know that can be complex as well.

64
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.002
Traditionally, you're using a regex

65
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:10.009
and then there's different variants.

66
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.008
Well, Java EE and its bean validation API

67
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.000
make it extremely simple.

68
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.002
Just add the Email annotation.

69
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.004
Okay, so let's go ahead and save that

70
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:23.000
and then I just want to quickly show you what we've done

71
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.002
in our form.

72
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:27.005
You'll remember that we used this message tag

73
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:31.005
within the HTML tag library for JSF.

74
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:34.003
I've just applied that to each one of our fields.

75
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:38.004
That way we can see the messages that will get returned

76
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:41.006
from our different built-in constraints

77
00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:43.009
in the validation API.

78
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.000
Okay, so with that in place,

79
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.001
let's quickly check our server.

80
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:51.003
I'm going to go ahead and remove the existing project

81
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:59.004
and then we can run our ear on the server.

82
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:01.006
So there we see our server starting up.

83
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.005
I'm going to open a browser

84
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:06.007
so that we can test this out.

85
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.005
Okay, so here's our form

86
00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:11.000
and I'm just going to go ahead and try to summit

87
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.008
and you'll immediately notice

88
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:16.001
that we received some validation messages

89
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:19.003
because we did not meet the criteria.

90
00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:21.006
So let's go ahead now

91
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:28.000
and we're going to add in some data.

92
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.009
And we can just test our validators.

93
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.002
I'm going to flip this back to 2018.

94
00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:36.008
And you'll notice that we satisfied

95
00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.008
the Product Name validation.

96
00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:42.008
But we have not satisfied some of the others.

97
00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:44.009
So you'll notice, we were including a space

98
00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.005
in the Manufacturer name which wasn't allowed

99
00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:49.009
and then here our date was in the past,

100
00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.007
so let's go ahead and make sure

101
00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:54.007
we are in the future.

102
00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:58.001
And then from here, you'll notice the description needed

103
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.003
to be letters.

104
00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:03.003
So let's go ahead now and we can submit.

105
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:05.006
Okay, so our validation worked

106
00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:09.005
and then we're going to go to the Item page

107
00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:11.008
and we added some validation here

108
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:14.005
in order to validate that email.

109
00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:17.000
So I'm just going to enter something

110
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.007
that is not an email.

111
00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:22.002
And you'll see that we get warned

112
00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:23.006
that we need a valid email.

113
00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:25.006
So let's go ahead

114
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:28.009
and add something that looks more like an email address

115
00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.004
and then we're going to go ahead,

116
00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:32.004
add item managers.

117
00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:36.007
And we can see the validation was applied.

118
00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:39.006
All right, so that sums up our lesson

119
00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:42.003
on the built-in validators

120
00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:45.000
that are provided within Java EE.
