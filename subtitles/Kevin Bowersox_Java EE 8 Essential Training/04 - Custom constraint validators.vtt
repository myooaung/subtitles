00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Narrator] When building an application

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.009
you may come across a scenario

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.007
where the validation logic is too complex

4
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.009
for the built in constraints

5
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.002
in the validation API.

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.002
In that case,

7
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.003
there is a mechanism we can use

8
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.002
within the bean validation API

9
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.004
to handle these situations.

10
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.009
We're able to build a custom constraint validator

11
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.006
that can handle more advanced logic.

12
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.001
So let's get started building

13
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.006
our own custom constraint validator

14
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.003
and what we're going to do is build a validator

15
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.001
that is able to restrict the manufacturers

16
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.009
to a specific list that we may have.

17
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.001
So nothing out of the box

18
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.003
is going to do that for us.

19
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:43.007
And to get started with that

20
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:46.000
we need an annotation

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.003
that we're going to apply to our manufacturer field

22
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:50.008
and it's going to be very similar

23
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.006
to our alphabetic annotation that we created

24
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.004
for the other custom validator.

25
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.007
So I'm just going to copy that

26
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.000
and we can rename it to the

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.004
permitted manufacturer

28
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.005
annotation

29
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.007
and this annotation,

30
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:07.009
if we take a look,

31
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.008
you know it's going to have all the details

32
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:12.005
of our alphabetic annotation.

33
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.009
So let's go ahead

34
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.007
and we can adjust some of these.

35
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.001
So we'll need to remove that pattern

36
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.009
and then we'll want to create

37
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.001
a new validation message that's returned.

38
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.004
So let's just say it's going to return

39
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.005
the invalid manufacturer property

40
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.005
and we can actually go over

41
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.001
to our properties file

42
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.009
and just enter that right now.

43
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.007
So we can say must be permitted.

44
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.007
Okay, we'll save that.

45
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.002
And then, the other thing we need to specify,

46
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.005
we actually don't have it yet,

47
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.001
and that is the constraint validator.

48
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.003
So the constraint annotation expects us

49
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:53.009
to provide a class

50
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.001
that implements the constraint validator interface.

51
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.004
So let's go build that

52
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.009
and we're just going to create a new class

53
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.008
within our com.linkedin package

54
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.001
and we're going to name this class

55
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.009
the permitted manufacturer

56
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.002
constraint validator.

57
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.009
And we need this class to

58
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.005
implement the constraint validator interface

59
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:25.007
that you see selected there.

60
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:26.009
So let's go ahead,

61
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:27.009
we'll select that

62
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.002
and then build our class.

63
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:31.007
And you'll notice there are

64
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:35.001
two type annotations on that interface

65
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:36.006
that we need to provide.

66
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:40.008
The first is the annotation that is going to

67
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.002
indicate that we would like

68
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:45.006
to use this constraint validator

69
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:51.003
and that will be the permitted manufacturer annotation.

70
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:54.001
And then the second generic type argument

71
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.006
is just the type of the value

72
00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:59.005
we're going to be validating.

73
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.008
Once we provide those we can go ahead,

74
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:04.001
add the unimplemented methods,

75
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.009
and here you see the single method

76
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.001
that we'll need to implement.

77
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.003
IsValid simply returns a boolean true or false

78
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:14.006
and then these type arguments

79
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:16.003
are not very well named.

80
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:18.008
The first will be the value

81
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:20.007
that we're going to be validating

82
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:23.007
and the second is the context.

83
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:25.009
So we're able to get some information

84
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.007
about the actual validation scenario.

85
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.004
And then, what we're going to do

86
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:34.004
within this constraint validator,

87
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:37.008
we're going to have an array of strings

88
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:44.000
that are going to represent our permitted manufacturers.

89
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.007
So we'll just create that

90
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:48.008
and only two companies are going to be allowed

91
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:52.003
to supply our products in our catalog.

92
00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:56.004
That's Company A and Company B.

93
00:03:56.004 --> 00:04:00.001
And then what we'll do within our isValid method,

94
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.001
we're going to provide some validation logic.

95
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:05.009
We can turn our array

96
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:07.003
into a list

97
00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:10.003
and then simply use the contains method

98
00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:14.004
and see that it contains the value we're validating.

99
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay, with that in place,

100
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.002
we need to head back over to our annotation

101
00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:22.009
because we now have the constraint validator

102
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:27.005
that we can specify within the constraint annotation.

103
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:30.000
Okay, let's go ahead and save that.

104
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.009
And then the final thing we need to do,

105
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.005
we don't want to forget to add our annotation

106
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.004
to the manufacturer's field.

107
00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:40.004
So we can specify that it needs

108
00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:43.004
to be a permitted manufacturer

109
00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:44.009
and with that in place,

110
00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.000
we'll go ahead

111
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.005
and we can run our application.

112
00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:50.007
There we see the server starting up,

113
00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:52.005
got the console.

114
00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:55.009
Let's navigate to the page

115
00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.005
and then here we're going to

116
00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:00.003
select the gloves.

117
00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:02.009
Let's say we're trying to source these from Company C,

118
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.005
which isn't permitted,

119
00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:06.000
and

120
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.004
we'll enter a valid date

121
00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:10.007
and a valid description.

122
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:14.007
So there you can see that Company C is restricted

123
00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:17.003
and let's specify a company that

124
00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:19.006
we do have a valid agreement with,

125
00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:21.002
Company A.

126
00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:22.006
And once we do that

127
00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:27.009
we are able to enter our new gloves into our inventory

128
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.000
for the H Sports Company.

129
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.009
So that was a look

130
00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.000
at how we can build a constraint validator

131
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.003
that can contain more advanced logic

132
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:37.007
if we get into a situation

133
00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:40.000
where an application requires it.
