1
00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.004
- So let's continue our work in our JSF project.

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.006
In order to bind data elements

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.003
from our facelet,

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.004
we need to create a backing bean.

5
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.000
So, we're going to navigate

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.001
to the source,

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.009
main Java directory,

8
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.009
and we'll just create a new class.

9
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.006
This is going to be a Java POJO.

10
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.007
And we're going to name that class

11
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.002
the "CatalogItemFormBean",

12
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.002
and we'll place that class

13
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:32.008
within the com.linkedin.jsf package.

14
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:34.008
We can then go ahead and hit finish,

15
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.001
and here's our new backing bean.

16
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.002
Now, it's really simple to create a backing bean.

17
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:44.001
All you need to do is create some fields

18
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.000
that you'd like to bind data to;

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.009
in our case,

20
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.009
we're defining some of the fields

21
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.004
on our catalog item,

22
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:55.003
such as the name and the manufacturer,

23
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.001
and we'll through the SKU in there as well,

24
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.000
and then you just create accessors

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.002
in order to support those fields.

26
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.000
Those will be used by the JSF bindings.

27
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.003
And there we have it.

28
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.002
It's our first backing bean.

29
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.008
Now, we also need to annotate this class

30
00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:23.006
in order for JSF to create the bean,

31
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:24.006
and to do that,

32
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.006
we add an annotation.

33
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.002
So, this is a scope.

34
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:31.004
It's basically going to say that this bean exists

35
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.006
for the life of the request.

36
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.007
We can talk a little bit more about that later.

37
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:38.006
And then we're going to say that this bean

38
00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:39.009
has a name,

39
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.003
and that allows us to reference it

40
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:44.008
within the expression language.

41
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:48.003
So, there we have those annotations applied,

42
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.006
and at this point we can head over

43
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:55.001
to our form.xhtml file,

44
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.007
and we can start binding to that backing bean.

45
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.000
So the first thing I'll do

46
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.008
is remove the template;

47
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.007
We'll get to that a little bit later.

48
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.003
And then we're going to add some mark-up

49
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.007
into this page,

50
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:12.003
and it's really important that we're using

51
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:17.004
the html tag library within JSF,

52
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.006
as opposed to just raw html elements.

53
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.007
So, you'll see many counterparts between the two,

54
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:27.007
so right there's the JSF counterpart

55
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:29.001
for a form,

56
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:33.001
and then we can just provide a regular old DIV

57
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.003
because we're not going to bind to that.

58
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:38.002
And then we'll use an output label.

59
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.005
So this is basically a field label

60
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.008
that we'll name "Product Name",

61
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:47.008
and then we're going to create an input text,

62
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:50.003
and the input text is going to have

63
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.004
our first binding.

64
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.008
Now, when we bind with JSF,

65
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.007
we use a pound sign,

66
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:58.005
and then the curly braces.

67
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:01.001
And you'll notice that we do get IntelliSense

68
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.000
within that expression,

69
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.009
so we can take a look at our catalog form bean,

70
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:12.008
and then select the name field on that bean.

71
00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.006
And then the final thing we'll do,

72
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.001
we're going to add a command button

73
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:18.007
to the form,

74
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:19.005
and for now,

75
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.004
we're just going to have it navigate

76
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:24.006
to a facelet named "List".

77
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.005
So, that will be the next view

78
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.006
that we're going to create,

79
00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:32.000
and we'll just give that button a value

80
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.009
of "Submit".

81
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.004
So, let's go ahead and create that list page.

82
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:41.004
So, I'm just going to copy our form.xhtml file,

83
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:43.001
and then we'll paste it within

84
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.008
the web app directory,

85
00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:48.007
change this over to "List.xhtml",

86
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:53.001
and then navigate into that file.

87
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:54.008
You'll see we have some markup

88
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:57.002
that was used for the form.

89
00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.002
We no longer need that,

90
00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:01.002
and what we'll do within this facelet

91
00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:04.001
is just output some of the data

92
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:07.003
that gets bound to our backing bean

93
00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:11.009
by supplying an expression that performs

94
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.004
that binding.

95
00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:14.002
And you'll remember,

96
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:17.002
we were setting the name field,

97
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.005
so we'll just pull that information out,

98
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:23.009
and there we have an output label that's going to

99
00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.000
display the name.

100
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.001
So it's pretty simple.

101
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.009
You know, we have two facelets,

102
00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.003
and they're bound to a common backing bean,

103
00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:34.001
which will have its values updated

104
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:38.000
as JSF processes through its lifecycle.

105
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.008
Okay.

106
00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:39.009
Let's see where our server's at.

107
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.007
It's stopped,

108
00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:43.006
so we need to run this application.

109
00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:45.007
Just right click on the project,

110
00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:47.006
and then "Run As",

111
00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:49.002
"Run On Server",

112
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:51.000
and then, once again, I'm going to select

113
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.008
"Always use this server

114
00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:53.009
when running this project",

115
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.005
so we don't have to select this every time.

116
00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:59.002
We will then see the server start up,

117
00:04:59.002 --> 00:05:02.009
and our JSF application will launch.

118
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.004
There, it launched.

119
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:06.002
Let's just go over to a browser,

120
00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:08.005
and we can take a look.

121
00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:10.001
So, there's our form,

122
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:12.002
and our product name...

123
00:05:12.002 --> 00:05:14.004
Let's go with a jacket this time.

124
00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:16.006
And then when we submit,

125
00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:18.006
you can see the request went back,

126
00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:21.006
the face's servelet applied the data

127
00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:22.008
to the backing bean,

128
00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:24.008
and then rendered the next view,

129
00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:27.007
and there we have our dynamic content

130
00:05:27.007 --> 00:05:29.003
with the jacket.

131
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:33.001
Alright, so, quick look at the basics of JSF.

132
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.000
We'll expand upon this moving forward.
