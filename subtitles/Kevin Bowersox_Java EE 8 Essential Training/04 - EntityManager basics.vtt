00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] In order to persist entities

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:03.008
within our application,

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.009
we'll need to work within EntityManager.

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.003
The EntityManager exposes operations

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.004
that allows us to perform CRUD operations

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.006
against our data store.

7
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.009
We're going to be working with the EntityManager

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.008
within our EJB.

9
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.003
So here we have the Catalog EJB we created

10
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.006
and you'll see right now,

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.007
it's pretty much using this list for persistence.

12
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.008
We're going to change that in this lesson.

13
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.007
So the first thing that we're going to do

14
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:36.005
is inject our EntityManager

15
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.003
using the PersistenceContext annotation.

16
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:44.004
And we apply that to a field of type EntityManager

17
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:49.001
and that will cause the container to inject an EntityManager

18
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:53.001
that we can use for performing persistence operations.

19
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.001
Now, you'll notice we have our two methods.

20
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.001
One gets the items,

21
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.008
the other adds an item.

22
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:05.003
So let's first add the logic to pull all

23
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:09.005
of our CatalogItems using the EntityManager.

24
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.003
And to do that, we use the createQuery method

25
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.000
on the EntityManager

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.005
and here we're able to use some JPQL

27
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.001
to construct a query.

28
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.004
So it's very SQL like

29
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.007
but it does use the object model.

30
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.000
So we're going to get c which is an alias

31
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.005
that we're going to create from

32
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.004
and then we specify the name

33
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.005
of the entity that we would like to get

34
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:40.000
and this will cause all of the CatalogItems

35
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.007
to be selected from our database.

36
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:48.005
Now, we can strongly type this call

37
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:51.004
by supplying a second argument.

38
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:54.002
So it simply wants to know the type

39
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:56.003
of the entity.

40
00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.005
So we just provide the class

41
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.009
and then we execute the getResultList

42
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.004
and that's going to return a collection of CatalogItems.

43
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.001
So now we're pulling that from the database

44
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.001
as opposed to a list.

45
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:16.004
Okay, and then for the addItem method,

46
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:19.007
we can also use the EntityManager

47
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:24.003
in order to store an item within the database.

48
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:27.002
So we will be inserting a CatalogItem

49
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.007
and the way we do that

50
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:31.005
is by using the persist method

51
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.000
and that's going to persist a new entity

52
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.008
into our database.

53
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:39.006
So we just pass the object into that method

54
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:41.003
and that's all there is to it.

55
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.000
It's going to generate the SELECT statements on our behalf.

56
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.007
It's going to generate the INSERT statements

57
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:47.009
and as a developer,

58
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:52.006
we're pretty much just working with the object model.

59
00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.002
Now, the neat part about this

60
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:57.009
is our EJB is being used

61
00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:01.005
by our CatalogItemFormBean

62
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:05.001
and because we've only modified the implementation

63
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:06.007
as opposed to the interface,

64
00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:08.003
there's really no changes here.

65
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:09.006
The only thing that we need to do

66
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.008
is adjust the scope of this bean.

67
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:14.004
We did have it as a session bean

68
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:19.004
but that's only because we wanted to maintain that state

69
00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:21.003
across the different calls we made.

70
00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:26.001
Now with the CatalogItems being stored

71
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:27.002
within the database,

72
00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:30.008
the persistence and the state has moved down

73
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.007
to our relational database.

74
00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:34.003
So with that in place,

75
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:36.006
let's go ahead, save everything

76
00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:39.007
and now we can run our application.

77
00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:41.007
So I'll right click on our ear.

78
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:45.000
Project, go to Run As and then Run.

79
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.004
That's going to start our application.

80
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:51.000
We see the console spin up.

81
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And we can start heading over to a browser at this point.

82
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.005
So I'll just go into Chrome.

83
00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.003
So now within the browser,

84
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:01.009
we can access the application.

85
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.006
Let's add a new product to the catalog

86
00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:08.004
and we can say this product

87
00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:10.007
is going to be goggles

88
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:13.001
and the goggles are going to be manufactured

89
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.009
by Great Goggles.

90
00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.008
And then we can say they're going to be available

91
00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:23.000
on January 10th of 2019

92
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.005
and we'll just say these are very durable.

93
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:29.001
And then from here, we can go ahead

94
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.007
and submit our product

95
00:04:31.007 --> 00:04:35.007
and there you see the product winds up in our data table

96
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:41.002
and it was persisted to our underlying relational database.

97
00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:43.001
And you'll recall that we didn't need

98
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:47.008
to write any SQL in order to insert that CatalogItem

99
00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:48.006
into the database.

100
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:51.000
That was all handled by JPA.
