00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Narrator] Let's review some of the changes

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.006
in the most recent version of Java EE.

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:09.001
Java EE 8 introduced two new APIs.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.001
JSON-B and the security API.

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.003
JSON-B provides support for serialization

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:20.004
and deserialization between Java objects and JSON.

7
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.005
With the prominence of JSON in web development,

8
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:27.002
this API is very useful for Java developers

9
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.007
building web applications.

10
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:34.002
The Java EE security API standardizes security concerns

11
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.001
across Java EE containers.

12
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.003
The new API provides three main interfaces

13
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:44.007
for handling security and introduces better CDI support

14
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.003
for security concerns.

15
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.003
Major updates were delivered for the Servlet,

16
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:56.002
CDI, and Bean Validation APIs in Java EE 8.

17
00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:00.003
The Servlet API introduce support for HTTP/2

18
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.000
and new components were introduced

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.004
for pushing resources such as JSS and CSS files

20
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.003
to the web browser.

21
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:14.004
Additional updates added an HTTP Servlet mapping object

22
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.000
to the HTTP Servlet request

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.008
that provides visibility of the mapping

24
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:23.000
that caused a Servlet to be invoked.

25
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.008
The Bean Validation API introduced

26
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.003
additional built in validators

27
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.002
that test constraints for emails,

28
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:34.007
dates, numbers, and strings.

29
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.008
The validation API was also updated

30
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:41.009
to include validation of container elements,

31
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.009
allowing elements in a collection to be validated.

32
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.009
The CDI specification was split into three parts

33
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.001
to allow CDI to be extended

34
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.000
to work with Java standard edition.

35
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.004
Other updates made the observers

36
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:02.004
and events features of CDI more robust.

37
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:06.000
Observers were updated to include priorities

38
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.005
that control the order events are received.

39
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:11.007
Events were changed to allow them

40
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.004
to be fired asynchronously.

41
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:18.006
In Java EE 8, minor updates were delivered to JSF

42
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:22.004
and the JAX-RS and JSON-P APIs.

43
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:27.002
The JAX-RS API was updated to include a reactive client

44
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:30.003
to provide a functional, nonblocking approach

45
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.004
for calling services.

46
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:36.005
This capability is used with the new completion stage

47
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:40.006
to orchestrate calls to multiple services.

48
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.004
Service sent events was another capability

49
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:46.000
introduced in Java EE 8.

50
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.003
It allows a one way channel to be created

51
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:53.007
from a server to a client which events can be sent over.

52
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:55.007
The biggest change to JFS

53
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.005
was the introduction of server push,

54
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.005
which adopts the new capabilities

55
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:03.007
introduced in Servlet four point zero.

56
00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:07.008
In JSON-P, support for JSON Pointer was introduced,

57
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.007
which provides a path based expression

58
00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:15.009
to be used to identify specific values in a JSON document.

59
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:19.004
This is similar to JSON Patch and Merge Patch.

60
00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:23.000
However these operations look to perform updates

61
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
on the JSON document using path expressions

62
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.008
built using a fluent API.

63
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:34.000
JSON Patch will cause the operations,

64
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.003
or updates, to be applied,

65
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:40.000
while JSON Merge Patch will provide a dif

66
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.001
of the differences the update will cause.

67
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:46.007
It is an exciting time for Java EE

68
00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:50.007
because of the great changes introduced in Java EE 8.

69
00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:53.007
We'll get hands on with the majority of these features

70
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:55.000
in the course.
