00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] Let's quickly review REST

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.006
before we explore the JAX-RS API.

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.009
In REST architecture, API clients send requests

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:14.005
to an API and receive responses over HTTP.

5
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.002
The HTTP request contains information

6
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:23.001
such as the URI and the request method that informs the API

7
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:28.001
of a desired operation or data the client is requesting.

8
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.006
The API maps request information to an endpoint

9
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.004
and then returns a response to the client

10
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.002
in adjacent format over HTTP.

11
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.007
The response contains resource representations

12
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.001
for requested data or information

13
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.002
about the operation performed

14
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.009
as the result of the client request.

15
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.008
The client then receives the response from the API

16
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:57.001
and processes the information returned by the API.

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.003
Let's look at a quick example to learn more.

18
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.008
This REST API provides endpoints

19
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.006
that correspond the operations

20
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.008
to an inventoryitems resource.

21
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.005
It exposes five endpoints for the resource

22
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.004
that generally map to CRUD operations.

23
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.001
To the left of the endpoints,

24
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.002
you see the request methods or operations

25
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:22.008
and their corresponding mappings to CRUD operations.

26
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.009
Some operations like post

27
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.004
require API clients to provide additional information

28
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.006
in the HTTP request body,

29
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.007
such as the inventory item to create.

30
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.007
This is typically provided in adjacent format.

31
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.009
Other endpoints may require information

32
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.009
to be supplied in the URL,

33
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.004
which is denoted by the template parameters

34
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.009
in curly braces.

35
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.001
As we progress in this chapter,

36
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.008
we'll see how JAX-RS can be used

37
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:55.007
to easily construct REST API implementations in Java EE

38
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.000
that conform to these standards.
