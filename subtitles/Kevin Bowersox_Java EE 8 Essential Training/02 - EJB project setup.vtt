00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
- [Instructor] When creating applications that use EJBs,

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.007
it is important to package them so that the EJB module,

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.007
or business logic, is separate from the web module

4
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.009
to prevent mixing of concerns.

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.005
Let's setup a project for our Enterprise application

6
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.004
that contains an EJB project.

7
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.001
First, we'll build a project

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:24.002
to house the business logic for our EJBs.

9
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.007
So all we need to do is right-click

10
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.007
within the Package Explorer,

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:33.006
and then we can go to New, EJB Project.

12
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:40.008
We'll give our EJB project a name of hsports-catalog-ejb,

13
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:46.006
and then from here all we need to do is click on Finish.

14
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:52.001
So now we have an EJB Project and a JSF project.

15
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.004
We're going to package these two projects together

16
00:00:55.004 --> 00:01:00.009
within an EAR project that can deploy both projects at once.

17
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.001
EAR files are a Java EE packaging strategy

18
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:08.005
that allows us to package multiple modules together.

19
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.002
So in order to create the EAR project,

20
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.001
just right-click once again on the Package Explorer,

21
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:20.001
go to New, and then select Enterprise Application Project.

22
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.007
Here we'll provide a name for our new project,

23
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:29.001
it's going to be the hsports-catalog project,

24
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:34.002
and then you'll see that we've selected EAR version 8.0

25
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:36.004
and we have a Runtime set.

26
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.004
Now, once we click on Next it's going to ask us

27
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:43.001
what projects we would like to include within this EAR.

28
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.003
So we'll select our EJB project

29
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:49.009
and then we'll select our JSF project, and hit Finish.

30
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.003
So now we have the structure of our application

31
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.008
which contains our EJB and JSF project.

32
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:59.004
If we deploy this project to our server,

33
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:03.002
which we can do, Run As, and then Run on Server.

34
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.008
We'll associate it with the server and then hit Finish.

35
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:10.008
We'll see that within the server the EAR is deployed

36
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:15.002
and then we have the EJB and JSF project deployed as well.

37
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.007
Now we can go ahead at this point

38
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:20.000
and remove our individual JSF project.
