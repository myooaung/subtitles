00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Most web applications are built

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:07.000
using external CSS, JavaScript, or images.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.006
We're going to take a look at how we can reference

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:14.000
these resources within a JSF application.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.002
To get started, we're going to modify our template,

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.001
and the first thing we need to do

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:25.004
is replace the <head> HTML tag with its JSF equivalent.

8
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:29.000
So we'll go ahead and add the "h" prefix

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.009
so that we can pull that tag

10
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.007
from the HTML tag library in JSF.

11
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.007
Once that's put in place, we can go ahead

12
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:44.003
and we can use the <outputStylesheet> tag

13
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:48.009
in order to point to our global CSS style sheet.

14
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.008
So the first thing we do is specify the library attribute,

15
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:57.000
and here we can specify that this is going to be CSS,

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and then we specify the name of our style sheet,

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.006
which will be global.css.

18
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.001
The next thing we're going to do

19
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:11.006
is add a banner image into our application.

20
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.008
So here where we have our table,

21
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.003
we're going to insert a new row,

22
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.008
and then inside of that row,

23
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.009
we're going to add a table cell.

24
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.000
And within that table cell,

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.005
we can reference the <graphicImage> tag,

26
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.002
and the <graphicImage> tag

27
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:38.001
allows us to display an image on the page.

28
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.007
And we'll just say that it's within the img library

29
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:45.006
because that's the subdirectory within our resources folder.

30
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:50.002
And then we specify a value for that image,

31
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:56.001
so we're going to provide a path to the banner.jpeg

32
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.007
that we have within our application.

33
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.002
So we can follow that path,

34
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:05.006
if we take a look, it goes within the resources directory,

35
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:10.001
into img, and then banner.jpg.

36
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.006
And then you'll notice we have the shake.js file,

37
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.008
so that's some JavaScript that will shake our form.

38
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:18.009
Let's go over to the form,

39
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:24.000
and here we're going to add that JavaScript file

40
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
into our page.

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.004
So here we are specifically adding the JavaScript file

42
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:33.001
to only this page.

43
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:39.001
So to do that, we can use the <outputScript> tag,

44
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.008
and once again we will supply a library,

45
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.002
so we're going to point to that js directory

46
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.006
nested within resources.

47
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:51.008
And then we provide the name of the file,

48
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:55.003
and within that shake.js file,

49
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:59.006
you'll see that it refers to our form by its ID,

50
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:02.009
and it needs the ID to be item-form.

51
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:06.007
So let's go ahead, put that in place, we'll save everything.

52
00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:12.007
And then we're going to run our application on the server,

53
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:15.006
so we'll see that start up.

54
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.005
And I'll open a browser,

55
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:21.000
and within the browser, we can navigate to our form.

56
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.009
You'll notice we got the shake there.

57
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.006
You'll see that we now have the banner image.

58
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.004
Let's enter a product.

59
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:30.002
So our product, we'll say it's gloves,

60
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:33.001
and we'll say they're GreatGloves,

61
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:36.007
they're available October 10th,

62
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:40.009
and we'll say "These are great gloves."

63
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.002
Okay, we'll go ahead and submit that.

64
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:48.004
And there we can see that our list page is also styled.

65
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:52.004
So that's how we can incorporate those external resources

66
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:56.000
into our web applications built with JSF.
