00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] The tools provided by JBoss

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.004
allow us to integrate Eclipse with WildFly,

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:10.000
which is very helpful when building Java EE applications.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.004
Let's set up and configure our WildFly server in Eclipse.

5
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:18.000
To do that, all we need to do is click on the servers tab

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.003
and then click on the link to create a new server.

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.006
That's going to open a dialogue that will allow you

8
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:29.000
to select various servers that integrate with Eclipse.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.009
In our case we would like WildFly 17,

10
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.008
so let's select that option and hit next.

11
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.007
And then on this next dialogue

12
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.006
we're just going to leave everything

13
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.007
as the default settings.

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.006
So we can hit next and proceed.

15
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.004
And then on the JBoss runtime dialogue

16
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.007
we need to point to our WildFly installation,

17
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.000
so that it can be integrated within Eclipse.

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.005
So just go ahead, click on browse.

19
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.001
And within this dialogue

20
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.002
you'll need to navigate to wherever you installed WildFly.

21
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.000
In my case I installed it on the desktop

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.007
in the server directory.

23
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:09.009
And here we see the installation directory for WildFly.

24
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.004
So once you've found it, just go ahead, hit select folder.

25
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.007
And then we can proceed to the next option.

26
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.002
You'll notice it's asking us to configure a JRE.

27
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.000
Now, currently it's set to Java 8.

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm going to be using JDK 11,

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.007
so I'm going to select an alternate JRE.

30
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:32.008
Once you've selected your JRE you can proceed to

31
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.005
configure this configuration file.

32
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.001
And you'll see standalone.xml there.

33
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.001
And what this is, it's an XML file

34
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:46.002
that determines the WildFly server's configuration

35
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:50.004
and what different sub systems are active within it.

36
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:54.001
The standalone.xml file does not contain

37
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.002
all of the features within WildFly,

38
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.000
so we're going to switch that up.

39
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.004
So just click on browse.

40
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:05.005
And then within the WildFly installation directory,

41
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.003
you're going to see the standalone directory,

42
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.006
so click on that.

43
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.001
And then you'll see configuration.

44
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.005
Once you navigate into the configuration directory

45
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:19.008
you'll see various configuration options here for WildFly.

46
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.005
In our case we're going to use

47
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:26.006
the standalone dash full option, so select it and hit open.

48
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:28.000
And then we won't need to,

49
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.003
but let's proceed to the next dialogue.

50
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.002
Here you could add a

51
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:35.000
existing application to the WildFly server.

52
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.007
We don't have an application yet,

53
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:39.002
so we're just going to click on finish.

54
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:42.008
Once we've done that you'll see that the WildFly server

55
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:46.006
is placed within the servers tab.

56
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:50.007
And we can go ahead and start the server.

57
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.004
Okay, so the server did start.

58
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:58.006
You'll notice that we do get a bit of a stack trace here.

59
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:00.000
Definitely look this up.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Don't worry about it.

61
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.005
It's not going to impact our course.

62
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:06.001
But you can see that the WildFly server

63
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.003
has successfully started.

64
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:11.000
And we can now use it throughout the course

65
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to build out our Java EE applications.
