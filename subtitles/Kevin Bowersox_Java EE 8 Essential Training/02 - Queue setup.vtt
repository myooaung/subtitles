00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.002
- [Instructor] In order to work with JMS and Wildfly,

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.006
we'll need to create queues on the server.

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.008
To do that, we're going to navigate

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:13.001
into our Wildfly installation and then,

5
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.003
we're going to hold the shift key,

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:19.008
right-click on the bin folder and open PowerShell.

7
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.005
Inside of this folder, there are various scripts

8
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:28.006
that we can use to administer Wildfly.

9
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.007
In our case, we're going to want to use

10
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:35.008
the jboss-cli.bat file and if we supply

11
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:40.001
the --connect argument, it's going to go ahead

12
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:44.000
and connect us to the Wildfly server.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.008
We can see that we're connected and now,

14
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.005
we issue a command.

15
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.001
So, we're going to activate a queue

16
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.005
within one of the subsystems.

17
00:00:53.005 --> 00:01:00.000
So, you want to type /subsystem equals messaging

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.005
- activemq and then we're going to add another forward slash

19
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.008
and it's going to be server equals default

20
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:15.007
then JMS-queue and then here, we're able to add our queue.

21
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:20.003
So, the queue is going to be HsportsQueue

22
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:26.003
and then we need to use the add to add an entry

23
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:31.006
and then we specify a JNDI name here for our queue.

24
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.005
Now, one of the things you can see

25
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.005
when we issue this command is that Wildfly

26
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:42.008
is using active MQ which is an open source message queue

27
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:46.006
and JMS will be able to integrate with that.

28
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.007
So, here is the command for creating a new queue

29
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.005
on the JMS server.

30
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:55.007
I'll leave that up for a minute so that you can check

31
00:01:55.007 --> 00:02:00.003
to make sure you have the syntax correct.

32
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.004
Let's go ahead, issue the command

33
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.000
and there you can see that our queue was created.
