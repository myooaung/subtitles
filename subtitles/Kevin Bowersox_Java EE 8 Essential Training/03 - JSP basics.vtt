00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at how Java server pages

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:08.005
make it easier to render content from a Jave EE application.

3
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.007
To start out, we'll begin where we left off

4
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.004
in our lest servlet lesson.

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.005
However instead of rendering the view

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.008
from hard-coded markup in the servlet,

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:20.000
we're going to use JSPs because they're more flexible

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.004
and you'll see it's a lot easier.

9
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.002
So to start out, we need to create a JSP.

10
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:31.002
To do that, we place the JSP within our web content folder

11
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.001
source main web app.

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.006
So just right-click on that folder,

13
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:41.000
go to new, and then select other, and then type JSP,

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.008
and you'll see we have the option to select a JSP file.

15
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.002
Now the next thing we need to do

16
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.006
is provide a name for that JSP.

17
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:53.000
We're going to call it list dot JSP,

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and then we'll hit next and you'll see

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.005
we're given the option to pick a JSP template.

20
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.002
And these are basically just using different HTML doc types.

21
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.006
It's fine for us to use HTML5,

22
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:08.002
so just leave the default selected and hit finish.

23
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.004
And there's our first JSP.

24
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:14.008
Now we're going to get a headstart here on our markup,

25
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.006
so just navigate to the form dot HTML page

26
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.005
and grab all of the markup

27
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:27.001
within that page from the head tag down to the end.

28
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.006
And you'll just want to copy that,

29
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.002
and then take it over to the JSP and we'll just replace

30
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:38.000
everything below our HTML tag there with that markup.

31
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.006
Okay, so we got some markup that's going to serve

32
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:46.002
as our template for the list dot JSP page

33
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:50.008
and one thing I'm going to do is if we take a look

34
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:55.007
within this page, you'll see that we're setting this table

35
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:57.006
to about 150 pixels.

36
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.000
We won't need that much vertical space,

37
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.009
so I'm just going to remove that styling.

38
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.000
And the next thing that we got to take a look at

39
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.005
is our servlet.

40
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.008
So one thing you'll notice on the web servlet annotation,

41
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.002
we have removed the asynchronous nature

42
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.009
as well as on the filter.

43
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.000
We'll no longer be using async,

44
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.008
and so that means we can remove

45
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:25.000
all of this asynch code found within

46
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.002
the post method of our servlet.

47
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.006
So we'll just go ahead, remove that.

48
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:34.003
And then what we want to do is grab the code

49
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:39.004
within our method down here that prints out all the content

50
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.005
and just place it back in the post method

51
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.006
and then we'll clean up this method.

52
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:50.006
So here you can see all of the markup being generated.

53
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:54.001
That's exactly what we don't want to do with JSPs.

54
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.006
So let's remove that,

55
00:02:56.006 --> 00:03:02.007
and we'll leave all of our logic that grabs the information

56
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.008
from the request.

57
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:08.005
And at this point, we can introduce

58
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.000
a request attribute,

59
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.008
so if we grab the HTTP servlet request,

60
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:17.003
you'll see the set attribute method.

61
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:21.000
And we're simply going to create an attribute named message,

62
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.005
and we're going to assign that attribute the value

63
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.008
of the product name that's coming in from the form.

64
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:32.006
So right here you see we set that string variable.

65
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:37.001
And the next thing we'll do is instruct the servlet

66
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.001
to navigate and forward the request

67
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.006
over to our JSP for further processing.

68
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:47.002
TO do that, we use the request dispatcher,

69
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:51.001
and in order to get an instance of a request dispatcher,

70
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:54.004
we use the HTTP servlet request interface

71
00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:58.003
and it has a get request dispatcher method on it,

72
00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.008
and then we just need to provide

73
00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:04.004
the name of our JSP as an argument

74
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:07.001
and then you'll see that if we look at the dispatcher,

75
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:09.001
it has a forward method.

76
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:12.000
And it's simply going to pass over the request

77
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.005
as well as the response

78
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:20.002
to the JSP so that it can render our dynamic markup.

79
00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:24.004
And the JSP's going to have access to this attribute

80
00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:26.005
that we set on the request.

81
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:32.005
Okay, so now we can navigate back to our list dot JSP

82
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.003
and at this point we no longer have a use

83
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:39.002
for this form because we're looking to display content,

84
00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:43.001
so let's remove that markup and then very simply

85
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.003
we're going to use the expression language,

86
00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:49.000
so it uses a dollar sign and then curly brace syntax.

87
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.008
And there we can specify the message

88
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:56.007
attribute is what we'd like to reference.

89
00:04:56.007 --> 00:05:01.004
And with that in place, we have our first dynamic content

90
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:04.001
within our JSP, so the HTML's serving

91
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:07.004
as a template and then we have our dynamic message

92
00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:09.004
attribute being displayed.

93
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:13.000
Okay, with that in place, let's head over

94
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.003
to our project and we're going to run this on the server

95
00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:20.004
so that we can see it in action.

96
00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:25.009
There we see the consoles and our server starting up.

97
00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.003
And then I'm going to navigate over to a web browser.

98
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:31.003
I do have the form favorited,

99
00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:33.009
so there we see we can access the form.

100
00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.007
And let's put in a new product, a hat,

101
00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:39.002
and we'll say it's from Super Hat.

102
00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:42.001
And the SKU is 1234.

103
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:45.000
And then we go ahead, submit our form,

104
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.002
and there you can see the dynamic content

105
00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:50.003
within our JSP.

106
00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:52.007
Now one thing I want to quickly show you

107
00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:56.005
is that the JSP that we created

108
00:05:56.005 --> 00:06:00.003
is actually turned into a servlet.

109
00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:05.003
So that markup and the dynamic expression language

110
00:06:05.003 --> 00:06:07.008
basically gets compiled into a servlet.

111
00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:11.001
And we can see that within

112
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:16.001
our server if we navigate into the standalone directory,

113
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.004
and then you'll see this temp directory,

114
00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:23.006
and then you'll see a folder for our project

115
00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:27.008
and if we head into there, here you can see

116
00:06:27.008 --> 00:06:29.002
the

117
00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:30.008
Java class

118
00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:33.001
that is generated

119
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:34.003
by

120
00:06:34.003 --> 00:06:36.006
the JSP container

121
00:06:36.006 --> 00:06:37.007
for

122
00:06:37.007 --> 00:06:38.007
our

123
00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:41.005
JSP, and it's actually a servlet.

124
00:06:41.005 --> 00:06:42.009
So it's just important to know

125
00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.001
that these do compile down to servlets.

126
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:47.008
So just another way you can see

127
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:51.000
that servlets are very important within Java EE.
