00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Kevin] Before we wrap up the course,

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.003
I want to take a moment to give you a path

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:08.000
for expanding your expertise with Java EE.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The best way to gain a deeper knowledge of Java EE

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is to build your own application with the APIs we covered.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.004
This might be a personal project or a project at work.

7
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.001
But if you put these skills to work on a daily basis,

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.004
you'll quickly become an expert in Java EE.

9
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.002
Also throughout the course we covered

10
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.007
the course skills for each of the APIs,

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.006
giving you a working knowledge of each area.

12
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.001
There are courses on the LinkedIn Learning platform

13
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.009
that dive even deeper into these areas

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:41.000
focusing on a specific API per course.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.006
I highly recommend watching the courses

16
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:45.008
that may be of interest to you.

17
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:48.009
Additionally, I encourage you to share your Java EE skills

18
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:53.005
with others via forums like LinkedIn and Stack Overflow.

19
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.001
If you want to stay in touch with me,

20
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.001
I'm not hard to find online.

21
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.003
You can visit my blog at www.tothought.com

22
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.005
or check out my Stack Overflow profile

23
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.006
to see my latest activity.

24
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.004
Additionally, I have two other courses

25
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.007
on the LinkedIn Learning platform.

26
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.007
Git for Teams is a course I built

27
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.006
that delivers strategies for teams that use Git

28
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.009
and can help you avoid some common pitfalls.

29
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.004
Building APIs with Swagger covers a design-first approach

30
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.005
to creating APIs and teaches you

31
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.000
the open-API specification.

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.002
Check these out if you like my teaching style.

33
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:31.007
So that is all I have for you for now.

34
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.000
Congratulations on finishing this course

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.008
and thank you for taking it.

36
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:37.008
I really appreciate your time investment

37
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.008
and hope I've been a helpful part

38
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:42.003
of your journey as a developer.

39
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:44.002
Now, put your skills to work

40
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:48.000
and go build some exciting applications with Java EE.
