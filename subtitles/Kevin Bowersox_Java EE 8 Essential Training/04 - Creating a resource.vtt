00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Narrator] In this lesson, we're going to create

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.002
our first JAX-RS resource.

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.004
To help us with this, you'll notice that I've added

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.008
the inventory item class into the project.

5
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:17.001
The class is annotated as a JPA entity,

6
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.003
because we're going to be using JPA in order to maintain,

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:26.000
some state within our JAX-RS API.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.003
To get started with building our first resource,

9
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.009
we're going to right click on our package,

10
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.006
and then go to new and then you'll see JAX-RS resource

11
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.005
within the first menu.

12
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.003
If you click on that, we get the dialogue for building

13
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.002
a resource within eclipse.

14
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.006
And one of the nice features is that we can select

15
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:49.008
the target entity.

16
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:50.006
In this case,

17
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.003
our resource is going to be the inventory item.

18
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.007
So we'll go ahead and select that item.

19
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:01.000
And then we can proceed to name our endpoint,

20
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.009
I'm just going to go ahead and accept the default.

21
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:08.000
And then you'll notice that we have been provided

22
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
with a resource path of inventory items.

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.008
That's the end point where we can access our resource,

24
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.005
so we'll leave that in place.

25
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.005
The other thing that we have to select is what media types

26
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.008
our endpoint will support.

27
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:26.007
We're not going to be using XML, so I'm going to go ahead

28
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.001
and remove XML from that list.

29
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.004
You'll then notice that the dialogue can create stubs for us

30
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.009
so we can create different crud operations,

31
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.008
that will be exposed as endpoints on our resource.

32
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:46.009
Let's go ahead and select all of these options

33
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.008
in order to create them when we generate our resource.

34
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.002
If we move to the next screen in the wizard,

35
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.006
you'll see that we could build out a JAX-RS application.

36
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.008
We've already done that so we're going to go ahead

37
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:01.008
and click on skip.

38
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.007
This point, we can hit finish,

39
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:09.001
and our new JAX-RS resource is created.

40
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:10.009
Let's take a look at it,

41
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.002
you'll notice that the path annotation has been applied.

42
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:19.003
So this is going to be concatenated to our base URL

43
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:24.003
for the API in order to form the endpoint for this resource.

44
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.009
We are also supporting Jason,

45
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:32.008
both accepting it and providing it to clients of our API.

46
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:36.000
And then here you'll see some stubs that have been built out

47
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.002
that correspond with different operations for our resource.

48
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:42.007
So here, you can post a resource

49
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:46.000
to create a new inventory item.

50
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.004
Here you can get a particular inventory item,

51
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:54.003
we see a path parameter there with in the parameters

52
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.007
on that method.

53
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:58.003
And then if we just scroll down,

54
00:02:58.003 --> 00:02:59.008
we'll see additional methods,

55
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:03.005
here is a method that is simply a get against

56
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:06.007
the base path for this resource.

57
00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:11.002
And it's able to return the entire list of inventory items.

58
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:14.001
You see, we can do a put to perform an update.

59
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.002
And then there's the delete annotation that allows us

60
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:19.004
to remove a resource.

61
00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:22.006
So let's make a couple adjustments here,

62
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:26.006
just so we can run a small example.

63
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:29.006
You'll notice that defined by ID method

64
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:33.009
is returning a inventory item

65
00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:38.004
based upon the ID which is provided as a path parameter

66
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:40.001
to this endpoint.

67
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.009
Currently, that item is going to be null, so let's go ahead

68
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.002
and we're just going to use the new operator

69
00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:52.009
and the constructor to create an inventory item.

70
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:56.005
And we can do that real simply will just make it static

71
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:58.005
and will say it's going to mittens

72
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:02.009
and we have a 100 mittens.

73
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.004
Okay, so that's in place.

74
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:09.005
Now we can go ahead and start our application.

75
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:13.004
So I'm just going to right click on our ear,

76
00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:17.002
go to run as and then run on server.

77
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:19.008
And we won't be accessing our API through

78
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.008
the application this time.

79
00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:25.005
Instead, we're just going to be issuing a get.

80
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:28.006
So I'm going to grab this URL,

81
00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:31.005
and then we can head over to the browser.

82
00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:32.008
And within the browser,

83
00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:38.002
we can send the get request to our JAX-RS API.

84
00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:43.008
And we just have to construct a request that will cause

85
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:47.006
the appropriate endpoint on that resource to be invoked.

86
00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:52.002
So you'll remember that hsports forward slash API

87
00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:53.008
was our base path.

88
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:58.002
And then we had the inventory items path to access

89
00:04:58.002 --> 00:05:00.000
the inventory items resource

90
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.009
and then we had to provide a path variable.

91
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.003
In this case, I'm going to specify one.

92
00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:08.004
And you'll notice that we get Jason back

93
00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:10.007
from our JAX-RS API.

94
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:13.006
So that's a look at how to create a resource

95
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:16.000
on a JAX-RS web service.
