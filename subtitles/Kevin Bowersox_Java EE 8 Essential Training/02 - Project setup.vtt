00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
- In this lesson, we will create and configure a new

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:09.005
project that will use the Java EE 8 Security API.

3
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.002
So to get started, we're just going to open the new

4
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:16.008
dialog and then create a Dynamic Web Project.

5
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.004
So select that option and hit next.

6
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.002
And then, we're going to name the project

7
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:27.005
the hsports-catalog-security project.

8
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:31.004
And you'll just hit next after you've provided that name.

9
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.005
Then we're going to go ahead and

10
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.001
remove the existing source folder,

11
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:40.006
and we're going to add the source main Java folder,

12
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:45.006
as well as the source main resources source folder.

13
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.002
Okay, from there we're going to proceed to the

14
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.001
next pane in the dialog and we're going

15
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.006
to name this source main web app.

16
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.004
From there, we'll hit finish.

17
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.006
That's going to create our new project and,

18
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:03.001
then within the source main Java source folder,

19
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.009
we're going to create a new servlet.

20
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.001
So we'll go ahead select servlet and hit next.

21
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.001
We'll put the servlet within the com.linkedin package,

22
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:18.002
and we're just going to name it secure servlet.

23
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.005
We'll then proceed to the next option in the dialog,

24
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.002
and this is going to allow us

25
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.003
to configure the URL mapping.

26
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.009
I'm going to remove the existing one

27
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.004
and just make it something shorter.

28
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.005
We'll make it secure.

29
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:34.004
And that will be the path to our servlet,

30
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.001
and then I'm actually going to go ahead

31
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.008
on the next pane and just remove the post.

32
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.002
We're only going to provide an implementation

33
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.000
for the get method.

34
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.007
And then you'll see, we get our servlet created.

35
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:47.009
And let's take out some of the comments

36
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.006
that they're providing, just to clean things up.

37
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:56.009
Okay. So now we have our servlet, and what we're

38
00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.008
going to do from here is configure

39
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.004
the project as a Maven project.

40
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:04.007
So just right-click on the project,

41
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:09.000
go to configure and then convert to Maven project.

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.009
And then just go ahead and hit finish.

43
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.000
That's going to bring up this dialog.

44
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.008
Just deselect all and then hit finish.

45
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:22.004
Okay. You'll notice we get a pom.xml file,

46
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.004
and we're going to use Maven to pull in

47
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:28.006
the new Java EE 8 Security API.

48
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:31.004
So to do that, we specify a group id

49
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:37.004
of javax.security.enterprise and then the artifact

50
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:45.004
id is javax.security.enterprise-api and we

51
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:50.004
want the version 1.0 of that API.

52
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:53.005
Okay. With that in place, let's go ahead, hit okay.

53
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:56.009
And now we can save our pom.xml file.

54
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.009
The next thing we're going to do

55
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.009
is add a JBoss web.xml file.

56
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:10.003
So this is a file that is specific to Wildfly and JBoss.

57
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.005
And to do that, we're just going to navigate

58
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:16.006
to the source main web app WEB-INF directory,

59
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:20.007
and then hit CTRL + N to open the new dialog,

60
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:22.006
and you'll just type file and then,

61
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.003
we're going to select the general file.

62
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:28.005
And then for the name of this file,

63
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:33.005
it's jboss-web.xml and then we'll go ahead and hit finish.

64
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:36.007
And this allows us to add in some

65
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.009
configurations that are specific to WildFly.

66
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:43.000
And what we need to do is change the

67
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
security domain that WildFly is using.

68
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.007
We need to use a particular security domain

69
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:53.005
that supports the new security API.

70
00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:58.004
So we can add a security domain tag to the

71
00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:02.002
jboss web.xml file and the name of

72
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:06.002
that security domain is jaspitest.

73
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:09.003
So you'll want to specify that.

74
00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:13.002
Then, we need to provide the context-root that

75
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:16.004
we will be using this security domain for,

76
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:18.005
and you'll remember that we named

77
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:23.008
our project hsports-catalog-security.

78
00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:30.006
Okay. So that puts our jboss-web.xml file in place

79
00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:34.009
and it completes the setup of our project that

80
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.000
we'll be using to test the security API.
