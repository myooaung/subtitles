00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] Eclipse makes the setup

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.004
of a new JAX-RS project very simple.

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's go ahead and build out a new JAX project.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Just open the new dialogue,

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.002
and then type dynamic web project,

6
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:14.009
and you'll see the selection.

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.004
Go ahead and move to the next screen,

8
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.004
and then, here, we need to provide a name

9
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:20.007
for our new project.

10
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:26.002
It's going to be Hsports-catalog-jax,

11
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.000
and then from here,

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we can proceed to the next screen in the wizard

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we'll remove the existing source folder.

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.001
We'll switch it over to source main java,

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:41.005
and then we'll add another folder source main resources,

16
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.006
and then we'll proceed to the next screen.

17
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.003
Here we're going to, once again,

18
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:51.000
switch out that content directory to source main web app.

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.008
And, from here, we can go ahead and hit finish.

20
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.009
So you'll see that our new project is created.

21
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.002
And then what we're going to do is

22
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:03.006
add a new JAX-RS application.

23
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:06.009
So if you just type application within the new dialogue,

24
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.006
you'll see the option to select JAX-RS application.

25
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.006
Choose that, hit next,

26
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:17.005
and then we need to provide some additional configuration.

27
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:23.009
First, we're going to set up the package for this new class,

28
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.001
and it's going to be com.linkedin.

29
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.009
And then for the name of the class,

30
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:35.004
we'll call it the HsportsRestApplication.

31
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:40.004
And then we set up the base URI for the entire API.

32
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.002
In our case,

33
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:47.005
we're going to specify a /Hsports/api.

34
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.007
Once that's in place, go ahead and hit finish,

35
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.009
and you'll see the class annotated

36
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.002
with the application path annotation

37
00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:01.009
as well as that class extending the application class,

38
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.000
which is part of JAX-RS.

39
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.004
And that's all we need to do

40
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:10.000
to set up a new JAX-RS application.

41
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.008
Now, we are packaging our entire app within an ear,

42
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.008
so we're going to right-click on that ear,

43
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.002
and then go to properties,

44
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:23.000
and then we can go to deployment assembly.

45
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.008
And if we click on add, we can add a project,

46
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.008
so we'll hit next, and then we simply select

47
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:35.009
our newly-created Hsports-catalog-jax project.

48
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.006
That will then become part of our ear.

49
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:41.007
And what we can do, I'm just going to remove

50
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:44.003
our existing application from the server,

51
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.003
and then we'll fire up the app

52
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:50.000
just to make sure everything's okay.

53
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.003
Let's watch the console here.

54
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.008
Okay, so we see that our application started,

55
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:05.003
so now we have a JAX-RS application configured.

56
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:08.001
We'll go ahead from here and start to build out

57
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.000
some of the resources in the upcoming lessons.
