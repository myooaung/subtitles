00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Let's begin our conversation

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.009
regarding Java Enterprise Edition.

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.007
One of the most important concepts to grasp

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:12.004
about Java EE is that it is an umbrella specification

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:16.001
that contains a group of API specifications

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.008
for building enterprise systems within Java.

7
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.009
Within sub specifications,

8
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.009
you will find a variety of development concerns addressed

9
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.009
such as web application development,

10
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.000
data persistence, building REST APIs,

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.005
dependency injection and security.

12
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.000
The API specifications are governed

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.001
by the Java Community Process

14
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.007
which we'll discuss in a little more detail.

15
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.008
The specifications themselves

16
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.002
are just documentation that various groups bring to life

17
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.008
by coding their implementations.

18
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.007
Currently, Java EE is at version eight

19
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.009
and the project has been handed off

20
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.005
by Oracle to the Eclipse Foundation.

21
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.009
Java EE API specifications are created

22
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.001
through the Java Community Process

23
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.000
which basically consists of an approval process

24
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.006
for Java specification requests

25
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.000
and their development and release.

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.009
Industry experts, Java user groups

27
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.007
and individual contributors participate

28
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.008
in the process of developing an API specification.

29
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.004
Once a specification is released,

30
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:27.003
various groups in the Java community build implementations

31
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:33.000
of the API writing the actual source code behind the API.

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.001
These implementations are typically made available

33
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.000
by vendors in their application servers

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.007
which can be certified as Java EE compliant.

35
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:48.002
Currently, there are 20 Java EE 8 compliant implementations.

36
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.009
The JSP establishes the direction of Java EE

37
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.006
through the JSRs they approve.

38
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.003
This helps move the technology forward

39
00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.007
in alignment with its goals.

40
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:02.002
The overarching goal of Java EE

41
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:06.003
is to help developers quickly build enterprise systems,

42
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.005
providing higher level abstractions

43
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.006
for handling common system concerns.

44
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.008
So imagine if you needed messaging within a system

45
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.001
you are developing.

46
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.002
You could code all of the network connectivity

47
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.000
for the messaging system,

48
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.009
however, with Java EE,

49
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.007
there's an API for that.

50
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.000
Over the past few versions,

51
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.006
Java EE has embraced several high-level goals

52
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.007
that transition the technologies

53
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:36.002
towards support of modern development techniques

54
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.008
such as suitability for cloud environments

55
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.008
and microservice architectures.

56
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:45.003
Additionally, Java EE has incorporated support

57
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.008
from developments outside of Java

58
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:52.002
such as HTML5, and HTTP/2.

59
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:55.003
Another key theme is simplifying the platform

60
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:58.000
which has been achieved using annotations,

61
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and dependency injection,

62
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.004
eliminating the need for massive amounts

63
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:04.009
of XML configuration.

64
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.008
There are roughly 35 APIs included

65
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:09.007
in Java Enterprise Edition

66
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.003
most of which are depicted here.

67
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.000
For the best use of your time,

68
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.003
we'll be covering 15 of the most relevant

69
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:20.002
and useful APIs found within Java EE.

70
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.007
Many of the APIs covered in the course

71
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:25.005
help developers create web applications

72
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.008
such as the servlets, JSP, JSF,

73
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:33.003
JAX-RS, and web sockets APIs.

74
00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:35.009
Another subset of the APIs we'll cover

75
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.005
addresses cross-cutting concerns used

76
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:41.000
throughout Java EE technologies

77
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.008
such as CDI, expression language

78
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:45.009
and bean validation.

79
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.007
CDI is a great example here.

80
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:51.004
It's the dependency injection technology

81
00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:55.002
at the foundation of Java EE.

82
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:58.005
Two of the APIs you'll learn, JSONP

83
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.004
and the new JSONB API,

84
00:04:01.004 --> 00:04:05.007
provide tolls for working with JSON in Java.

85
00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:07.007
We'll also explore JPA

86
00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:10.000
which is used for persisting information

87
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.009
to relational databases

88
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.002
and JMS which provides support

89
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.005
for messaging in Java.

90
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:20.005
You will also get an overview of enterprise Java beans

91
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:24.003
for building services and the new security API

92
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:29.005
that standardizes security across Java EE applications.

93
00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.009
So that was just a glimpse

94
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.000
of the APIs we'll cover in the course.

95
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.007
We'll dive in deeper with hands-on lessons

96
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.003
for each API that teach you

97
00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:43.000
to create better enterprise applications in Java.
