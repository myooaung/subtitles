00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.004
- [Man] Within JSF, we can use the facelets tag library,

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.009
to introduce templating within our application.

3
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.004
This is useful because we can avoid repeating

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.003
common markup within every page.

5
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.002
So, to get started, just right click on the web app folder,

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.000
and then go to new, other,

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.003
and then here we're going to create a new XHTML page,

8
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.007
we're going to name that page template,

9
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.000
and then we'll just hit next,

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.001
and instead of picking the blank facelet page,

11
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.004
we'll select the common facelet page

12
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:40.001
to build out our template, and then just hit finish.

13
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:44.001
You'll notice we're using the older DOCTYPE,

14
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.006
so let's go grab out HTML5 DOCTYPE,

15
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:52.003
and we're going to paste that at the top of our file,

16
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.009
okay, and now let's take a closer look at our template.

17
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.008
So, if we inspect the template,

18
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:00.002
you're going to see these insert tags,

19
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.008
that are facelets tags,

20
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:03.004
and basically this is saying that

21
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.005
you can define a page title,

22
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:09.005
and insert the content within the template

23
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.002
from a page that leverages the template.

24
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:18.002
You'll also notice we have a page header, as well as a body.

25
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:22.006
So, let's go over to our form facelet,

26
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.008
and here we're going to set it up

27
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:29.009
to leverage our new template,

28
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.004
and then we use the ui:define tag,

29
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:37.005
that's part of the facelets tag library,

30
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.006
in order to define our body,

31
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:45.000
and then you just surround the content that you would like

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.004
placed within the body section of the template,

33
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.002
using the ui:define tag.

34
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.008
So, another thing that we saw was that

35
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:57.004
there was a page header on there,

36
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:02.007
so let's go ahead and we can specify a page header,

37
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:06.003
let's make sure we got that correct, yep okay,

38
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:11.003
and here we can build out another piece of content

39
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:16.008
that we would like to place within our template.

40
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.007
So, we're going to do this a little bit differently,

41
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:22.000
we're going to define a resource bundle,

42
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.001
which can be used by JSF.

43
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.003
To do that, I'm going to create a new package

44
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:30.008
within my source main Java folder,

45
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:33.007
I'm going to name that package resources,

46
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.005
and then inside of that resources package,

47
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.007
I'm just going to add a file,

48
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:43.000
and I'm going to call it messages.properties,

49
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
so there you can see our properties file,

50
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and if we head over to the source for that file,

51
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.009
here we can define key value pairs that can be leveraged

52
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:58.000
using the expression language within JSF.

53
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.006
So, I'm going to add a property named form.pageTitle,

54
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:09.006
and we'll just set that properties value to catalog form,

55
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:13.008
and then we'll add another property list.pageTitle,

56
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:18.003
which we'll set to catalog, and then from here,

57
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:22.007
we go back to our template.xhtml file,

58
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:25.008
and you'll notice we have this loadBundle tag,

59
00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:27.007
which is also a facelets tag,

60
00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:32.000
and that needs to point to our properties file.

61
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.004
So, we set the basename attribute,

62
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:37.007
and you can see we're benefiting from IntelliSense there,

63
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:40.006
and basically we're assigning all of those properties

64
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:43.008
to this variable msg.

65
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:48.007
So, let's go back over to our form,

66
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:53.005
and then within the form we can leverage

67
00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:57.005
our resource bundle by creating an expression,

68
00:03:57.005 --> 00:04:01.005
and then we use the msg variable name,

69
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:05.004
and then we reference the property,

70
00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:11.003
so that was the form.PageTitle property,

71
00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:15.008
and then we just close out our expression, okay.

72
00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:20.008
So, there we've set up our form to use our page template,

73
00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:25.001
we're providing some content from our resource bundle,

74
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:30.000
let's go ahead and add this as well to our last page,

75
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.004
so I'm just going to copy all of this,

76
00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:36.001
go over to the list, and then we can add that in,

77
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.009
we'll need to switch up the property

78
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.007
we're referencing within that resource bundle,

79
00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:45.006
and then we're also going to need to

80
00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:52.009
close out our define tag for the body, okay.

81
00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.007
So, both pages set up to use templates,

82
00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:58.001
we got the resource bundle content,

83
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.002
let's make sure everything is saved,

84
00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:02.003
and then we're going to go ahead

85
00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:06.008
and run this application on our server,

86
00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:11.004
we'll see it fire up here,

87
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:13.009
and then I'm just going to head over to Chrome,

88
00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.009
where I have things bookmarked.

89
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.004
Now, you can see we get some styling from the template,

90
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:22.001
let's add another product name,

91
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:26.000
this time we'll say skis, we go ahead, we submit,

92
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.009
there we see we go to the list page,

93
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.009
which also has the markup and the styling of our template.

94
00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.004
So, that was a look at how we can use some of the

95
00:05:36.004 --> 00:05:40.000
templating features within the facelets tag library.
