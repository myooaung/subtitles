00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] Before we get too far into the course,

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.009
I wanted to take a moment to introduce you

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.000
to our course project.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.008
Our course project is going to be a back office

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:14.003
inventory management system created for H+ Sport.

6
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.007
Within this back office system

7
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.002
we can created different products

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.007
that are going to be found

9
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:25.004
within the H+ Sport inventory.

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.008
These products will then be added to the catalog

11
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.007
for the company and we can view the individual product

12
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:36.009
and its details as well as assign item managers

13
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.008
that are responsible for supplying the product

14
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.006
for the company.

15
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.002
Also there's a help chat that we've developed

16
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.000
that can be used by the item managers

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.008
to resolve product issues.

18
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.009
Now all of this back office inventory management

19
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.008
is to support the H+ Sport company

20
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:01.001
and they sell active apparel and supplements

21
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.008
on their H+ Sport website.

22
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:09.000
Here we can see the product catalog for the company.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.007
As we build out this project,

24
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.002
you're going to get a lot of great, hands-on experience

25
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.009
with all of the Java EE APIs

26
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.000
and we're going to integrate many of the technologies

27
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in order to build our H+ Sport inventory management system.
