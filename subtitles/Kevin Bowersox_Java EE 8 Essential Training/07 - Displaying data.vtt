00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- [Tutor] In addition to helping us style our applications,

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:07.001
JSF also provides components that we can leverage

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.002
in order to display data.

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.004
We're going to take a look at one of those components

5
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:12.009
in this lesson.

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.007
You remember that we have our items list

7
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.008
on our Catalog Item Form Bean.

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:24.004
And that serves as the backing beam for our form

9
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.003
and now it's going to serve as a backing beam

10
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.002
for our list page.

11
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:33.000
So instead of just displaying the individual field,

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.008
we're going to add a new component to this page

13
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:41.000
and it's going to be a data table.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.005
So inside the data table, we're able to specify columns

15
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:49.002
that will display as part of the table.

16
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:53.006
To do that, we can use the facet tag

17
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:59.002
and we specify that we want the facet to be a header

18
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:03.005
and then we provide the name for that column header.

19
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:08.003
Then after that, we can specify an output text.

20
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:13.002
And that output text can be bound to an item

21
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:17.004
that is contained within the collection bound

22
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.000
to the data table.

23
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.002
So let's go ahead and bind our collection to the data table.

24
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.006
So we use the expression language

25
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:29.007
to bind the items collection

26
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:33.008
and then within the table element,

27
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:36.004
we can specify the name

28
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:40.007
of a variable that will hold each individual item

29
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.000
within the collection.

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And now we can use that variable name in order to bind

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.002
to that item within our table.

32
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:53.005
So, there we see the binding for one of our columns.

33
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:57.000
Let's go ahead and add the other columns

34
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.002
we'd like to display.

35
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:08.002
So we'll need a column for the manufacturer

36
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:11.008
which is another field contained on the item.

37
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:19.002
And then we'll also have the available date.

38
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:24.008
And we use expression language to reference that.

39
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:29.006
And then finally, we're going to display our description.

40
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:33.008
And we'll change up the name on that header.

41
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.001
So we'll go ahead and format our html

42
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.005
and then I'm going to save the application

43
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:48.008
and now we can go ahead and run the project.

44
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:54.004
We can then go to our form and we can add a new product.

45
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:59.003
I'm just going to add gloves once again.

46
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:01.004
And then we can go ahead and submit.

47
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:04.001
And here you can see our data table

48
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.006
that is displaying the information found

49
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:07.009
within our collection.

50
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:11.007
So if we were to go back, we could add a second product,

51
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:20.008
let's say mittens.

52
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:24.001
And you'll see that another row is displayed

53
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:25.007
within our data table.

54
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:28.003
So, that's one of the components that we can leverage

55
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:30.007
to display information to the end-user.

56
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:32.009
It will cause a component to be built

57
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.004
within the Facelets component tree.

58
00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:37.008
And there's many of those within JSF

59
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:40.000
that you could leverage for displaying data.
