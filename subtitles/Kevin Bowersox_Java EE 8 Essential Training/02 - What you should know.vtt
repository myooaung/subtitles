00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.006
- Before diving deeper into Java Enterprise Edition,

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.001
let's talk about who the course is for,

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.000
and what information you should know ahead of time.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.007
If you want to learn the entire Java Enterprise Edition

5
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.007
stack, this is a great course to take end to end.

6
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:20.002
However, if you're interested in a few specific APIs,

7
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.004
you'll benefit a lot from completing individual chapters

8
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.001
in this course.

9
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.007
This course is extremely beneficial for Java developers

10
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.000
who want to gain hands on experience,

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.009
with the various APIs in Java Enterprise Edition.

12
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.006
The course will teach you when and how to use

13
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.008
popular technologies within Java EE,

14
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:45.006
so you can leverage them within a new or existing project.

15
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.009
Software architects will also benefit from this course

16
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.002
because it provides a good overview of the capabilities

17
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:55.004
present within the latest Java EE release.

18
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:59.009
So they can be applied when architecting new systems.

19
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.004
Also, those interested in furthering their understanding

20
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.002
of software development, will benefit from the content

21
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.008
in this course.

22
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.006
I should point out that all the tools we'll be using

23
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:13.008
such as Eclipse, and WildFly, work on almost

24
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.001
every operating system, so if you're using Linux,

25
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.001
Windows or a Mac, you'll be fine for moving ahead

26
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.000
in this course.

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.001
Each chapter of the course, focuses on a specific

28
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.004
Java EE API, teaching you the concepts and core skills

29
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:33.002
necessary to develop, architect, or maintain systems

30
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:37.002
leveraging that particular Java EE technology.

31
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.004
To get the most out of this course, you should have

32
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.007
a basic understanding of the Java programming language.

33
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.006
If you understand the basic syntax, classes,

34
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.004
interfaces and annotations, I can help you

35
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:51.000
become proficient in Java EE.

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.004
That is all you need to know, a little bit of Java,

37
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.000
and I'll be there to guide you through the rest.
