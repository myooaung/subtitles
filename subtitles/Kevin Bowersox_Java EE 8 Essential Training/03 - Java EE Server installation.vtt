00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] Throughout the course,

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:04.008
we will use WildFly, a certified Java EE

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.001
application server provided by Jboss.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.001
Within WildFly, we'll find implementations

5
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.004
of various Java Enterprise Edition technologies

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:19.000
that support development of Java EE applications.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.008
So all we need to do in order to get started with WildFly

8
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:28.004
is click on the downloads section of the WildFly website,

9
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:32.007
which is located at wildfly.org.

10
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.006
Within the downloads section,

11
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:38.006
you'll find various distributions of the application server.

12
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.003
We're going to be using version 17.

13
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:45.001
So if we scroll down, you'll notice that we have

14
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.001
the Java EE Full and Web Distribution.

15
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.009
This will include support

16
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:55.001
for all of the APIs found within Java EE.

17
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.001
Go ahead and download this distribution

18
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.006
by clicking on the ZIP link.

19
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:04.005
And you'll notice that the server begins to download.

20
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:08.007
It's packaged in a nice ZIP file.

21
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.009
I've placed that ZIP file on the desktop.

22
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.002
And I'm just going to click on the downloaded ZIP file.

23
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.006
I'm going to change its name to server,

24
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:25.007
and then I'm going to go ahead and extract it to the desktop.

25
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:29.003
Here we see the directory containing WildFly.

26
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.002
If we look within the contents of that directory,

27
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:36.008
you'll see the server and all of the files related to it.

28
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:41.000
You'll want to be sure to note the installation directory

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.004
where you've placed the WildFly server,

30
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:46.001
because we'll need that in order to integrate

31
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.000
the server with our IDE.
