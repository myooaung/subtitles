00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.005
- In this lesson, we're going to use JSON P's object model

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.009
API to create a jsonObject and a jsonArray.

3
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.001
We'll do that by using two of the builders found within

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.000
the object model API.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.004
All of our work is going to take place within

6
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:21.001
our Order resource and we're going to start out by

7
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.000
removing our customerObject, as well as our console

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.007
output.

9
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.009
Then, within the body of the resource method

10
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.006
we can start to build out out jsonObject.

11
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.001
This object is going to be used to create some

12
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:40.003
tracking information about the order, so we'll be able to

13
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:43.004
see when the order was created and see different statuses

14
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.004
that it goes through.

15
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:49.002
Let's start by building an objectBuilder and

16
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:53.004
we just use the jsonObjectBuilder type and I'm

17
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.004
going to name this objectBuilder

18
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.008
jsonTrackingObjectBuilder.

19
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.006
Then to create the

20
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.009
objectBuilder we use the jsonObject and it has a

21
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.008
createObjectBuilder method on it.

22
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.006
Then from here we can start chaining

23
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:14.005
using its fluent API, so we'll invoke the add operation

24
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:18.001
and this going to accept two arguments, the first of which

25
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:22.009
is the name of the property we want to add to the object.

26
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.005
In our case it's going to be the 'orderDate' and then we can

27
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.009
assign a value in the second argument.

28
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.009
We're going to use the localDateTime object

29
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.000
to get the current date and time.

30
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.006
Then we'll send that to a string.

31
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:44.008
And there we've created our first jsonObjectBbuilder.

32
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:46.008
Now, we haven't built the jsonObject yet, we'll do

33
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.009
that in a little bit.

34
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.005
Next we're going to use a jsonArrayBuilder

35
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:58.006
and we'll name this the jsonStatusArrayBuilder.

36
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:01.006
WE're going to build an array that tracks the different

37
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:06.002
statuses the order goes through with this builder.

38
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:10.001
So let's create the arrayBuilder using the jsonObject

39
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.002
and its createArrayBuilder method.

40
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:18.000
Just like the objectBuilder, it has a fluent API,

41
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.007
so we can chain calls, and what we're actually going to

42
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:27.008
do is nest an object within the array.

43
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:32.005
So, we're going to use the objectBuilder and then we're

44
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:36.004
going to add a 'status' property on the object

45
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:40.002
and then we're going to provide a value

46
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:45.008
where the status is 'RECEIVED'.

47
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:50.000
Then we'll need to build that jsonObject.

48
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.004
So we're going to add one more status to our array.

49
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:57.003
So I'm just going to copy that line, and then we're

50
00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:01.002
going to change the status over to 'SENT_FOR_PROCESSING'.

51
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:05.001
Okay, so now we have our jsonArrayBuilder.

52
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.005
What we're going to do next is take our

53
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:12.006
jsonTrackingObjectBuilder and we're going to add

54
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:16.000
another property and that property's name is going to be

55
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.007
'statuses'

56
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:21.005
Then we're going to use our jsonStatusArrayBuilder

57
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:24.005
and we're going to build the array and attach

58
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:28.006
it to a property on the object called 'statuses'.

59
00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:31.009
From there we're going to take the original object,

60
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.002
which was passed into our resource method, and

61
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:37.006
that's our order, if you remember.

62
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:41.001
We're going to add the TrackingObject to that

63
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:43.009
jsonObject.

64
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.003
So, we'll assign the jsonObject to the result of

65
00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:53.007
creating a new objectBuilder and then we're going to

66
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:58.002
pass in our jsonObject, and then from there we can

67
00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:01.009
continue to use the method chaining to add

68
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.004
a 'tracking' object.

69
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:07.003
Then we're going to leverage our

70
00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:13.002
jsonTrackingObjectBuilder, and we're going to go ahead

71
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:16.005
build that object.

72
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:20.000
Let's drop this down to another line so we can see.

73
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.008
Then finally, we'll need to build our new object.

74
00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:29.001
At this point we have a new jsonObject which is an order

75
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:32.006
that contains tracking information.

76
00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:35.002
So, let's go ahead we'll clean things up here a little bit.

77
00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:38.005
Then we're just going to add some console output so that

78
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:40.009
we can run a test.

79
00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.008
The console output we're going to provide, we're

80
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:46.005
just going to take our new jsonObject and send it

81
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:48.005
to a string.

82
00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:51.005
With all that in place, let's go ahead and run our

83
00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:53.000
application.

84
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So there we see it starting up.

85
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.008
I'm going to make sure we got our console and then

86
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:00.004
I'll clear it.

87
00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:04.002
Then we'll go ahead and right-click on our PowerShow

88
00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.001
command.

89
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:09.001
We'll run that command, which will send the API traffic

90
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:11.008
Now let's take a look at our console again.

91
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:16.008
Here you can see the new jsonObject that we created.

92
00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:21.001
There we see the customer, we see the items that they

93
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:23.000
have selected.

94
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.009
Then we should see our trackingObject.

95
00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.004
Right there it was.

96
00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:32.003
You can also see the statuses that were found

97
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:35.002
on our trackingObject.

98
00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:39.005
Right there, that information or that json was added

99
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:43.006
to our existing object, by using the different builders

100
00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:47.000
within the jsonp object model API.
