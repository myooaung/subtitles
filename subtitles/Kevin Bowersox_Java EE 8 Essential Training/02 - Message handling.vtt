00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] The Servlet interface is designed

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:07.001
to receive and respond using HTTP messages.

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.006
It's important to understand the concepts

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:15.001
behind HTTP messages, and their associated API interfaces,

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.004
to successfully work with Servlets.

6
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.009
Within Servlet API, we will be using

7
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.009
the HTTP Servlet request,

8
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.008
and HTTP Servlet response interfaces

9
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.006
when we are working with HTTP messages.

10
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.007
These interfaces have corresponding methods

11
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.003
that are able to retrieve or create

12
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.000
parts of an HTTP request.

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.008
Let's review the typical structure of an HTTP message

14
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.006
in order to work with these interfaces better.

15
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:51.005
An HTTP message begins with a start line

16
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.007
that contains the type of HTTP method,

17
00:00:54.007 --> 00:01:00.008
in this case a POST, and the protocol being used, HTTP.

18
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.007
The start line is followed by headers that provide metadata

19
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:09.001
about the message, and cookies included within the message.

20
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.006
Finally, the body of the response contains data

21
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.000
associated with the message, which can be

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.008
a variety of media types, such as HTML, or JSON.

23
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.001
The request body is typically used

24
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.001
only for HTTP POST and PUT request.

25
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.002
For responses, there's generally some content

26
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.000
that is generated and placed within the body

27
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.004
to be returned to the browser.

28
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.003
Let's dive in a little bit deeper,

29
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:37.004
and take a look at

30
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:43.007
the HTTP Servlet request interface documentation.

31
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.005
The HTTP Servlet request interface

32
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:50.005
represents the incoming HTTP message.

33
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:54.000
Within this interface, you will find support

34
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.009
for retrieving various pieces of data on that request.

35
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.004
So here we see the Get Cookies method,

36
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.001
which can return a Cookies object.

37
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.004
You see that we can also get headers,

38
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:10.009
as well as a collection of header names that are accessible.

39
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.005
And, we're also able to get parameters

40
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:19.001
from the HTTP Servlet request.

41
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:22.008
So, all of these methods are basically allowing us

42
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:27.004
to parce out that HTTP request.

43
00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:29.008
Now let's move on, and we'll take a look at

44
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:33.002
the HTTP Servlet response interface.

45
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:36.003
So, if we navigate to the documentation,

46
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.004
the HTTP Servlet response is what we're building

47
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:43.000
and providing back to the client or the browser.

48
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.006
Now, if we scroll down and take a look,

49
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.005
you can see that instead of retrieving information,

50
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:51.000
we are instead constructing that response

51
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
by adding things like cookies, adding different headers,

52
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.006
and a very important piece of this is the Writer.

53
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:02.003
So, if we take a look at the Writer method,

54
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:04.008
it provides a Printwriter object,

55
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:08.004
and this is where we're actually writing out content

56
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:13.005
that makes up the response that we would like to provide.

57
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.009
So, this was a quick look at the HTTP Servlet request,

58
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:21.002
and HTTP Servlet response, and how they correspond

59
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.002
with HTTP messages.

60
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.009
We'll be working with these interfaces

61
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.000
quite extensively throughout our lessons.
