00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] When setting up a JPA project,

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.009
there are a few configurations that must be preformed.

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.002
The application must be set up to connect to a data source,

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.005
and a persistence unit must be configured.

5
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:17.002
Let's configure our EJB project to use JPA with an Eclipse.

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.000
Eclipse provides support for configuring JPA projects,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.008
which makes it pretty easy.

8
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:23.007
To get started,

9
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.001
we're just going to right-click on our project,

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.009
and then we can go to configure within the menu,

11
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.004
and select "Convert to JPA Project."

12
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.003
This will bring up a dialogue that allows us to select

13
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.008
our JPA version, and apply the project facet

14
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.000
to our EJB project.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So just click on "Finish,"

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.008
and you'll notice that when we do that,

17
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:52.000
we're going to get a persistence.xml file

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.005
within our project.

19
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.008
That persistence.xml file

20
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:01.005
has some GUI support within Eclipse that allows us

21
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:05.003
to specify information such as the connection.

22
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.009
Now in our case, we're going to be using

23
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.001
a in-memory database found within WildFly,

24
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.009
so data source is already registered in

25
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.006
the application server and it has a JNDI name

26
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:21.006
that we can leverage out of the box.

27
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.004
Now if you were configuring another data source

28
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:29.008
such as Oracle or maybe MySQL, you would need to configure

29
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.009
the driver, the URL, and then the username and password

30
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.000
for your database.

31
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.003
Now an important option that we need to configure

32
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:44.005
is the Schema generation, so within the JPA providers,

33
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.008
there's support for your DDL

34
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:51.002
to be created automatically within your databases.

35
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.008
This is okay when you're doing development

36
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.000
such as we are, just kind of exploring

37
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.008
or when you're doing initial development,

38
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:01.000
but once you connect this to an production database,

39
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.007
you want to make sure it's set to "None."

40
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:06.009
In our case, we're going to set it to "Drop and Create,"

41
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.008
and that's going to cause the JPA provider

42
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.004
to drop the tables each time we launch our application,

43
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.006
and then re-create them,

44
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.008
and it looks at the entity annotations

45
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:23.004
that we've provide in order to create those tables.

46
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:26.009
If we would like, we can specify other properties

47
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:32.000
that instruct the JPA provider on its behavior,

48
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
so those configuration properties

49
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.006
can be provided on this properties tab.

50
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.009
We don't have any to apply right now,

51
00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:43.000
so let's just go ahead, we'll save our systems.xml file,

52
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.006
and then we're going to go ahead

53
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:49.009
and we'll remove our project from the server

54
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:53.001
and then we can go ahead and restart it,

55
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:57.009
just to make sure everything's configured appropriately.

56
00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:01.005
Okay, we can see that our application starts up,

57
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:06.003
and here you can see the hibernate.jpa implementation,

58
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:11.000
actually doing some work in connecting to our database.
