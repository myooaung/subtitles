- [Instructor] JavaServer Pages,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.009
or JSP,

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.005
is a Java EE technology

4
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.002
that allows developers to easily build web pages

5
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.008
with dynamic content.

6
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.005
Most web pages are built using Dynamic Content

7
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:17.004
because it allows unique experiences for each visit

8
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.000
or visitor to a page.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here is the home page for another course of mine

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.007
on LinkedIn Learning.

11
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:25.003
Notice that the layout

12
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:29.001
and themeing of the page is consistent with other courses.

13
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:29.009
However,

14
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.002
there is content specific to this course.

15
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.009
Such as the course name

16
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.005
and information about what you will learn.

17
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.006
LinkedIn does not create a static HTML page

18
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.008
for every course.

19
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:41.006
Instead,

20
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.005
static content is templated for generic page elements

21
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.007
such as "Layout"

22
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.004
and then the dynamic content like "Course Information"

23
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:54.009
is intermixed to create a unique page for each course.

24
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:59.009
This concept can easily be applied within Java EE using JSP.

25
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.000
(soft clicking sound)

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.009
Here is a general look

27
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.003
at how JSP applications are patterned

28
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.007
using today's best practices.

29
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:08.009
In this pattern,

30
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.004
a browser passes HTTP requests to a servlet.

31
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.003
Which performs its logic

32
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.000
and then stores data into a model.

33
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.008
The servlet then passes the request to the JSP.

34
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:24.007
Which extracts the data from the model and intermixes it

35
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.006
within a template to generate a dynamic page

36
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.000
for the end user.

37
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.007
The pattern known as Model View Controller,

38
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.001
or MVC for short,

39
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.008
separates the three primary concerns

40
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.009
of building dynamic web pages to prevent code

41
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.007
from becoming unreadable and hard to maintain.

42
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:46.004
So we've talked about how JSP's are documents

43
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.003
that mix static content

44
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:52.002
with dynamic content using an MVC architecture.

45
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.000
Let's dive a little bit deeper.

46
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.008
When building a JSP page.. there are two syntax options:

47
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:01.001
JSP page

48
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.003
or JSP document.

49
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:08.008
The JSP document syntax.. enforces strict XML syntax.

50
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.009
And it can prevent co-mingling

51
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.004
of controller logic in the view.

52
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.009
The standard syntax is used more frequently.

53
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.004
However it does create the possibility for coupling

54
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.000
between MVC layers.

55
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.002
If you have a well-disciplined team or co-reviewed process,

56
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:30.006
it shouldn't be a problem to use the JSP page syntax.

57
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.000
Within JSP pages,

58
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
we can import tag libraries that define when usable JSP tags

59
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.006
that help us build the page.

60
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.004
Additionally,

61
00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:42.004
a simple expression language is available

62
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:44.004
that provides a concise syntax

63
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.005
for referencing model objects in the page.

64
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:51.001
This high-level overview gives you the over-arching concepts

65
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:55.000
that we'll be working with in JSP.
