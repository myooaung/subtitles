1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,530
in this video will move on to look at the other two functions,

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,450
which are available when you're working with acceptable in Excel,

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:26,750
filter XML and encode U R L So in zero fall Web service Filter XML the next part that's now

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:33,120
going to number three years in built XML and encode u R l To see how these two functions

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,650
work,

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,950
we're going to be using a Web service from a free website called Geo Names or Award.

7
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:46,200
Let's begin by opening up geo names dot txt And here we've got all the information that we

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,750
need to work with this free site,

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,050
and the first thing that you'll need to do is to sign up for a free account.

10
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,130
Has the U.

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,840
R L,

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,050
which you can do this.

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,400
So let's just copy that you are.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,840
L just move into your favorite browser and use the paste and go feature to get to that you

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,450
are l.

16
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,230
So the first time you visit the website,

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,100
we'll need to create a new user account.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,650
Just choose a user name.

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,530
No space is allowed,

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,440
and then just put your email,

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,430
confirm your email,

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,650
choose a password and confirm your password and then go ahead and create an account,

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,960
and the confirmation email will be sent through to the email address that you supplied.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,460
The email will look something like this,

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,930
and it will include an activation link so you simply click on the activation link to

26
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,350
activate your account.

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,270
Once he validated,

28
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,830
your account will automatically be logged in and thereafter.

29
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,610
Future.

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,900
You obviously can just click on the log in button,

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,050
put in your credentials and log in.

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,030
And then there's just one final step you need to perform on.

33
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,070
That is to going to manage account,

34
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,660
and you get to that by clicking on your user name in the top,

35
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,230
right,

36
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,960
you'll see you've got the two wings there.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,930
Want the logging out on the other,

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,650
which consists off your user name is the managed account link.

39
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,250
So you click on that,

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:26,250
and here you have the opportunity to change your user email and to change your password.

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,650
The thing that's most important for our purposes is to be able to use the free Web services

42
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:32,650
,

43
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,150
and to do that,

44
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,730
you have to click on this link at the bottom,

45
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,880
says you can see it,

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,840
says the account is not yet enabled to use three Web services.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,380
Click here to enable,

48
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,450
So we click on that and then we good to go.

49
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,750
So from now on,

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,930
we can use that free Web services.

51
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,010
There is a limit as to how many requests you can send that day,

52
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,510
but beyond that,

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,350
it's all free.

54
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,050
So we now click on Web service.

55
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,650
A Van Web service overview.

56
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,980
These were all the different Web services.

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,110
And of course,

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,980
the XML column is the one that we're interested in.

59
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,200
Because Excel doesn't offer an option to use Jason,

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,950
it only uses XML using the Web service function that we've seen.

61
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,810
So the Web service that we're interested in using it's postal code search,

62
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,710
which is you can see,

63
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,450
is available in both XML and Jason.

64
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,850
So let's click on that.

65
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,150
And here we have all the possible parameters that you can use with this Web service,

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,980
and if we go to the bottom,

67
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,180
we can find an example which we can use in Excel with the Web service function.

68
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,450
So that's just coping that,

69
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,550
and I'll add that to the text file.

70
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,480
And,

71
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,870
of course,

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,470
when using this girl,

73
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,040
you simply need to replace that user name demo with the user name that you chose when you

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,750
signed up to this service.

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,710
And,

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,060
of course,

77
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,500
the other thing will need to change is this.

78
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,750
We want to have different postal codes when we actually use this facility.

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,650
So let's leave the text file.

80
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,290
It's no open up the Excel file.

81
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,960
We're working with postal codes.

82
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,850
Example,

83
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,600
and inside it you'll find hotel information.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,260
So you've got the address of each hotel and then the rating,

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,200
the average rating given by our start members.

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,260
And let's say to completely solution,

87
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,350
we need tohave the latitude and longitude off each of these hotels,

88
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,850
and we're going to use a Web service to obtain this information.

89
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,850
Select at three new columns.

90
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,650
The first will contain the XML that we retreat from the Web service.

91
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,040
Then we want the latitude,

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:11,450
longitude and it's copied formats.

93
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:21,550
The logic of having a separate column for the XML is that both the latitude and longitude

94
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:30,070
can then be extracted from that one cell instead of embedding to Web service calls in each

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,350
of these two columns,

96
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,990
and this way of working becomes quite important.

97
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,650
If you're paying for every single call that you make to a given Web service.

98
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,070
So now let's put the Web service function equals Web service.

99
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,940
And as he saw in a previous video,

100
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,670
the only parameter is the URL,

101
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,450
which is a string on which we can just can't be from text file.

102
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,830
And before we do that,

103
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,250
I'm just gonna change the maximum number of rows toe one.

104
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,420
We don't really need that much detail,

105
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,390
since we're only interested in the latitude and longitude.

106
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,050
So we called you all of that,

107
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,660
paste it in,

108
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,250
and then we need to make a couple of changes.

109
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,280
First of all,

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,700
the postal code that we're looking up is the postal code from cell F two.

111
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,090
So we need to tag on to.

112
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,610
And this is where we use encode.

113
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,650
U R l What it does,

114
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,460
basically,

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,750
is to take your data on converted into a format which is Earl Legal.

116
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,770
In other words,

117
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:45,830
any characters which were illegal in a URL will be converted to their equivalents.

118
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,330
So,

119
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,150
for example,

120
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:54,370
spaces will be converted to percentage 20 so just not enough to we closed quotes,

121
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,560
then use ampersand.

122
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Then we use encode u R L click on it to close parentheses to end the function.

123
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,240
Now we need another ampersand on.

124
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,650
We reopen the quotation marks,

125
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,140
So the whole thing looks rather strange because,

126
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,530
of course,

127
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,100
we can an M percent inside this string.

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,590
But as you probably know,

129
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,050
1% a very common in you RL's where you're supplying parameter values.

130
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,320
Then,

131
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,660
of course,

132
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,300
the other change we need to make is to replace Demo with our user name.

133
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,210
Let me close quotes,

134
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,750
close parentheses and we're done.

135
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:51,800
We can then copy that formula down and each of the cells in column h will now contain a

136
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,250
slightly different XML document.

137
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,530
What I always like to do at this point is to copy one of these XML documents into a text

138
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,350
file so we can take a good look at the external structure.

139
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,940
So let's go back into the folder and create a text document,

140
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,450
and it's just rename it results dot xml.

141
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,590
Yes,

142
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,450
we do want to change the fine extension,

143
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,780
and then we can just open it and paste in our XML.

144
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,370
So here's our X terminal document.

145
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:37,950
We can lose the double quotes so you can see we have a Roose element of geo names.

146
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,010
And then it's got to child elements,

147
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,820
total result,

148
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,850
count and code.

149
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,750
So let's just select all of these and tap them in,

150
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:56,630
and then code has child elements that contain the data that we actually want.

151
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,210
So again,

152
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:03,470
let's just tap those in on the two bits of information we want their Agassi lacked on LNG.

153
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,550
So in terms of our experts statement,

154
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,980
we're gonna have three locations steps g,

155
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,140
other names code and then l a T or L N dri.

156
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,650
And in each case,

157
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:23,450
we maybe along the default child access so they can from parent to child each time.

158
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,580
So that's saved this document.

159
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:43,700
And now let's get back to excel so we can hide column H That's Desprez escaped to coming

160
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,150
out a copy mode and then create a formula.

161
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,080
So we've got equals Filter XML.

162
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,150
The first parameter is the XML,

163
00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:00,350
which is in our hidden cell H two on the second parameter is our expert statement which

164
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,050
goes inside double quotes.

165
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,880
For an absolute experts statement,

166
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,780
you always start with a forward slash,

167
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:14,220
which represents the root of the XML file and then you put your location steps so first,

168
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,940
as we said,

169
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,250
was geo names.

170
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,690
Then we had code and then the latitude is L.

171
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:28,130
A T close quotes clothes for embassies on.

172
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,350
We can just copy this entire formula because the longitude is virtually the same.

173
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:50,430
So let's just paste it in for longitude a man change L A t soup LNG and we could to get So

174
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,000
we can now coffee this formula down for every road on because basically,

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,600
you know,

176
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,650
hidden call him.

177
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,850
We return in a slightly different XML result on each road,

178
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,250
the experts statement is retrieving a different value each time.

179
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:14,640
So that's our first look at using expert statements with the filter XML function on.

180
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,620
Just remind you,

181
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:23,670
we have these three locations steps in each case we use in two off the three possible

182
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,650
components we use in the access on the no test.

183
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,040
We're not using the optional predicated.

184
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,510
It will come to that later.

185
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,390
And as I said,

186
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,880
because the child access is the default,

187
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
it's normally admitted.

188
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,380
So if you did want to write it in,

189
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,200
it would be child colon,

190
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,950
colon in each of these three cases,

191
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,650
so we'll see you get exactly the same result.

192
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,940
But if course because child is the default axis,

193
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,250
it's always omitted.

194
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,050
So let's just undo.

195
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:07,990
Although the Filter XML function is normally used in conjunction with the Web service

196
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,700
function,

197
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,450
it's also possible to use it on local XML files.

198
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,250
I will take a look at doing just that in the next video.
