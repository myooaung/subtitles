00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.380
Let's continue to work our way into the Excel object model by looking at the work seat.

2
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.940
Object Number 10.

3
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.450
It's no open 06 displaying worksheet properties in this model.

4
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.950
We want to display some work read stance.

5
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.520
So first of all,

6
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.450
we want to display the total number of worksheets currently in the workbook.

7
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.250
And then we want to put some information on each of those sheets.

8
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.850
So the first thing is,

9
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
we want to conditionally display that information,

10
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.250
starting with the seat number.

11
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.350
So the way upset this up is that we have one as the first treat position because you can't

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.300
delete Aled the seats in a workbook.

13
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.550
You have to have one work street there and then below that.

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.890
We've got a simple Excel formula,

15
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:13.940
which checks to see whether the cell above plus one is less than all report to the value

16
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.510
currently in a to the number of worksheets.

17
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.250
If it is,

18
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.130
then we display the cell above,

19
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.390
plus ones in this case,

20
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.750
we would display it to,

21
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.530
but if it's not,

22
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.750
we display nothing.

23
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.350
And then I just wrapped that insight and if error statements,

24
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.470
so you can think there is an error.

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.650
We display nothing.

26
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.450
So if I just type in 12 in here,

27
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.120
you'll see that the 12 numbers now appear and I've only gone down as Faras 15.

28
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.770
Obviously,

29
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.980
we could just keep dragging this formula down,

30
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.260
but 15 fits nicely on my screen,

31
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.450
so that's the way that set up.

32
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.650
We now want to create three user defined functions to complete the model.

33
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.690
So here we want a function,

34
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.150
which will calculate the number of sheets currently in the workbook.

35
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.860
Here We want to function,

36
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.410
which will pick up the sheet name based on the position name of seat one,

37
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.070
name a fleet to and so forth.

38
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.770
And finally,

39
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.150
we want to display the used range,

40
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.350
so they used range of this worksheet.

41
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.310
As you can see,

42
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.710
it always starts from a one on.

43
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.850
Then it stresses its faras column C and Rowe 19 So the use range will be a one colon C 19.

44
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.240
So we need to write three functions.

45
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.750
Let's go into developer visual basic,

46
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.550
and we insert a module in this workbook.

47
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.490
Let's rename the module worksheet stats.

48
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.530
So I m work,

49
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.350
read stats there,

50
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.450
and then it's like in the code window to activate it and go to insert procedure,

51
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.530
procedure,

52
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.550
type function,

53
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.550
and it's called the function worksheet count.

54
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:23.150
It won't require any input,

55
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.050
but we have to specify its output using the key what eyes?

56
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.200
And it's gonna output a whole number on the standard data type in B B A for whole number is

57
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.830
long,

58
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.010
as in long indigent.

59
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.420
Another command that you'll find useful when you're writing you to define function is

60
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.850
application dot volatile.

61
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.430
And what this means is that your work seat gumption will recalculate whenever any cell

62
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.350
within the workbook is calculated.

63
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.560
And this is useful where you have a worksheet function that's going to go into several

64
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.650
different cells.

65
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.650
So in our model,

66
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.540
well,

67
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.550
obviously want all of these cells to update.

68
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.690
If someone,

69
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.580
for example,

70
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.850
deletes a worksheet,

71
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.650
so I use an application not volatile.

72
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.950
Within our function,

73
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.550
we can make our functions as interactive as possible.

74
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:31.850
So that's the first line Will could application dot Volatile is a method rather than a

75
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.650
property.

76
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.750
If we just delete it and put it back in again,

77
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.850
you'll see that when I type it,

78
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.010
it has that green icon next to it,

79
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.770
which indicates that it's a method.

80
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.410
The method is basically a function just like an Excel worksheet function on.

81
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.870
As with Excel functions,

82
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.990
most methods take parameters or arguments to specify the argument for a function in V B.

83
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.350
A.

84
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.860
You put a space excelled in obligingly displays the names of all the arguments which that

85
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.050
function takes.

86
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.600
In this case,

87
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.950
as with excels built in worksheet functions,

88
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.350
we can see that the parameter has square brackets around it,

89
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.420
and this means that it's emotional.

90
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.870
However,

91
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.770
let's put it in so I can show you the syntax that you use when you're specifying the

92
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.810
arguments or a function.

93
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:35.280
Best practice is to put the name of the argument so volatile is we can see and then put

94
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.750
colon equals and the value that applies to that argument.

95
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.670
So this is clearly a 1,000,000,000 value,

96
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.250
and we want to set it to truth.

97
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.700
And,

98
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.650
as you can probably guess,

99
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.820
true is the default.

100
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.190
So if we were to admit it,

101
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.650
we get the same results.

102
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.910
That's just to demonstrate how we write arguments for functions or methods as they call in

103
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.710
League B A.

104
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.940
And now let's specify the return value for our function so as we've seen before.

105
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.180
If the function returns data which this one does,

106
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.370
it returns an insurgent.

107
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:18.350
We used the key word let in the name of the function equal.

108
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.950
And then we specify a calculation will statement which returns the correct type of data.

109
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:31.440
So here we want to find out the number of sheets in this workbook.

110
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.350
In other words,

111
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.450
the workbook that contains this function.

112
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.460
So we use application.

113
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.540
No,

114
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:44.480
this workbook don't work seats and then don't count.

115
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.720
So we've drawn into the hierarchy,

116
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.650
starting with excellent soul down to this workbook,

117
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.650
looking at the worksheets collection inside it.

118
00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.490
That's all the work treats it contains on menus in the Count property to find out how many

119
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.050
there are.

120
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:09.000
And the count will obviously return an indigent a whole number hence which specified that

121
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.060
this worksheet returns a long interview.

122
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:25.700
Let's just test it so we can just type equal work leads count?

123
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.910
Yes,

124
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.690
and so And we have one.

125
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.100
So so far,

126
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.650
so good.

127
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.550
Let's write our next function.

128
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:40.810
Now we want the name off our worksheet against that.

129
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.400
Another function procedure,

130
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.700
Brooksie name on.

131
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.350
The key difference here is that we do need an input.

132
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.830
We need to know the number,

133
00:07:53.830 --> 00:08:00.760
the position or that particular workbook that we want the name on little cool,

134
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.110
that prime minister position.

135
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.140
And,

136
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.840
of course,

137
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.670
it's an integer.

138
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.430
The worksheet name,

139
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.190
however,

140
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.230
is a string,

141
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:19.280
so the function returns a string again.

142
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.330
We'll use application of all the time,

143
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.690
and I'm using controlled drag to copy that line into the new function.

144
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:34.920
Let's now take this opportunity to put a reference to a work feet inside a variable.

145
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.400
This is something we haven't had to do before,

146
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.550
so let's declare a variable for holding a worksheet.

147
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.260
As always,

148
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.150
it's dim.

149
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.150
And then I'm going to use the prefix wks for worksheet,

150
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.680
and I'll just call it W cast targets as well.

151
00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:01.290
She's to put a reference inside wks worksheet.

152
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:11.620
We use scent in contrast to let so let container equal is used for making a data ass IG

153
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.250
Nation.

154
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.280
You're what incident data into a data container.

155
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.430
What we doing here?

156
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.850
Within a reference to an excel object.

157
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:29.940
So that's why we use set as opposed to let so said wks target equal to and then we're

158
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.980
drilling down inside application.

159
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:41.150
Not this workbook don't work feats and to specify which one.

160
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.360
We just use parentheses and inside the parentheses,

161
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.050
we can either specify a name or a number.

162
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.430
And of course,

163
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.520
our function has asked for a number,

164
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.300
which is the position off the worksheet.

165
00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:00.350
So we can use that as our index inside the parentheses.

166
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:11.150
So we can now put our return statements what we want to let worksheets name equal.

167
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.520
And of course,

168
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.020
it is a let because works.

169
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.350
The name is a string.

170
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:29.160
So let's work seat name equal wks targets don't name,

171
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:40.450
and then let's test equals work seat name.

172
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.580
And this time we need to specify a parameter.

173
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.850
A useful thing you can do,

174
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.300
which we've done a couple of times,

175
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.730
is,

176
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.270
of course,

177
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.990
to insert function.

178
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.000
And the benefit of that is that your prompted.

179
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.080
If there is an argument or several arguments required,

180
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.090
you're always planted as to what they are.

181
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.550
So we just click on the cell that contains the position,

182
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.070
which is a five,

183
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.090
and then we get the name off work sleep one,

184
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.610
which is,

185
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.120
of course,

186
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.390
the website were already in used range is gonna be a virtually identical.

187
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:20.380
So I'm gonna copy all of this and use that as my starting point.

188
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.050
Change the name of the function two news range.

189
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.610
And then,

190
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.480
of course,

191
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.850
we're returning used range as opposed to worksheet name.

192
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.560
And then the final thing is,

193
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.060
the property that we're home in in on is the use range.

194
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.250
Don't use range,

195
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.590
but used range is a range.

196
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.550
It's not a string,

197
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.050
so you can't just put a range into a cell in Excel.

198
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.510
It's not textual,

199
00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:00.370
so we've got to drill down inside the used range on Find the address on.

200
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:00.910
As you can see,

201
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.100
this is a property,

202
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.460
and,

203
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.820
of course,

204
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.950
it's just a string.

205
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:12.950
So let's test equals used range.

206
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.350
Um,

207
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.060
work feeds one treatment pickup.

208
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.830
They fine,

209
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.960
and that gives us our address.

210
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.190
Now,

211
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:24.530
of course,

212
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.480
if we copy this town before we've actually got a position,

213
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.450
we'll end up with errors.

214
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.450
If I just copy it down ones,

215
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.830
you'll see because there is no work.

216
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.090
She,

217
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.630
too.

218
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:43.720
We get that value era so we can just do what we've done here and wrap out formula inside

219
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.150
and if error statements.

220
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.010
So,

221
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.550
yeah,

222
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.250
after the equal sign,

223
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.050
we just put if error,

224
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.130
Then,

225
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.000
after the original formula we put comma,

226
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.340
double quotes,

227
00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:09.830
double quotes to indicate blank on that would do the same thing here that will close little

228
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.710
quotes.

229
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.940
So now it's safe to company this all the way down on.

230
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.140
Because all these cells are filled with formula,

231
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.350
I can just double quick.

232
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.580
So without the affair,

233
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.690
we would be getting error values in here.

234
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:31.150
What we've done with the if era is to replace them with the non string.

235
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.230
So let's introduce some more work feats.

236
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.830
If we get back into the training boulder,

237
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.350
I've got some extra sheets.

238
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.250
06 extra streets.

239
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.850
Let's move them all across something.

240
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.960
Hold down the shift key.

241
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.660
The 1st 1 is ready selected.

242
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.360
I hold down shift,

243
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.450
click on the last that selects all of them.

244
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.020
And then I can just right click Movil copy.

245
00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:01.130
Choose the name of my other work ST 06 on.

246
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:08.850
Move them to the end in They will go there when I get back to my worksheet stance.

247
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.620
Terrible.

248
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.880
My new seats.

249
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.170
These are the names of the feats,

250
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.090
and then I can check the used range of each one
