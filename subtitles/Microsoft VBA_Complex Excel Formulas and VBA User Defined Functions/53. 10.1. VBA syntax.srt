1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,150
we've now reached section 10 of the course,

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,600
so let's go into this section 10 older on what would be doing in this section is to look

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,150
more closely at the key aspects of right in the B A code.

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,210
Let's begin by discussing the first thing that you're gonna need to get to grips with,

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,250
which is B B A syntax.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,940
So let's open up 01 BBs in tax,

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,280
which is a Pdf file.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,050
And if lightly your PdF so open with Adobe Acrobat,

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,450
you can just catch a view Bull Street mode.

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,290
Well,

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,450
press control L.

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,350
BB is a fully fledged programming language,

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,050
and it has a series of features which are common to all programming languages.

14
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,850
This table is the key syntactical elements of B B A.

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,250
And as we encounter these elements in our code,

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,150
I'll keep referring back to this chart.

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:15,440
I'll recommend that you do is saying each line of code that you write in B B A will fall

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,210
into one of these categories.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,950
Now we've obviously just stomach did so we haven't really done very much,

20
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,670
but let's look at the features that we have encountered so far.

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,120
Festival.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:37,270
We've encountered procedure declaration that's just come out of full screen mode for a

23
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,590
moment by pressing Escape and go back into the train in Boulder.

24
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:54,870
Hold on nine and 03 We wrote our first user defined function that we're going to The

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,850
developments happened.

26
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,150
Click on visual Basic.

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,460
This basically is a procedure declaration,

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,220
and it remember we went insert procedure and then chose the type of procedure which was

29
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,850
function.

30
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:16,190
So the two lines of code relating to procedure declaration that we've encountered and which

31
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,190
,

32
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,770
applying to the creation of user defined functions,

33
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,150
this line,

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,300
public function,

35
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,550
name of function,

36
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:31,490
her embassies containing optional arguments and then a declaration of the type of value

37
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,650
produced by the function using the ask he were.

38
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,260
And then the other line that relates to procedure Declaration is,

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,940
of course,

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,250
the end function,

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,990
which indicates the termination of that particular function.

42
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,560
Because,

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,020
of course,

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,350
there's nothing to stop you put in other macros and other functions within this same model

45
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,350
.

46
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,350
We also encountered comments,

47
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,580
comments or simply lines of code,

48
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,230
which you insert a clarification both for your own benefits and for the benefit of anyone

49
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,990
else looking at your code as well as placing comments on their own line.

50
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,070
You can also place a comment at the end of the line.

51
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,980
So here,

52
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,980
for example,

53
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,550
I can just hit the space bar.

54
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,250
But in apostrophe,

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,070
which remember,

56
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,750
is the signal for a comment.

57
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,750
And then I can simply say procedure declaration.

58
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,460
When I move away from the line,

59
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,400
Excel will change the color of the comment,

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,540
which is quite useful.

61
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,510
It makes them stand out another nice feature,

62
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,250
by the ways,

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,630
when you've got toe a lot of code,

64
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,130
and when you're debugging when something's not working,

65
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,650
you can simply highlight a line of code.

66
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,950
If you remember,

67
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,200
these two lines are treated as one line because they got the space.

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,010
Underscore the continuation character At the end of the first line,

69
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,290
I can highlight any line or lines of code on.

70
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:00,630
Then,

71
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,040
in the editing toolbar,

72
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,050
which is here,

73
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,930
I just remind you,

74
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,330
the old school method.

75
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,550
If the editing toolbar weren't visible,

76
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,550
just right click into edit to make it visible.

77
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,080
Well,

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,790
that's a view to bars on Giuseppe from there.

79
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,350
So on the Edit toolbar has this feature called a comment look.

80
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,990
So if I highlight some lines of code and click on comment block that effectively disables

81
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,300
those lines of code so I can focus on something else.

82
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,350
And then when I want them back again,

83
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,340
obviously next door has the uncommon command.

84
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,750
The other thing we've seen is assignment off data value,

85
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,750
and that's indicated by the keyword less.

86
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,110
As I've said,

87
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,450
Let is actually optional so most people admitted.

88
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,100
But it's useful when you'll learn inmediato.

89
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,870
Always use it so that you remind yourself off what's taken place on that particular line of

90
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,450
code.

91
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:10,290
So the assignment of a data value means that on objects,

92
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:19,350
which is essentially a container for ordinary data which means text or string base numbers

93
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,350
,

94
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:26,010
these are ordinary pieces of data as opposed to excel objects such as worksheets,

95
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,950
cell ranges,

96
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,750
etcetera.

97
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:35,710
So the ASIC nation of a data value involves place in the appropriate type of value into

98
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,650
that container.

99
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,090
So in this case,

100
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,250
the container is the function itself.

101
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:48,150
But the function is essentially a string simply by sane after the function name as a string

102
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,150
.

103
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,900
We're saying that the sole purpose in life of this function is to produce a piece of text,

104
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,750
a string.

105
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,110
So what we did on this line is a signing the string,

106
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,180
which is on the right hand side of the equal sign to the object or container,

107
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,350
which is on the left of the equal side.

108
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,090
And that's the way that the assignments operation always works.

109
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,580
Whatever is on the right of the hole is being placed inside whatever is on the left of the

110
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,350
equal sign.

111
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,750
So let's put one more comment into that effect.

112
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:34,530
Apostrophe assignment or days of value and then in print diseases weaken,

113
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,750
say string.

114
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,450
So the key thing to remember is what I mean by data is the kind of thing that can actually

115
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:50,530
go inside and excel Cell a date number piece of text on the big contrast that you've got to

116
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,630
get used to when your programming in B B.

117
00:06:52,630 --> 00:07:00,150
A is the distinction between these ordinary pieces of data on references to excel objects.

118
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,600
So whenever you're working with ordinary pieces of data used,

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,590
the key word let and as we'll see later,

120
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,750
when you come to work with references to excel objects such as worksheets and workbooks,

121
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,850
you use the opposite keyword set.

122
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,440
That's a far as we've got without look at B B A syntax.

123
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,490
We've just started to scratch the surface,

124
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,990
but as I said,

125
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:32,020
I will keep coming back to this chart so that we can just keep track off the different

126
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,950
syntactical elements that you need to get used to.
