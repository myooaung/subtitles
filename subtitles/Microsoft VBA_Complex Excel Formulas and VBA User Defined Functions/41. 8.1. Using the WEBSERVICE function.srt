1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,310
Microsoft excels.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,750
Web service function is used to get an external response from a Web service.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:24,340
A Web service is an application designed to deliver a particular type of information to any

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,140
client who requested when the request is made.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,570
Parameter values are normally supply,

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,150
which determine the result generated.

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:40,060
It's very similar to simply visit in a Web U R L and having a Web application which

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,050
supplies content to you.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,350
The big difference is that a Web service is designed to supply content not to humans,

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,400
but to another application.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,750
So in this case,

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,670
that other application is excel on.

13
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,890
The mechanism that we're using is the Web service function.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,750
We specify the Earl of the Web service application,

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,550
and normally that girl has embedded in it.

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:13,420
One mobile parameters on the Web service as a result of the request,

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,890
produces an XML response and then delivers that into the cell,

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,250
which contains the Web service function.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,970
Web services can deliver other types of content apart from XML.

20
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,390
But in the case of Microsoft Excel,

21
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,810
XML is the only response which is understood.

22
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,390
So in using excels Web service function,

23
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,850
you can only work with Web services capable of producing an XML response.

24
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:48,310
So let's take an example in the training folder will now working in zero for Web service

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,580
filled,

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,950
exhale exposed.

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,050
And that's going to fold one using the Web service function.

28
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,450
Now let's examine our example international pricing that's open that.

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,380
And in this example,

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,850
we have a series of prices using GDP as the base currency.

31
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:14,490
We want to be able to translate those prices into all of these different currencies,

32
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,910
using up to date conversion rates.

33
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,270
So what we want to do with the Web service function is defined a Web service which will

34
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,410
give us the conversion rate from GBP.

35
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,220
$2 euros,

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,100
Canadian dollars,

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,900
etcetera.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,270
So let's now return to the training folder.

39
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,360
And if you open up the text vocal Wandell software for this demonstration,

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,950
we're going to use Mondor dot walk as our Web service supplier.

41
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,150
And the reason to do in this is that they have a 14 day triable service,

42
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,860
which allows you to make a limited number of requests to their Web service.

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,250
So the first thing we'll need to do is to sign up,

44
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,650
so just copy this sign up.

45
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,490
You are L and Paste it into your browser using paste and go and then just fill out the

46
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,550
information and click on request demo key now.

47
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,210
And if all is well,

48
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,250
within a few minutes,

49
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,840
you should receive an email like this one which contains an A p I key.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:41,380
So I'm just gonna copy this a p i and paste it into note pad so that would just need to

51
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,900
know the u r L that we need to access when we use in Excels Web service function.

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,960
So we go across to the website,

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,050
click on the link on the left here,

54
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,300
currency exchange rates,

55
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:03,640
XML Web service and then just click on this web ap I access link on the first.

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:12,710
You are role that we see here gives us all the information that we need and it gives us a

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,890
breakdown of the six components to that You are l on.

58
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,220
What we have to remember basically is that the base currency comes first.

59
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,840
So in our example,

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,750
obviously the base currency will be UK price.

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,980
Then comes the target currency and then components five and six.

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,450
You'll notice that both optional So in our case it will simply omit them the amount of

63
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,890
convert defaults toe one and the date of conversion defaults to the current date.

64
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,550
So that's exactly what we want.

65
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,450
So we can just copy the first part of the URL admitting the last two sections.

66
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,650
I'll just face that here as well.

67
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:10,500
That and save my changes.

68
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,180
So now we're ready to use the Web service function in Excel.

69
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,700
Let's start with USD.

70
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,240
I have the u.

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,830
R l still on the clipboard,

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,180
so I can just tie equals Web service and the girl is a string.

73
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,840
So it has to go in double quotes,

74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,050
double quotes,

75
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,760
and I can just paste it in close quotes,

76
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,750
close brackets and presenter.

77
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,100
And of course,

78
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,770
the thing that I forgot to do was to put in my keys.

79
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,950
I left this sort of default key in there.

80
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,530
I obviously need to replace that with the A p I key that they supply to me.

81
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,400
So let's just go back on,

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,450
grab that,

83
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:02,850
just paste it in here.

84
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:08,650
It's now we should be good to go and we have a price.

85
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:16,140
Let me just widen this soul so that we can see the result on then see what we need to do

86
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,840
before we can actually use this value so we can see that in this case the Web service

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,350
actually returns the value that we want.

88
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,350
The only problem is that the value is quoted.

89
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:34,220
So all we need to do to get our calculations to work is to remove the quotation marks on.

90
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,900
We can do that using excels,

91
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,300
substitute function.

92
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,220
So around our Web service,

93
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:48,160
let's put the substitute function and use that to remove the double quotes so equal

94
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,050
substitute.

95
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,070
The Web service function is the first argument.

96
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,660
In other words,

97
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,450
the text.

98
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,190
We put a comma at the end.

99
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,520
Now we supply the old text in other words,

100
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,860
the text we want to remove and that text has to go in double quotes.

101
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,240
Which raises the question.

102
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,960
How do you put double quotes inside double quotes?

103
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,890
I don't know if you've ever had to do this,

104
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,530
but basically you double up.

105
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,580
So you put two double quotes to represent double close.

106
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,250
Hence we put open quotation marks,

107
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,870
two double quotes,

108
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,750
close quotation marks,

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,100
so four double quotes in total coma.

110
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,570
What do we want to replace them with?

111
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,560
Nothing.

112
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:35,230
So we simply put open and close double quotes to indicate the mold stream close brackets.

113
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,570
And,

114
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,830
as you can see once the quotation marks have gone even though,

115
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,870
strictly speaking,

116
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,290
we still have a text value because the text value consists of numbers only Excel

117
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,810
automatically converted to a numeric value and uses it to perform the calculation.

118
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,330
So I'm just gonna reinstate the Marrow column with so you can see all the different

119
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,450
currency rates.

120
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:07,250
And then the final thing we need to do is to modify the default formula.

121
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,940
So it's not using euro and us deep,

122
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:19,210
but it's using G V P as the source and then picking up the conversion currency from the

123
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,650
cell above the cell containing the formula.

124
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,790
Simple way of doing that is to festival,

125
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,760
delete euro and replace it with GBP.

126
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,720
Then we delete USD.

127
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,070
But this time we need to replace USD with the contents of this cell above the cell

128
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,230
containing the formula.

129
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,380
So to do that,

130
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,050
we close quotation marks,

131
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,010
then put an empress end but can cast a nation and click on the cell above which in this

132
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,290
case is J two,

133
00:08:52,290 --> 00:09:00,200
so that picks up the currency in that cell Then we put another empress end and then open

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,350
quotation marks.

135
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,350
So you just insert in that variable string into the URL.

136
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,450
So when we press enter,

137
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,650
our calculation should now actually be the correct one.

138
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,170
And what we now do is just to copy that formula.

139
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,050
It's of the rights,

140
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:25,960
and because there are no dollar signs were always picking up whatever currency is in the

141
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,750
cell above the cell that contains our formula.

142
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,520
So that's an example of using excels Web service function.

143
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,040
And on this occasion,

144
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,180
the result that was produced was,

145
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:37,720
in fact,

146
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,150
the result that we needed.

147
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,740
In most cases,

148
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,320
however,

149
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,360
the Web service function returns an XML document containing a hierarchy of elements and

150
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,150
attributes,

151
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,190
and you then need to use a second function,

152
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,250
filter XML to navigate within that structure and extract the data that you need.

153
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,180
So in the next video,

154
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,250
we'll move on to look at working with the Filter XML function
