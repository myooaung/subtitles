1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Let's end.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,150
I'll look at manipulating numbers by looking at XL's large and small functions.

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:22,250
06 manipulating numbers that's open 06 using large,

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,750
small and count A.

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,090
In this example,

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,130
we have a series of sales figures,

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,300
ruled out claims and,

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,710
in our summary work leads,

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,350
were interested in displaying the top 10 spenders on the bottom 10 spenders.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:45,250
And this is exactly what XL's large and small functions will enable you to do and for a bit

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,610
of further practice will do three versions about summary and with each new version,

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,450
will introduce another level of complexity.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,250
Begin with you had a bit of charity to the formulas will create.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,650
Let's create some named Ranges,

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,950
since we've only got whole columns,

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:11,280
I'll see next hole and then go across to the Formulas tab and in the defined names group,

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,550
click on Create From Selection.

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,610
Yeah,

19
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:21,000
especially find that the names to be used in the top row only now let me kick Okay,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,050
Excel creates our names,

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,750
and we can then use these names in our formulas in preference to the rule cell references.

22
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,850
So let's begin by having a look at the syntax of the large and small functions.

23
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,850
The syntax for both functions is identical.

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,050
Each function takes two arguments.

25
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,480
Festival.

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,450
You have the array,

27
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,290
and this is normally a single column containing numbers or sometimes dates within which you

28
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,270
want to find the largest second largest,

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,950
etcetera.

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,690
So in our case,

31
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,870
it's going to be the total.

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,850
Spend a column.

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:10,350
The second argument K allows you to specify the nature of the value that you want to

34
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,950
retreat.

35
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,690
How close to being the largely shouldn't be second,

36
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,210
largest,

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,640
third largest or if you were using the small function second,

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,590
smallest third smallest,

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,350
etcetera.

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,750
So let's complete summary version one the simplest of the three.

41
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,390
And to make this one really simple,

42
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,150
what we've done is to insert a new married column,

43
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,740
which essentially has the K number.

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,750
The second argument of the large ins all functions.

45
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,810
So the large will be working in ascending order,

46
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:52,650
iced first and then for small will work in descending order 10 from smallest at the top on

47
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,050
the very smallest at the bottom,

48
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,050
so the large function will be used to calculate the total,

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,950
and then once we've got that total,

50
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:10,830
we can use index and match to find out the client you spend that amount formula is going to

51
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:19,630
be equals large and for our Arabian Goto formulas using formula on,

52
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,850
pick up total spend coma and then for the K argument,

53
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:36,480
you just click on Self a two and then we can just copy that down on the K argument is

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
always being picked up from the first column.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,910
So we get largest,

56
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,780
second largest,

57
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,450
etcetera,

58
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:53,190
and we can copy this formula to save a bit of time for the small equivalent on.

59
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,650
Firstly,

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:53,960
changed,

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,670
the function names a small and secondly,

62
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,990
we change the K reference to call in half.

63
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,850
And then we can call me this one down,

64
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,650
10 smallest all the way down to smallest.

65
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,450
So now that we've extracted these figures,

66
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,450
we can simply look in sales.

67
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,650
Find the client who spent that month,

68
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,450
and then we can use index and match to pull back the name of the client.

69
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:39,250
Let's just have a quick review of how in Nexen match work when index and matter used

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,110
together to look up.

71
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,650
A value index is always the outer function,

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,050
and it takes two arguments.

73
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,370
First of all,

74
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,980
we have the array within which you're looking for.

75
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,050
A particular value in our case is going to be the client column,

76
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,570
and secondly,

77
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,950
you have the road number.

78
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,650
This is supplied by Ness in the match function.

79
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,150
The match function needs a look up value.

80
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,860
In this case,

81
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,850
it's going to be D to That's the total Spend column in our summary worksheet,

82
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,750
and we specially find the look up Ray.

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,570
And that will be the total Spend column within our sales work.

84
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,080
She's and then finally,

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,530
we have the optional argument match type,

86
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,550
and we wouldn't want zero for an exact match.

87
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,950
So let's expand the formula.

88
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,770
So any equals,

89
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,850
index enter.

90
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,950
And the first argument the array will be the client Cullen,

91
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,550
which we have named the client coma.

92
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,970
All enter and then for the road number.

93
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,220
The second argument we nest,

94
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,940
the match function Look up.

95
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:12,190
Value will be D to coma and the look up array within which we certain for D to will be the

96
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,750
total Spend column coma.

97
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,650
We're looking for an exact match.

98
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:33,030
Closed parenthesis to end match old enter on the closing premises to end index and then we

99
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:41,550
can just double quick to copy this down and copy the formula to the bottom 10 spenders.

100
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:54,320
And all we have to change is D two,

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,350
which now becomes I to.

102
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:05,950
So when we test it,

103
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,850
we should see Kobe at the top on Ashton Western at the very bottom.

104
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,950
Then they all the high spenders on the list.

105
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:28,150
So that's the basic version of how summary.

106
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,890
In the next video,

107
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:36,200
we'll do a slightly more complex example where we haven't got that convenient column with

108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,890
number,

109
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,950
which can then be referenced by the large and small functions.
