00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.250
Although the Filter XML function is designed to work with Web services,

2
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.990
you may occasionally find it convenient to use it with your local XML files in this video.

3
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.150
We'll look at a work around for doing that.

4
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.050
It's going to sub folder for using Filter XML with local XML files.

5
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.730
Let's open up.

6
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.250
The Excel file will be working with expense claims.

7
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.050
So here we've got a bunch of expense claims by staff members.

8
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.680
We want to do the equivalent of a V look up to find out the I.

9
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
D first name and last name off the head of department.

10
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.150
But we want to do this from an XML file.

11
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.810
Obviously,

12
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.860
in some scenarios you'll be able to simply import the XML file into a table on then USVI

13
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.110
look up index match as appropriate to pull across the data that you need.

14
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.850
But as we've seen,

15
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.250
the whole XML files lend themselves to being imported into an Excel table.

16
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.300
So there will be times where it's more convenient to connect to the XML file externally and

17
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.360
then to use the Filter XML to pull in data from different parts of that XML structure.

18
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.520
There are a couple of limitations.

19
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.280
So let's have a look of the work around that we're gonna use.

20
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.750
Let's create a new work Feet called XML Connections.

21
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:51.280
And the first thing I need to tell you is that this work around has one key limitation.

22
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.850
And that is because we use in Filter XML,

23
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
which takes us its first parameter.

24
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.050
An XML document.

25
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:10.320
The XML file that we connect to can't have more than 32,767 characters because that's the

26
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.300
maximum number of characters which will fit within a cell in Microsoft.

27
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.450
Excel on for the Filter XML function to be used.

28
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.450
We have to have the entire XML document in one cell.

29
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.850
So we go across the data,

30
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.800
the feature that we use it,

31
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.400
get external data and we simply connects to the XML file as a text file on this operational

32
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.640
course,

33
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.350
excel to import the XML,

34
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.190
and under normal circumstances,

35
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.250
it will take up several rows.

36
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.350
What we want to do is to have it all imported into a single cell.

37
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.750
So the first work around is to use what's called a mini fide XML file.

38
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.950
Let's go back into the train in folder so you can see what this means.

39
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.420
Here's the XML file that will be connecting to Head Start XML.

40
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.810
But as I've said,

41
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.400
if we import this,

42
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.050
it's gonna be imported on lots of different rose rather than into a single cell.

43
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.000
So what we've done is to convert it into what's called a min ified XML File one with all

44
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.510
the spaces taken out.

45
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.690
So we open up heads,

46
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.460
many fight.

47
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.550
It's exactly the same document.

48
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.440
But as you can see,

49
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.920
all the returns,

50
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.070
tabs and spaces between the elements have been removed.

51
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.910
So it's just one long string.

52
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.690
This means that when you connect to a text file in this format,

53
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.550
it all comes in into a single cell.

54
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.520
So it's close.

55
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.850
Both of these let's get back to excel and connect to the mini fine version.

56
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.470
So in the data tab of the ribbon,

57
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.160
we go sue,

58
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.340
get external data from text against this workout,

59
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.990
waiting to fold it.

60
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:15.230
Number four view files a man connect to heads many find because we treating it as a text

61
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.730
file.

62
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.050
The text import was it appears so in step one.

63
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:28.610
We specify the Limited instead to will say that the delimit er is other without specifying

64
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.250
what it is.

65
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.810
And just in case,

66
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.350
let's say that the text qualifier is none,

67
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.960
and then instead,

68
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.880
three we can choose.

69
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.140
Text is the full amount,

70
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.030
then we click on finish before clicking.

71
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.420
OK,

72
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.100
it's a good idea to have a look at the properties because there's one property which is

73
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.350
rather irritation,

74
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.050
and that is that every time you refresh the Data York wanted to specify the location of the

75
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.550
file.

76
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.880
No idea why that's the default,

77
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.150
but let's switch it off.

78
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.180
And then,

79
00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.980
as you can see,

80
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.740
you can specify the frequency of the refresh,

81
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.350
and you can specify to repress the data every time you open the file.

82
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.140
The data formats and,

83
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.660
of course,

84
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.930
won't supply because we're not bringing this in in a tabular format.

85
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.150
We're bringing it into a single cell,

86
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.560
so it's like,

87
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.410
OK,

88
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.950
when we click OK again.

89
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.260
The entire document is now being brought into a single cell.

90
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.050
If I go out to the home tab and speech onward ramp,

91
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.050
we can see our many fine XML format.

92
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.350
There are several websites available which will create a unified version off your XML.

93
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.790
We go into the training folder.

94
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.450
I have the Earl of one of them XML many fire.

95
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.630
So if you want to experiment with this feature,

96
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.750
just visit this u R L Paste in the original XML.

97
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.340
So I got many fine and you'll have a unifying version off your file toe work with.

98
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.850
So now that we have our XML in a single cell,

99
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.150
we can go back to expenses and use Filter XML to navigate our way through it.

100
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:16.890
So let's open the armed men if I inversion so we can have a look at the structure so we can

101
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:23.700
see that we need to navigate from heads to head and then to stop i.

102
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.250
D.

103
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:31.250
Last name first name on we using underscore to split words.

104
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:39.450
So let's put the basic formula in equals.

105
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.250
Phil Drink Samil.

106
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.030
The XML document is in our XML connections.

107
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.850
Work feet.

108
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.600
When we click on the cell that contains the linked document,

109
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.620
you'll notice that it's the name of the link document that gets put in because that name

110
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.940
has been applied to the cell that we put our expand statement or was slashed to indicate an

111
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.050
absolute path.

112
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.770
Heads slash head slash stuff on the school.

113
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.650
I d.

114
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.480
Close quotation marks.

115
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:22.940
Can the clothes in parenthesis when we enter what we've actually targeted,

116
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:31.150
we'd go back to the XML structure is the staff i d of the first of our heads of department

117
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.150
.

118
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.360
In other words,

119
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.600
out formulas not quite finished because we know hoping in on a particular department or a

120
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.650
particular branch.

121
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.350
But we'll leave it like that for this video.

122
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.170
And then in the next video,

123
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.150
we'll finish it off when we talk about X path predicates.

124
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.250
But for the moment,

125
00:07:52.250 --> 00:08:03.750
let's just copy the formula and paste it in so we can pick up the first name and last name

126
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.750
.

127
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:22.080
Since I've said,

128
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.170
these three formulas are purely picking up the details of the first person.

129
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.230
And if we were to copy it down,

130
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.650
we simply get that person's details replicated for every room.

131
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:38.400
So let's just don't do save out changes.

132
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.850
And in the next video,

133
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.320
we'll discuss the use of expert predicated,

134
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.150
which will enable us to complete these three formulas
