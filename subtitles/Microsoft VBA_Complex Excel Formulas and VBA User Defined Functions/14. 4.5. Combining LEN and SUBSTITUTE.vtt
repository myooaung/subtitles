00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.650
the next text function combination will examine is Len on substitute,

2
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:25.570
So zero for manipulating text that's open 05 Combining Len and Substitute The land function

3
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.760
is,

4
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.250
of course,

5
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.800
used to measure the length of the string within a cell,

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.450
and substitute is used to replace one string with another within a given cell.

7
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.360
In this work feet,

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.090
we can see a couple of examples of how we can combine these two functions to get some

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.200
useful results In column A.

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.510
We have the copy of our advertisements and in column B,

11
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.350
we want to count the number of characters within the advert,

12
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.250
admit in spaces and in column C.

13
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.650
We want to count the number of words within the ad.

14
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.850
We can solve both of these requirements by the combined use of Len and Substitute.

15
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.650
So let's start with characters without spaces.

16
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.400
We start by using the len function,

17
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.950
and this takes a single argument the cell containing the text that you want the lens off.

18
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.210
And this,

19
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.780
of course,

20
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.560
is sell a to however,

21
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.580
because we want to admit spaces instead of referring directly to sell A to we nest.

22
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.290
The substitute function on the substitute function takes three arguments the cell on which

23
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560
you want to perform the replace operation,

24
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.620
which is of course,

25
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.280
a to the old text,

26
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.150
which is the text that you want to replace.

27
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.470
And that's a space and the new text.

28
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.640
What do you want to replace the old text with?

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.280
We want to replace a space with nothing.

30
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.650
So once we've performed the substitute operation on A to,

31
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.350
we have the original string minus all of the spaces.

32
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.690
So let's type out.

33
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.410
First formula equals land.

34
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.720
Then I'll press walk,

35
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.300
enter to nest.

36
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:35.220
The substitute function our text parameter is a to comma old text which,

37
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.050
of course has to go in quotes is a space comma.

38
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.150
And now new tests which also has to get in Khost is nothing.

39
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.540
So we simply put double quotes,

40
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.850
double quotes with nothing between them,

41
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.550
close parentheses and the substitute.

42
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.190
Um,

43
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.550
I'll just press walt enter on the line.

44
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.650
The clothes in parenthesis off the land function underneath the opening parenthesis,

45
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.850
and that's our function.

46
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:10.550
So to test it in selling to just temporarily type a space,

47
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.360
be space.

48
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.900
See when I press enter,

49
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:24.640
I should get three letters and let's undo Let's just copy before me that down and move on

50
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.750
to the word count.

51
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:36.620
Imagine that we have three words in cell 82 will have to spaces one space between the first

52
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.610
and the second word.

53
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.950
One space between the second and the third.

54
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.450
If we had four words would have three spaces and so forth.

55
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.750
So the number of words is always going to be one more than the number of spaces.

56
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.530
That's the logic that we use to calculate the number of words we start by taking the length

57
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.580
of the entire string using the lens function,

58
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.430
which takes a single argument.

59
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.260
I either text that you want to measure and that,

60
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.810
of course,

61
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.350
is sell me too.

62
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.410
Then,

63
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.680
from that total figure,

64
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.910
we subtract the length not at the original string,

65
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.750
but of the original string with spaces removed,

66
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.810
and we use this substitute function to perform the removal operation.

67
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.720
The substitute function takes three arguments the cell containing the text,

68
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.170
which is a to the old text,

69
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.680
the text you want to get rid on,

70
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.150
which is a space,

71
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.070
and the new text,

72
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.930
the text you want to replace the old text with,

73
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.950
which is nothing So when we perform this calculation,

74
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.350
we'll end up with a number of spaces.

75
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.050
And as we've just seen,

76
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.950
once you have a number of spaces,

77
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.280
you just had one,

78
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.250
and you then have the number of words so onto our word count function.

79
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.950
And since we using this technique account in the number of spaces,

80
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.350
it's important that we make sure we only have one space between each pair of words.

81
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.380
If that's not the case,

82
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.950
we'll obviously get the wrong result.

83
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.860
So,

84
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.440
for example,

85
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.950
of deliberately put a couple of spaces in here,

86
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.150
we could build logic into our formula,

87
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.030
which ignores these extra spaces.

88
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.950
But I think it makes far more sense just to create an extra column here.

89
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:41.700
And let's just call it a copy trimmed and use the trim function to remove those extra

90
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.450
spaces.

91
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.450
That's just equals trim.

92
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.550
Sally,

93
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.250
too,

94
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.750
and we don't.

95
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.550
So now we know that when we have by our word,

96
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.950
camp will only have one space between words.

97
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.060
This is one of the three things that the trim function does.

98
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.850
It removes spaces at the end at the beginning,

99
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.940
and when it finds multiple spaces between words,

100
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.760
it contracts thumb down to one space well company.

101
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.650
The four minute down and then our word count will apply to the trend version of the ad copy

102
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.650
,

103
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.640
not the original.

104
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.050
It's on formula.

105
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.170
So equals Len on.

106
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.590
We want be to minus now.

107
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.520
I use all tender on,

108
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.950
but the second land here,

109
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:44.550
all tender again on the nested substitute text is B two comma.

110
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.550
Old text is a space.

111
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.560
New text is nothing,

112
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.720
which,

113
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.110
of course,

114
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.040
is double quotes,

115
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.950
double quotes and the clothes in parenthesis for Len.

116
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:05.490
So so far we've calculated the number of spaces express all kinds of one small men just put

117
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:13.320
plus one so that we now have the number of words that sounds the formula and to test it are

118
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.930
going to the original cell eight to just type word space based face,

119
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.580
word,

120
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.140
space,

121
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.350
space word.

122
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.150
Just a test that we'll ignore the extra spaces the women present.

123
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.750
It currently calculates that we have three words,

124
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.450
and let's undo that we could just company to formula down.

125
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:42.780
So there we have a couple of examples of using two very useful text functions.

126
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.790
Len on substitute in Conjunction
