1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,850
in the interest of security.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:18,750
Microsoft Excel regards any file in which you placed BB a code as a potential security risk

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:18,750
.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,010
So,

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,950
for example,

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:27,580
or we're going to fold in nine and then open up the workbook that we used in the last video

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:27,580
.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:36,550
03 Excel automatically displays a security warning and disables the content.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,910
Naturally,

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,850
you can click on enable content and everything works fine.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,400
This feature is obviously quite useful,

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,450
and it's in our best interests.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,650
But when you're doing any kind of BB a development,

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,270
you don't really need tohave files that you've created.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,250
Treated with any suspicion,

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,910
A good way of achieving the right balance is toe.

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,750
Add the folders in which you're doing development to your trusted locations.

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,810
As always,

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,500
everything related to the B B A is in the developer town and in the code section.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,130
On the left,

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,550
you'll find the macro security button,

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:25,240
and this command takes you into the trust center settings on these settings for part of

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,550
Excel options.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,550
So we cancel.

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,150
We can get to the same location simply by going to file options.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,600
Then,

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,140
on the left,

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,050
we click on trust center and on the right you'll see a button marked trust center settings

29
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,050
,

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:49,490
so clicking on that button is exactly the same as clicking on the macro security button in

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,650
the developer tab.

32
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:58,310
While it's possible you can see to set global settings,

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,350
it's more convenient to use trusted locations because this allows you to be more selective

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,350
.

35
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,550
So on the left we choose trusted locations,

36
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:15,580
and then we add any older locations in which we do in VB a development to our trusted

37
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,450
locations.

38
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,450
It's on the right.

39
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,050
You'll see a button marked at a new location,

40
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:26,950
and this enables you to browse to any location that contains the B A that your develop it

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,050
that's going to the desktop.

42
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,920
And here I've got the training folder.

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,750
I opened the outer folder and add that to my trusted locations.

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,730
And then,

45
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,620
very importantly,

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,130
before clicking OK,

47
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,580
I also activate the option.

48
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,850
Sub folds of this location are also trusted.

49
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,800
Then I click OK,

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,280
and from now on,

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,470
any code files within that folder that I open won't trigger excels normal security warning

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,150
message.

53
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,680
I can click.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,450
OK,

55
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,620
okay,

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,300
again close without saving.

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,550
And then when I reopened the file because the file is in my trusted locations,

58
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,650
it doesn't trigger the security warning message
