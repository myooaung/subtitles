1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,890
as we've seen the Web service function can't be used on local XML files.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,010
On the work around,

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,730
I've suggested,

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,450
is to use a unified XML file.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,150
What if many find your XML isn't really an option.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,920
If,

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,830
for example,

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,790
the XML file is over written fairly frequently,

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,450
you'll have to manually updated each time and get a unifying version.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,160
So in this video,

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,130
we'll look at using the new contract function in Excel to enable you to import on ordinary

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,160
XML file.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,890
I non magnified.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,720
And then can Katyn ate all the roads that it occupies,

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,950
so it can then be treated as being inserted into a single cell.

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,450
So let's go into number six.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,850
Then you can cat function and open up expense claims.

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,230
Let's move across to Excel connections on,

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:13,250
then connect to the UNMIN ified XML file that we've got here called Head Start XML.

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,110
And,

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,090
as you can see,

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,180
because it's not many fight,

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:28,000
it will take up 363 rows within an Excel worksheet so they can Katyn eight function can't

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,830
be used because it has a maximum of 255.

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,750
Paramus is,

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,140
however,

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,950
in Excel 2016 there's a new function called Can Cat,

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,400
and it offers much more powerful.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,050
Can cast a nation options.

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,450
Let's have a look at how it works,

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,750
so we go across the data,

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,950
get external data from text.

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,940
Now we're working our way into Folder six,

34
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,950
View a lot files and then import hence dot xml.

35
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,090
We important is the limited.

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,850
The limiter is other and then unspecified XT qualify and none.

37
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:19,130
And we form in the colon past text on before clicking.

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,480
OK,

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,550
that's just going to properties and switch off that pesky option problems for final name on

40
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,400
refresh.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,750
Let's say we want to refresh every time we get in the file,

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:37,980
so we've now connected to our XML file.

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,370
But when we go back to our other worksheet,

44
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:51,750
we won't now be able to use Filter XML because our XML is distributed across 300 rose.

45
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,250
So what we need to do is to assemble the XML into a single cell.

46
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,150
So let's just merge a whole bunch of cells.

47
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,080
I think we need to go all the way down.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm emergent center,

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,550
vertically aligned to the top.

50
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:19,990
And then in that cell we use Excel 20 sixteens new can cat function equals Can cat.

51
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,750
And what's new is that I can now simply click on column A.

52
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,320
Have the function will automatically can.

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,150
Katyn ate the values in each row,

54
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,050
and the fact that there are 363 rose is not a problem.

55
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,720
I don't have 363 arguments.

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,700
I only have one argument so I could put if I wanted to another 254 arguments within the

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,320
capital option so you can see how much more powerful it becomes than the classic can Katyn

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,560
eight function that we've had for some years.

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,250
So when I enter my function and special lead wrap,

60
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:11,350
you'll see that I have my XML file sitting in a single cell.

61
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,610
I won't bother repeating the creation off the formulas.

62
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,410
What I wanted to show you,

63
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,110
basically,

64
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:24,760
is that if the trick of many find your XML isn't really possible,

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,370
you can still assemble all the lines of your external document into a single cell.

66
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,930
Use in that very useful can can't function.

67
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,790
But what if you don't have Excel 2016?

68
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,230
Unfortunately,

69
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,750
you'll have to do it the hard way,

70
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,140
but it's still not super difficult.

71
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,940
Let's have a look at how it would work.

72
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,050
I'm gonna make this column narrower.

73
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,410
And then here I'm just gonna put in a column of numbers.

74
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:02,190
We know that there are 363 rows,

75
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:09,660
but let's say we want to go all the way down to 500 in case the XML ends up growing.

76
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:24,130
So I go down to about 500 on.

77
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:31,400
What I can now do is to get Excel to build a really complex formula automatically.

78
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,490
So I'm using a series of formulas to build another formula.

79
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,150
You'll see what I mean in a moment.

80
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,980
So we start with equals and we want to pick up a one.

81
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,750
So we put the A in quotes,

82
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,050
and then we say ampersand and click on the one which contains one.

83
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,650
So that gives us a one.

84
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,990
And then we want an M percent.

85
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,180
So we say Ampersand quotes,

86
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,190
ampersand close,

87
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:02,980
close.

88
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,400
When I press enter,

89
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,730
you'll see we now have a 1%.

90
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,710
In other words,

91
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,350
are formula needs to say a one M percent 8 to 10% a three etcetera.

92
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,130
So in the second road,

93
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,290
we can now say equals the cell above,

94
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,450
followed by Okay.

95
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:31,950
Ampersand de to Anderson quotes Empress end.

96
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:38,920
Hopefully you can see what I'm going with this as we copy it down,

97
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,720
it's gonna take the cell above and then just add on the reference for that road so I can

98
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,170
just double click to copy it down Myth to the bottom on.

99
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,950
This is now gonna be my completed formula,

100
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:02,020
so I can just copy that into note pad time equals,

101
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,550
paste it in there,

102
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,070
lose the trailing and percent,

103
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,940
and we've got ourselves a formula,

104
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,030
So not a huge amount of work to create.

105
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,690
It likened a little of this.

106
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,840
Let's just make another one of these big cells.

107
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,950
So let's win this a bit.

108
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:38,350
Select a bunch of cells and then Myrdal of these cells left the line top aligned.

109
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,760
Hopefully my clipboard is still intact,

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:50,150
suddenly placed all of that in and so and would run.

111
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,950
And we've got exactly the same result.

112
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,050
Very untidy formula.

113
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,710
But as you can see,

114
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,350
not so much work to create.

115
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,710
So if you haven't got Excel 2016 this is the approach you can take.

116
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,550
But if you have 2016 and I'm sure that they can cat function is one that you'll be very

117
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,880
keen to start using
