00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.750
Let's now move on to look at the two functions used to rank data in Excel ranked body Q and

2
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.040
drank,

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.490
not TVG 06 Manipulating numbers that's open zero.

4
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.050
Find the rank function variations.

5
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.100
One simple way of Rankin data is to sort the data in descending order.

6
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.560
But what the rank functions enable you to do is to display the rank permanently,

7
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.450
regardless of the sort order.

8
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.350
In this example,

9
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.810
we're analyzing how good each of our account handlers is.

10
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.250
It close in sales.

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.350
We want to rank them by what this company calls the clothes factor.

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.050
So let's begin by calculating the clothes factor.

13
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.900
And it's simply the number of hours taken to close sales divided by the revenue.

14
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.750
And because this will be a fairly small number,

15
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.250
let's have five significant digits.

16
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.880
So to do that,

17
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.990
we'll use the round.

18
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.510
Function around function allows you to specify the number of decimals to which in number is

19
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.150
rounded.

20
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.400
It takes two arguments.

21
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.170
Festival the number which in this case will be see two divided by G two and secondly,

22
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.350
the number of digits.

23
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.480
And let's say,

24
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.450
because this number is very small,

25
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:49.510
we'll have five decimal places says a calculator on clothes factor.

26
00:01:49.510 --> 00:02:00.090
It's going to be equals round see to divided by G two coma number of digits.

27
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.650
Fine,

28
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:11.410
and I've already formatted this column to display by personal places.

29
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.580
On That,

30
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.950
of course,

31
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.570
is done.

32
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.850
Using these two buttons increased decimal on decrease decibel,

33
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.750
so we can now copy this down.

34
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.150
We now have a thing that we want to rank before we create our final two formulas.

35
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.890
Let's create some named ranges,

36
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.250
which we can then refer to in our formulas.

37
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.100
We'll highlight the three columns that we're interested in using control.

38
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.750
Click and then in formulas.

39
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:53.910
I mean years in the defined names group we use create from selection talk right and these

40
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.950
around you names.

41
00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.850
So now let's discuss the rank function.

42
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.450
The rank function takes three arguments.

43
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.090
First of all,

44
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.550
you specify the number that you want to rang,

45
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.370
which in our case will be G two because I'm formula is on road to will be referenced in the

46
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.210
second row of the Revenue column.

47
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:28.930
The second perimeter reference allows you to specify the range in which your position in

48
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.570
the number than use pacified.

49
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.850
And that's the column that we've named revenue.

50
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:47.750
The sad argument is the order will the highest item the standing.

51
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.050
The third argument is the orders.

52
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.800
The third argument is optional,

53
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.080
and that's the order.

54
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.380
This allows you to specify whether you want to treat The items is being sorted in

55
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.580
descending order,

56
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.620
which is the default on which is easy in descending order,

57
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.750
which is the default what is indicated by zero or ascend in order.

58
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.350
Lowest first.

59
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.910
That's indicated by one you know,

60
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.750
scenario.

61
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:30.980
We want one because the lower in our scenario we need one ascending order because the lower

62
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.080
the closed time,

63
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.760
the better because the lower the close time,

64
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:46.610
the better has moved across to the other worksheet we have in this workbook e que verses A

65
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.270
B G.

66
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.500
And let's look at the two flavors off the rank function.

67
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.410
I'm gonna put some figures in the first column,

68
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:07.920
which is what we'll be ranking and let's just copy those down so clearly 10 is the highest

69
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.750
figure it will have a rank of one.

70
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.630
One is the lowest.

71
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.350
It will have a rank of 10 equals rank que.

72
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:33.240
The number is a two common on the reference is that whole columns from A to bounce 11 and

73
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.950
then I'll press at Ford to make that into an absolute reference.

74
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.550
We get the anticipated results,

75
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:57.740
and then we can just copy this formula and paste it for the A V G version and we get

76
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.450
exactly the same formula.

77
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.950
So the difference between these two comes into play when we have ties.

78
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.530
So if we put in two sevens,

79
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.450
for example,

80
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:16.750
we can now see the difference with rank e que.

81
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.940
We now have two items.

82
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.850
Time for fourth place with rank A V G.

83
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.790
We have an average figure,

84
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.650
so both of the force place items were indicated is 4.5 rather than fall.

85
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.320
And this difference really comes into play when you're performing operations on the rank

86
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.350
Colin itself.

87
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.850
So we put a total for these two columns.

88
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:49.450
You'll see that with Frankie Que.

89
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.550
Whenever you have ties,

90
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.250
the total number within the Rank column will decrease by one.

91
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.490
Where's with rain?

92
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.550
Cave E G.

93
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.750
That total number will never change.

94
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.450
So if you perform in operations on the Rank column,

95
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.450
it's usually better to use rank a VG,

96
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.290
and that's what we'll need.

97
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.050
In this particular example,

98
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.450
have been calculated the close rank.

99
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.950
We intend to go on to calculate the clothes status,

100
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.410
which will make fast,

101
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.750
medium or slow.

102
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.950
And although they can't be very much in it,

103
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.440
we should get slightly more accurate results that we use ranked.

104
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.390
What a BCG,

105
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:50.950
as opposed to run buddy here so close rank will simply be equals ranked on a beauty and our

106
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:57.060
number parameter will be the clothes factor indeed to comma.

107
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.050
And then from reference,

108
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.650
we can use the named range close factor.

109
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:15.380
Coleman and then for our purposes will need ascending or one because the lower the clothes

110
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.770
factor the better.

111
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:25.400
Because obviously a low close factor indicates fewer sales hours and therefore less time

112
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.150
taking to close the deal.

113
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.050
And that's our formula.

114
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:38.250
So we can see immediately that no point normal 150 is not unique.

115
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.350
Let's calm me down.

116
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.510
So wherever you see a decimal,

117
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.380
that means we have a tie in.

118
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.320
Close factor column on,

119
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.830
By the way,

120
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.670
we can change the clothes factor 2%.

121
00:08:53.670 --> 00:09:00.150
I think it probably will look better as a percentage and then increase the number of

122
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.050
decimals.

123
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.700
So,

124
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.090
of course,

125
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.650
if we now sort by the close factor column.

126
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:18.320
Small is the largest we can now see which company takes the few.

127
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.650
It's ours too close relative to the revenue that we generate from them.

128
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.920
We can see that because we use in rank believe e g.

129
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.550
Wherever there's a tie,

130
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.250
we get the average position.

131
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.150
So now let's move on to the close status.

132
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.400
And here we just want the words fast,

133
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.050
medium or slow.

134
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:48.210
And rather than basing this on the clothes factory sold were simply going to base it on the

135
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.750
rank.

136
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:57.640
So I will say that the top third will have passed the middle third medium and the Bolton

137
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.250
said,

138
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:04.030
slow to calculate the clothes status.

139
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.350
We use an if statement,

140
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.550
and for a logical test,

141
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:17.140
we can check to see whether the close rank in E to is greater than or equal to the maximum

142
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.300
close rank divided by three multiplied by two.

143
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.350
This means that the close rank is in the bottom three.

144
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.870
Obviously,

145
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.250
the highest number is the poorest rank.

146
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.460
If that's the case,

147
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.450
the value true will be the word slow.

148
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.050
And if it's no,

149
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.160
the value of false will be supplied by a nested.

150
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.050
If statement.

151
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.630
This time we'll test to see,

152
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:51.620
but they close rank in E to is greater than or equal to the maximum close rank divided by

153
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.350
three.

154
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.850
If it is,

155
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.950
since we know that it's not in the highest ranking numbers,

156
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:07.230
this puts it in the middle and therefore will assign it value media it both our first and

157
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.750
second logical tests proved to be false.

158
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.150
Then the cattle value it falls will kick in.

159
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.560
And that means that our ranks are in the low numbers.

160
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.640
The bottom third,

161
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.750
which means that we want the word fast.

162
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.530
So let's create our final function.

163
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.350
And for this we can expand the formula bar,

164
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.400
so we need equals.

165
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:45.050
If the first test is to see whether the clothes ranging E to is greater than or equal to

166
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:52.050
the maximum close rank and it seems I start time,

167
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:58.660
it comes up in the list and we can just select it in press tab to insert it divided by

168
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.240
three multiplied by two to target the tops.

169
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.750
Third,

170
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:09.480
if it is high number in the case,

171
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.150
a slow closed time.

172
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:20.920
So although enter and we put the word slowed coma well,

173
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.430
Santa and then the value false is supplied by our nested.

174
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:31.950
If old enter a logical test,

175
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.650
we can copy from the first,

176
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.350
permitting the multiplied by two,

177
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.450
which means that we're now very fine,

178
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.450
that the close rank is greater than or equal to the top,

179
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.300
said Coma.

180
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.920
And thinking about it equal to isn't really required.

181
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.240
You just want greater than that.

182
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.950
So there's take these equal signs out,

183
00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:00.960
although enter if they're in the middle,

184
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.460
said we won't medium comma old hands,

185
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:05.840
huh?

186
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:12.060
And then our cattle value false will be fast indicating there in the bottom,

187
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.950
said the lowest numbers,

188
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:19.640
or enter close in parenthesis for the next.

189
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:35.760
It if enclosed in parenthesis for the outer is so when we can't be down because I still

190
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.010
have the data sorted by close factor.

191
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.650
I can see the top.

192
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:40.850
There is fast.

193
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.690
The middle of that is medium animals of that is slow
