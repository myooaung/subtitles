1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,690
Let's move on to look at another array function this time one that you can use yourself

2
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,650
rather than one that's created automatically for you.

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,150
07 Array formulas.

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,560
That's 705 transpose function.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,050
The transpose operation simply means to change the orientation of your data.

6
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:32,990
So,

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,050
for example,

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,780
if we have the days of the week in this orientation,

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,550
we can can't be.

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,530
And when we paste,

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,700
we can transpose.

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:54,650
So that's the transposed operation.

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,620
The transpose function,

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,650
by contrast,

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:03,350
enables you to achieve this switch in orientation in a dynamic fashion.

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,360
And it's particularly useful when you're summarising data,

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,670
and it's more convenient to see the summarized data in the opposite orientation to the

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,750
original data.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,850
So in this example,

20
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,550
we look at daily sales.

21
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,970
Let's say in our summary work seat,

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,950
we simply want to keep track of the total for each branch,

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,850
and that's displayed at the bottom of the table using the total row.

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:37,300
So if you haven't used this before in table tools design,

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,060
we'll see there's an option here for Total Road.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,000
When that switched on,

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,490
Excel allows you to automatically aggregate each of the columns so all we want in our

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:57,280
summary is the headings and the total road,

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,050
but the convenience.

30
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,650
We want them in columns.

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:11,750
So the first thing we need to do is to measure the Matrix so you don't highlight from a one

32
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,330
t.

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,590
J.

34
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,890
One very conveniently in the name box.

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:24,550
Excel is blazed by mentions of my current selection so we can see it one row by 10 Collins

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,550
.

37
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,890
And to use the transpose function,

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,300
you simply select the Matrix,

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,890
which has the opposite.

40
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,450
I mention in this case,

41
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,050
let's do headings.

42
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,750
First you need to select the Matrix,

43
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,850
which is 10 rose by one column.

44
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,610
So,

45
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,650
as you can see,

46
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,710
like the table function,

47
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,260
which we saw in the last video,

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:57,270
the transpose function is a function that populates multiple cells simultaneously that this

49
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,370
function you enter manually.

50
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,470
There's no command which generates it.

51
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,250
As we saw in the table function,

52
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,150
they simply equals transpose.

53
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,900
And then you specify the array,

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,150
which you want to transpose within the currently selected cells.

55
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,950
So you go across the daily sales and we selectable that the head is,

56
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,210
and you probably know that you don't need to put a close in parenthesis when you only have

57
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,250
a single function in your formula.

58
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,210
But what we need to do is to make sure that we press CSE control,

59
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,450
shift and enter.

60
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,650
So we now have a dynamically transposed version off the original data.

61
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,950
So let's say for some reason we wanted to abbreviate the headings,

62
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:54,370
it would change Birmingham to be apostrophe.

63
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,650
Um,

64
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,010
when we go back to the summary,

65
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,910
of course,

66
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,800
we'll see the updated version there.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,550
But now let's do the same for the totals.

68
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,410
So I'm including the heading in.

69
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,270
My selection equals transfers,

70
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:27,150
and we strolled bottom and drank across all of the total cells.

71
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,410
So you always have to make sure that the range that you specify is the exact opposite.

72
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,950
In terms of rows and columns or the selected range,

73
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:43,370
you're transposed formula and then ask before we make sure that we press control ship enter

74
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:43,370
.

75
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,350
So we've got a summarized version off the table,

76
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,670
and just to emphasize that it's dynamic,

77
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,350
we go across the more data.

78
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,550
Select all the data here,

79
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,010
missing out the headings,

80
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,680
of course,

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,580
so controls it writes.

82
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,950
Control it down,

83
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,170
copy all of that data and paste it into the table.

84
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,290
We just need to click in the bottom.

85
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,050
Later sell just about the total road press the tab key,

86
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,150
and that creates a blank grow into which we can then paste.

87
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,650
And I should have done that before the copy because I've now canceled the copy.

88
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,080
Soccer go back could be again and then based into my blank right.

89
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,930
Of course,

90
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,550
when we come back to our summary,

91
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,490
we have the new updated total.

92
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,910
That's all there is to the transposed function.

93
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,050
Very simple,

94
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,580
but sometimes very convenient feature.
