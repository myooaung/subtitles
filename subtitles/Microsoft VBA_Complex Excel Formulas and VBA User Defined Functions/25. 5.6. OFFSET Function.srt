1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,040
in this video,

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,350
we'll take a look of the use of excels offset function,

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,250
which could be used to isolate a range of data within a larger range.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,550
The 05 look up reference Let's open up 06 offset function.

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,050
So here we have to work sheets.

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,230
First of all,

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,450
we have call centre averages has information every day of the week.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,980
But those are the seven days of week one,

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,480
and we've just got some summaries,

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,380
average time,

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,500
things of answer,

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:45,790
call,

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,650
duration,

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,050
etcetera.

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,550
And in the summary worksheet,

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,550
what we're looking to do is to get the weekly averages.

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,890
So we want to take each of those seven rows and just get the average figure.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,950
But in each of the columns,

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,470
so naturally,

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,750
for this to work,

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,730
we have to have the data sorted chronologically.

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,160
So we've got all the Week one information or the week to information,

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,950
etcetera.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,070
But in this case,

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,510
I think you'll agree that is the logical way to lay out this information.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,950
So it's logical that it would be sorted in this fashion.

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,950
The way that the offset function works is that you specify a reference cell,

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,680
which is the starting point So in the case of column see the time taken to answer a logical

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,150
reference.

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,450
Elwood BC to the first cell in week one.

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:51,660
Then we specify the robe offset and column offset How many rows down?

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,810
How many Collins across Solwezi?

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,690
In this case,

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,900
we don't want any columns across,

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,640
and the number of rows down depends on the week saying We won.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,350
We want an offset a zero rose because we're in the right cell in Week two.

37
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,590
We want an offset of seven.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,450
So it's starting from here.

39
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,350
1234567 And that takes us to Monday of the following week.

40
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:26,410
So the relationship between the week number on the offset is that we need to subtract one

41
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:33,290
from the week number and then multiply the result by seven saying we won,

42
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,330
we subtract one from one,

43
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,420
leaving zero multiplied by seven gives us zero,

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,150
so we've got no upset.

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,020
Then we to tu minus one,

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,990
gives us 11 Time.

47
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,450
Seven gives this seven.

48
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:55,930
That gives us an offset of seven starting from the initial reference point so that initial

49
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,920
reference point C two will be fixed,

50
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,050
or at least a two will be fixed with a dollar sign.

51
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,610
So we're always started from that point.

52
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,530
And then as the weeks progress,

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,550
the road offset just continually increases.

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,750
So this is the formula we need to create.

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,850
The out of function is average,

56
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,750
and this can take a series of arguments separated by commas.

57
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,250
Refer to his number one number two etcetera.

58
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:32,850
Each of these is normally a cell reference molders need one block of cells which will be

59
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,840
retrieved by the offset function.

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,800
The offset function takes five arguments,

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,850
only the 1st 3 or obligatory.

62
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,780
Firstly,

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,090
we have the reference.

64
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,660
So for the first piece of information,

65
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,180
we're looking up.

66
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,590
That's gonna be cell C two and we'll have to remember to put a dollar in front of the two

67
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:52,840
sides.

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,320
We copy the formula down,

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,840
we stay stuck on that road.

70
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,230
Then we've got the two offsets.

71
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,220
How maney of Rose he wants,

72
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,430
well,

73
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,330
sat down.

74
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,750
How many columns do you want to offset across?

75
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,630
So for the rose,

76
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,450
we use the week number,

77
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,340
subtract one from it,

78
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,730
then multiplied by seven and the columns We haven't all set of zero because we're in the

79
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,550
right column.

80
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,160
And then because We're doing an average for the week.

81
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,010
The height that we want to retreat is seven.

82
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,550
So the offset takes us to Monday.

83
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,820
A man from there.

84
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,060
We have a height of seven,

85
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:38,000
which encompasses the entire week because we want the with to be one on because one is the

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,750
default.

87
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,190
We can venom it.

88
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,310
The fifth argument,

89
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,340
which is the with that we've got a matrix,

90
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,750
which is seven rows high on one Colin wide.

91
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,530
So now let's write out formula.

92
00:04:51,530 --> 00:05:05,780
So the outer function is average old Santa and then inside it me.

93
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,430
Next hour,

94
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:15,700
offset reference is call centre averages C two and then I'll just press that four until I

95
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:25,030
got a dollar sign in front of the two but no dollar sign in front of the sea and then for

96
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,410
the number of rows that we want to offset in parentheses.

97
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:29,990
Well,

98
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,900
first of all,

99
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,550
pick up the week and I'll just deletes the name of the worksheets since the Formula Asian

100
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,150
summary.

101
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,260
And then we just press that for until we've got a dollar sign in front of the A that no

102
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,980
dollar sign in front of the two.

103
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,300
That way,

104
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,730
when we call me to the right reference will remain stuck on the week color,

105
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,650
but when we call you down,

106
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,760
we'll pick up each of the different leaks from that figure.

107
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,990
We need to subtract one before multiplying it by seven.

108
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,050
That's how many rows down we want to offset.

109
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,650
Now we need to specify how many columns we want to offset.

110
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,840
We're in the right column so we don't need or not said it's all.

111
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,510
But we have to put zero because Collins is not an optional argument comma that we specify

112
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,530
the height we want the average of seven days.

113
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,550
So we put a height of seven.

114
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,450
And then for our wits,

115
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,380
we can either put comma one or because,

116
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,440
as you can tell by this,

117
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,150
where brackets it's optional,

118
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,550
we can simply admit the with,

119
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,550
and then we'll have a default of one.

120
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,860
So the upset function is returning.

121
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,050
The matrix of seven rose by one column.

122
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,620
That's our formula.

123
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,850
So all times on the closing practices to him,

124
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,970
the average function.

125
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:04,650
So because of our strategic use of dollar signs,

126
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,950
we can now call me to the right,

127
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,920
pick up the average reach of you,

128
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,170
Jason Columns and then we could just double click.

129
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,650
So you copy down and pick up the averages for each week.

130
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,230
So that's how the offset function works very useful function or isolated and analyze in

131
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,550
small sections of data within a larger data set.
