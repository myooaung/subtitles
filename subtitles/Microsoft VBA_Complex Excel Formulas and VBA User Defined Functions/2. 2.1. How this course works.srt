1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,060
Once you've downloaded and unzipped the exercise files for this course,

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,950
it's probably a good idea to delete the ZIP file just to avoid confusion.

3
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,410
Amanda is going to the exercise folder on here.

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,480
You'll find everything that you need to complete the course.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,000
The 1st 2 sections are preparatory,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,050
so there are no real work files here.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,350
You'll see in the Welcome folder there.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,160
No work files,

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,470
a tall on.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,700
Then we've just got one work file and getting started.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,950
The course proper starts with 03 logical functions,

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,350
and there are three components inside each of the sub folders.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,950
First of all,

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,850
we have the start files.

15
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,680
These are the files that I'll be using as I demonstrate.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,380
So when we talk about the first topic,

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,750
which is if statements you'll need to open this file,

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:12,770
which is what I'll be doing on screen and then follow along on what I'd recommend that you

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,640
do,

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,460
it's to start from scratch each time and then type the formulas as you watch the

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,950
demonstration.

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,550
However,

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,650
I realize it's not always convenient for people to do this,

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,850
so if for any reason you find it inconvenient to work in this way,

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,750
simply go into the folder called Completed,

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,450
and here you'll find the completed exercise.

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,650
And here's the formula that will be built in in the very first you tool riel.

28
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,150
But that's not the recommended method.

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:55,150
Recommended method is to start with a blank each time,

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:02,150
and that's what's the tutorial and to the formula.

31
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,250
And,

32
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:03,610
of course,

33
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,850
if you feel confident that you can solve some of these problems yourself,

34
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,850
go ahead and pause the video and have a crack at entering the formula yourself.

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:19,900
So those are the tutorial files start in and completed,

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,750
and then the other sub folder that we have here is a little diagrams.

37
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,180
So as you're watching the tutorials,

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,350
if I use any diagrams,

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,480
you'll find your copy of that same diagram in this folder.

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,970
And obviously the names match the tutorials that we do.

41
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,750
They're all in PdF format,

42
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,750
so when I double quick on a pdf,

43
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,650
it opens in Acrobat.

44
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,750
But any pdf Rita will be fine.

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,000
If you are used,

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,690
an acrobat will record that reader,

47
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,600
and remember,

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,050
you can just go to view full screen mode,

49
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,770
but which the short cut is.

50
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,750
Control L and then remember that some of these PdF's have multiple pages,

51
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,890
So if you are in full screen mode,

52
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,650
just use the forward and backward arrows to switch between pages.

53
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,280
And,

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,650
of course,

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,120
to come out at full screen mode.

56
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,380
Just press the escape key or type control L one small.

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:22,160
So those are the three areas to look for when you go into each folder,

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,320
completed diagrams,

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,550
and then these are the ones that you need to focus on but start in file for each tutorial.
