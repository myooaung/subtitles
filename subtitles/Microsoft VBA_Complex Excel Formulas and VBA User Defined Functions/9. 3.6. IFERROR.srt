1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,700
Let's end our look at excels,

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,150
logical functions by looking at a very simple but very useful function.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:27,780
If Karen and basically what the if Arab function does is to enable you to substitute

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,050
potential era values returned by your formulas with something will use a friendly.

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,450
Let's take an example here we want to create a formula to do some basic email validation,

6
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,670
and are we going to do is to test for the presence of the at sign and the dot in each of

7
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,850
our email addresses.

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,830
So,

9
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,220
as usual,

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,760
let's expand our fold in the bar.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,290
So this,

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,680
of course,

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,950
will be an if statement.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,750
So as per usual,

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,250
we start by specifying a logical test.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,850
And since this will be a compound test,

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,550
we have to use all or And and in this case,

18
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,300
we want both the acts and adult to be present.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,900
So we needed,

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,750
and both conditions have to be satisfied.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,570
So we have.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,820
And now let's start with the outside.

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,300
So we need a function which will test whether the at sign is present in cell F two on for

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,860
this weekend.

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,740
Use find.

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,960
The first argument is the thing you're looking for,

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,950
and that has to go in close.

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,020
Of course,

29
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,420
it's the outside comma on.

30
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,950
The second argument is to sell that you're examining,

31
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,840
which of course,

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,250
is left to the first email address.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,830
Then we can close parentheses,

34
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,450
permitting the final optional argument,

35
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,450
and then we need to finish this off to make it into a test.

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,630
If I say,

37
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,370
for example,

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,060
greater than one,

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,350
this will test ISI that the string contains an ensign and it's not the first character,

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:13,950
and then we can do the same for the dots find Don't enough to.

41
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,850
And this time,

42
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,220
let's say,

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,250
greater than four.

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,230
That completes out.

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,150
And so you put the clothes in parentheses.

46
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,050
Coma.

47
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,950
That's our logical test completed.

48
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,650
Let's press old enter for a new line and move on to the value is true.

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,140
If the test is successful,

50
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,480
we want the word valid to appear in the song coma,

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,770
cancer and then for value of false.

52
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,410
We want the word invalid that completes our If so,

53
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,600
we can just put the clothes in parenthesis.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,850
So let's presente.

55
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,640
So the email address,

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:57,940
you know,

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,350
two is valid.

58
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,590
But when we copy down,

59
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,600
what we find is that all those email addresses,

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,980
which are invalid instead of returning the text in value,

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,950
as we've asked,

62
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,250
producing an Arab body.

63
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,950
So we know in this example that every time there's an error,

64
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,550
what we actually have is an invalid email address.

65
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:28,650
What we want to do here is to replace this arrow value with the word in Balad,

66
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,510
and that's exactly what the if error function enables us to do.

67
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:42,150
So Here's a summary of the logic that we have in place using the and function.

68
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:49,650
Have an inside it use the find function twice very fine the position of the at sign on the

69
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,250
dots.

70
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,990
So because this email address has no out sign,

71
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,590
the first find operation produces an era value.

72
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,880
Once that happens,

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,040
the formula itself produces an error value so the value of true and valuable false parts of

74
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,850
the if statement are processed.

75
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:19,960
So the solution is to use if era it takes two arguments on the first argument is simply the

76
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,880
entire formula that you want to evaluate.

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,370
So the formula that we currently have will become the first argument,

78
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:34,530
the value argument of the if Eric function and then the second arguments is the value that

79
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,650
you want to appear in the cell whenever an error does a result from your formula.

80
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,910
So in this case,

81
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,950
we want the word invalid to replace the Arab Annie.

82
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:57,050
So all we need to do is after the equal sign to put if error,

83
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:08,630
I'll just press walk enter to emphasize that the if statement is the first argument of the

84
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,250
era.

85
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:16,700
And then that first argument is followed by a comma now completed the value arguments of

86
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,350
the era.

87
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,400
We just need the value,

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,580
if error argument again on press Old Enter have in to line up with the if statement and put

89
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:37,270
the word invalid and then a single close in parenthesis to end the era function.

90
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,340
So let's test it and and then copy down.

91
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,820
So now,

92
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,550
whenever an error occurs,

93
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,550
the word invalid replaces the error of value.
