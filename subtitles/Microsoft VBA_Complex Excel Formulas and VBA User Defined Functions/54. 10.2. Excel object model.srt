1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,840
as you write your BB a functions you'll need to manipulate different aspects of Excel on

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,050
Excel elements.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:24,090
The Excel Object model is the term or the hierarchy that Microsoft have created,

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,980
which represents Excel and all things excel.

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,950
So key aspect of this Intacs that you'll need to learn is how to reference different parts

6
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,990
of the Microsoft Excel structure.

7
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,350
This diagram is far from complete.

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,330
It represents only the key aspects.

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:50,460
The key elements within the Excel hierarchy on also bear in mind that there are certain

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,250
elements which you can't access when you're right in user defined functions,

11
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,330
these elements can only be automated,

12
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,740
so when you write macros,

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,950
you can refer to them.

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,350
You can't,

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,080
for example,

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,380
right.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,070
A user defined function,

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,650
which uses excels speech capability to talk to the user.

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:16,650
That can only be done by writing a macro as we manipulate Excel elements or come back to

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,250
this diagram and just point out different aspects of the hierarchy that were actually

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,200
manipulated.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,590
So in order to get used to the syntax that you use when you work with the Excel object

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,250
model,

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:38,140
let's just briefly discuss four of the elements in this diagram complication Workbooks This

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,450
workbook Onda workbook.

26
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,260
As you can imagine,

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,050
application represents Microsoft Excel itself.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,160
It's whenever you're working with settings,

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,330
which are essentially excel settings rather than attributes pertaining to a particular

30
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,550
workbook or a particular work seat.

31
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,850
We'll be working with the application object.

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,250
Let's have a look at some of the syntax that applies to the application object.

33
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,650
Let's go to the developer tab on visual.

34
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,910
Basic visual.

35
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,700
Basic Editor includes a very detailed reference to excel,

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,430
maybe a.

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,570
But you can access my feelings of you in choosing Object browser.

38
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:35,650
And here you can find a list of all the components that make up the Excel object model in

39
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,670
the top left.

40
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,240
Prince has all libraries.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,990
We can restrict our list into excel and let's find application.

42
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:52,450
But I highlight application the members off the application object displayed on the right.

43
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:59,640
That basically means all the other elements within the Excel object model that apart off

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,050
the application object and there are two key types of elements.

45
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,090
But first,

46
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,720
let's have the green icon our methods,

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,110
which are essentially functions,

48
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,950
and for the most part,

49
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,000
when you're writing user defined functions,

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,430
you don't really access them these operations.

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,000
So if you're right in Mac Rose,

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,830
you want to close files,

53
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,010
open files,

54
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,730
print documents and so forth.

55
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,850
These are all methods or actions that you can perform on these objects.

56
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:37,960
The type of member that you focus on when you're writing user defined functions is really

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,970
properties.

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,850
These are the attributes off the elements.

59
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,710
So,

60
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,790
for example,

61
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,080
if we scroll down,

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,750
we have calculation.

63
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,050
That's the current set in within Excel As to whether calculation is manual or automatic.

64
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,450
When I click on calculation on the bottom of the screen,

65
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,450
you'll see a brief description is displayed.

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,100
If I want a more detailed description,

67
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,750
I just click on the help button.

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,650
And here you're given a description of the calculate property,

69
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,280
handsome examples of its usage and at the bottom of the screen.

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:26,020
We have a brief description on also useful links if we click on the link that says Excel

71
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,400
calculation were taken to a list of all the permissible values.

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,380
So this is a constant.

73
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,750
So we used to represent the settings that air access to the interface,

74
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,950
automatic manual or semi automatic,

75
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,740
another tool that's quite useful when you're experimenting with the Excel object model is

76
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,950
the immediate window.

77
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,400
To get to this,

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,450
you get a new choose immediate window on in this window,

79
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:04,050
you can type a line of code and their two styles in line that you can write.

80
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,250
One is where you simply want to get an answer to a question.

81
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,900
So,

82
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,440
for example,

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,850
we might want to check What is the current calculation set in within Microsoft Excel.

84
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,050
But that style of line You start with a question mark,

85
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,450
and then you just write a line of code and presente so we would write application,

86
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,950
not calculation.

87
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,620
Now,

88
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,470
when we present,

89
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,450
we get a constant and if I close this window for a moment,

90
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,250
but I click on these.

91
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,930
If you look at the bottom of the screen,

92
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,150
you'll see the actual constant that's represented by each of these.

93
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:54,150
So the minus 4105 If we can see represents automatic,

94
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:00,250
it would move onto wet books.

95
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,570
Workbooks simply represents the collection of files,

96
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,850
which you currently have open in Excel.

97
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,040
As soon as you close a file its top speed in the workbooks collection on when you open a

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,600
file.

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,330
The workbooks collection increases by one so if we type application,

100
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,060
don't work.

101
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,250
Bookstop count.

102
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,670
When I press enter,

103
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:34,010
I have to the file that was created automatically for me when I open Excel and the personal

104
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,650
workbook,

105
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,550
which is currently open.

106
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,150
And that kind of says one,

107
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:47,550
if I want to reference a particular workbook in parentheses after the word workbooks,

108
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,550
I can either put the name of the workbook or it's positional number.

109
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,260
So the personal workbook,

110
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,240
because it's integral to excel if it's open,

111
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,680
it will always have a number of one say bye,

112
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,720
puts one in parentheses and then use the property.

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,550
Don't name.

114
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,990
When I press enter,

115
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,050
the name of the personal work is displayed.

116
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:23,840
So when we reference a workbook in this way by place in either a name or a number in the

117
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,850
parentheses,

118
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,850
we are referencing a workbook object.

119
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,590
So to get to a workbook object,

120
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:37,910
you dive into the workbooks collection and pick out a single one that gives you the

121
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,350
workbook object as well as reference in individual workbooks.

122
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,140
You can also use application,

123
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:52,490
not this workbook on what this means is the workbook that contains your BB,

124
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,950
a code so here,

125
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,100
instead of access in a particular workbook.

126
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,700
Weaken,

127
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,290
say dot this workbook Full name on.

128
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,360
When we press enter,

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,880
we can see it's called Book one,

130
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,550
which is the default name of the workbook that Excel creates when you first want to the

131
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,650
program and will be used in this workbook very shortly in our code.

132
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:28,000
So those are the two tools in Excel that you can use to just navigate on.

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,750
Learn about the Excel object model.

134
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,550
Let's just close these down for the moment.

135
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,720
And as I said,

136
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,250
we'll come back to this diagram as we encounter different aspects of the Excel object model

137
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,250
.
