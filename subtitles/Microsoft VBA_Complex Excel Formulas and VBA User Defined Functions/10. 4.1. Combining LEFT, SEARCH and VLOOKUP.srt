1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,050
let's now turn our attention to the manipulation of text.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,440
Let's take a look at some of the typical function combinations that you use when working

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,350
with text,

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,700
so we're currently in zero for manipulating text on Let's start with number one combining

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,550
left search from the look up.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,550
Then this workbook We have to work feeds.

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,350
The first has a record off all the highest of taking place,

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,250
the second as the names off into the items that can be hired,

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,050
saying the highest work seat.

10
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,650
We have a high of ref column,

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,750
but the higher ref has three components,

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,450
and it's only the first of these three components that matches the items.

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,870
So we need to have a formula which will extract all the text before the first hyphen.

14
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,470
On this occasion,

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,370
we can't simply use the left function because when you use left on its own,

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,550
you need to specify the number of characters to extract started from the left.

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,550
And as you can see that number very sometimes it's four on sometimes is free.

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,610
There is,

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,180
of course,

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,330
in the data tab,

21
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,850
this very useful feature text to columns.

22
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,750
But remember,

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,020
this is an operation.

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,230
What we're trying to do here is to create a formula so that,

25
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,750
given any higher up with these three components,

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,640
we can extract the first component and then use the V look up function to find out the name

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,050
of the correspondent item so that the name of the Iceman's probably all with me.

28
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,830
Let's start by simply extract in the code so that we can look at using the to text

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,450
functions in conjunction.

30
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,950
So here what we're interested in doing,

31
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,680
extracting all of the characters that precede the first hyphen so we can use the left

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,450
function,

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,580
which takes two parameters.

34
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,150
First of all,

35
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,880
the text from which you want to extract some characters on this,

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,340
of course,

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,460
is the text in the cell.

38
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,450
Eight to the second argument is the number of characters,

39
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,030
and for this we can't give a literal number.

40
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,850
We can't say three or all because the number varies,

41
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,050
so instead,

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,150
use the search function,

43
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,850
so the search function becomes the second argument of the left function.

44
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,550
The search function,

45
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,120
in turn,

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,850
takes two arguments.

47
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,650
The fine text,

48
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,790
the text that you're looking for,

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,690
which is we know,

50
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,850
is the hyphen and then within text the selling which you're looking for that text.

51
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,840
And as we've seen that stay,

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,350
too,

53
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,550
the search function returns a number,

54
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,620
which is the character position of the stream that your searching for so in this case in

55
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,960
selling to the hyphen is in character position.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,550
Fine.

57
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,890
But of course,

58
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,770
we don't want to extract five characters we want to extract.

59
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,450
Or,

60
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,730
in other words,

61
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,650
we always want to extract one character fewer than the character position of the hyphen.

62
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,350
So after the closing parenthesis for the search function,

63
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:38,830
we need to put minus one so there is a lesson going on.

64
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,950
So we'll split this onto several lines and for that will increase the size of the formula

65
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,350
bar.

66
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:52,750
So it's equals left then all enter to go to a new line,

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,850
and the first parameter is the text.

68
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,240
Which is,

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:05,550
you can see is the text in the adjacent column in a two that's our first parameter old

70
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,450
enter again and then for the second parameter,

71
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,020
we now need to use a function which will identify the character position of the first

72
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,650
hyphen.

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,350
And there two candidates search and find find is case sensitive,

74
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,290
and search is not.

75
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,540
And for that reason it's probably best to think of searches,

76
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,240
the standard function and then only use.

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,230
Find on those occasions where you definitely need to take the case into account so he will

78
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,260
use such the fine text has to go in double quotes,

79
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,850
and it's the hyphen.

80
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,910
Within text is the cell that we're searching in,

81
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,150
which is a two.

82
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,420
If we admit the third parameter,

83
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,160
which is you can see,

84
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,070
is optional.

85
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,150
That's the starting.

86
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,720
Um,

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,460
we know it's optional because it's in square brackets.

88
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,600
Excel will simply start the search on character Position one.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,350
What is fine.

90
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,930
So he closed when we found the position of the hyphen.

91
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,050
We then need to subtract one.

92
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,460
As you can see in this first example,

93
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,630
the hyphen is in position.

94
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,250
Five.

95
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,040
We don't want the 1st 5 characters.

96
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,250
We want the 1st 4 so we now need minus one,

97
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,950
and that completes our left function.

98
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,700
So just press old enter and put the clothes in parenthesis on a separate line.

99
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,110
So when we press center,

100
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,910
we'll see we have all the characters before the hype in.

101
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,150
If I copied down that it works both for three letters on four letters.

102
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,950
In reality,

103
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,760
we probably wouldn't bother to have a separate column just for the item code.

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,300
What we really need to know is the name of the item.

105
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,990
But in a learning scenario is always useful to have a look at these things in isolation on

106
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,250
Just look at the components that go together to make up the whole.

107
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:04,370
So what we can do now is to highlight all of this and copy it Amanda's press escape to come

108
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,750
out of formula editing.

109
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:13,690
And now we can use to be look up function to look up the item code that we've extracted in

110
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,150
columns A and B,

111
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,350
all the adjacent work she called items.

112
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:27,550
So here we using the V look up function to retrieve the name of the item that was hired

113
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,950
that we look up function takes four parameters.

114
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,550
First of all,

115
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,680
the look at value,

116
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,750
this is the information that you already have.

117
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,920
So in the case of Sally to,

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,650
we would want to look up as MTBE.

119
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:49,350
Next we have the table of Ray where you looking all that value.

120
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,550
So we'll be looking in the adjacent work feed cool items in Collins A and B,

121
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,350
and the third argument is the column index number within the look up table.

122
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,650
Which column contains the answer,

123
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,870
and it's always the Americ.

124
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,550
So we put two and not be.

125
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,830
And then the final parameter range look up specifies whether you're looking for an exact

126
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,430
match or an approximate one because we're looking for an exact match.

127
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,550
We put the word falls so the lost three arguments is straight forward.

128
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,700
But first we need to use a function which will extract the characters that we want to look

129
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,630
up on.

130
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,140
The function use is,

131
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,750
of course,

132
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:47,950
the left so equals the look up old mentor and paste.

133
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,150
I mean,

134
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,390
losses press the space,

135
00:07:51,390 --> 00:08:09,750
but it's have everything in So all of this becomes the first argument of the look up,

136
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,630
which is,

137
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,950
you can see is look up value.

138
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:21,150
So we put a comma all 10 and then on to the second argument would be look up,

139
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,250
which is the table of Ray.

140
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,190
This,

141
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,610
of course,

142
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,710
is in the adjacent worksheet items.

143
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,860
We want the 1st 2 columns A and B calmer Walt enter,

144
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:40,570
and then we simply specify which column in that table contains the answer and this is

145
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,790
always numeric.

146
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:48,150
So it's not be it's too calmer or center.

147
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:55,390
And then in the final parameter that the look up we use false to indicate that we want an

148
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,990
exact match Old and,

149
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,550
uh and in the closing parenthesis for me Look up.

150
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,930
So when we press center waken see,

151
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:12,780
that s nbt refers to a Samsung tablet and we can then just copy the formula down.

152
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:20,850
So there we have a very typical combination Well manipulating text,

153
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,750
namely left and such.

154
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,790
In the next video,

155
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,180
we'll move on to look at combine in mid and search No.
