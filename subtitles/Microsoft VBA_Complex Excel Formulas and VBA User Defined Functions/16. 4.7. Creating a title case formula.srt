1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,420
in this video,

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,370
we'll get some more practice on using the brute pool substitution technique that we saw in

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,250
the last video.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,550
So zero for manipulating text that's going to number seven,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,450
creating a title case formula.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,860
But what we want to do in this example,

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:33,040
is to come up with a formula which will transform the text in this color into dramatically

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,350
correct titles.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,280
Now,

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,330
as you probably know,

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,550
Excel has a function called proper,

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,750
which will capitalize the first letter image word.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,100
This doesn't always give a viable title.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,350
Let's put it to the test.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,950
Let's begin by inside in the colon.

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,590
And then we could copy the title,

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,350
had her across and then just use equals proper.

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,680
Press the left.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,640
Arum to reference the adjacent a two and enter on the first couple of titles.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,750
We have no problems.

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,550
When we get to titles three and four.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:24,030
We can see that a off and should all be in lower case If I move across to the other

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,050
worksheet that we have here in lower case list.

24
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,630
I've got a list of other words and phrases that should always be in lower case when they

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,750
occur in the title,

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,170
and I should add that I've made no great efforts to make this list complete.

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,530
So you are using this technique in a real life situation.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,550
The onus is on you to actually come up with a list they to improve on the proper function.

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:54,220
What we can do is having applied the proper function to a to We can then use our fruitful

30
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,650
substitution 10 week to replace all of these words with their lower case equivalents

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,050
whenever they occur in its idle.

32
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,550
So let's just undo all of that.

33
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,750
But leave the new column in place,

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:17,590
and it's now open up our template so that a second template 07 substitution template it is

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,650
currently blank.

36
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,160
Here's the formula that we put together in the last video,

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,350
so we just need to copy all of those words into the old text column.

38
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,720
However,

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,150
we can't copy the words as they are.

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,900
For example,

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,920
if we change every occurrence of a the indefinite article to its lower case equivalent,

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,570
all words beginning with a would also become lower case and hear the word Andes would also

43
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,340
become low case because it starts with a nd so what we need to do is to make sure that we

44
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,550
have in place these words when they are recognized as words.

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,550
Nicole's what makes them recognize the buzzwords is where they're preceded by a space

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,050
notice I say preceded rather than followed.

47
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,880
Because,

48
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,280
of course,

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,710
if one of these words is the first word within a title,

50
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,060
it shouldn't be converted to lower case on.

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,740
The formula for doing this is fairly straightforward because and then the space has to go

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,050
double quotes and percent.

53
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,750
I'll just press the left arrow to reference they won and that sound formula.

54
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:40,200
And then we just company that down So you can see by the slight in dende at the start of

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,250
each of these entries.

56
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,250
We've now been a space inserted before each of these words and phrases.

57
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,350
So this is what we copy into our time place.

58
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:56,710
And of course,

59
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,280
we don't want to pace the formula.

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:07,150
We want to paste values then for the new text.

61
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,250
In other words,

62
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,950
detects that we want to convert this into we simply use equals lower press the left an

63
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,850
arrow to pick up you,

64
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:25,140
Jason itself on enter and then we can copy to fool me that down and then to build our final

65
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,850
formula,

66
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,650
we just need to specify the cell that were initially applying the substitute to.

67
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,650
So we go back into the worksheet titles.

68
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,610
That cell,

69
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,070
of course,

70
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,950
is a to,

71
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,880
but what we want a blind,

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,350
too,

73
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,550
is the proper version of A to and I'll template.

74
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,470
We need to type proper brackets.

75
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:52,700
A.

76
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,140
To that sounds starting formula was certainly a space,

77
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,060
followed by other case,

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,950
a changing into space,

79
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,750
followed by love in case A.

80
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,930
Then,

81
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,000
as I copy that down uses,

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,650
the Saleh bothers the input,

83
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,650
the men does the second substitution the third and so forth.

84
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,750
So we simply copy these all the way to the bottom.

85
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:24,880
All of these values then get substituted with the values in column C on the final or villa

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,650
contains all of their substitution Sylvester one that we copy.

87
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,340
And of course,

88
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:37,250
the reason I have to paste this into the text editor that he copious several in excel.

89
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,150
You can only paste it into another cell,

90
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,180
so we need to get it onto the general clipboard,

91
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,460
pasting it into a text.

92
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,650
Eggs are like night pad will do the drink.

93
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,150
So here's our formula.

94
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,750
Unlisted selected all on Copy it.

95
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,750
Now we're ready to build our final formula.

96
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,070
That's just expand the formula bar.

97
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,750
So this time what we have on the clipboard is literally all they'll need.

98
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,650
So we just begin with an equal sign and then we based everything.

99
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,850
And that's our completed formula.

100
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:35,050
So let's copy it down so we can see it's working off the A etcetera.

101
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,650
All of these words are now in lower case.

102
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,750
But when they care at the start of the title,

103
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,050
such as The Lord of the Rings,

104
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,850
you'll see that the upper case initial letter is retained.

105
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,080
The only problem I can see is on this line.

106
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,550
Gulliver's Travels,

107
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:00,770
where we have Apostrophe s Excel is treated the apostrophe as being the end of one word and

108
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,950
therefore s is the beginning of another word.

109
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,550
So we obviously need to modify our template to take this into account.

110
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,360
Now,

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,000
this is not to say that every time we have an apostrophe,

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,350
we now have to look at the following letter and make sure it's lower case.

113
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,570
If you think about it,

114
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,250
Apostrophe s is the only problem,

115
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,440
say,

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,350
for example,

117
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,850
it Swift had called his hero Ohara instead of Gulliver.

118
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,020
So the book title was actually Oh,

119
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,250
Horace travels.

120
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,740
We wouldn't want the age to become lower case.

121
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,260
We would want it to stay uppercase.

122
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,770
So apostrophe s is really the only thing that we need to change the lower case and the

123
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,650
logical way of doing that just to bring back out templates,

124
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:59,440
add it to the bottom and put the lower case substitution.

125
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,580
Now,

126
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,850
apostrophe has a special meaning in excel,

127
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,050
so we can't simply type apostrophe uppercase s.

128
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,490
Instead,

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,200
what we'll have to do is to use a formula to generate that string equals quotes.

130
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,980
And then inside the quotes,

131
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:28,550
we put apostrophe uppercase s and then replace that with the equivalent lower case formula

132
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,950
equals quotes,

133
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,350
apostrophes low case s close quotes.

134
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,320
So by doing that with Force in Excel,

135
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,650
to treat the apostrophe is a literal string instead of assuming that it has a special

136
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,280
function,

137
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,550
as it normally does.

138
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,470
And of course,

139
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,650
that special function is to indicate that we have a number stores text,

140
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,950
so we just need to add that into a formula.

141
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:04,090
And we do that by copying the formula down and then we'll just copy that new version.

142
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,470
So,

143
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:07,850
really,

144
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,650
this one,

145
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,450
Just paste it here for safekeeping.

146
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,410
A man just copy it into our solution.

147
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:23,550
So what goes?

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,560
No place is the new fashion,

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:39,730
so we can see that we've killed the problem you've now put on Horace travels.

150
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,450
Better change that back to Gulliver's Travels.

151
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:50,680
So if you try this in a real scenario,

152
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,550
I'm sure you'll also come up with other anomalies.

153
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,620
This will be especially true.

154
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,560
Perhaps if you're not working in English,

155
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,610
you're working with languages that have accents and so forth.

156
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,320
You may find that there are anomalies that you need Teoh take into account.

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,350
But hopefully simply by using this technique of brutal substitution,

158
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,500
you could just come up with substitution strings which will solve all of these problems for

159
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,750
you.
