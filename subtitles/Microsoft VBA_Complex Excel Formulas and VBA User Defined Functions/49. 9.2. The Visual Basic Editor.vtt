00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.950
now that we've made our develop it on visible,

2
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.100
we're ready to start looking at the environment in which you create your user defined

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.950
functions.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:26.660
And this is called a visual basic editor in 09 Getting Started With Bebe au D EFs Let's now

5
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.440
have not zero to the visual basic editor When you click on the developer,

6
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.930
tap the very first command that you'll see on the left.

7
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.550
Visual Basic takes you into the visual basic editor,

8
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.750
and this is the environment in which you do all your BB a Cody.

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.650
You'll notice that this environment differs from Excel.

10
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.500
It doesn't have the familiar ribbon and ribbon.

11
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.470
Tam's has the old school menus,

12
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.010
two of ours and floating windows.

13
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.100
And,

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.850
as with Excel 2003 in previous,

15
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.450
if you go to the View menu,

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.260
you'll find a list of all the available tool bars and you'll find a command to hide and

17
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.250
show all of the floating windows.

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.380
Let's just close thes floating when those down.

19
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.410
So if you've got any open,

20
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.150
just closed them all so we can get an idea of what they call.

21
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.950
The most essential of these floating windows is the one called Project Explorer.

22
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.900
Without this,

23
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.550
you can't get started.

24
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.550
So let's get a view into his Project Explorer.

25
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.950
The term project in the context of V B.

26
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.350
A.

27
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.520
Simply means the container or all your VB a code B B A can be implemented in several

28
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.450
different ways.

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.910
For example,

30
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.290
you're probably familiar with the concept of macros,

31
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.950
which were used for automation.

32
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550
It's also possible to write BB,

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.530
a code which executes automatically based on actions performed by the user on the way that

34
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.850
VB a works is determined by the container inside of which you put your VB a code.

35
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.380
And we'll be discussing the containers which applying to use the defined functions in the

36
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.350
next video.

37
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.040
The second most essential of these floating windows is the properties window.

38
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.050
So let's go to you and Properties Window,

39
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.710
and we could just resize that so we can see both the Project Explorer on the properties

40
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.250
window.

41
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.710
The properties window,

42
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.030
as the name suggests,

43
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.690
allows you to change the properties or attributes of any of the objects that you got in the

44
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.900
Project Explorer,

45
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.030
and we'll be using it from time to time as we write out code at the moment Let's look at a

46
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.730
useful facility provided by the Properties Window.

47
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.530
What's come out of the visual?

48
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.550
Basic editor.

49
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.200
We couldn't do that either.

50
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.220
By close individual basic editor.

51
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.710
So here on closing the visual basic editor,

52
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.650
I haven't closed Excel itself.

53
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.420
Let's go back inside country.

54
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.850
The second method on the second method is simply to switch back to excel,

55
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.650
leaving the visual basic,

56
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.050
and it's a window open.

57
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.970
You can obviously do this from the task Bob.

58
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.150
Simply click on Excel to reveal a windows and then switch to the Excel window.

59
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.700
1/3 method is to press the keyboard shortcut,

60
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.450
which is walled 11.

61
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.450
And,

62
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.860
of course,

63
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.150
you don't need to make a special effort to remember that every time you hope her over the

64
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.880
visual basic and it's a button,

65
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.350
Excel will remind you of the short cut,

66
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.180
so I'm gonna press halt at 11.

67
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.740
I'm individual basic editor,

68
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.770
also 11.

69
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.520
Again.

70
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.750
I'm back in Excel so you can use any of those methods to switch between the two

71
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.650
environments.

72
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:08.110
So let's go back to excel on what I want to show you is a useful feature for hiding work

73
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.650
leads,

74
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.470
So I got a couple of worksheets here If I right click on the one called Hide Lee Andrews

75
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.040
hide as I'm sure you've done in the past that tab is then hidden If I right click and

76
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.200
choose a new hide the hidden tab is available and I can then click OK to make it visible

77
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.700
again.

78
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.720
However,

79
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.950
if we go into the visual basic editor and find these two worksheets So here we can see

80
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.140
inside Microsoft Excel objects.

81
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.450
We have sheet too.

82
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.050
And in parentheses we have the interface name the tab name,

83
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.750
which I simply called Hide me and then we've got a 2nd 1 called very high bay.

84
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.150
So what we conduce you in the properties window is with this sheet selected,

85
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.650
we go to the final property as well as Excel Sheet Hidden,

86
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.640
which is the equivalent command to the action that I pulled a moment ago.

87
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.550
We have Excel sheets very hidden.

88
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.330
So if we choose this when we go back to excel,

89
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.150
the work she's is hidden.

90
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.350
But the difference is that if I now right click,

91
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.650
you'll see that unhygienic is great out.

92
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:33.690
So the user hasn't been given a clue that this sheet exists so That's just an example off

93
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.310
using the properties window.

94
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.260
So for the moment,

95
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.290
let's leave it at that.

96
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.850
We've got the Project Explorer on,

97
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.430
We have the properties window,

98
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.070
and in the next video,

99
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.150
we'll move on to look at actually writing our first user defined function.
