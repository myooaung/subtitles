1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,620
let's now move on to look at nested.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:18,680
If statements what would be doing in this example?

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,210
It's a sign in a status to each of the accounts listed in this worksheet,

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,050
and these are the criteria that will be using.

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,250
I should just explain one quirk that you'll notice in this streak.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,910
The days overdue column contains static values on the date.

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,450
Do Kahlan contains a calculation to display that they do.

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,650
And obviously,

9
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,250
in a really scenario,

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,540
the reverse would be true.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,530
We would have static values here,

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,170
which indicated when the account was due and then would have a calculation here to work out

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,450
how many days do each account waas.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,770
So just to explain,

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,700
I've done that for training purposes so that we can both have exactly the same thing on our

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,550
screens.

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:10,270
So to calculate the status we're going to use these criteria 120 days or greater status is

18
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,970
bad.

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,950
Mind your greater aged on DSO four.

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,450
When you use invested of statements to test numerical values,

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,520
it's always best to start with the highest value.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,050
Work your way down to the low study.

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,940
This means that you don't need compound testing.

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,550
Don't need to say between 1920 between 60 and 90 etcetera.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,950
The reason for this is the way that Excel will evaluate the X statements.

26
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,050
So we take the first road as an example.

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,910
We've got days over.

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:46,350
You have 20 by eliminating the highest value with our first test,

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,050
what we come to do our second test.

30
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,350
We know that the value is less than 120 because if it weren't,

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,650
the second test would never even take place.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,450
That we need to test for each time is the next one down.

33
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,840
Our test will simply to say great to them.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,050
Regal to it will never need to say both.

35
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:17,040
Greater panel recall two and less than so before we go ahead and write the formula,

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,020
let's have a brief discussion of how invested its work in Excel when they hear the term

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,850
nice two days,

38
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:32,210
a lot of people will visualize a structure whereby you have one if statement with several.

39
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:39,010
If statements nested inside that one if and this is not actually the case,

40
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,550
this isn't how it works.

41
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:48,660
A better way of visualize invested ifs is to think of a Russian doll arrangement whereby

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,450
each if statement is nested inside the previous one.

43
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,430
So going back to our days overdue example.

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,600
Let's say that we have a cell that contains 20 days overdue.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Let's just run that career unless they've structure.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,250
So we start without outta if the one that contains all the others.

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,450
And like all if statements,

48
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:20,470
it has its street reminisces for the logical test for the outer if is gonna be days overdue

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,470
,

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:27,800
greater than or equal to 120 on the value of true will be the word bad that clearly our

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,250
cell contains 20 so that's gonna be evaluated to falls.

52
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,950
But instead of having a literal value,

53
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,650
people's we need to do some further testing.

54
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,940
So the value of falls is supplied by another,

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,850
if statement.

56
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:53,960
And so we have a statement to nested inside if statement one via the value of false

57
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,790
parameter.

58
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:02,050
So if statement to becomes the value of false parameter off if statement one.

59
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:09,370
And that's how the structure works on our second if statement were tested to see if the

60
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,230
days overdue is greater than or equal to 90 and if it were,

61
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,750
we put the word aged into the cell since 20 isn't greater than or equal to 90.

62
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:25,070
We need the value it false and again that is supplied by another,

63
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,050
if statement.

64
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,940
So we move on to its statement.

65
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,880
Number three,

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,670
which test to see the value of you is greater than or equal to 60.

67
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,730
If it were,

68
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,970
it would put the word of the do that.

69
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,720
Since it's not,

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,250
we go to Value Falls,

71
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:49,360
which is supplied by the final if statement on the final or innermost.

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,150
If statement,

73
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,150
we test to see what these over here is greater than or equal to 30.

74
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,450
If it were,

75
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,850
we would supply the man do.

76
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,750
But since it's not,

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,550
and since we've done along the testing that we want,

78
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,820
we supply the value,

79
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,010
not do the literal value,

80
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,940
so you can see that it's only the in the most.

81
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,250
If that has a literal value for value falls.

82
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,880
In the case of all of the other ifs,

83
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,050
the value of falls is being calculated by another nested it statement.

84
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,150
So now let's move back to excel and create the formula.

85
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,840
So we're in the status column e to let's increase the size on hold,

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,050
and then we'll split the formula into multiple lines.

87
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,450
We start with the outer if statement,

88
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,150
and we're testing the highest value.

89
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:59,150
The Selva testing is D to on the highest value is 120 the greater than or equal to 120 coma

90
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,150
.

91
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,440
And then,

92
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,150
as Excel is prompting us here we're onto the value is true.

93
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,900
If true,

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,720
we want the word bad to appear in the self on because that's text.

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,330
It does,

96
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,790
of course,

97
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,250
have to go in double quotes.

98
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,450
So now we come to 1/3 parameter value in bowls,

99
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,650
and this is where we implement our nested if structure,

100
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,200
instead of putting a literal value for the value false.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,250
We put another it function.

102
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,850
Let's put that on a new line.

103
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:37,490
Old enter for a new line Tremendous hit the space bar to move along underneath the first

104
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,150
argument.

105
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,550
So now we need another If and again we're testing D to.

106
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,920
So what I'll do is to just copy this first test and then we can use that as our starting

107
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,210
point.

108
00:06:50,210 --> 00:07:08,490
Each time I'll do all my paste in now old enter on old enter.

109
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,850
So just explain why I've done that.

110
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,550
We're testing or values 1 2090 60 on 30.

111
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:27,640
So we're now need to do is to train these values and then change the status associated with

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,210
each one so aged.

113
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:37,860
What do you and not do?

114
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,960
So,

115
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:48,150
Having eliminated 1 2090 60 and 30 we now know that if none of these proved to be true,

116
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,370
the status needs to be not do so.

117
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,220
We don't need any further test in.

118
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,110
We can finally supply a literal value.

119
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:04,660
The value balls value falls has been supplied each time that it's been supplied by another

120
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:04,660
,

121
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,540
if statement.

122
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,050
So within this structure,

123
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,700
each of the statements has as its third argument,

124
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,650
value it false.

125
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,350
Another if statement.

126
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:20,550
And it's only the innermost statement that has a literal value as it's patently false.

127
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,160
So let's put this on the new line as well.

128
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,350
Or Cantor space bar across men in double quotes you need not do.

129
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,760
Let's have finished the formula.

130
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,650
We've used four if statements and put in opening parenthesis after each one.

131
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:49,150
We therefore now need all match in closing parentheses to finish the Formula 1234 and we

132
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:55,870
don't let's restore the normal height.

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,510
That formula bar and just copy before then.

134
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,650
They're down by move into the also feel handle and double click in.

135
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:08,650
That's how nested ifs work.

136
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,800
If you're struggling to understand them,

137
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,450
just think of Russian dolls.

138
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,870
Lester.

139
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,250
That's can be quite complex and convoluted.

140
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,250
So in the next two videos,

141
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,730
what discuss alternatives to use in the next city of structure?
