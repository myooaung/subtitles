00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
In the last video,

2
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.130
we focused on the application object,

3
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.950
which represents Excel itself.

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.750
In this video look of working with a couple of properties of the workbook object.

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:29.650
So we working in Folder 10 KBB A concepts.

6
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.050
It's no open 05 displaying work but properties.

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.220
In this example.

8
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.270
We have a workbook info,

9
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.150
work feet,

10
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.240
and this might be used where a company has a policy off,

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.800
always filling in document properties.

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.210
Let me just remind you where document properties live,

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.790
file info and then I'm right.

14
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.770
We have properties and click here we can get into the balance properties and that you can

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.750
see I fell down most of the categories.

16
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.860
So when we opened the workbook,

17
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.550
we want the workbook info tab to display all of those document properties,

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.600
and we also want to display the entire path to where this particular work look insane.

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.620
It's just a way of allowing to distinguish this workbook from others with a civil,

20
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.660
and they so you can just remind yourself of the physical location or this particular

21
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.350
document.

22
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.050
So let's write down code.

23
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.090
First,

24
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.470
we'll need a module and I put in the module in the workbook as opposed to the personal

25
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.250
workbook.

26
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.200
Let's rename it workbook info.

27
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.050
So Emma workbook info.

28
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:06.370
Then we click in the code window to activate it and goes inside procedure all the function

29
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.850
time,

30
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.190
so we'll need to functions.

31
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.350
The 1st 1 displays the path,

32
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.790
so we'll call that one workbook past.

33
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.650
We don't need any arguments that nothing goes inside the parentheses,

34
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.650
but we always need to specify the type of data produced by the function.

35
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.120
We do that with the key,

36
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.310
but as And of course,

37
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.750
the path is a string,

38
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.470
and then we can write one line function.

39
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.250
So one line function should always start with the keyword.

40
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.690
Let because we're assigning a value to abate a container.

41
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.060
In this case,

42
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.050
the workbook parents function.

43
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.950
So let's work but pomace equal.

44
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.100
Then we've got to find the syntax for the past of the workbook that contains this function

45
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.100
.

46
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.120
So if you remember,

47
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.270
we've got a special way of saying,

48
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.850
but workbook that contains this function and that is application,

49
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.050
not this workbook.

50
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.020
And then it's gonna be dot something,

51
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.950
and in fact,

52
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.850
there are three properties relating to the name and location off a workbook.

53
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.990
First of all,

54
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.750
we simply have not name.

55
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:41.280
And if we simply copy that into our new best friend,

56
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.930
the immediate window you remember you type a question mark and then he can execute any

57
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.430
statements because you can see name is purely the name of the workbook.

58
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.650
It doesn't give us any clue as to where the work is saved.

59
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:05.640
The second property is dot path and it was roll over.

60
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.500
You can see that that is folded 10 inside of which this file is actually saved.

61
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.250
So that's two parts of the puzzle.

62
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.550
We know where it saved and we know what it's called.

63
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.330
And the third property combines the two.

64
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.380
And that is Stop,

65
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.250
Full name,

66
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.270
right,

67
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.700
of course,

68
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.850
is the one that we want.

69
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.650
You'll see that after the folder,

70
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.220
it actually continues and gives us the full power.

71
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.940
So that's the property we need here,

72
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.280
Dr.

73
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.990
Full name.

74
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.250
And that's our function.

75
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.750
We can press that it hasn't got any errors.

76
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.150
I'm leaving.

77
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.460
Then go straight ahead and use.

78
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.780
It equals work,

79
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.650
but path enter.

80
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:08.550
Now let's do the same for our document properties,

81
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.210
Incent procedure,

82
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.320
time name,

83
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.710
document properties.

84
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:27.050
And this time we will need an argument.

85
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.500
The text in column A will be the argument that determines which document property is

86
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.950
displayed in column B.

87
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.800
A logical name for the argument would be property,

88
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.570
and it cools its a string.

89
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.150
The function itself also returns a string,

90
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:58.350
and again we can get away with a one lying function.

91
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:09.460
So let's name of function equal application,

92
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:19.080
not this workbook on the property we need is called Got Built in document properties as

93
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.270
opposed to custom document properties and then in parentheses,

94
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.050
we specify which one.

95
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.220
And of course,

96
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.250
the mechanism that we're using is to use the parameter,

97
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.650
the argument as the property.

98
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:41.550
So we simply put the name of the argument inside the parentheses,

99
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:49.670
and then whatever we pick up in column A will determine which document property is

100
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.070
displayed on that road.

101
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:58.150
So it compiles okay on to use it.

102
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.150
We've got one further thing to Ryan out.

103
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.310
We have the text,

104
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.850
we have the name of the property,

105
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.550
but we also have a colon,

106
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:13.480
so we'll need to get rid of the colon before whatever is in Colin A can be used as the

107
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.550
argument for our function,

108
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.350
but we know how to do that we use the substitute Gulshan.

109
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:27.930
So this is our first example or combining one of our user defined functions with a built in

110
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.050
excel function.

111
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.460
So we invest in the substitute function.

112
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.350
Inside our music defying function.

113
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.050
So equals document properties,

114
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:46.050
or pensar and then we're nest in substitutes.

115
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:58.050
The text is a to former all text is colon coma.

116
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.150
New text is nothing.

117
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.550
In other words,

118
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.520
quotes,

119
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.250
quotes,

120
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.280
close parentheses,

121
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:13.440
substitute old and and the closing Prentice's or our Document Properties function.

122
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:20.250
It picks up out cycle army and then copy down,

123
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.650
and it picks up each of the other document properties.
