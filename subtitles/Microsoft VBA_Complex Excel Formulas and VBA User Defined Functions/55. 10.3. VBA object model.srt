1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,420
as well as the Excel object.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,900
Model B B A itself provides a lot of syntax.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,450
Buyer The BB A object model,

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:26,130
The V B A object model consists of a series of useful functions divided into different

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,350
classifications.

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,750
A lot of these functions relate to the manipulation of data,

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,340
and they directly equivalent to some of excels.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,650
Work three functions.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,130
So,

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,000
for example,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,850
most of the functions in the strings classification are equivalent to excel text functions

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:46,850
,

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,430
and similarly,

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,850
we have data time,

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,050
miss information.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,850
So these are all useful things that you conduce to manipulate data,

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,350
many of which are equivalent to the familiar territory of using Excel functions.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,350
So let's take just one example off using a BB A function.

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,400
Let's go back into the previous folder,

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,350
number nine,

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,550
and open up the first user defined function that we rose.

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,050
And if you remember this,

23
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,250
simply insert a piece of text.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,030
Let's say that we prefer to split this text onto two lines so it's displayed in a large

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,390
cell.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,740
Let's make this a larger,

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,350
and the cell has wrapped text activated.

28
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,650
So let's say we want copyright City smart limited,

29
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,750
then a return,

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,950
and the rest of the statement.

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:03,000
So that's going to developer on visual basic on before we actually modify the function.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,580
Let me just point out that the Object browser,

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,690
which we saw earlier,

34
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,450
can also be used to check BB a syntax.

35
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:18,070
So let's go back into view object browser and then choose the V B A library.

36
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,730
So here we've got the different classes that we saw earlier on the one we're going to use

37
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,950
his constants.

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,690
Now we've got the VCR,

39
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,610
carrot return,

40
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,950
BBC RLF carriage return line feed on VB LF line feed.

41
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,150
And obviously,

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,650
in the context of a cell,

43
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,430
there's no difference.

44
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,680
If you exported the text and opened it in a word processor,

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,450
then carried return line feed will always to give you a paragraph.

46
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,150
Where's the other two will give you a line break.

47
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:59,560
So all we want to do here is to split this text,

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,650
so I'm gonna speak it now onto three lines.

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,860
So let's terminate the string here,

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,350
put an ampersand space on the school to split the line,

51
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,050
create a new line and then reopen the quotation marks.

52
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,620
So although we've got three physical lines,

53
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:26,700
we have one logical line of code on what we now want to do is after this statement to

54
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,250
insert a line feed so we can just click here until I m percent.

55
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,450
And when you type in BB A functions,

56
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,210
a useful thing is to type the function longhand.

57
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,700
So it stands out,

58
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,480
becomes very conspicuous whenever you look at it.

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,750
You know that V be a function has been used at that point.

60
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:54,380
So we would type B B a dots and then the intel a sense this auto completion pops up and

61
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,910
gives us a lot of different baby A functions if you remember when looking inside the

62
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:04,750
constants class and when we took the second dot we get all the different options.

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,350
So I'm just gonna use V b l f A line feed,

64
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,750
and that's it.

65
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,580
So,

66
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,150
having updated out function,

67
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:25,380
if I just add in the cell and you'll see our line feed character kicks in and splits the

68
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,150
string onto two lives.

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,710
So he now looked at the three different parts of the V B.

70
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,980
A syntax puzzle.

71
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,770
We have BB a syntax structures such as if statements,

72
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,400
loops,

73
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,050
etcetera.

74
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,130
Then we have the Excel object mobile,

75
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,050
and then we have the V b a object model.

76
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,960
So as we go through the course,

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,110
I'll just keep coming back to those three themes,

78
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,320
so hopefully you'll have a good idea of what's being contributed by each of these three

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,050
aspects.
