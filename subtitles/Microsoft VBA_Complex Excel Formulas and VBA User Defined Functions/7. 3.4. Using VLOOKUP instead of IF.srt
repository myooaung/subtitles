1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,770
when you use investor tips to test numeric values.

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,540
What alternative is to use the V look up function?

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,200
Let's take an example that's open 04 Use envy.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,220
Look up instead of it.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,110
So here we have the same example that we've used in the last two videos and since the

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,650
criteria that we want to use are laid out in a table,

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:41,140
we could use this as I will look up table and then simply use the look up as an alternative

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,690
to having the If logic on the only provides er is that we've arranged our table in

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,750
ascending order.

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,550
So we have a numeric values in the first column,

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,240
and they've been sorted in ascending order.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,780
So the B look up will automatically take each of the values in column D and compare them to

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,050
the values in the first column of the look up table.

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,750
So it will start on this column,

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,550
and in the case of D two,

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,590
it's gonna compare 20 to the cell below on because the number below is greater.

17
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,350
It wouldn't move down.

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,130
It will stay on these roads,

19
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,480
and we can then move across the column,

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,150
too,

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,250
to see what status is appropriate for that value.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:36,740
So the if logic that we implemented manually is implemented automatically by the V Look up

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,450
function.

24
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,140
There's no nesting required on this one,

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,240
so we can just write it.

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,510
Alarm online equals B.

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,250
Look up,

28
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,150
and then we have our four parameters.

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,840
Look up values,

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,310
of course.

31
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,150
E to.

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,970
If it's difficult to click on the selling one,

33
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,530
remember,

34
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,460
you can always press the arrow keys to move to the soul.

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,880
So here I'm gonna press the left era comma for second values table array.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,200
We could simply drag across the column.

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,920
Headings like this G and H and level,

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,310
of course,

39
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,260
include the title,

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,850
which being text is just equivalent to zero.

41
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,210
If we wanted to have just the values he could drag cross posed.

42
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,080
But of course we have to remember to press at all to insert the dollar signs so that when

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,110
we copy the table values,

44
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,350
they're still being addressed.

45
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:38,050
My own personal preferences wherever possible to track across the column headings coma.

46
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,580
Then we specify the column within the look up table,

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,950
which contains the answer that we want to display.

48
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,520
So it's a two column table and the answer is in the second column off at two column table.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,600
So he put it to on not an H that this third parameter is always knew.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,020
Married.

51
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,550
It's never letter about given column.

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,780
And then,

53
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,690
finally,

54
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,210
at Excel promises.

55
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,250
Are we looking for an approximate match or an exact match?

56
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,590
And in this case,

57
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,180
of course,

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,550
looking for an approximate match.

59
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,850
We just want to put each of these numeric values into the appropriate band,

60
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,150
and that's it.

61
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,130
We don't even need to put the clothes in parenthesis because there's no nest in so we can

62
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,380
just presenter on Excel will insert it for us.

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,750
We can then coming down.

64
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,250
So if you do find yourself using a nest,

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,480
if which has lots of possible values or is purely numeric,

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,550
as in this case,

67
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,720
and you might consider just constructing a look up table could be on a hidden work feet

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,890
even on then using that to implement the logic rather than having what often becomes a very

69
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,750
complex nested.

70
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,850
If structure
