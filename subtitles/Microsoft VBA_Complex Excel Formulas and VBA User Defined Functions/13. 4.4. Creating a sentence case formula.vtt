00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.450
If you're a user of Microsoft Word,

2
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.950
you're almost certainly familiar with sentence case.

3
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.560
Seven example.

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.450
Here I can select all of these lines and go to change case and then choose sentence case

5
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.930
and you'll notice that word capitalizes.

6
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.250
The first letter on each line,

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.460
although Excel has functions,

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.750
will change in the case.

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.250
It doesn't offer a sentence case option,

10
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.390
so we're going to create a formula which does just that.

11
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.350
And for good measure,

12
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.850
we'll put a full stop at the end as well.

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:57.250
So we're working in zero for manipulating text.

14
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.950
That's no open up 04 creating a sentence case formula.

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.560
So here we have a worksheet,

16
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.150
which records I t support calls,

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.250
and we want to tidy up Colin E.

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.650
We'll notice that the case is inconsistent,

19
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.740
I say,

20
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.420
for reporting purposes we'd like toe have each Hendry start with a capital letter so and

21
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.650
end with a full stop.

22
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:38.850
So to do this will use the concatenation operator M percent,

23
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.030
So the first thing we'll do is to extract the first character and converted to uppercase so

24
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.030
we'll use the upper function on this takes a single argument,

25
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.650
which is referred to as text,

26
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.640
and that's the cell that you want to convert to a case.

27
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.680
But instead of a cell reference E to which would imply the entire entry,

28
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.050
we use the left function to extract.

29
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.050
The first letter,

30
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.490
as we've seen with a function,

31
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.970
requires two arguments the text that you want to operate on,

32
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.450
which is me too.

33
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.270
I have a number of characters you want to extract,

34
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.640
starting from the left,

35
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.960
which is of course,

36
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.650
one.

37
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.210
Then we use the concatenation operator,

38
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.950
but essentially means followed by what we then once I have.

39
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.250
Is all of the characters within two bar the first letter.

40
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.500
So we use the right function to achieve.

41
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.450
This takes two parameters.

42
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.350
The text that you operating on launch again is E to and then the number of characters.

43
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.190
To calculate this,

44
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.450
we use the length function as in lens,

45
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.950
which has a single argument.

46
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.350
The string that you want to know the land called.

47
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.300
That of course,

48
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.350
is to,

49
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.380
but we don't want to tag on the entire string.

50
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.780
We want to tag on the string bother first letter.

51
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.810
So after the close in parenthesis of the land function we need to put minus one.

52
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.950
So let's create a new column.

53
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.470
Well,

54
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.350
just initially copy everything.

55
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.650
So we've got the formats the same and then deletes all of these entries.

56
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.970
And as usual,

57
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.490
I'm gonna expand the formula bar on.

58
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.950
Let's create our formula.

59
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.550
So the first component is upper equals upper.

60
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.230
We nest in the left function.

61
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.550
So I'm gonna use old enter left.

62
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.550
The text is too comer on a number of characters is one,

63
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.650
and that completes the upper function.

64
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.650
Then we need an percent 57 frickin castle nation.

65
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.630
Well,

66
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.870
and,

67
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.250
uh,

68
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.590
and now we need the right function on because it will have Len nested inside it on diesel

69
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.550
tender again.

70
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:27.520
How text he to call me goaltender.

71
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.290
But the number of characters we use,

72
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:44.350
Len E to minus one or cancer on the clothes in parenthesis for the right function.

73
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.030
And then finally,

74
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.000
I'm going to tag on using ampersand and,

75
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.380
of course,

76
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.180
quotes.

77
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.550
Full stop.

78
00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:00.060
So we extract in the first character capitalising eggs,

79
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.550
and then can Captain Eytan starting from the right.

80
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:14.940
All the characters inside e to which we pick up using lend me to bother first that we do

81
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.950
that simply by saying minus one,

82
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.890
and then we take it on the whole.

83
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.440
So and that's it.

84
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.400
So here we've got a tidied up version off the original entry.

85
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.080
Ondas.

86
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.350
We copy that down.

87
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.550
All of the entries now resemble sentences.
