00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.850
in this video,

2
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.020
we'll move on to look at the summit's function,

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.610
which differs from the sun.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.130
If function that we saw in the last video in that you can specify multiple criteria and at

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.750
the same time we'll discuss the use of wildcard matches.

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.350
06 manipulated numbers that's open up 03 using wild cards with some apes.

7
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.360
Let's first of all,

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.190
have a look at the model that we're building and I'll item sales worksheet.

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.660
We have a record of all the items that were soul,

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.750
the account handler,

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.640
the product and the total price on what we're interested in doing in our summary worksheets

12
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.920
is focusing on the performance of our account handlers and then get in there total sales

13
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.410
average transaction,

14
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.870
minimum transaction,

15
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.350
maximum transaction.

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.160
But at the same time,

17
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.450
we want to offer the user the possibility,

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:20.390
focusing on a particular product range so they can either specify figures for all ranges or

19
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.750
for a particular range.

20
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.610
And finally,

21
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.330
to get ourselves that challenge how item sales figures have no product range.

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.840
Colin.

23
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.740
They know that's a match.

24
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:41.730
The product we need to focus on the 1st 2 letters off the product reference because The 1st

25
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.870
2 letters of the product reference are the same as the 1st 2 letters of the name of the

26
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.850
product range,

27
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.150
and this will give us a chance to see how wildcard matches have done when you're working

28
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.520
with any of excels,

29
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.890
conditional number crunching functions such as some if averages etcetera.

30
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.250
To add clarity to the formulas that will build,

31
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.250
it's also used main ranges.

32
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.280
Hopefully,

33
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.950
you're familiar with named Rangers.

34
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.950
Let's go across the item sales,

35
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.640
and we're really interested in account,

36
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.550
handler product and total price.

37
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.210
But in the interests of completeness,

38
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.450
let's name all of the columns,

39
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.010
and we've got the choice of either attaching the name to the entire column or simply to the

40
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.750
cells that are filled with data.

41
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.600
Since these figures are historical,

42
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.850
let's use the latter technique and just focus on the cells that have data.

43
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.090
So to do that,

44
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.830
we click in cell,

45
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.910
a one press control ship right arrow,

46
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.530
followed by control ship Down Arrow that's elects all the data and then to create the named

47
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.260
ranges.

48
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.360
We can go to formulas and then the defined names group click on Create from Selection,

49
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.500
and we then just tell excel to create the names using the column headings in the first room

50
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.500
.

51
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.050
So we leave Taco selected Okay and Excel automatically creates the names for us.

52
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.450
We can now use these names in our formulas rather than using the raw column references.

53
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.450
Let's do one final name.

54
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.470
Let's name the cell a one he created.

55
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.390
Name manually.

56
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.560
We click in the Name box,

57
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.360
which is just here and type of name,

58
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.740
which,

59
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.220
of course,

60
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.540
can't have any spaces.

61
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.530
So all underscore ranges and always remember to press enter.

62
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.280
Otherwise the name will register.

63
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.750
The summit's function takes three obligatory arguments on up to 126 optional arguments.

64
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.150
The first parameter is this some range?

65
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.060
This is the range of cells from which you want to create your conditional total.

66
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.360
In our case is the range of cells that we've now called Total price,

67
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.400
the final colon,

68
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.020
and then the second argument is your first criteria range.

69
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.050
And that's gonna be the column containing the names of the account handlers.

70
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.230
And then finally,

71
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.450
we have the criteria that will look in for within that range.

72
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.950
That's gonna be the contents of cell A full,

73
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.730
which,

74
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.920
if you remember is Brandon Jackson,

75
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.050
and then you complete the summits function.

76
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.620
I,

77
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.810
especially if I ng pairs Chrissie arrange criteria,

78
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.350
and you could do that up to 126 more times.

79
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.500
In our case,

80
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.850
of course,

81
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.560
we only need one additional pair,

82
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.280
and this time we're trying to match the product.

83
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.520
So criteria range to will be the column that is now called product and for criteria to will

84
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.910
need to use an if statement to test the value in the cell that we now call range the one

85
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.270
that contains a drop down,

86
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.950
enabling the user to choose a product range.

87
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:11.550
Let's begin by building the basic formula use in just the 1st 3 obligatory arguments.

88
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:28.080
Let's begin by expanding the formula so any equal summits or enter and we start with the

89
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.650
some range.

90
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.630
This,

91
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.140
of course,

92
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.750
is in item sales.

93
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.250
The final column column J.

94
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.440
Instead of using the rule reference because we've assigned the name to those cells,

95
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.750
we can use the name in our formula.

96
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:53.510
One way of doing that is in the formulas tab in the defined names group News in formula and

97
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.130
here we've got total price comma old,

98
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:05.240
enter And now we're into the first of our criteria range stroke criteria,

99
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.250
pairs.

100
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.640
So the criteria range,

101
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.510
First of all,

102
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.890
is gonna be account handler and again,

103
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.650
we haven't named range.

104
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.550
A second way of entering the name range is simply to type it.

105
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.530
So if I type a cc Excel obligingly displays the name I command,

106
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.950
just press the tab key to insert it into my formula,

107
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.410
comma old enter and then to complete the pair,

108
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.050
we specify the criteria that we want to match within the criteria range.

109
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.020
On this,

110
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.600
of course,

111
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.500
is the name of the account Ambler,

112
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:47.670
which is in cell able as always because my formula is in the summary work Street.

113
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.650
I'm going to delete the name of the worksheet so formula is not complete.

114
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.920
But let's leave it at that for the moment,

115
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.870
Ault enter closing parenthesis.

116
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.550
So we left it like that.

117
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.760
First of all,

118
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.810
we wouldn't have needed the s we could have disused summit on.

119
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.640
Secondly,

120
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.340
whatever choice the user makes up here is going to be ignored.

121
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.530
So now let's think about the second criteria pairing that we need to insert into our

122
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.250
formula.

123
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.650
The pair always begins with the criteria range.

124
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.880
That,

125
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.620
of course,

126
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:36.390
is going to be the product column when we haven't named Range called Product to specify

127
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.850
this.

128
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.070
But then,

129
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.950
when we come to specify the criteria that were matching within this range,

130
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:51.720
we'll need to test the value that the user has chosen in cell a one which we've named

131
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.850
product range.

132
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:59.690
And the first thing we need to distinguish between is whether they've chosen all ranges or

133
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.550
whether they've chosen a particular product range.

134
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.380
We can do that with an if statement.

135
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.540
We can say,

136
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.370
if our product ranges,

137
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.510
cell equals all Rangers do one thing,

138
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.050
otherwise do another.

139
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.900
So what do we want to do if they choose all ranges?

140
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.530
Basically,

141
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:27.750
we want to say match every single row within product that miss any rose out.

142
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.840
So the only criteria that's being applied,

143
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.670
the only limitation is that we're matching a particular account handler.

144
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:41.360
But we want no additional filter in to occur on product on weaken.

145
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.110
Do this by using the wildcard character,

146
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:51.050
which is asterisk so to complete our formula.

147
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.200
We specify criteria range,

148
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.850
too,

149
00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:00.090
which will be the product column and then for the matching cry interior we use an

150
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.400
excitement biological test will be whether the cell,

151
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.050
called range contains the selection ball.

152
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.540
If it does,

153
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.210
value true will be an asterisk and if it doesn't value of false,

154
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.240
will be the first to characters followed by an asteroid.

155
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.740
So to extract,

156
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.450
the 1st 2 characters will need the left function.

157
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.700
The text will be the cell called Range a one,

158
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:34.420
and then the number of characters will be to then will refuse 1% asterisks to tag on the

159
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.850
wildcard character.

160
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.670
Let's now complete our formula.

161
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:45.510
So now I'm gonna add on to more arguments,

162
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.750
comma or cancer.

163
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.650
And in our parents,

164
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.850
the criteria range always comes first.

165
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.550
On the range we're evaluating is the product column.

166
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.950
Since it has a name,

167
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.250
we can use that name cycle to start to type it.

168
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:12.020
And when it appears in the list inserted by pressing tab old enter and now we come to

169
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.730
specify the criteria that will use within the product.

170
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.290
Colin.

171
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:24.200
So here were interested in examining this cell and testing to see whether the user has

172
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.150
chosen away ranges,

173
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:35.690
so he will need an if statement old and how logical test is whether a one that is called

174
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.650
product range,

175
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:43.150
contains the words or ranges so we can insert product ranges.

176
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:48.640
I've just noticed that I've called it all ranges rather than product ranges.

177
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.440
So when we finished the formula,

178
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.120
we'll rename that car.

179
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.390
That range would be a better name than war rangers.

180
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.430
So it all ranges equals quotes,

181
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.660
all space ranges,

182
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.550
which is the entry that's actually gonna be displayed in the cell comma.

183
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:12.940
All came so and value it true will be our wildcard character.

184
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.590
But of course,

185
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.590
goes in quotes.

186
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.950
So quotes,

187
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.720
asterisk,

188
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.740
close quotes,

189
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:22.650
comma all Danto and then on value it false.

190
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:28.250
It's going to be the first to characters of the product ranges cell full of by the asterisk

191
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.250
.

192
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.950
So he used a left function to extract the 1st 2 characters.

193
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:38.090
The text will be all ranges comma.

194
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.640
Number of characters will be,

195
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:46.320
too the closing premises to end the left function and then I m percent to tag on the

196
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:54.480
wildcard character and that completes our if statement alone enter and then the clothes in

197
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.460
parenthesis.

198
00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:04.950
All the if statement that completes our formula before we test it.

199
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.750
Let's change the name all ranges to product range,

200
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.010
which is a much better name saying formulas.

201
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:18.300
We go to name manager and we can just add it all ranges and cool.

202
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.150
It's on the school range.

203
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.630
And the great thing is,

204
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.050
of course,

205
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.540
that Excel automatically ate the name fours,

206
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.100
so you can see we've now the product range instead of all ranges.

207
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.570
So let's just collapse on Formula bar on.

208
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.450
Let's test it so we can now choose a particular range,

209
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:48.850
and we now see in the total figures for that range.

210
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.850
Brandon Jackson Brain stuff,

211
00:12:51.850 --> 00:13:12.380
52,711 0.8 unless didn't filter to test but brain star,

212
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:23.480
this time beyond the search criteria se I like all visible cells and then in the bottom

213
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:23.970
right,

214
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.700
We can see that we've got the correct total.

215
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:43.300
So let's complete our model and,

216
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:43.790
of course,

217
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.810
average minimum maximum,

218
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:53.370
working exactly the same way that we can simply copy the original formula pasted into each

219
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:58.450
of these cells and change the name of the function

220
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:31.270
on

221
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:31.420
that,

222
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.990
we can copy all of these formers down
