1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,490
in the last video,

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,180
we created our first version of our summary,

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,720
and we allow ourselves the luxury of having an extra column.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,350
It contained numbers.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,560
These numbers could then be referenced by the large and small functions as the second or K

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,450
argument.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,480
When you're building a model that uses the large function,

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,790
it's not always convenient to have an extra column containing the number,

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,250
which you can men reference,

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,140
and it's usually preferable if you could come up with a calculation that will generate the

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,550
number automatically.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,560
Naturally,

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,250
you could put the number and literally,

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,650
there's nothing to stop us type in a one in here,

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,950
then on the second road to and so full.

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,350
But what if you wanted a top 100 on the bottom 100?

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,020
It will be far preferable to come up with a calculation that generates the number

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,050
automatically as we copy the formula down.

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,290
So that's what we'll be doing in version two of our summary.

20
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,150
Let's move across the summary B two.

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,410
Let's first of all,

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,350
look a technique for generating the number that we need.

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,350
We can use account a function,

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,500
and the trick that we use is as follows equals counting,

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,550
and we now need to reference his cell close to the cell containing the formula.

26
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,620
You obviously don't want to reference the cell that contains the formula itself.

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,250
That would be a circular reference.

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,000
So we referenced this celeb.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,320
Um,

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,500
if we left the formula like that,

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,550
it would always return one.

32
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,950
But if we now put Colon,

33
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,210
we now have C one colon.

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,050
See one.

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,720
If we count the number of cells in that reference,

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,880
we still have a one.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,150
But the trick that we use is to make the first part of the reference absolute.

38
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,260
I can do that by pressing that fall on the keyboard.

39
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:17,850
So now we have Dolisie one fixed and C one not fixed.

40
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,140
So obviously,

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,550
on this first cell,

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,890
the count will be one.

43
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:30,140
But when we copy it down because the first part of the reference days fixed will be going

44
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,710
from C one to C two.

45
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,180
So the count will be two and three,

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,820
then four.

47
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,450
And so?

48
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,520
So that's the trick.

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,350
If we enter the formula as we copy down,

50
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,710
you'll see that the number increases by one each time.

51
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,050
So all we have to do is to use exactly the same formula that we use last time.

52
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,650
But instead of reference in a cell that contains the number,

53
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,950
we used this count a technique to generate the number.

54
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:09,440
So this is what the new version about formula will look like again we use in the large

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,250
function on the array that we're looking inside is the Total Spend Column.

56
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,750
But for the K argument,

57
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,270
that is the number.

58
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,250
How large,

59
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,370
largest,

60
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,090
second largest,

61
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,750
etcetera.

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,350
We messed in the count a function,

63
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,980
and this takes either a single argument.

64
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,310
Refer to his value one or a comma separated list of arguments.

65
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,950
So which was used in one.

66
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,450
Then we using this trick of having the original formula going from C one to C one,

67
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,150
thereby generating one.

68
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,120
But because we have a dollar sign in front of the first part of that reference,

69
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,850
as we copy it down,

70
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,050
the first part stays fixed on the second part increases.

71
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,650
And as the second part increases,

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,750
so does the range.

73
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,450
Being referenced on would generate the numbers that we want.

74
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,620
So by using the county function with about this little engine inside the former there

75
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,250
itself,

76
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,160
which generates a number that increases by one as the formula is copied down from row to

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,650
row.

78
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,850
And now let's use another trick that you should have in your armory,

79
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,580
which is a trick that you use whenever you want to create a formula,

80
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,250
which is similar to an existing one.

81
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,200
So here's the trick.

82
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,850
Will copy this live across the summary version one,

83
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:42,650
and we know that what we want to do is to replace this A to with our account A.

84
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,850
So we actually build the new formula in our be one cell.

85
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,500
And the simple trick is,

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,010
when we've got the formula,

87
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,810
we copy it and then we just cancel.

88
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,470
So in other words,

89
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,550
we don't commit the changes that we've made to this.

90
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,250
So we're using this cell for convenience.

91
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,910
So here we wrestled,

92
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,730
enter I live across so that we could nest on account,

93
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,770
a function we paste that in.

94
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,590
I'll just put another all tensor in here just to be consistent.

95
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,250
That's the way we've been doing it so far.

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,570
On all 10 to here is well and of course,

97
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,640
under in this purely irritability.

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,850
Everything's nice needs untidy.

99
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,550
That's it.

100
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,550
So that's the new version of the formula that we need for our B two,

101
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,370
but we're building it here for convenience.

102
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,940
And now all we have to do is to copy the final formula and make sure that we don't press

103
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,650
enter because press escape or click on the cancel button on the left of the formula bar.

104
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,150
Then we can live across,

105
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:55,050
get rid of all these on pay star formula into C two,

106
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,690
and that's it.

107
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,250
So we copy that down.

108
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,450
You get exactly the same results as we had before,

109
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,810
but we don't need to have this extra column just that that we have somewhere to pick up the

110
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,350
number.

111
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,080
The number is now being generated automatically that in our corner.

112
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,430
So it's much more efficient.

113
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,510
And just to finish off some reversion to,

114
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,190
let's copy this formula to generate the small formula.

115
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,450
So the changes that we need to make our,

116
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:36,750
of course the function itself that becomes small and then the references.

117
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:43,100
So now we're referencing column G type colon,

118
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,750
so you have G one DRI one,

119
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:56,470
and then we put dollar signs on the 1st 1 and I was just about to copy that down on then.

120
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,170
I've remembered that we actually want this to be in descending order,

121
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,040
so we leave it as it is.

122
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,750
We'll have ascending order.

123
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,130
We'll go from 1 to 10.

124
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,490
We want to go down from 10 to 1 on.

125
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,150
The simple answer to this is that we prefix the count A with 11 minus.

126
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,960
So if you think about it,

127
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,590
11 minus one,

128
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,650
which is what this county generates will give us the 10 when we copy it down.

129
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,650
Account increases to two.

130
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,910
So we have 11 minus two,

131
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,100
which is nine copy down again.

132
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,850
The count increases to 3 11 Minus three is eight and salt.

133
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:45,850
So we enter that and as we call me down the K argument of small,

134
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,760
which determines how small sounds a 10 on ends on one.

135
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,250
So we should have exactly the same numbers as we had last time.

136
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,270
And finally,

137
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,580
let's copy across our second formula.

138
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:15,920
And the only difference is we no longer have column A containing numbers that we've got one

139
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,940
column fewer,

140
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:26,730
so be too needs to be changed to see to Yeah,

141
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,140
we can copy this down,

142
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:34,110
then do the same thing for the bottom 10 on again.

143
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,190
D two needs to be updated this time to G two.

144
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:46,100
So that sound,

145
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,490
new,

146
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,490
improved version of the summary and the improvement is that we don't have to have this

147
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,720
extra column with the numbers we used in the count a function to generate the required

148
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,150
numbers within the formula itself.
