00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.910
in this video,

2
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.050
we'll take another example of a non standard the look up,

3
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.250
one in which you need to evaluate multiple criteria.

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.750
Zero find Look up in reference that 702 we look up multiple criteria.

5
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.430
In this example,

6
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.750
we have some sales information,

7
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.550
which is simply missing the cost of each item.

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.750
So to find the cost,

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.950
we have a purchase I D.

10
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.650
And we can use that in the purchases table to pull back a price.

11
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.150
But if we try to use that in the purchases table to pull back up price,

12
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.350
we'll find that the purchase I d is not unique to each row.

13
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.110
And if I sought by purchase,

14
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.750
I d.

15
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.650
We can see that for the first i d.

16
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.250
They're six items that were purchased using that same purchase order number.

17
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.310
So what we really need to do in order to uniquely identify a particular cost is to include

18
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.310
,

19
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.350
in our evaluation the product i d.

20
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.750
Because on each purchase I d.

21
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.800
We'll only have one road,

22
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.950
the reach product that was bought.

23
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.640
So if we use envy,

24
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.250
look up.

25
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.700
Ideally,

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.780
what we need is a composite colon,

27
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.700
one which combines but the products.

28
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.300
I d.

29
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.710
On the purchase i d.

30
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.710
And this is one way of handling this particular situation.

31
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.490
You simply create an extra column,

32
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.050
which can Katyn eights these two items and you do that in both data sets.

33
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.400
So I'd start with purchases and let's inside it as the first column,

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.440
and then I'll just take the format from the right hand column.

35
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.700
And then let's just call the column composite key.

36
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.240
And then it's just a simple case.

37
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.850
Or in Canton ation.

38
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.270
So you can say equals C two ampersand the two.

39
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:43.280
And then we can just copy this down and do the same thing.

40
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.150
The sales.

41
00:02:44.150 --> 00:03:00.560
So this time,

42
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.350
the product ideas G two ampersand purchase I D in D two.

43
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:19.310
So without composite key in place,

44
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.460
we can now use a standard.

45
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.350
The look up equals the look up.

46
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.650
We're looking up the composite key in A to coma and our table array is in.

47
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.450
Purchases started in column A and in Colon Age,

48
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:48.290
which is eight columns comma and its the eighth column that contains the unit price coma

49
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.880
and zero for an exact match.

50
00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.210
So that gives us the unit cost to match the unit price.

51
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:08.120
So let's just change the column heading to indicate their unit cost and then making copy on

52
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.920
holding it down.

53
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.690
So this is the basic solution to the situation where you need to do.

54
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.600
If you look up,

55
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.850
you have multiple criteria to be evaluated.

56
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.730
Now it's not always feasible to develop.

57
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.690
Beauty is done.

58
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.340
There are several scenarios in which you don't have the ability to go in and create an

59
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.650
extra Kahlan in the data set that you're looking up.

60
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.340
So once we've got a bit more ammunition,

61
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.570
Once we've discussed a few more look up and reference functions and a few more techniques,

62
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.450
we'll revisit this example and look at a more sophisticated solution.
