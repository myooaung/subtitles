00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,330
Let's continue our local techniques for extracting one string from another by examining the

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:26,360
combined use of right Len and Search zero for manipulating tax that's open up 03 So we're

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,410
working with the same example as in the previous two videos on What we want to do this time

4
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,370
is to extract the higher code from eight to on.

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,950
The high coat is basically either all five numbers at the end off the string.

6
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,300
So the fact that we have a variable number of characters,

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,450
which we're extracting starting from the right,

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,840
is that we need to nest a function or,

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,310
in this case,

10
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,350
two functions in order to calculate the number of characters to be extracted.

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,110
So let's have a look at how we combine,

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:10,650
right Len in search How else a function will be the right function.

13
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,950
This takes two arguments.

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,970
First of all,

15
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,140
we have the text,

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,050
which is the cell eight to,

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,830
and then we have the number of characters on.

18
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,250
Because this varies,

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:29,260
we need to use another couple of functions that calculated So the technique will use is

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,620
first of all to use the land barge in the target.

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,910
The final character within the string.

22
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:42,110
So the length of the string is 13 which is the case with the string in A to Len.

23
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,350
A two will target the 13 or last character,

24
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,690
and then from that we subtract the character position,

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,150
all that final hyphen.

26
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,220
And as we've seen in previous videos to calculate the position of the hyphen,

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,250
use the search function that takes two arguments.

28
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,880
The thing you looking for but find text is the thing you're looking for,

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,200
which will be our hyphen.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,780
And the within text is the cell within which your surgeon,

31
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,930
which is sell eight to So given the current contents of a to then a two,

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:30,400
will take us to Position 13 whereas search for the hyphen in a two will either take us to

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,430
position five or to position nine in order to make sure that we end up on the second hyphen

34
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,430
,

35
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,740
which is character nine.

36
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,750
Within the string,

37
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,900
we need to use the certain parameter the optional parameter of the search function,

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,010
and that is starting.

39
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,450
Um,

40
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,720
in the previous examples,

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,080
we've admitted starting them since it defaults toe one,

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,850
which means that the function will start searching on the first character if we sent start

43
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,850
numb to six.

44
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:08,860
This means that we're always starting the search beyond the position of the first hype in,

45
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,150
since the number of characters that precedes it is a maximum of four,

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,350
the maximum character position of the first hype and is five.

47
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,890
Therefore,

48
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,950
by specifying that are starting on the six,

49
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,230
we ensure that we miss out the first hype in,

50
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,950
which means that the first high phone will find will be hyphen number two.

51
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,450
So let's write our function.

52
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,380
I expand the formula.

53
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,250
Buyers per usual equals right,

54
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,030
and since we'll be nest in another function inside it,

55
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,950
that's useful.

56
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,450
Enter to put the arguments on separate lines.

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:59,230
The first argument is the text just simply eight to comma or center,

58
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,650
and the second argument is the number of characters.

59
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,350
So for this we start with Len as in length,

60
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,260
and we want the length of a to And then from that,

61
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,160
we want to subtract the character position off the second hyphen.

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,750
So this is where we use our search.

63
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,790
Find text has to go in double quotes,

64
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:37,370
and it's a hyphen comma found within tax where own searching is sell a to comma and then

65
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,250
are optional.

66
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,450
Start Numb is six because we want to start searching from character Position six.

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:52,230
So that calculation is the second argument off our right function on.

68
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,200
We finish with Walt enter and then the closing bracket.

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:06,590
So now we can answer the formula and let me call me down Begin.

70
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,530
Siano too.

71
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,130
We have four numbers at the end,

72
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,250
which we've extracted,

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,230
but on Road five,

74
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,850
where we have five digits following the hyphen,

75
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,250
we've successfully extracted those.

76
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,300
And if you're thinking,

77
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,640
could we have done that using the mid function?

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,130
Yes,

79
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,710
we could,

80
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,340
but I wanted to practice this combination of right Len and Search,

81
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,310
since it's a classic example,

82
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,850
or a complex formula which uses a classic combination or excel functions.
