1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that's.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,690
And now look a text manipulation formulas by creating a formula which test to see whether

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,950
the contents of ourselves start with a number.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:28,700
So zero for manipulating text that's taken 09 So in this example we have a series of topic

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,370
headings,

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,290
and then we've got some paragraphs below each headed,

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,410
and what we want to do,

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,160
basically,

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,950
in the Topic Level column,

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,050
is to assign a level based on whether the text starts with a number or not.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,650
You'll see that each of the topic Allen's begins with a number,

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,950
and in this example,

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,750
we want to end up with the appropriate HTML tanks placed around the original entries.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,080
So the training folder,

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:09,850
if you open up the HTML file what we want to do is to paste our topics below the

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,250
appropriate headed excellent production for Excel Intermediate.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,950
So the level column will tell us which is which.

18
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,350
That's the last topic related to Excel introduction.

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,410
And as I said,

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,000
the number will tell us whether this is a heading or whether it should be body text.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,840
Let's look at the functions that will need to achieve this so naturally the first function

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,550
we're going to use is if and as we've seen,

23
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,950
it has three arguments,

24
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,380
the first being logical test a test which has to produce the value,

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,590
true or false,

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,110
the test.

27
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,690
Whether something America we can use the is number function and this is inherently

28
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,450
1,000,000,000.

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,150
It can only produce the result true or holes.

30
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,950
It takes a single argument which excel calls value and to supply that argument.

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,250
The logical thing is to assume that we would use the left function,

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,950
which we've seen several times first thrown into text the cell that you want to operate on

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:19,950
,

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,850
which is due to second parameter number of characters.

35
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,350
We want the first character only.

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,560
However,

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,750
there's a slight problem in this approach,

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,810
which is that all text functions,

39
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,050
including left,

40
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,220
will always produce a text result.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:43,160
So even though the character we're extracting may look like a number by virtue of the fact

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,090
that that number has been produced,

43
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,750
uses a text function.

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,460
That character will always be treated as a textual character,

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,680
never numeric.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,950
So the value being processed by these number function is supplied by the left function.

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,470
The result will always be false.

48
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,350
We will never have a number.

49
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,250
So before evaluating the character that we've extracted,

50
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,230
we need to use the value function in order to attend,

51
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,450
to convert that character to a number.

52
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,650
And if it is a number,

53
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,290
that attempt will be successful and the is number.

54
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,090
Function will then produce true.

55
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,950
So I heard the fact that we've got value value in a diagram hasn't confused you.

56
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,510
His number takes a single argument,

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,150
which excel calls value and then we use in the value function.

58
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,250
Just apply that argument.

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,070
So we have our true or false.

60
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,160
And then the second argument idiot is valued true.

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,450
If the first character is numeric,

62
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,770
we want to change Selby to into ahead in three.

63
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,110
And if the value is false,

64
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,210
In other words,

65
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,050
if the first character is not the America,

66
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,250
we want to change selfie to into a paragraph.

67
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,800
And if you haven't done much with Web development,

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,190
just a point out that HTML has six headings.

69
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:15,750
The pace that we use in this is headed one h one these ahead in twos.

70
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,850
So back in Excel,

71
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,150
we want this to be head in three.

72
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:36,250
So let's write our function office expound the formula bar so we start with equals If and

73
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,050
then we nest in.

74
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,550
So old mentor is number.

75
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,400
And again we're next in so old mentor value.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,730
And then we lest in left inside values overall,

77
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,450
enter left.

78
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,570
First argument.

79
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,920
What's the text that you're operating on?

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,800
Its D to coma?

81
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,900
A second argument.

82
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,150
Number of characters.

83
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,800
How many characters are you extracting from B to one character?

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,280
So that's our left.

85
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,150
And that's the only argument off the value function.

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,310
So all cantor on the clothes in parenthesis.

87
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:29,870
So the value function all cancer on the clothes in parenthesis for his number function.

88
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:39,210
So that is number Statement is the first argument biological test argument off our if

89
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,950
function.

90
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,950
So no need a coma.

91
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,360
And on to the second argument,

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,460
your true so for value True.

93
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,400
Want to convert D to into an HTML age three statement.

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,510
So to do that in quotes,

95
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:07,480
we put the opening tag age three close quotes and then we use the concatenation operator

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,550
and percent tag on de too.

97
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:19,030
And then we need the close in time and percent quotation marks because we're doing a

98
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,010
literal string and then we put the clothes in H three tag,

99
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,570
which in Html looks like this coma.

100
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,270
So that completes the value of true on value.

101
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,770
False is very similar.

102
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:43,310
So I'm going to copy it all center and then just paste that in.

103
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,870
And instead of age three,

104
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,210
you know what a paragraph,

105
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:56,850
which is simply he and that completes our if statement on our regular So all mentor and

106
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,950
then we close in parenthesis.

107
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,350
Is that the if statement?

108
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:07,950
So when we price center D two should be converted into 83 because it starts with a number,

109
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,160
so that's working.

110
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
We can learn,

111
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,600
just collapse up on the bar computer formula down.

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,460
So what Excel has done for us?

113
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,650
It's the generate the HTML marca that we need for our page.

114
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,750
So we can now open up the HTML page in an editor.

115
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,140
So you probably need to right click and choose open with,

116
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,310
you know,

117
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,960
Pat or similar editor isn't available.

118
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,840
You can obviously just shoot another out something.

119
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,090
Open it with night pack,

120
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:49,450
so we want the markup for excellent reduction Here.

121
00:07:49,450 --> 00:08:02,850
Got a couple of that festival introduction ends here,

122
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:14,250
so we can't be that on a student off page scroll down for the immediate Malcolm,

123
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:24,140
which goes all the way to the bottom.

124
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:34,430
So it's close and same.

125
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,950
And then let's open the HTML page,

126
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:46,650
my double quick in and then we can see we have our head in threes.

127
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:53,620
That's the end of the first section and then excellent,

128
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,150
and they get it.

129
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,370
So complete sound.

130
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,050
Look at manipulating text.

131
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,230
Hopefully,

132
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:06,050
you're getting used to the use or multiple functions to produce the result that you need,

133
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,050
and hopefully you can see why.

134
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:18,210
I prefer to split complex formulas onto several lines using all enter in our next section,

135
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,050
we want to look at formulas which used look up in reference functions.
