00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.510
Let's end this section on.

2
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.400
Look up in reference formulas I revisit in the topic of multi criteria.

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.950
Look up!

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.700
That's open up the final word book zero late.

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.850
Let me first of all remind you off the issue that we had.

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.450
We want to find out the cost,

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.050
the beat of the items that were sold.

8
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.950
But in order to do so when we look up data in the purchases table,

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.400
we need to identify not only the purchase I t,

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.650
but also the product i d.

11
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.720
And just to remind you the solution that me used early.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.050
Yeah,

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.150
we simply created a competent key in both of the worksheets.

14
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:06.850
And then we were able to use this using a simple the look up statement.

15
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:15.140
So we'll now give ourselves more challenge and say that we've got a situation in which it

16
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.350
simply isn't practical to create a composite key in both worksheets.

17
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.950
One such scenario might be the one in which the purchases worksheet is constantly updated.

18
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.050
So as soon as you create your composite key,

19
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.800
a new version of the worksheet comes along,

20
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.550
which doesn't have the composite key.

21
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.670
So the solution on proposing is fairly complicated So what we'll do is to take it one step

22
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.550
at a time.

23
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.850
And to make things clearer will create some temporary helper columns,

24
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.250
which we can then either delete or hide once we've got the final formula.

25
00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:03.610
So let's begin by inserting three columns for the left of the cost column on the approach

26
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:12.750
that we're going to take is to exploit the fact that the data is sorted by purchase i d.

27
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.570
On.

28
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:22.010
What we'll do is to try and identify but first and last row for each of the purchase I ds.

29
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:31.670
Once we've identified that we can then to look up only within those rose in the product i d

30
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.250
column.

31
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.110
And since there will be no repetitions of product,

32
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.750
I D.

33
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.450
Within that small range we can therefore identity by which of these rows contains the Majin

34
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.450
products I D.

35
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.450
And that will be the one from which we take back the unit cost price.

36
00:02:48.450 --> 00:03:07.580
So are three help of columns will be top row bottom row and then the product I d wrote to

37
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.000
find the top and bottom row will use the match function and then we'll exploit the fact

38
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.880
that the match function has a match type argument,

39
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.550
which,

40
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.270
when dealing with multiple results,

41
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.750
will either find the first along the last.

42
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.050
So to find the top row,

43
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.430
the use equals match and,

44
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.850
of course,

45
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.290
were looking in purchase I D.

46
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.630
C.

47
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.490
To because this is the one that has the repetitions comma.

48
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.650
And then I'll look up array in purchases.

49
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.680
Will be column see the purchase i d column and just remind you that this will only work if

50
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.590
the data is sorted by that column in ascending order comma.

51
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.350
And then we simply use exact match because when we have repetitions,

52
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.150
use an exact match will always target the first of those repetitions.

53
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:09.650
And is this implies this solution is not going to be highly optimized solution.

54
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.360
You're using it with lots of data.

55
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.150
It may actually be quite slow.

56
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.250
That's our function.

57
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.300
And then the formula for the bottom row is identical,

58
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:33.050
apart from the fact that the final argument becomes one.

59
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.940
So we've got an approximate match,

60
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.590
which will then pick up the last of our repeated rose so you can see this is going from

61
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.340
3492357 Misters,

62
00:04:47.340 --> 00:05:04.950
check that it's accurate So we've got a purchase idea of 269711 on the road 349 And there's

63
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.270
the last of our rose.

64
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:18.990
357 The fact that match enables us to isolate the matrix that applies to each purchase I d

65
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.550
buy.

66
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.250
Tell anus the top and bottom row numbers.

67
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.830
It means that we can now use our new best friend from the last video the indirect function

68
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:36.110
to target the adjacent colon Be and do look up the product i d.

69
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.650
But only within those rose.

70
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.100
So we'll know there'll be no repetition of the product i d.

71
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.840
Within the Rose applying to a particular purchase i d.

72
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.650
So when we specify the look up range,

73
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.930
we simply can.

74
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.100
Katyn ate the match functions which will calculate the top and bottom rose because we know

75
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.800
that regardless of the role numbers,

76
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.380
it will always be column B.

77
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.350
So we're doing another match,

78
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:19.160
but this time will messed the indirect function inside it equals match old enter and I look

79
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.550
out Value is the product i d comma all counter.

80
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:39.660
So to supply the look up array we use indirect and then we need to assemble a string using

81
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.850
concatenation,

82
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:47.780
and we know we'll be working in the purchases work Street exclamation mark and we know

83
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.450
we'll be working in column B.

84
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.560
Then we can.

85
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.080
Captain ate the top row,

86
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.750
which we've calculated in H two and percent,

87
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.600
and we need Colon Be and we can.

88
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.480
Katyn ate the bottom road that completes our string.

89
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.950
That completes indirect,

90
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:18.800
which just to remind you is the second look up array argument of match so common to end

91
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.850
that argument,

92
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:30.390
Altanta and then the match type would use one because it's faster Walt enter and the

93
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.750
closing parenthesis.

94
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:39.470
So within that small matrix product,

95
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.550
I D 43 occurs on the seventh row.

96
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.310
So it's not the seventh row.

97
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.150
The worksheet.

98
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.950
It's 1/7 row of the Matrix,

99
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.560
which contains that particular party,

100
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.250
Saidi.

101
00:07:53.250 --> 00:08:06.150
That's copy all about four minutes down and then let's assemble them into one main formula

102
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.150
.

103
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.850
So equals index old enter.

104
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.530
We start by specifying the array,

105
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.150
which will be column G using the same technique that we used here.

106
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.660
So in direct quotes,

107
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.650
name of work feet,

108
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:40.960
exclamation mark and then call it G and percent tank on the top row Empress end back into

109
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.680
quotes.

110
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.290
Colon G and percent.

111
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.750
The bottom right?

112
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.850
So that's our indirect.

113
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:56.010
So that's the Matrix within which we're looking Walt enter.

114
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.150
And then to specify the road within that matrix,

115
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.440
we use the formula that we have in the product I The row column,

116
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.050
Altanta and the clothes in parenthesis.

117
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.710
There we have our cost.

118
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.710
So let's just test that it's working.

119
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:25.050
So this is product idea 43 and it's in Row three for nine plus seven.

120
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:40.060
There's our Matrix and there's product 43 on.

121
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:47.950
We can see that we have a price of 42.7 So to finish off,

122
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.050
we can dispense without help of columns.

123
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.450
Let's do everything in turn.

124
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.350
First of all,

125
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.250
we need the code for H two.

126
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:11.950
So old enter on hte to goes here.

127
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:36.550
Then I two let's do another old enter on replace I two with its formula

128
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:45.650
and then finally J two.

129
00:10:45.650 --> 00:11:14.950
Let's align the indentation and there we have it.

130
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:20.820
We now have a choice of either deleting these three help the columns What?

131
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:29.900
We could just hide them and to finish we can just copy the formula down
