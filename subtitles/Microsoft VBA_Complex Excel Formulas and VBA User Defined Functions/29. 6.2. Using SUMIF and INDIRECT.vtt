00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.330
let's now move on to look at one of excels power functions,

2
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.050
this Summit function.

3
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.650
To make things more interested,

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.080
we'll use it in combination within the ranked 706 manipulating numbers.

5
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.350
Let's open zero to So here we have a serious of worksheets,

6
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.050
which will have an identical torment.

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.650
And in our summary worksheet from sales,

8
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:48.050
we want to calculate all the different categories of expenditure across Bulla branches.

9
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.680
So what we need is conditional.

10
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.610
So nation,

11
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.750
when we examine the data you need of our branch work feeds,

12
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.110
we're interested in Kahlan D,

13
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.950
the amount reimbursed.

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.250
But we want a breakdown of the amount reimbursed category.

15
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.530
How much did we spend on travel,

16
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.190
public transport and so forth?

17
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.390
And this is exactly what some if enables us to do and then to complete our model.

18
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.650
We have the names of all our branches,

19
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.650
which correspond to the worksheet that contains the figures for each of the branches.

20
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.740
And that's where indirect will come in when you intend to use the indirect function in a

21
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.450
formula.

22
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.640
It's usually a good idea to start by creating a literal reference and then including the

23
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.550
indirect function afterwards.

24
00:01:47.550 --> 00:02:00.660
So let's expand our formula bar so equals some if all cancer,

25
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.850
since we'll be nest in the indirect funding inside it.

26
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.680
But for the moment,

27
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.120
let's ignore indirect.

28
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.100
Let's create a literal reference using the first of our work feats.

29
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.850
Birmingham.

30
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.150
So we're supplying the first argument of the summit function,

31
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.280
and that's the criteria range the range in which the summit function will look for whatever

32
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.740
criteria you specified.

33
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.350
And that's going to be the category column calling F.

34
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.300
And since we intend to copy this formula to the right well,

35
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.790
now press the F four key to convert the reference into an absolute reference.

36
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.460
Coma and old enter.

37
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.390
Now we specify the criteria.

38
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.550
So back to the bronze sales work feet and the criteria is in row one.

39
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.970
So we click on B one now.

40
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.150
Then we've got to think about dollar signs.

41
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.550
If we copy across,

42
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.450
we want the be to change so we can pick up all the different categories.

43
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.510
But if we can't beat down,

44
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.530
we have one with one to change.

45
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.950
We want to stay on row one,

46
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.820
so we just press that for and so we've got B dollar one coma or enter,

47
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.460
and then the final argument is optional.

48
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.050
It's the some range.

49
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.250
This is the range of cells that you want to total.

50
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.800
If it submitted,

51
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.650
the function will attempt to some the Chrissie rearrange.

52
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.980
In our case,

53
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.350
the some range is different.

54
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.850
How some range is calling d the amount we invest.

55
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.320
And again,

56
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:55.590
we need to press that fool to fix the range old enter and then the closes for emphasis to

57
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.650
finish our literal formula.

58
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.350
So to finish our formula,

59
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.320
we used the indirect function to compose both of ourselves.

60
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.150
References.

61
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.290
So,

62
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.020
first of all,

63
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.450
the criteria range.

64
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.900
Instead of having a literal reference to the Birmingham worksheets using indirect,

65
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.920
we can now say Take the contents of Cell A to which is Birmingham and then can Katyn eight

66
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.920
.

67
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.350
An exclamation mark,

68
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.850
which excelled requires for a worksheet reference,

69
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.380
followed by the criteria column column F,

70
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.650
which contains all their expense categories.

71
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.250
Then we got on criteria.

72
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.250
No changes there,

73
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.490
but for the some range,

74
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.920
we again using the ranks.

75
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.950
We take the worksheet name from a to,

76
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.550
and this time after the exclamation mark,

77
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.750
we tag on a reference to Colin D.

78
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.390
And that's the amount reimbursed collar.

79
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:07.050
So for our criteria range.

80
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:15.750
We could delete the word Birmingham and convert the remainder of the reference into a

81
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.550
string.

82
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:28.890
And then we can use indirect click on A to press that full until we've got a dollar sign in

83
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.790
front of the A.

84
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.770
But not in front of that,

85
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.450
too,

86
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:39.080
and percent the remainder of this string and the clothes in parenthesis.

87
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:50.850
And then we could just copy the stomachs of that and paste it to compose the some range

88
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:58.450
open quotation mark closing quotation marks close in parenthesis.

89
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.050
So if you use an indirect,

90
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.650
that's what I'd recommend.

91
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.150
Always start with a literal string as an example,

92
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.950
and then look to see where you can use indirect to introduce flexibility into your model.

93
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.590
So when we enter,

94
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.050
we should get the same results.

95
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:24.780
But what we can now do is to copy both across and down.

96
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.150
Let's just check one of our figures,

97
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.150
so I'm gonna check comedy travel 1159.2.

98
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:44.090
Let's just going to filter on,

99
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:51.450
actually travel and then highlight the amount reinvest.

100
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.750
And if you look on the right hand side of the status bone,

101
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:10.720
you'll see we've got out 1159.20 So that's the summit function where you're using a single

102
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.750
criteria.

103
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.640
In the next video,

104
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.450
we'll move on to look at summits,

105
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.850
which allows you to specify multiple criteria.
