00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.130
before we start the cause proper.

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.950
Let's just briefly discuss the style of writing that will be using throughout this course.

3
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.350
So let's go into the Exercises folder on an 02 Getting started.

4
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.550
Let's open the Excel File zero to writing Complex Excel Formless.

5
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.050
We have a typical Excel formula,

6
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.790
it's written,

7
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.950
is one long line,

8
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.050
and it's quite dense and Impenetrable to look at.

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.810
It's not mega complicated,

10
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.050
but it does take some deciphering.

11
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.350
First of all,

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.450
we can see that there are three functions.

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.050
Be look up,

14
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.880
left and such.

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.150
And then it's down to our experience to work out the role of each of these three functions

16
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.250
within the formula as a whole.

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.190
So with a bit of investigation,

18
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.880
we can deduce that left is acting as one of the arguments or parameters a B Look up with a

19
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.410
bit more investigation.

20
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.550
We can see that search is acting as one of the arguments of left.

21
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.900
Let's compare that with the style of writing that will be using.

22
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.450
So the first thing will be doing is to expand the formula bar,

23
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.140
and there's a little button on the right here,

24
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.450
which does that you click to expand and then click to collapse when you finished.

25
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.350
Once you've expanded the formula bomb,

26
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.340
the final height can be adjusted by going to the bottom of the formula bar and just

27
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.600
dragging Uppal down.

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.350
So we now click in Cell C two.

29
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.470
We have the same formula,

30
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.230
but Britain,

31
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.390
in the style that will be using on that style,

32
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.950
is simply to split the formula onto multiple lines.

33
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.610
On the main benefit of doing this is to emphasize the role that each of these three

34
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.050
functions is plain,

35
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.150
so we can immediately see that be look up is the outer function,

36
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.660
which contains everything else.

37
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.650
If we click inside the open in parenthesis after the look up,

38
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.260
Excel displays the arguments.

39
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.550
When we click on the first,

40
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.100
it highlights the entire left function.

41
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.950
We can therefore see that the left function is supplying the first argument of the look up

42
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.950
,

43
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.770
and this is why we have written it in this style.

44
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.140
Left is clearly inside.

45
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.320
We look up and the indentation emphasizes the hierarchy.

46
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.780
We look up is the parent.

47
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.550
On left is the child.

48
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.850
If we click inside the open in parenthesis after the left function,

49
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.950
when we click on the first argument,

50
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.390
we can see that it's simply a cell reference.

51
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.950
But when we played on the second,

52
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.720
we can see that it supplied by the search function again.

53
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.700
We have this parent child relationship we can clearly see.

54
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.000
The left is the parent,

55
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.400
and search is the child.

56
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.920
So that's the logic of split in the formula onto multiple lines and then in dent in the

57
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.820
text to illustrate the hierarchical relationships between the various functions within the

58
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.550
formula.

59
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.520
So for those of you who haven't actually done this,

60
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.550
let's now look at how you spent a formula onto multiple lines.

61
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.130
I'll just press cancel to come out of this cell and then moved back to be,

62
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.670
too,

63
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.550
where we have everything on one line.

64
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.650
The key criterion that I'll be using to decide when to spend a formula into multiple lines

65
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.350
is as follows whenever there's a parent child relationship within the formula.

66
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.030
In other words,

67
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.370
whenever there's an outer function for which one of the arguments is supplied by a nested

68
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.990
function,

69
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.150
and that's clearly the case here.

70
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.170
So the way that will write it is that will split the line after the opening parenthesis

71
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.560
that follows the parent function.

72
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.030
So the parent function is clearly the look up in this case.

73
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.230
So we click after the opening parenthesis and we press old and enter to insert a line break

74
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.590
within the formula bar.

75
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.150
And then we simply use the space bar to invent the text.

76
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.350
So we now have the left function inside.

77
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.450
We look up if the left function had no Children and we write it along one line.

78
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.300
But as we can see,

79
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.450
it has the search function as the second argument.

80
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.750
So for that reason will do the same thing with the left function.

81
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.350
We pressel dente and then use the space bar to invent the arguments.

82
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:25.700
The first argument is 82 the old enter before the second arguments and then space bar along

83
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.800
to indented.

84
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.150
And of course,

85
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.390
what we trying to do here is to align the arguments.

86
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.400
So after search,

87
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.790
we have a minus one,

88
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.210
and then here we've got the clothes in parenthesis to the left function on.

89
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.720
What I'll be doing is to press old enter here and align the clothes in parenthesis with the

90
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.950
opening premises.

91
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:56.750
So all of that constitutes the first argument of the look up.

92
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:05.370
So we now in certain all enter in front of the second argument and the line,

93
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.750
the second argument under the first.

94
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.480
And we do the same with the third argument,

95
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.630
which is the number two.

96
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.750
So Venter Space Bar on the final argument,

97
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.560
both mentor space for,

98
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.260
um and again all tensor on the line,

99
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:33.290
the clothes in parenthesis off the look up under the opening Prentice's So this is purely

100
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.130
stylistic.

101
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.860
It makes no difference whether we write it on one line or whether we spent it on several

102
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.370
lines when you go to a formula,

103
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:49.400
either for the first time or after a while and having it written in this style where you

104
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.650
can clearly see the parent child relationship between the nested functions.

105
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.960
Hopefully,

106
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.330
I think you'll agree it does make life easier.

107
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:04.180
So that's the style that will be using throughout the course selling this center.

108
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.210
And of course,

109
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.740
there's no hard and fast rule as to when you invent and how much you in debt and so forth.

110
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.630
But the general theme is that if you split a complex formula onto multiple lines,

111
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.440
it's easy to see how the form that works and to see the relationship between the various

112
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.850
components of the border
