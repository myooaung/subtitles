1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,320
Let's move on to look at another very typical combination when you're working with text at

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,590
last,

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,910
the use of the mid and search functions.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,870
Zero for manipulating text.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,690
Let's open up zero to combining mid search.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:30,660
And if what we want to do in this video is to find out the type of usage,

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,400
whether it was internal or external,

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,550
and we can do that by examining the letters in the middle of the higher reference,

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,270
they'll either be i,

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,750
N T or E X T.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,150
And again because the letters that precede the hyphen very sometimes for sometimes three

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,850
we'll need to use the search function.

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,970
But this time we use in in combination with mid rather than left because obviously we

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,900
started in the middle of the string,

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,350
not starting from the left.

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
So again,

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,640
what we really want to have is usage.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,160
We want either internal or external in the usage column,

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,310
but just doesn't learning mechanism.

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,670
That's first of all,

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,180
extract the i m.

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,850
T.

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,050
Using a combination of minute and such.

24
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:31,350
The mid function takes three parameters Festival.

25
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,950
We have text,

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:40,220
and this is simply the cell that contains the text you're examining second we have to start

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:48,600
number the character position from which you want to start extracting text and thirdly,

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,150
the number of characters that you want to extract.

29
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,210
So,

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,030
in our example,

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,410
texted,

32
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,210
straightforward,

33
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,050
we're looking in Cell eight to,

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,200
and the number of characters is straightforward.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,050
It's always three because the letters are either i nt for internal or txt for external.

36
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,900
So the thing that's not straightforward is the start number.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,850
Which character position do we start from when we're extracting text?

38
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,100
So because of that,

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,650
we use the search function to supply that parameter.

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,980
The search function takes two parameters.

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,800
The fine text is what we're looking for.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,050
It is a hyphen,

43
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,320
and within text is the cell that you're examining,

44
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,450
which is self a two that will tell us the character position off that first hyphen.

45
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,850
But what we then need to do is to live one character position to the right.

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,280
So after we close that parentheses for the search function,

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,040
we need to put plus one so that we don't include the hyphen in the text that were extracted

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,040
.

49
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,160
So that's right.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,550
Our function un.

51
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,750
Expand the formula virus per usual,

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:16,010
so we want equals mid and then I'll press fold enter because we'll be less than another

53
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,350
function inside made.

54
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,350
So the first parameter is text.

55
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,430
That's the cell that we're examining,

56
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,980
which is 82 coma,

57
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,680
all tender.

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,860
And then we,

59
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,050
specifying a start position my nest in the search function,

60
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,250
have a search function as its two parameters that find text,

61
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,880
which,

62
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,250
of course,

63
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,780
has to go in double quotes.

64
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,950
That's the hyphen.

65
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,650
Call me within text the cell that you looking in,

66
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,780
which is a two.

67
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,250
But then the start number will omit because we want to start from character Position one.

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:01,930
But then we add one plus one to make sure that we don't include the hyphen itself.

69
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,100
We want the character that follows the hyphen.

70
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,490
Come on.

71
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,800
So all of that is the second parameter about made function.

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:20,560
All 10 and in the third parameter is the number of characters which is fixed at three and

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,150
then old Enter on the closing for emphasis.

74
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,040
So when we press end,

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,850
so we should get I in t.

76
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,350
And then as we caught me down alive that I nt or the X t each time,

77
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,270
so that gives you a bit of practice on using mid and search in combination.

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,510
There are very common combination in a similar way to the use of left and search which we

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,850
saw in the previous video.

80
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,860
So now let's copy the formula that we've got so far excluding,

81
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,290
of course,

82
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:59,300
the equal sign in his press escape once you've copied and then we can use this as one of

83
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,250
the parameters for the if statement that we now need.

84
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,960
So what we want to say basically,

85
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,620
is that if the mid function gives us,

86
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,250
i n t put the word internal into Sally too.

87
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,450
Otherwise for the word external.

88
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:28,600
So the it function becomes the outer function and the function takes three arguments.

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,550
First a logical test,

90
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,460
then evaluate true and then a value the false.

91
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,450
So for a logical test,

92
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,060
well,

93
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,250
basically nest the mid formula that we created so far.

94
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,970
So we've got the text that start number,

95
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,330
number of characters.

96
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:47,970
And then,

97
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,910
as we saw,

98
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:55,790
this start number is being supplied by the search function which has iPhone is it's fine

99
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,150
text and so a two as the within text.

100
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:06,750
But then we and one to the result in character position now because we want this to be a

101
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,850
logical test.

102
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,320
What we then have to do is to use a logical operator.

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,950
And obviously equality is the thing that we're testing all.

104
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:22,390
Does the result produced by the mid function equal the letters I NT?

105
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,470
So that would be a logical test.

106
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,070
I test that can only be true or false value of truth.

107
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,830
We put the string internal into the cell,

108
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,140
value it false.

109
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,050
Who put the string external.

110
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,070
So let's right now,

111
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:50,750
function equals if Walt enter and then I'll just paste in before Mueller that copy.

112
00:06:50,750 --> 00:07:05,250
Remember to use the space Barton s this so that was the formula we had before.

113
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,060
But as it stands,

114
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,450
it's not a logical test.

115
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,600
And since it's acting is the first parameter of an if statement,

116
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,650
it needs to be converted into a logical test.

117
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,050
And we do that simply by Adan equals and then,

118
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,500
of course,

119
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,070
in quotes,

120
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,690
because it's a string e x t.

121
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,350
So now we have a logical test.

122
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,020
If the result produced,

123
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,990
my maid equals txt coma,

124
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:39,510
old enter and then the second parameter which were align in underneath mid,

125
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,450
which was the first prime Minister If is the body is true,

126
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,150
which is a string.

127
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:57,060
It is the word internal Homa or cancer Valley falls external Walt,

128
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:04,070
enter on the clothes in parenthesis for the if statement And I just noticed that I've got

129
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:10,370
this the wrong way around I should be testing for I N t And then the positive values

130
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,320
internal the negative values next time.

131
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,840
So let's ends around formula class the full huh?

132
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:28,950
And called me down Whenever we have I nt we get internal on Whenever we have txt,

133
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,400
we get X double.
