1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,950
in this section will take some examples of working with numeric values.

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,750
Let's begin by looking at rounded 06 manipulated numbers.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:33,100
Let's open 01 Controlling round insensitivity Excel has a number of functions which will

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,350
perform round in operations on the American bodies,

5
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,270
but these are not to be confused with all matin.

6
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,340
So,

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,990
for example,

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,160
here I've got a recommended retail price.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,750
Colin,

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:52,950
if I highlight it and use the increase or decrease decimal buttons,

11
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,550
I'm in no way changing the number.

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,790
So simply by changing the corner so that the decimals aren't displayed doesn't imply that

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,150
the number has changed.

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,750
When I click on the cells,

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,850
we'll see that any decibels that were there are still there.

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,610
By contrast,

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,280
when we use around in function,

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,150
we're actually changing the number in some way.

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,460
So the most basic round in functions will change the number of decimals,

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:35,450
which displayed perhaps the most useful round in functions of those which round the number

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,350
in more sophisticated ways.

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,220
These are the functions will look at in this video and round,

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,850
ceiling and floor.

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:54,190
All three of these have the ability to around the number to whatever significant digits you

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,850
desire in this example.

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,380
Well,

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,750
look at calculating discounted prices,

28
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,350
but since they on prices,

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,450
we want them to be fairly user friendly and easy to remember.

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,510
We've got all out discounts set up in columns.

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,900
I threw a hammer,

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,380
and here we have a couple of drop downs,

33
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,650
but which the user can choose the significance or sensitivity.

34
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,560
So,

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,090
for example,

36
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,350
if they choose five,

37
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,150
we'll be round in the number to the nearest five to the nearest 2.5,

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,090
right down to decimals,

39
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,250
to the nearest nor going to five,

40
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,750
and then the user can specify the direction.

41
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,850
Do you want to do normal rounding up with no 0.5 and above,

42
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,900
down for anything below,

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,870
nor point fine?

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,270
Or do we always,

45
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,970
once around,

46
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,750
up all always round down?

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,710
So let's begin by putting our basic formula in place.

48
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:06,990
One which calculates the prices based on these discounts so we would want equals

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:16,770
recommended retail in the three minus because with this county the recommended retail

50
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,580
multiplied by the discount so that will take care of this count.

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,950
A Now who wants to copy this formula?

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,350
We'll have to think about dollar signs.

53
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,750
First of all the to be threes.

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,750
When we copy to the right,

55
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,210
we won't want the beater change,

56
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,750
but when we copy down,

57
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,750
we will want the three to change.

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,550
So we press at all.

59
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,280
And so we've got a dollar in front of the bees,

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,450
but no dollar in front of the three.

61
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,080
And then for I three,

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,380
we have the reverse when we copy.

63
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,060
So the right we do want the I to change to a J.

64
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,960
K etcetera.

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,090
So it picks up all the other discounts.

66
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,830
But when we copy down,

67
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,540
we go with the three to change.

68
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,500
So this time we use that for to get toe I dollar through.

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,070
That's our basic formula.

70
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:19,580
Now let's make out solution a bit more flexible By taking the significance on the direction

71
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,450
into account.

72
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:26,620
Let's start by name in these two cells also alone,

73
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,710
this one to the right.

74
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,350
I think he looks a lot better that way.

75
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,900
And then to name the cells,

76
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,050
we could just highlight this matrix,

77
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,550
which has potential names on the left,

78
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:45,840
have an automatically generated the names by using formulas create from selection and left

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,360
colon,

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:56,310
so the name significance will apply to J by on the name direction well,

81
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:04,190
applying to J six and then our created names available here with my choose direction,

82
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,250
even see Stay six and significance is j fine.

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,350
I believe the next statement.

84
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:19,430
Test the direction that's chosen and use the appropriate function based on the current

85
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,190
selection.

86
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:28,150
So the outer function will be if and then a logical test.

87
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,810
Well,

88
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,450
we weather direction equals around and then for value is true.

89
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,160
We would use the M around function,

90
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,060
which is normal.

91
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,790
Rounding the number that we want around is the formula that we have so far that simple

92
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,750
calculation.

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:54,230
And then we specify in the case of em around the second row mentor call multiple.

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,380
And this will basically be our significance.

95
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,150
And that's a number between North 0.25 and five.

96
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,250
That's what we do in a logical test proves to be true.

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,050
And when the logical test is false,

98
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,250
value it falls is a nested if statement.

99
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,580
A logical test here is for the second puzzle of their action direction.

100
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,050
People's ground up.

101
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,150
If it does,

102
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:31,050
value true is to use instead of the M around function,

103
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,370
the ceiling function,

104
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,920
which always rounds up and like em around seeing it has two arguments.

105
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,120
The number two which it applies.

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,650
It is our calculation,

107
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,840
and then the second perimeter.

108
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,250
Instead of the import multiple.

109
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,350
It's called significance,

110
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,760
and that will be this cell that we've called signage because which has to drop down with

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,350
the different numerical values between 4.5 and fine,

112
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,950
having tested but two possible directions.

113
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,600
It neither of those is true catchall value,

114
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,010
if all still kicking.

115
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,210
And in that scenario,

116
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,750
we know that we must be around it down.

117
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,310
So we'll be using law and then the first parameter,

118
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:27,470
which should say number like so present calculation and then ask before the significance is

119
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,950
the choice that's currently in play in the cell that we've made its significance.

120
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,250
So now let's create our final formula.

121
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,080
Let's expand the formula bar.

122
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,650
Let's also collapsed the ribbon to get ourselves a bit more room,

123
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:54,650
so we'll need this So this press old into a couple of times and leave it in place.

124
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,470
But to start the final formula,

125
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:04,670
we need if all hands a neurological test and we test in the direction,

126
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,010
so you'll notice that when I click on J six.

127
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,410
Because it has a name,

128
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,350
the name is automatically picked up.

129
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,350
Direction equals ground.

130
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,450
That sound test,

131
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,990
all hands are and the value true used the M around function,

132
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,850
and then the number that we around in is the calculation that we did earlier.

133
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,470
Coma.

134
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,340
And then the second argument,

135
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,950
which Excel holds more people will be the cell that we've called significance.

136
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,750
So when I click on it,

137
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,980
the name of the sound is automatically inserted.

138
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:54,130
Close friend persist in the M round and comma to end the second on Vince the value true or

139
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,150
our if statement,

140
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:02,350
and to supply the third argument on its walls,

141
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:10,150
we put in a nest it if or enter at this time,

142
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:17,220
we're testing to see if the direction equals round up calmer.

143
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,410
I meant to supply the value of true arguments of this nest.

144
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:23,680
It is.

145
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,650
You would use ceiling.

146
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,850
We can ignore sealing off man for two reasons.

147
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,980
First reason.

148
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,090
It's only available in Excel 2013 and 2060.

149
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,450
So not everyone doing this tools for actually have it available,

150
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,810
and secondly,

151
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,950
the promise of it it offers which ceiling doesn't.

152
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,750
Pam is to specify the direction or around in negative numbers.

153
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,450
So since we're not dealing with negative numbers,

154
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,270
we can ignore seeing that man,

155
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,540
you just insert ceiling.

156
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,850
And then,

157
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,360
of course,

158
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,850
the number that we're analyzing is the one supplied by our initial calculation.

159
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:10,150
Common and then significance is this cell that called significance.

160
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:23,520
Let's just call Colmer and then for the value of false not just of the nested.

161
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,800
If,

162
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:33,350
but they're both ISS will become floor and then we just paste in rest off the function.

163
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,720
So it has to see the user has specified that we want around all round up.

164
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,600
If they want around,

165
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,170
we use them around if they want to round up when you see them.

166
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:53,460
Neither of those two is true when you small old enter closing parenthesis for the nested it

167
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,050
on the closing parenthesis for the outer.

168
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:05,360
And when I pasted,

169
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,380
I managed to end up with two open parentheses.

170
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,250
There sort of lose that one.

171
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,150
That's our basic formula,

172
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,930
which because of our strategic use of dollar signs,

173
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,650
we can come across on coming down.

174
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,850
So with the significant sets of five,

175
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,630
you can see that all our prices are multiples of five and Then,

176
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,430
as we re buying this significance,

177
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:42,740
we get more granular prices all the way down to 4.25 where we had personal accuracy to our

178
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,350
prices.

179
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:55,150
And if you want the user to see the consequence of the choice of around in this chosen,

180
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,740
you can just insert a formula here to calculate the average vehicles,

181
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,850
average all these cells on.

182
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:15,230
Then we can copy that across and then to see the most dramatic difference,

183
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,550
we can set the significance toe fine.

184
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,130
If it is candidate,

185
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,050
we have a price of about 48.

186
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,750
If we round up,

187
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,500
that becomes 50.

188
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,750
I think we round down.

189
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,590
That becomes fully fine.

190
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:38,200
So as you can see,

191
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,050
rounding in Excel is not just a case off the decimals.

192
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,950
It can apply to the significant digits as well,

193
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:51,450
using one of these three very useful functions em around ceiling or law
