1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,250
in the last video,

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,210
we improved our summary by incorporating the count function to automatically generate the K

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,350
number required by the large and small functions.

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:30,900
Let's move on to version three of our summary and introduce a bit more sophistication in

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,790
this version.

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,370
We want the user to be able to choose whether they want to focus on total spend or total

7
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,250
units.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,350
So,

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,550
so far are formulas have unconditionally been analyzing the Total Spend column.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,850
We now want the user to be able to choose between total spend and total units.

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,690
And of course,

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,850
we've named both of these columns.

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,490
So we've got total underscore spend and total underscored units as the automatically

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,890
generated names for these columns.

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:19,440
So the first thing we'll do is to name the choice Cell a one instead of reference in a one

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,440
.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,380
Let's call this cell total choice to manually name a cell.

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,250
We go to the name box in the top,

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,250
left here on type the name Total under school choice,

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,690
and always remember to press enter.

21
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,520
Otherwise,

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,350
the name doesn't actually register.

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,950
So now we want to move from this formula,

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,210
which unconditionally uses the total Spend column as the array argument of the large

25
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,330
function to a conditional structure.

26
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,960
And that,

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,430
of course,

28
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:02,740
means an if statement so logical test will check to see the value that's currently in place

29
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,850
in the cell that we've now called total choice.

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,560
So we can say the total choice equals total spend Been.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,590
The value of true is the large formula that we had in version two of our summary on the

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,750
value of falls.

33
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,350
It's the same large formula,

34
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,650
but for the array argument instead of total spend,

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,350
we have total units.

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,650
So let's create our formula,

37
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,850
and the first thing we can do is to copy that formula that we have already.

38
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,600
So let's copy the large formula.

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:53,150
Let's just make this a bit bigger,

40
00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:00,050
and we can also collapse the ribbon to give ourselves a bit more room.

41
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,320
So we need equals.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,950
If,

43
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,540
well,

44
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,280
Penta and then our logical tests is going to test the value that's been chosen in cell a

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,850
one.

46
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,360
So total choice equals double quotes,

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,250
total spend,

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,530
comma Walt enter,

49
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,050
and then the value of true.

50
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,840
He paced in the formula from version two of our summary,

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:42,660
and I'll just put a few spaces into invented a bit further coma.

52
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:50,370
And then we just need to modify this cell reference This version of the summary we've

53
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,590
introduced two new rose.

54
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:02,490
So the rose reference by the count a function have also increased by two instead of C one.

55
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:07,340
We simply need C three on.

56
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Then we can copy a lot of this and paste it as the third argument about it function.

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,550
So all tender on based.

58
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:29,080
And the only change we need to make is that this now becomes total units and that completes

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,250
our if statement so old enter and the clothes in parenthesis.

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:47,550
So you can copy this down and then use it to generate this small version.

61
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:57,950
So first large become small.

62
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:05,150
Then we modify the cell reference.

63
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:22,520
So all our seas replaced by G's and finally so that we can have descending order we prefix

64
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,560
the count A function with 11 minus 11 minus one equals 10.

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,750
You copy it down.

66
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:40,060
You haven't minus two equals nine on so forth and we do that here as well and that's it.

67
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,600
We can then answer on copy this one down as well.

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,550
And now we need to use index and match to pick up the names of the clients,

69
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,950
so we need a very similar if structure to the one that we've just used.

70
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,150
We'll need exactly the same logical test,

71
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,850
checking to see what they use is chosen in cell a one which we've called total choice.

72
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,650
If they've chosen total spend,

73
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,150
then for value is true.

74
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,460
We use index and match in.

75
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,380
Next be in the outer function on our array is the clients.

76
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,250
That's what we're trying to look for to calculate the room number used match.

77
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,320
Look out.

78
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,950
Value is now in C four because we've got expert rows of the top.

79
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:38,690
So all is our first data road within our summary data on because the user has chosen total

80
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,370
spend,

81
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,860
I'll Look up Array is the total Spend Column,

82
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,740
and the match type is zero Bren exact MASH.

83
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,260
Let the user hasn't chosen total spend.

84
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,590
That means they've chosen total units,

85
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,290
so the value false.

86
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,250
We use index pulling back a client we met in the value in seed for,

87
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:10,470
but we're matching it in the Total Units column because as a result of the user's choice,

88
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,450
the formula in column hall will now be Eritrean units sold rather than total spend.

89
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:23,050
So to get the company name,

90
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,350
we can start my copying the first part of our if statement,

91
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,050
it's gonna be exactly the same.

92
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,610
There we go back into our summary version two.

93
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,960
You can use this convenient trick of building the formula in a convenient location,

94
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,550
copying our final version,

95
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,940
pressing the cancel button on,

96
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,070
then move in that code to its destination.

97
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,280
So here we need a lot Kenta on here,

98
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,150
we paste in the start about it.

99
00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:06,950
This is the logical test part of the if statement and index becomes the value of truth.

100
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:17,770
So let's just invent it and then terminated with a comma.

101
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:32,150
Then we can copy the second arguments old enter and paste it as the third argument.

102
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,340
And of course,

103
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,650
the enemy changes.

104
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,250
If total sorties doesn't equal total spend,

105
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,650
it will equal total units.

106
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:49,150
And then the only other change is that si two will become C four.

107
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,390
Because,

108
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:50,800
of course,

109
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,450
on summary version three,

110
00:08:52,450 --> 00:09:00,350
we've introduced two new rose at the top so that the user can make that choice so seem to

111
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,150
now becomes a sea pool on to finish out of statement.

112
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,880
Let's just do old enter and put the clothes in parentheses,

113
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,020
and when I pasted,

114
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:19,770
I managed to end up with two equal signs of Let's get rid of this extra one so we can can't

115
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,850
be all events.

116
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,900
So we built it here for convenience because it handsome,

117
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,730
useful code that we could use as a starting point.

118
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,210
But we've only been using it as a work area.

119
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,650
We don't actually want to change this cell.

120
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,160
So once we sure we've got that on the clipboard,

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
we can just press cancel.

122
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,650
No harm has been done to this cell,

123
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,350
but we now have on the clipboard the formula that we need for this cell.

124
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,950
So we just paste it in and it's good to go.

125
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:06,460
We can then copy that down and then paste another version in the bottom 10 section on.

126
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,450
The only change that we need to make here is that instead of reference in column C,

127
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:20,550
we now reference in column G so that to see falls need to be changed to G fools.

128
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,190
That's the only change I can see.

129
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,060
That's just test it on.

130
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,870
Help me down.

131
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:36,510
That completes version three of our summary this is the version that really had in mind or

132
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,370
this section.

133
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,970
I thought it might be useful to us to do it in three stages and introduce a bit more

134
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,950
complexity at each stage.
