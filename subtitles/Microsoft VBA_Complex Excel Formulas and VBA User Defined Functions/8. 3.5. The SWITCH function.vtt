00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.350
let's now move on to look at the switch function.

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.330
And this is another function,

3
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.450
which will only work in office 365 and Excel 2016.

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.550
That's going to see right five.

5
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.300
And in this example,

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.800
we want to create what I've called a formal interview date based on the short date in

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.430
column G by formal,

8
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.710
I simply mean a date,

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.300
which includes the orginal on the first would want to display the S T on the second,

10
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.330
the nd on the third,

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.950
the RV and for all other days,

12
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.020
the th that's first of all,

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.320
look at how the switch function works and let's say that we use in an interview date of the

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.050
24th of October 2017 and we want to find out what orginal is appropriate for that date.

15
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.650
So the first parameter of the switch function it's an expression.

16
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.890
This is the expression that you want to evaluate and then specify a different series of

17
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.650
results,

18
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.050
depending on what value is the outcome off this expression.

19
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.200
So the expression were evaluating is the day off the interview dates,

20
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.050
and of course,

21
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.150
we used the day function to obtain that in this case.

22
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.540
The result is 24.

23
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.000
Then we have a series of pairs value One result one value to result to and so forth.

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.850
The value is one possible value or the expression that we've specified.

25
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.110
And in this case,

26
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.930
we want to combine values.

27
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.550
So we use the or function to do this.

28
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.050
If the day is 1 21 or 31 we want the result to be S t.

29
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.540
Then for a second test again,

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:16.650
we use all if the days two or 22 we want the results to be nd a man on third and final test

31
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:26.010
again uses a little to combine 3 23 to produce a result of our D remember function as the

32
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.350
default option.

33
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.150
If none of the tests that you specified proves to be true,

34
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.970
what default value you want to use?

35
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.900
And of course,

36
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.470
in the case of an orginal,

37
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.050
it would be t age.

38
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.670
And for the date that we're evaluating,

39
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.160
the 24 th is the true value said the default would automatically kick in because all of the

40
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.950
tests returned falls.

41
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.150
So that's now right out formula.

42
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.360
As usual,

43
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.140
I'm going to expand the formula bar,

44
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:06.220
and the first thing we want to display is the day and I'm going to use the text function.

45
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.150
To do this so equals text,

46
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.470
and what the text function enables us to do is to apply a format toe,

47
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.050
one component within a formula.

48
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.020
So here I'm a plane,

49
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.500
a format purely to the day the text function takes two parameters.

50
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.320
The first is the value to which you want to apply.

51
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.050
The formats that this is cause is the interview date in G two comma,

52
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.880
and the second is the format that you want to apply,

53
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.350
and you'll notice that it's format text,

54
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.260
which means that it's gotta go in double quotes.

55
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.280
So here I want tohave the day displayed as a number with no leading zeros.

56
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.200
And to do that I put a single bee to these would give me a numeric value with a leading 03

57
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.460
days would give me the short name of the day.

58
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.520
As in money,

59
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.730
M.

60
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.300
O N.

61
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.170
ANA calls.

62
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.250
Four days will give me Monday before name of the day.

63
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.390
That's the first part of our for more bait,

64
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.050
and then I'm going to use the ampersand or can Cata Nation to tag on the rest.

65
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.950
Let's now press all enter to go into a new line and then space bar a couple of times,

66
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.850
and now we need our switch function.

67
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.310
So switch first argument is expression.

68
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.350
What do we want to evaluate?

69
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.630
So we use the day function on G two,

70
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.450
which contains the interview date,

71
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.650
and that's our first argument.

72
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.500
Coma Pressel.

73
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.950
10 toe men just aligned the next argument under the first.

74
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.710
So now we need the first possible value.

75
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.090
Or,

76
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.940
in this case,

77
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.950
values.

78
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.850
We combine the values using the also that only one of them has to be true.

79
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.350
So one coma,

80
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.650
21 calm at 31.

81
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.250
So that's our first value value.

82
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.720
One comma result.

83
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.200
One.

84
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.550
If the day proves to be any of those numbers,

85
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.650
what value do you want to display at this point?

86
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.340
And,

87
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.670
of course,

88
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.610
it's a text value,

89
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.360
so it goes in double quotes and it's S t calmer.

90
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.740
And then we simply repeat this line,

91
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.340
so copy it wrestled.

92
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.650
Enter on,

93
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.910
just paste it in.

94
00:05:38.910 --> 00:06:03.590
So now we can have to on 22 which would give M d a paste three on 23 which would give him a

95
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.070
D wall canto.

96
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.240
And then finally we have our cattle,

97
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.250
which is simply th and then close parentheses to end the switch statement.

98
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.250
And it would be a good idea to insert spaces after the orginal soldiers do that.

99
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:31.960
And then we tack on the rest of the date using ampersand again,

100
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.270
our press old enter and again,

101
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.320
I'll use the text function to achieve the appropriate for that in the value So which were

102
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:48.950
applying the format is again G two comma men in quotes the format that we want.

103
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.240
It's first of all,

104
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.650
the full name of the month.

105
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.450
That's full EMS,

106
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.970
then a space on the full year.

107
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:05.850
So that's four wise and then the clothes in parenthesis to end the text function.

108
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.880
So that's how the switch function works.

109
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.850
You may have encountered the structure in programming languages,

110
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.630
so you use it when you're tested more item or lots of different possible outcomes.

111
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.560
That's the same item each time,

112
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.960
but its value can be different,

113
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.860
and you bought the contents of the soul to be determined which of these values is equal to

114
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.530
the thing that you're evaluated in this case,

115
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.250
the day.

116
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.800
All the interview date.

117
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.580
That's it.

118
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:43.850
We can enter collapse the formula on double take on the auto he'll handle to copy down.

119
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.290
And,

120
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.600
of course,

121
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.450
what we end up with is not a date.

122
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.300
It is a piece of text,

123
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.740
so we can't before many date operations on this column.

124
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.650
We can only do that on the original column G.
