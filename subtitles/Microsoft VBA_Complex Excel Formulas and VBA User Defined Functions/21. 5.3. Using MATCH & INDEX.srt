1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,950
the V look up function is very useful.

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,070
However,

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,850
it does have limitations.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,890
So this video will move on to look at a couple of functions,

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,110
which provide a much more flexible alternative.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,290
When you're performing,

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:32,300
look up operations 05 look up reference that's open up 03 using matched an index.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,790
So festival.

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,900
Let's discuss the key limitation off the bill a cup function.

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,780
In this example,

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,310
we have to work seeds,

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:48,030
hires and damaged items,

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,450
items which will return from higher but were damaged.

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,950
And we simply want to find out the name of the person who hired each of these items.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,150
So we have a higher ranch,

16
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,140
and in our highest table,

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,910
we have a higher ref column.

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,150
However,

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,920
the simple fact that the column saying in the name of the person who hired is on the left

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,890
of the column,

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,050
which contains the hiring,

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,630
means that we can't use the look up now.

23
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,960
A simple solution would be to cut the higher F column and paste it on the left of the

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,380
higher A column that would solve the problem.

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,250
But clearly this is not always gonna be feasible.

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,490
There are going to be situations where you're simply not able to make that kind of change

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,750
without perhaps messing up part of a solution.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,830
Accident.

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,050
Have the authority is not your workbook.

30
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,350
He don't have the authority to sort of cut and paste Collins,

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,450
so sooner or later you'll find situations where we look up simply can't be used.

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,770
And in these situations,

33
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,650
the best solution is to use a combination of match and index In each of these two.

34
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,850
Before was one part of the look up operation.

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,450
So we started with a particular higher ref.

36
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,150
And if we look at our hires data,

37
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,130
the higher ed column is calling me.

38
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:19,650
What the match function will do is to identify which row a particular higher F occurs in.

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,170
Once you've identified that road,

40
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,750
the index function could be used on any other column toe.

41
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,080
Identify the entry in that column On that road,

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,350
the index function will be the outer function,

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,450
and the index function takes three arguments.

44
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,830
First we have to you,

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,450
Ray,

46
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:55,820
which in this case will be calling a of the highest worksheet into the second argument.

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,800
The road number.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,580
We used a match function that match function,

49
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,050
in turn,

50
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,460
takes three arguments.

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,460
First of all,

52
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,530
the look up value,

53
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,690
which is the higher reference in Cell A to the damaged items.

54
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,020
Work,

55
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,450
please.

56
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,650
Then we have to look up array,

57
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,650
and this is column e of the highest work feet,

58
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,200
the column that contains all the higher references.

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,160
Finally,

60
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,550
we have the match type,

61
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,780
which is very similar to the final argument of the V look up option.

62
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,650
And as with that argument,

63
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,850
we can either use zero or falls to indicate that we want an exact match.

64
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:48,450
So all of that supplied by the match function becomes the second Argument row number,

65
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,830
and then index has 1/3 optional argument,

66
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,540
which is the column number.

67
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,870
In this example.

68
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,000
We're working with a single column,

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,380
said the depo column number,

70
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,700
which is one is fine.

71
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,290
For that reason,

72
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,920
we can omit back there.

73
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,350
Optional arguments.

74
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,900
Let's write out formula.

75
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:27,190
We start with equals index all tender since we're going to be nest in match inside it First

76
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,620
argument is Thean Ray,

77
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,750
within which we're looking and that's going to be hires.

78
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,380
Call him a calmer all cantor,

79
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,150
and then the second parameter is the road number,

80
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,400
and this is where we need our match.

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,190
The match starts with a look up value,

82
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,870
which is back in damaged items,

83
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,800
and it's eight to since damaged items is the work.

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,710
See that contains the formula well,

85
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,700
believe the name of the work street coma.

86
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,650
Now the look up array is back in hires,

87
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,630
and it's calling E,

88
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,610
which is quite difficult to click on that you can just about manage it coma.

89
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,850
And then we specify the match type as zero waffles,

90
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:32,770
although enter on the clothes in parenthesis to finish index,

91
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:41,250
and then we can help you on formula down.

92
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:50,940
So I see you can see use an index in combination with Match gives you much more flexibility

93
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,040
than using,

94
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,250
be look up and then require in a look up table.

95
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,950
You could use match on any column to identify a row number.

96
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,870
Then,

97
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,720
once you targeted that road,

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,450
you can use index on any other column to pull back any value on that road.

99
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,470
So they're very much partners in crime not last powerful on their own.

100
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,850
But when used in combination,

101
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,250
they provide a very flexible method of performing look up operations
