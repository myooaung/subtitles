00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.080
in the next two videos will examine the intensive use of the substitute culture where you

2
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.550
replace in a significant number of values.

3
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.350
And this is a technique that I refer to his group Force substitution.

4
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.450
Let me show you how it works.

5
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.850
So zero or manipulating text.

6
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.550
Let's open up 06 rubles substitution.

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.150
We have a situation similar to one that we've seen in the previous video,

8
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.450
where we have a customer code that actually contains three components.

9
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.350
We have a series of numbers which we want to extract is the customer I D.

10
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.040
That we have two letters which we want to extract is a country code and then we have a

11
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.270
series of numbers.

12
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.850
What we want to extract is a sector code,

13
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.350
but in this example we have a slight problem.

14
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.150
The number of digits that preceded the two letters varies,

15
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.390
and the numbers that followed the two letters also very and there no convenient characters

16
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.850
such as hyphens,

17
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.190
which occur consistently in every entry.

18
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.630
So the only thing that we have is the fact that we have two letters somewhere in the middle

19
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.850
of the customer code.

20
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.390
So the brute force substitution solution to This involves combining the left mid and write

21
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600
functions with search,

22
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.580
as we've seen in previous videos.

23
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.800
And then when we search,

24
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.250
we treat any letter as a single character,

25
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.980
so I'm going to use the hyphen.

26
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.970
But you can use any character you like,

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.590
so there are a lot of moving parts to this.

28
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.450
The first thing we need to do is to get actually training folder.

29
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.950
Let's just open up 06 substitution template.

30
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:17.280
So here we want to create a formula which will gradually build the substitute formula that

31
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.850
we want.

32
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.120
So the way it works is that you put your old text in this column on the new text whatever

33
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.850
you want to replace the old text with in the adjacent column.

34
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.150
So this example,

35
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.850
the thing that we're replacing is every letter in the alphabet.

36
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.350
So let's go ahead and find the letters of the alphabet.

37
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.840
That's always when in doubt,

38
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:58.670
we go to the Internet and do a search on here.

39
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.850
We've got a Wikipedia example that will do the trick service in the copy all of the upper

40
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.250
case letters and paste them into our template,

41
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:22.390
just paste them initially as a row I'll call them and use the transposed option to paste

42
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.350
them as a column.

43
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:32.020
And I can just delete what I originally pasted and then for the new text.

44
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.150
I'm just gonna put a hyphen and copy that all the way down.

45
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.910
So as I said,

46
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.630
there were quite a few moving parts to this.

47
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.500
So that's the set up.

48
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.910
Let's now look at how we build formula in this cell.

49
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.450
We put this cell that we want the formula to refer to.

50
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.370
So,

51
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.730
of course,

52
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.050
when we use the formula,

53
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.350
we're gonna be referring to A.

54
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.860
To that,

55
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.650
the substitute function is case sensitive.

56
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.440
So we have two choices we can either find,

57
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.690
then copy all the lower case letters or we can simply transform the contents of a to upper

58
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.760
case on.

59
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.100
Obviously,

60
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.250
the latter is preferable because it's just one operation.

61
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.340
So instead of just type in eight to,

62
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.850
I'm going to type upper open brackets a too close bracket.

63
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.470
In other words,

64
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.750
we're applying the substitution to the upper case version of the contents of self A two.

65
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.750
So now we create a formula which will generate the formula that we actually want,

66
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.130
So we type equals on the formula that we want uses the substitute function.

67
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.050
So in quotes it put substitute open parentheses.

68
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:59.040
Let me just remind you of the three parameters that the substitute function news is so

69
00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.560
First of all,

70
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.650
we have text.

71
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.900
This is the text that we want a razor which is sell A to which we've converted to uppercase

72
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.160
using the other function.

73
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.350
Then we have the old text,

74
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.570
which will be the column containing the upper case letters and the new text,

75
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.150
which will be the hyphen that we've put in the adjacent column.

76
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.850
So to get our formula to generate that formula,

77
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.350
we now need to close our quotes and use concatenation and percent,

78
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.270
and can captain ate whatever is in the cell above.

79
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.990
So if I click on the salad bar,

80
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.050
which is a two that completes our first argument,

81
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.950
all those presents is so you can see what we're building.

82
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:49.040
So that's the start of the formula that we want to end up with substitute Upper A two,

83
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.450
which is the first argument of substitute.

84
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.380
So now need a comma.

85
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.650
The men we can move on to the second argument,

86
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:04.940
the ampersand close so to close the first argument.

87
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.030
We put a comma and to open the second argument,

88
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.850
we now need quotes.

89
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.740
So what we want to do is to put quotes inside,

90
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.550
quotes.

91
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.970
And whenever you need to do this in Excel,

92
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.560
you simply double up.

93
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.150
So we type two quotation marks on that means close,

94
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.850
and now we put the regular closing quotation mark.

95
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.720
So it's difficult beauty on the screen that actually got three double quotes next to each

96
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.150
other.

97
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.220
Let's to stand her again so you can see what we build in.

98
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.240
So we've got substitute first argument,

99
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.560
comma and then the quotes for the second argument to put something inside the quotes.

100
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.680
We just but ampersand the three and then put the clothes in quotes.

101
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.570
Ember send open quotation marks,

102
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.210
double up on the quote so instead to double quick.

103
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.950
And then we can go into the third argument,

104
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.850
said comma.

105
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.250
Double quotes around the third argument close clues.

106
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.070
So if your lives in count that was ampersand.

107
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.420
Three.

108
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.910
Quote,

109
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.990
coma and three quotes again Finish.

110
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.050
We won't hamper Send C three.

111
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.540
So that sound.

112
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.750
New text arguments and finally to close off.

113
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.850
We need double close,

114
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.450
open quotation marks,

115
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.450
quotes,

116
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.360
quotes to indicate double quotes and then the closing quotation mark.

117
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.780
So four quotes at this point room and we enter,

118
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.250
and the anything I forgot was the clothes in parenthesis.

119
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:53.150
So I'll just put back here just before the final double quote,

120
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.950
and that completes our formula.

121
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.880
So basically,

122
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.750
what we now need to do is to simply copy this down.

123
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.940
So I was like,

124
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.950
opiate down.

125
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:13.100
You can see that the original formula becomes the argument of a new substitute function,

126
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.250
and that's the way that substitute works.

127
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.810
You could say it's the reverse of lest in what you're doing each time is your rap in a new

128
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.250
substitute function around the existing one.

129
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.050
So we start with a single substitute permission,

130
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:36.380
and then that original substitute function becomes the text argument.

131
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.640
The first argument off another substitute function any,

132
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.650
then replace the second letter.

133
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:49.250
And then all of that becomes the text argument of the third substitute,

134
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.820
and you replace the third letter.

135
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:59.000
You do that all the way up until you get to said so we'll eventually have 26 substitutes

136
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.550
wrapped around each other in this fashion,

137
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.220
so that may sound extremely complex.

138
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.170
but because we have this formula that generates the formula,

139
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.850
Horace,

140
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.350
what we need to do is to copy it down,

141
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:20.050
move to the very bottom and then the final formula that we actually need is this one.

142
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.980
So we can copy it into note pad or any text editor.

143
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:35.550
And that's what it looks like because you can see we started with the original Upper A to

144
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.990
and then we just applied successive substitution on that initial value.

145
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.590
So if you count all the bees still in 26 of them,

146
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:49.660
one replacing these letter of the alphabet and each time the letter is always being

147
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.950
replaced with a hyphen.

148
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.650
So every time we use this code,

149
00:09:53.650 --> 00:10:00.650
whatever letters are in cell eight to will always be replaced by hyphens.

150
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:06.250
And then we use the techniques that we saw in previous videos to track the position of the

151
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:06.790
hyphen.

152
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.350
Using the search function on man were in familiar territory.

153
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.350
That's no good and waste all functions.

154
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.650
Some templates finished.

155
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.100
And the great thing about the template is,

156
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.150
once you've done this rather complex formula,

157
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.330
you can just keep it on.

158
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.180
Any time you want to use this technique,

159
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.850
you simply replace these two columns.

160
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.980
When we look at other examples of using this template during the course,

161
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.320
say,

162
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.040
for the moment,

163
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.450
we can just close it down and save our changes.

164
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:47.750
So now we want the customer by B and this is gonna be used in the left function.

165
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.290
So let's just expand that formula.

166
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.550
Bar has been usual.

167
00:10:52.550 --> 00:11:00.250
So just to remind you of the technique use the left function is the outer function.

168
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:06.640
And it takes two arguments the text from which you are extracting characters,

169
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.750
which is a two,

170
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.950
and then for the number of characters we used to such function.

171
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:19.310
The fine text is the character that you're looking for and this is where I'm brute force

172
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:25.550
Substitution comes in so that formula that we've generated begin paste in at that point,

173
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.550
and it effectively means will be certain for hyphens.

174
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.270
But within text,

175
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:31.720
of course,

176
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.970
is where we're searching,

177
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:33.390
which of course,

178
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.350
is a to.

179
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.050
And then you got to remember that when we find the position around hyphen,

180
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.570
which will be where the UK is,

181
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.780
because the substitute rule in place all letters with hyphens.

182
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.150
We don't have to subtract one,

183
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:51.710
because otherwise in this case will be picking up the new as well of the number that

184
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.750
precedes the letters.

185
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:59.570
So we type equals left center.

186
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:04.810
That's parameter is text,

187
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.630
which is a two Coleman or cancer.

188
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:19.050
And then the second perimeter is supplied by search or enter Find text.

189
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.230
What are you searching?

190
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.680
Call,

191
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:29.310
which is a hyphen Coma within text,

192
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.390
wary.

193
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.450
Looking for it.

194
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:40.750
This is where we paste in our code just across the note pad or text editor and copy it

195
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.480
repast.

196
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.010
It'll then?

197
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.310
So in other words,

198
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.250
we're not searching inside a two per se.

199
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:57.160
We're searching inside a modified her shin off a 21 which has hyphens replacing the

200
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:04.520
original letters Well then and that completes our search functions as the closing

201
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.850
parenthesis for that.

202
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:12.620
And then the search function is in turn the second argument off the left function so old

203
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:19.750
enter again and the final closing parenthesis All the left function Well,

204
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.460
we enter.

205
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.950
You can see that we've got the number,

206
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.050
but because I forgot to put the minus one.

207
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.500
We've also got the letter,

208
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:36.220
so we simply need after the search which closes here to insert minus one.

209
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.990
So we're not picking up the first letter and that's it.

210
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:46.710
So that's how left and weaken vendors copy this one down and we'll see each time.

211
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.270
It's just picking up that variable number of digits.

212
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.550
So now on to the country code.

213
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.480
This time,

214
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:54.890
when using,

215
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.400
admit.

216
00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.840
So the mid function takes three arguments because for me,

217
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.130
the text which will be the text in a to and then for the start number,

218
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.650
will use the search function.

219
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.230
And then the final text will be out Group for Substitution Code,

220
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:20.850
which I've called mega sub in this diagram on again within text is a to this time there's

221
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.420
no adjustment necessary.

222
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.650
When we find the hyphen,

223
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.580
we're in the right position.

224
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:33.580
So the country code equals made cantor.

225
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:44.240
The text is a to comma and then start number,

226
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.250
search,

227
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:52.150
enter or in Texas hyphen.

228
00:14:52.150 --> 00:15:05.870
You call may for enter and then we paste in our mega sub code or enter and that completes

229
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.850
our search.

230
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:13.490
It was important Asus for that coma and then we're back into the mid function.

231
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.760
We've completed 1st 2 arguments,

232
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.510
text and starting them.

233
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.420
Now we want a number of characters so bold Enter.

234
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.920
I have a number of characters is a ones,

235
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.500
too.

236
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:33.130
It's a two letter code that complete sound made that all winter on the closure for emphasis

237
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.940
that gives us our country code,

238
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.910
which we can then cut me down in per sector code.

239
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.700
Let's use the right function.

240
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.550
So to use the right function,

241
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.250
use Len to find the final count the position.

242
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.250
And from that you search to find the position of the hyphens.

243
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.110
So right itself takes two arguments.

244
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.540
The text that you're looking inside,

245
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:08.870
which is 82 then the number of characters we use Len Onley to that.

246
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:17.730
Texas is a final character position minus and then we use such and now mega sub to find the

247
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:25.350
position of the first hyphen within the to that will correspond to the position of the U.

248
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.210
So,

249
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.580
of course,

250
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.710
if we left it at that,

251
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.950
we'd end up including the K in the stream that's being extracted.

252
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:38.190
So we need to subtract one from the total to avoid picking up the second letter of the

253
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.150
country code.

254
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:44.150
So equals rights.

255
00:16:44.150 --> 00:17:03.960
Enter text is a to Coleman enter and the number of characters we have Len off a two minus

256
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:11.100
search well,

257
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:19.550
canto by in Texas the hyphen Call me canto.

258
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.690
I mean,

259
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.880
for within text you paste in,

260
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:36.280
make a code cancer because his a man minus one and that completes our right.

261
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.980
So old enter on an equation.

262
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.660
Parenthesis or the right policy.

263
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:54.140
So there we have It seems like 2795 on we can help me down someone who is crabbing the

264
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.760
numbers which follow the letters.

265
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.390
So,

266
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.350
as you can see,

267
00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.260
even though we've got this fairly complex looking formula,

268
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.230
once you have a template that can generate that code,

269
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.110
you can just paste it anywhere.

270
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.660
And it solves quite a wide range of problems.

271
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.550
Here's just one example,

272
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.260
and we'll look at another example in the next video.
