1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,650
that's our move on to look at excels in direct function.

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:25,630
05 Let's open up 07 The indirect function enables you to construct a cell reference by

3
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,250
using concatenation.

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,850
So in this example,

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,650
we have a series of worksheets.

6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,150
We want to analyze the data in each of those work treats.

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:41,150
We want to come up with a total amount claim total amount reimbursed on the average

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,650
percentage reimbursed.

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,530
So obviously,

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,680
when we come to analyze the Birmingham work,

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,550
Treat will be using the word Birmingham.

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,960
When we come to analyze,

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,440
cardio will be using the word Cardiff and so four on what the indirect function enables you

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,050
to do is to incorporate that word into your cell reference.

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:11,470
And a good way to use indirect is to start with a literal reference and then incorporate

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,450
indirect within a literal reference.

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,550
So for Birmingham,

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,050
we would say equal some.

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,750
I live across the Birmingham and highlight this cell reference that we want to analyze.

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,860
So for amount claim that's column C and then we enter the formula,

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:40,320
and what indirect now enables us to do is to substitute the word Birmingham with a

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,340
reference to sell a to that way,

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,850
when we copy the formula down will have a reference to sell a three a four,

24
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,450
which will effectively enable us to target a different work feet.

25
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,690
So let's just expand the formula bar because we're nest in indirect inside.

26
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,450
Some are used old enter.

27
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,960
Yeah,

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,190
we'll need indirect come in here,

29
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,560
we'll need old enter.

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,150
And that will be the clothing parenthesis all the sun.

31
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,350
So the argument that indirect taste,

32
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,350
the obligatory argument is referenced text and the key word here is text.

33
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,820
So in other words,

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,290
what goes inside the parentheses is a string.

35
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,450
If I were simply to put what we have already as a string and close parentheses,

36
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,250
we'll get the same results.

37
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,050
But because it's a string,

38
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,390
what we can now do,

39
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,430
it's the use can cast a nation so we can delete the word Birmingham and proceed it with

40
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,750
Cell 82.

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,250
So if I put in reference to eat too,

42
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,250
and then use the ampersand African cattle nation,

43
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,750
I'm now saying,

44
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:06,410
Take the word in cell a to and then can Katyn ate the rest of this string to produce the

45
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,580
spinal cell reference and when I enter,

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,250
get exactly the same result,

47
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,450
but I now have a flexibility,

48
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:22,070
a copy in this formula down and then the total reimbursed will be exactly the same as this

49
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,780
formula.

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,550
But with colon be instead,

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:30,410
that's just verify that so that we could see amount playing see amount.

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:41,960
We invest the so if instantly copy the original press escape and then paste it in and

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:51,750
changer C's two D's was coming that one down,

54
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,610
and then finally,

55
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,350
or the amount reimbursed.

56
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,720
We analyze column E,

57
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,340
but we use the average function again.

58
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,950
I'll just paste in change something average on chain C T E.

59
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,990
On.

60
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,250
I've already formatted this column as a percentage.

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,150
So that's the basic usage off the indirect function.

62
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,350
It provides a great deal of power,

63
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,850
a great deal of flexibility.

64
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,850
We'll get some further practice on using it in the next video.
