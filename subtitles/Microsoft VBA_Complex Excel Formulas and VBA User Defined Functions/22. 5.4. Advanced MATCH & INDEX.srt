1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's now move on to look at a more advanced use of the match in index combination,

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,420
the one in which you need to.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,050
Unless the match function twice inside the index function 05 Look up in reference.

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,300
That's open up zero for that Burns Majin index.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,420
And in this example,

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,350
we have an order for and then in the adjacent work seat,

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:40,950
we've got the number of items in stock of each of our products at each of all branches.

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,550
So on the order form,

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,750
if we put in the quantity and then choose a particular product,

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:01:04,450
I'm gonna go for this one y a l 50 80 on entry unit price of 75.

11
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:11,670
We want tohave a formula in this stock column which,

12
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,160
given the product code and also a branch.

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,160
So let's choose London will automatically display the number of items in stock.

14
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,850
So we've got an idea of whether we can actually supply the items being ordered.

15
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:34,060
So we've seen how we can use the match function so identify which road contains a

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,250
particular item.

17
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,180
But in this example,

18
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,290
additionally,

19
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,610
we can use mass to identify which Kahlan we should be working in so We want the

20
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,450
intersection off this road on this column,

21
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,620
and that's what we need are formula to do for us.

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:03,120
So we'll have a similar nest into the one that we saw in the previous video index will be

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,550
out out of function,

24
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,250
but this time we'll use all three arguments.

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,550
The first argument is the ray The last time we had a single column array.

26
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,250
This time we'll need a multi call in the rain,

27
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,990
so we reference all of the columns in the stock worksheet.

28
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,800
Then,

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,030
for a second argument,

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,950
the row number.

31
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,250
We used a match function and has the look of value.

32
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,470
We used the product reference that we've entered on the look up array will be column A of

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,530
the stock table.

34
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,950
That's the column that contains the references on the match type zero for an exact match,

35
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,160
then on to the third argument of index the optional one.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,050
And that's the colon number.

37
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,000
And in our arrangement,

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,250
what we need to do is identifying the branch that we're actually working at,

39
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,330
so we nest the match function a second time.

40
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:09,190
This time to look at value is sell F 10 which contains the branch and for the look up array

41
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,520
will then specify Row one of our stock work feet and again,

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,750
we've got a match type of zero for an exact match.

43
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:28,670
So now let's write out formula Well,

44
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,150
just collapsed the ribbon to get a bit more space.

45
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:41,120
So equals index all kinds of since we're gonna be nest in the match function inside it when

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,350
the first argument is theory A that we're looking inside.

47
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,220
This time we need to have a multi column array,

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,320
so we go away from a across the end,

49
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,950
so reference in all of those columns,

50
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:02,070
comma or center lead to calculate the room number,

51
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,250
we make our first use of the match function.

52
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,990
So for the road,

53
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,950
we're taking the product code from the 15.

54
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,150
It's into a reference in a cell in the same worksheet is the one that contains the formula

55
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,150
.

56
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,150
We don't need the name of the worksheet comma,

57
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,450
and then the look up array is simply the first column of the stock worksheets,

58
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,250
then comma zero to specify that we want an exact match.

59
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:47,310
So this back statement constitutes the second argument of the index function comma all 10

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,330
and then we use match a second time to supply the third optional argument.

61
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,450
The column number.

62
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:03,050
So this time the thing that we're looking for is the branch,

63
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,290
which is in F 10 and again.

64
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,560
We don't need to include the name of the worksheets.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,510
However,

66
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,150
we do need dollar signs,

67
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,890
because when we copy this formula down,

68
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,350
we don't want F 10 to change.

69
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,480
So I'll just press that four to convert this from a relative reference into an absolute

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,850
reference comma.

71
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,610
Now the look up array,

72
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,250
Where we gonna find the brunch?

73
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,460
Then I stopped.

74
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:41,550
Work Seat will find the Browns on the first row and again when we copy before me that down

75
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:41,550
.

76
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:50,830
We don't want this reference to change so a lot to insert dollar signs and to finish the

77
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,570
match.

78
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,150
Com a zero for an exact match,

79
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:03,610
and that completes our formula all tender and the closing parentheses to complete the index

80
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,950
function and to complete the formula.

81
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,250
So when we press enter,

82
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:17,250
we'll just need to choose a branch back to London.

83
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,950
We can see the quantity in stock in London,

84
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,290
and of course,

85
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,000
it would be a good idea to suppress the errors So,

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,530
for example,

87
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,640
we copy this down at the moment until we supply a product code.

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:38,890
We will get this error so we can simply use the if era function to suppress that error.

89
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,270
So enter,

90
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,350
let's put out if error here.

91
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:56,700
So this now becomes the first argument that if our comma or enter so here we need the

92
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,040
replacement value,

93
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,090
which is double quotes twice,

94
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,130
or the null string on the closing parenthesis to finish off.

95
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,940
If era now,

96
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,250
we don't have a branch recently have nothing until we choose a branch.

97
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:23,250
And then if we copy the formula down,

98
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,250
we shouldn't now have any errors.

99
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,750
But women choose a product.

100
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,250
The quantity and stock is calculated for us.

101
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:48,480
So that's the slightly more advanced use off the index function where the match function is

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,050
nested twice wants to specify the road and wants to specify the Colin
