00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,150
So far in this section,

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,800
we've looked at a rate formulas which perform operations on the raise,

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,500
such a multiplication and concatenation.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,920
Let's now move on to look at another type of every Formula One that uses an array function

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:26,920
.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:35,950
We'll start by looking at the table function 07 or eight formulas that's open 04 ray

7
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,850
formulas and data tables.

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,060
A data table is a special Excel construct,

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,950
not to be confused with pivot tables or Excel tables,

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,550
which live in the insert tam.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,250
There's nothing to do with pivots,

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,750
nothing to do with tables,

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,870
data tables he used in what if analysis.

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:06,550
They allow you to create a matrix of possible values when you're doing projections or

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,950
looking at best and worst case scenarios.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,350
So in this example,

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,950
we're doing that projection to calculate gross profit for the year,

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,790
and we've got 3/4 of actual information,

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,060
and then we have some budget information or quarter for,

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,880
and we want to use our data table to give us a bit more flexibility to look at a range of

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,850
possible profit values.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:44,870
The way that the data table works is that you have to follow a certain structure in the top

23
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,100
left of the table.

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,980
You must have a formula and then below the cells that contain the formula.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,450
You can put a range of substitute values.

26
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:02,200
These values can be substituted for any cell referenced by the formula,

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:11,030
either directly or indirectly have very birth to as the road input values and then

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,450
optionally on the right of the cell that contains the formula.

29
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,850
You can put a second set of substitute values,

30
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,650
and these refer to as the column input values.

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,940
And again they can act as substitutes that any single fell referenced directly or

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,750
indirectly buying the formula.

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,090
So in this example,

34
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,750
the two variables that we're using is the number of days boot for our banquet.

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:48,120
Swedes and the number of days boot her out conference weeds the really input values with

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,770
actor substitutes for the banquet.

37
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,060
Sweet Days on the column.

38
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,940
Input values well,

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,050
actor substitutes for the conference suite bookings.

40
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,360
And to add a bit of flexibility to the model,

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,650
we allow the user to change the stunt in value for both the column and road input values.

42
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,500
So if we want to be pessimistic,

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,100
we could say go from 60 for the conference suite.

44
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,290
Bookings on.

45
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,720
We've simply got a formula in here which says on one,

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,180
as you go to the rights and again,

47
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,850
if we being very pessimistic,

48
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,210
we can say what he found.

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,650
Banquet suite bookings are also quite low,

50
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,730
and if you want to be optimistic,

51
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,650
weaken started 70 80.

52
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,240
So those are the variables that we're working with.

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,020
Let's now look at now.

54
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,570
Excel implements the rape formula.

55
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,400
First of all,

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,650
you select the entire matrix.

57
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,560
The top left of your selection will always be the cell that contains the formula.

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,700
If you're using row input,

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,430
only,

60
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,830
then you'll have a matrix of cells,

61
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,350
which is one column white.

62
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,730
And obviously,

63
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,270
in our case,

64
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,980
we use in both row input values and Colin input values.

65
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:19,530
So in selecting the entire Matrix and then you don't actually type any formulas the command

66
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,750
that you need lives in the data town and it's in the forecast group.

67
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:32,410
You click on what if analysis and shoes data table and then all you need to specify is

68
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,890
which cells are being substituted begin by special.

69
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,050
If I in this cell,

70
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:45,450
which your row input values the values arranged in rows are going to be substitutes for.

71
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,800
So,

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,960
as we've said there substitutes for our banquet suite bookings if he's on road to and cause

73
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,720
a ball so e to And then we specify the cell for which the values we've got arranged in

74
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,450
Collins with actors a substitute.

75
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,890
And in this case,

76
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,050
it's the conference suite Bookings.

77
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,610
I'm not saying 85 and that's all that Excel needs to know when you click.

78
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,250
OK,

79
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,050
it populates the table,

80
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,750
and it does so by using a single formula.

81
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,720
So when you click on any cell within that matrix,

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,550
you'll see exactly the same formula displayed,

83
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,750
and it uses the table function.

84
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,450
So here we've got an optimistic matrix,

85
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:52,520
and then we could go in change the start in values two medium figure out or to a

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,690
pessimistic figure,

87
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,350
and that single array formula updates the entire table
