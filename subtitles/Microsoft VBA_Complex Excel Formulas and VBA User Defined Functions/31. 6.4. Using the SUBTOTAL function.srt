1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,460
Let's now move on to look at a very simple but very useful function.

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,750
Sub Total.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,850
06 Manipulating numbers.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,190
Let's open zero fall sub total gumption.

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,590
The sub total function is used automatically by Microsoft.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,950
Excel whenever you use the sum total command.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,540
However,

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,450
Additionally,

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,950
you can use the sub total function in your own formulas and solutions,

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,830
and thats we'll see it provides a couple of very unique attributes,

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,220
which you can take advantage of.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,650
Let's begin by reviewing the sub total command,

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,650
so we'll switch across to the sub total command work feet and here we have some sales data

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:53,650
.

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,450
The subtitle Command is basically a poor man's pivot table.

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:06,400
It allows you to group data and to insert subtitles either before each group or after each

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,850
group.

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,130
So,

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,050
for example,

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,550
if we wanted to show stop totals by sales person,

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,750
our first step would be to sort the data by the salesperson column.

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,790
I mean,

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,620
it's just a case of going across to the data time and on the right hand side here,

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,890
we've got sub total,

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:35,320
so each changing sales person we use the some function on the sales.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,950
Kahlan.

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,550
When we click OK,

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,550
excel automatically inserts extra rose after each group,

29
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:51,550
and it uses the sock total function to generate the subtitles.

30
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,550
We'll discuss the syntax of the sub total function shortly,

31
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,270
but for the moment,

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,130
I just like to point out to very useful and unique attributes possessed by the subtitle

33
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:03,750
function.

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:13,150
The first is that the sub total function ignores any cells that contain sub totals.

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,010
So,

36
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,590
for example,

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,110
at the bottom of our data,

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,850
Excel has automatically generated a grand total road,

39
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,350
and it's using the sub total function to calculate the grand total along the data.

40
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,010
In doing so,

41
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,520
it creates a reference to the entire column,

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:40,000
starting from road to the first data road and ending on 1000 and 84 the last state of Rhode

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,730
between those two cells.

44
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,990
There are lots of cells that contain sub total formulas,

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,090
but these are automatically ignored,

46
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,100
and that wouldn't be the case if we were using this some function,

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,050
for example,

48
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,610
the total is generated by all these analysis cells would be included in the calculation if

49
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:08,590
we use the sun function instead of the sub Total function on the second key attributes is

50
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,250
that when you filter data the subtitle will analyze only the currently visible cells.

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,060
So,

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,950
for example,

53
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:26,480
if I activate Filter In and let's say I only want to see sales greater than or equal to

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:35,250
75,000 So if I make a selection,

55
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,860
we can see that the total in the status bar matches the total generated by the sub total

56
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,480
function,

57
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,650
and this is the attributes that will be taken advantage off in our solution.

58
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:58,550
So let's clear our filter and let's remove our subtitles by using the subtitle Command

59
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:05,450
Again and clicking on removed or on before we create our formulas.

60
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's have a look at the syntax off the subtitle function.

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,890
The subtitle function is basically a wrapper function,

62
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,200
which allows you to perform a variety of different calculations,

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,750
depending on the first argument.

64
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,900
But function argument is used to specify whether you want sub total to give you the average

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,470
count.

66
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,550
Count a max etcetera,

67
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,350
and the argument is numeric.

68
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,150
You'll notice that each of these possible values occurs twice.

69
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,810
This allows you to specify how you want the sub total function toe handle manually.

70
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,070
Hidden rose if you choose a single digit valley,

71
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,180
manually hitting rose are included in the final calculation.

72
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,520
If you choose one of those three digit equivalence,

73
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,250
manually hitting Rose are excluded,

74
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,950
and it's important to remember that we are talking about manually hidden rose.

75
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:13,080
Only any rooms which are hidden as a result of film three I never included on the second

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,390
arguments of the subtitle function is the reference that you want to apply this function,

77
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,980
too.

78
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,600
So,

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,930
in our case will be working on the sales.

80
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,450
Told him.

81
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,450
Ask the name of the arguments implies Breath one.

82
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,120
You can either have a single reference or a series of comma separated references.

83
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,200
So in our case,

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,550
we just want one column,

85
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,950
which is the sales column.

86
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,650
So now let's create our formulas.

87
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,980
It's a very simple formula with no nesting,

88
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,570
so we don't need to expand our formula bar.

89
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,580
You just need equals sub total,

90
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:57,330
and then excel very obligingly displays all of the available functions on For our purposes

91
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:57,330
.

92
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,850
We can either use nine.

93
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:07,550
A one on nine is the user will be filtering data rather than manually high in rows.

94
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,920
And of course,

95
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:16,150
both nine and 109 will only analyze visible cells when filtering is used as opposed to

96
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,850
manually hiding Rose.

97
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,890
Someone used nine coma.

98
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,950
And then the only reference that we need to specify is rep one,

99
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,180
which will be the sales column.

100
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,390
So I'll reference the entire column by clicking on the column heading If I could just about

101
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,790
reach and that's our formula.

102
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,090
So we enter,

103
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,950
and we can then copy this formula to save a bit of time when we created the others.

104
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,250
So we simply need to paste each one in and replace the number.

105
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,750
And to get Excel to duel the work.

106
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,950
We just reinsert the opening parenthesis to bring on the list.

107
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:09,850
So everyone number one everyone number full.

108
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:19,080
And here we want under five.

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:27,140
So using the simple formulas yuk unbilled solutions,

110
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,150
which are very similar to the ones that you build using functions like some if averages.

111
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,550
But the difference is that you have far more flexibility and interactivity.

112
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,450
You're leaving it to the user to decide how they want to filter the data,

113
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:47,150
and then your formulas give them a result for the currently visible cells.

114
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,750
So let's test that it's working if we filter the bronze Colin.

115
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,850
So we're only viewing the figures for the Cardiff branch.

116
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:05,620
And then let's reduce the quarter down to court a one only if we now select all of the

117
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,060
sales figures by clicking on the first and press in control ship Down Arrow,

118
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:19,410
we can see from the figures displayed in the status bar without total.

119
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,140
On average,

120
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,160
figures have been updated to reflect only the currently visible rose.
