1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,250
We've already seen seven examples of concatenation using the ampersand operator in this

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,850
video,

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:24,190
we'll have a look at making concatenation conditional zero for manipulating text that's

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:31,680
open up 08 conditional concatenation on What we want to do in this solution is to have the

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:39,420
user choose a company name and have the address of that company each line automatically

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,250
inserted.

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,730
To do that,

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,070
we use be look up and I'll look up Table will be in the customer's worksheet.

9
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,150
This will be the look up column,

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:57,400
and then we'll call back each of the four lines of the address three of the lines and never

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,150
empty.

12
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,950
But the second line of the address it's sometimes blank,

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,160
and this is the one that will need to make conditional.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:15,380
So let's begin our formula by pulling across the first line.

15
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:22,270
So equals V.

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,950
Look up.

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,750
The thing we're looking up is the cell above 85 comma and the look up table is in customers

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:30,750
.

19
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,550
Columns 80 e Comma.

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,620
The column that we need is column,

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,650
too Coma,

22
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,750
then zero or calls for an exact match.

23
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,550
So no problems so far.

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:55,050
If we change the company name the corresponding first line comes across.

25
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:01,850
So let's now have a think about how we need to approach it when we come to this column.

26
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:08,950
So we'll need an if statement and for the logical test.

27
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,830
Well,

28
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,240
testes.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,350
See whether V look up,

30
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,550
returns a blank.

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,650
So we use exactly the same view the cup that we've just done.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,250
And then to make it into a logical test,

33
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,550
I will simply say not equal to nothing but the value of true.

34
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,800
We don't just want the address.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,760
We want the address on a new line so we can use excels,

36
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,750
character function or char with the number 10 to achieve that.

37
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,150
And then after the new line,

38
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,290
we would put the results off.

39
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,570
I'll be look up off column three of the look up table on the value of false will only kick

40
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,350
in when the villa camp produces a blank value.

41
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,950
And in that case we simply insert nothing.

42
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,940
And,

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,290
of course,

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,450
when I say nothing,

45
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,850
I'm repairing to to double quotes,

46
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,950
but nothing between land the null string.

47
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:17,220
So let's go back to the invoice form and continue our formula so conditional concatenation

48
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,220
.

49
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,150
We still use the regular M percent all then toe.

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,820
And then we deserve our if statement all cancer.

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,160
Since we're now gonna nest,

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,150
be look up,

53
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,020
which will be essentially the same as the first.

54
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,550
So let's just copy the rest of it.

55
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,750
And,

56
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,320
of course,

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,050
we now on color three.

58
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,550
Then to convert that into a logical test,

59
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,170
Use Matti call to been old string quote squints.

60
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,350
That's a logical test.

61
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,820
Coma old Enter,

62
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,710
I meant value.

63
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,250
True,

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:14,150
We need this preceded by current to 10.

65
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:24,340
So character 10 ampersand we look up that will insert a new line and then put the result of

66
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,540
our be look up coma goaltender.

67
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,750
And then finally we put the value of false,

68
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,910
which is close quotes,

69
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,850
a little string,

70
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,030
well,

71
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,050
Vento and then the clothes in parenthesis to finish the if statement,

72
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,930
Let's check with that.

73
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,360
All works so back.

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,250
So leisure do have something in that column.

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,350
Let's find a customer that doesn't have a day of manufacturing,

76
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,250
for example,

77
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:09,650
and we can see that nothing is inserted and we don't get a narrow.

78
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,750
So let's just finish out formula.

79
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,100
So we've used conditional Comcast a nation to take care of the column,

80
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,120
which is sometimes blank the last two columns never blank,

81
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,450
so we could just copy this line and then using to put across the last two columns.

82
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,090
I m percent and I'll just split.

83
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,350
It's on to another line.

84
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:43,550
This one will be calling for ampersand,

85
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,650
old enter and column five,

86
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:57,150
and that completes our formula.

87
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:08,050
So the company up it their manufacturing have three lines of address.

88
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,000
Where is the backs of leisure?

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,850
Have all lines?

90
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,350
And by using conditional concatenation,

91
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:23,550
we've eliminated the possibility have in blank lines.
