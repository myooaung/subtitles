00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,830
hello.

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,480
Welcome to this course on Advanced Excel formulas.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,680
BB a user defined functions My name got gamble on,

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,110
Can I say,

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,790
First of all,

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,950
that this course is designed for experienced Excel users.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,230
So if you need a refresher on Excel formulas,

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,060
check out the course.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:38,310
Essential Excel formulas and functions on this course will dive straight in and start

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,560
looking at Advanced Excel formulas.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,190
So what makes the Formula Advance Basically the main attributes banned foreigners is the

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,140
combined use of multiple functions within the same formula.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,220
For example,

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,430
in a basic formula,

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,330
you might use the left function to extract the 1st 5 characters from strength.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,810
What is the number of characters to be extracted?

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,330
Is not always the same way may need to come up with several functions,

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:09,870
which,

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,970
when combined,

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,860
will give us the result of the one.

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,350
And this is what this course is all about.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,770
We'll take a systematic approach to building complicated Excel formulas,

23
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,480
which involved uses multiplex cell functions in combination.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,100
A key feature of this course is the use of explanatory diagrams.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,720
Calls features dozens of diagrams saved in pdf format.

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,340
Naturally,

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,100
you'll have access to all these diagrams you can study them at your leisure.

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,550
You can print them out,

29
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,410
make notes on them,

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,000
whatever useful.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,430
Another key feature of the course is that,

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:50,650
well,

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,290
right on formula Multiple Alliance Thinks makes it easy to read.

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,980
Complex Four Meters says it helps to make it clear when one function is messed it inside.

35
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,530
Another will also encounter examples of using formulas,

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,010
cannula,

37
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,740
mega formula,

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,670
sometimes dozens of lines along,

39
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,630
which will be very hard to light manually.

40
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,370
Way begin,

41
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,330
because by looking,

42
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,820
it's conditional functions.

43
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,500
Since these are the most versatile of Excel functions,

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,810
then we'll move on to look a building formulas,

45
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:34,710
manipulating text manipulated numbers formulas for performing complex look up operations.

46
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:41,450
I'm all for disgusting use of array formulas as well as formulas for important XML based

47
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,750
information into Excel,

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,790
both from the Web on from local,

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,000
ex and all documents.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,610
And finally,

51
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,380
we'll move on to look at the creation of custom functions using the N B.

52
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,650
A.

53
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,700
Thes functions could be included in any workbook and could greatly enhance Your Excel

54
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,420
solutions.

55
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,900
We'll focus on White and VB eight functions that provide results that can be produced using

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,590
excels of built in functions for example,

57
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,360
displaying the users with those long gone or the names of all the work she tabs would

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,400
explain information from the bouldering,

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,540
which world safe.

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,800
So if you're looking for a challenge in course,

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,030
which will provide you with strategies for creating powerful,

62
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,910
complex Excel formulas,

63
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,300
and this is,

64
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,880
of course,

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,610
that you need.
