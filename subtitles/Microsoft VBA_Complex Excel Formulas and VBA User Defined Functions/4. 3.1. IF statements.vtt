00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.460
we'll begin our discussion of logical functions by talking about the if function,

2
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.820
the most frequently used of excels,

3
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.810
logical functions That's open up.

4
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:29.090
If statements 01 on what would be doing here is to create a function which will calculate a

5
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.850
person's age based on their date of birth.

6
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.260
The basic calculation to do in this it's simply to subtract there.

7
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.850
Europe ER from the current year that we have a person who was born on 17th of October 1997

8
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.750
on the current day is reporting Bob's over 2017.

9
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.350
A person is approximately 20 years old,

10
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.770
I say consummately because this is only true once the person has reached his or her

11
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.650
birthday.

12
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.950
Up until then,

13
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.290
what we'd have to do is to subtract the year of birth from the current year events

14
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.850
attractive for one.

15
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.850
So as of now,

16
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.750
this person is actually 19.

17
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.550
It's only when we reach the 17th of October that she will actually become 20.

18
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.850
So to express this,

19
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.250
we use an if statement and the if statement takes three parameters.

20
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.300
First,

21
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.920
we have a logical test.

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.810
In other words,

23
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.150
a test which has to have trouble holes is the result,

24
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.640
then we have a value.

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.350
True,

26
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.350
what would be like to put into the cell containing the formula?

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.750
If the test proves to be true,

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.790
a man value is false.

29
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.930
What value do we want to put into the cells in the testes?

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.550
False.

31
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.780
The chronological test is we test into things the month on the day we'll need to use the

32
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.550
armed function to combine them.

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.360
The and function is another a common excel logical function,

34
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.350
and it simply takes a series of logical tests.

35
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.150
So first test,

36
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.210
we'll use the month function to extract the month from the date of birth and check to see

37
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.250
whether that's greater than the current month.

38
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.550
And then we do exactly the same thing for the day.

39
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.350
So both of those tests are true.

40
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.950
This means that the logical test for the if statement will also be true.

41
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.750
So that's how the and works all of the logical tastic contains,

42
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.780
have to be true in order for the end to return.

43
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.230
True on that causes,

44
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.160
we do it all.

45
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.450
Only one of the logical tests needs to be true.

46
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.150
So in the case of this person about logical test is true the month is 10 in both cases,

47
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.750
and in the case of the day,

48
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.470
the day of the birth date is 17.

49
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.650
That's greater than or equal to 14 which is the current day.

50
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.440
So this means that this person,

51
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.310
finally true,

52
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.070
will kick in.

53
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.250
We said practically,

54
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.150
you're a birth from the current year and then we subtract the further one.

55
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.150
If the logical has proved to be false,

56
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.370
Ben for value it force,

57
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.050
we would simply subtract the year of birth from the current year.

58
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.140
So back in Excel,

59
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.110
let's create our formula because we'll be split in this formula onto several lines.

60
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.840
Let's begin by increasing the size of the formula bar.

61
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.070
They've got plenty of space to work in.

62
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.280
So we start with the if function,

63
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.890
which contains everything else.

64
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.010
And once we type equals.

65
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.450
If on the opening for emphasis,

66
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.630
Excel duly displays the three arguments that we need logical test on your true and that any

67
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.850
false psychological test,

68
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.370
we're going to use the and function and then inside it,

69
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.730
we put out to logical tests.

70
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.050
So let's start by test in the month.

71
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.710
So we want to see whether the month of the date of birth,

72
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.660
which issued in season two.

73
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:29.890
It's greater than or equal to the month of the current date,

74
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.750
which we can pick up using the Today function that today function is one of those rare

75
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.850
functions which doesn't take any arguments.

76
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.470
But because it is a function you still need to put the opening and closing parentheses

77
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.150
after the name of the function.

78
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.200
And then we put one further closing parenthesis to finish off the month function.

79
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.350
That's the first logical test inside out hand.

80
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.470
We put a comma.

81
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.280
Now I'm gonna press old enter.

82
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.180
To go on to a new line on this is purely to increase the readability of very subtlety in

83
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.950
formula.

84
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.540
We can then use the space bar to move along,

85
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.850
and it's a line the second parameter of the and function under the first.

86
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.450
So now we tested day and again we're testing whether the day of F two is greater than or

87
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:36.750
equal to the day off the current date that completes our and statement.

88
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.250
And just to emphasize the fact that is nested inside the statement,

89
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.730
that's just press fault.

90
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.350
Enter one final time,

91
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:51.150
put the clothes in parenthesis aligned with the opening parenthesis from two lines above.

92
00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:01.050
So that entire and statement constitutes the first argument all its containing if statement

93
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.050
.

94
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.870
And then that argument is followed by a comma readability.

95
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.560
Let's Pressel center again,

96
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.750
and now we're align in underneath the first argument of the if statement.

97
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.660
So just with the end,

98
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.150
which was the first argument,

99
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.360
So for value is true,

100
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.650
which is the second parameter of the if statement,

101
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.370
we need to say,

102
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.230
Take the year off the current date,

103
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:38.390
using today again and subtract from it the year off the date of birth.

104
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.490
What is enough to immense attractive?

105
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.070
Further one because with our test has proved,

106
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.150
is that this person hasn't yet had her birthday.

107
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.980
And then we put a common to separate the second argument from the third,

108
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.820
and let's then put the third on a separate line.

109
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:04.100
You did or enter on space bar so the value falls will be virtually identical.

110
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.650
It's just that we won't be subtracted one at the end,

111
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.310
leaving just copy this on paste.

112
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.500
It's as I said,

113
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.750
and final arguments.

114
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.750
I'll just press old enter again and put the clothes in parenthesis of the if statement

115
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.950
approximately in line with the open parenthesis,

116
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.850
and that completes our formula.

117
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.640
So as we have seen,

118
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.050
this person hasn't had her birthday.

119
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.550
So when we press center,

120
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.050
she should be 19.

121
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.040
And then,

122
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.540
of course,

123
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.410
once the 17th comes around,

124
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.250
if we opened this worksheet again,

125
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.990
this statement will no longer evaluated.

126
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.630
True,

127
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.650
it will evaluate to false,

128
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.680
which means that the third argument will kick in on her age,

129
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.450
will be displayed as 20.

130
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.250
That completes our formula.

131
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.770
That's presenter.

132
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.290
Restore the normal science of the formula bar.

133
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:09.380
A man just lived to the auto fill handle in the bottom right of the cell and double click

134
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.950
to copy that formula down.

135
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.140
That's an example,

136
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.370
or using a fairly simple,

137
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.380
if statement.

138
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.940
But even in this example,

139
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.460
in order to get the result that we needed,

140
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:30.850
you've noticed that we've had to nest several functions inside the if statement in the next

141
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:31.430
video,

142
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:37.170
we'll continue exploring this concept of nest in one function inside another by looking at

143
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.850
the use of nested ifs.

144
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.550
This is where we have one if statement nested inside another
