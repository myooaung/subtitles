00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Friends here our concert is why we need to build

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.830
a custom Docker image C. Before understanding about this concept, first,

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.550
let me give a simple setup that is simply deploying

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.755
Jenkins application on Tomcat application server using Docker CentOS container.

5
00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:18.195
Now, for this setup,

6
00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:19.530
we need some requirements.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.165
The very first one is sent to a container and wake creating CentOS container,

8
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:27.720
we need to map Docker container port with the docker host.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.150
See if you have any doubts on why we

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.655
need to map Docker container port with the docker host.

11
00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:34.435
Please follow my previous video.

12
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:37.970
Then. Next one is we need to install Java with container

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.990
because we are running Jenkins application on Tomcat application server.

14
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.190
And in that case,

15
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.545
Tomcat application server needs Java.

16
00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.035
That's why we need to install Java with container,

17
00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:51.080
then install Tomcat with container.

18
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.860
Then we need to download the Yankees dot var file and we have to

19
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.280
copy that to Tomcat or web apps folder so that Tomcat,

20
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.695
we'll run our jenkins application.

21
00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.880
And finally, we can access Jenkins application using the URL.

22
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.785
We will see that at the end of the setup.

23
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:11.315
Now let me go and create CentOS container C. If you remember,

24
00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:13.370
we already pulled some images without

25
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.325
Docker host and also we are running with some containers.

26
00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.025
Fine.

27
00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:19.600
Now let me go and create a new container.

28
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.670
So how to create a container simply by running a command called Docker run hyphen,

29
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.705
hyphen D. Now let me provide some name for my container,

30
00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:30.624
let's say my Jenkins.

31
00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.410
And let me map the ports.

32
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.295
See here I'm taking 7 thousand on my co-host and egg 00 on my container.

33
00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:43.315
So here, why I am taking 800 port on my container

34
00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:48.775
means actually we are going to run Jenkins on top of Tomcat application server.

35
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:53.395
And by default, Tomcat application server will run on port number edge,

36
00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:55.660
edge rho, c, same port number.

37
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.365
You can also consider on your Docker host to map with that.

38
00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:03.385
But if you remember, we already use that port for some other application.

39
00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:06.520
That's why on my Docker host I'm taking different port.

40
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.060
That's fine. Now let me do CentOS images.

41
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.965
So I'm taking CentOS.

42
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.020
Now let me create a container.

43
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.760
So container has been created.

44
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.425
Now let me see that.

45
00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:20.155
Say this is the container just novae we created.

46
00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:21.895
No, let me enter into it.

47
00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:24.670
Docker EX C hyphen IT,

48
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.790
then your container, let's say shall as bash.

49
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.805
Now we are inside of your container.

50
00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:34.315
Now let me open ways, release information.

51
00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:36.115
And here one more thing.

52
00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:38.455
If clear command is not working,

53
00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:43.640
then simply use Control L in your keyboard so that it will clear your screen.

54
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.630
That's fine.

55
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.090
Now we are ready with CentOS container.

56
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.905
What are the remaining requirements?

57
00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:50.315
We need to install Java,

58
00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:51.680
we need to install Tomcat,

59
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.695
and then we have to download Jenkins application,

60
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.920
and we have to copy that to Tomcat web apps folder.

61
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.780
Now for these three requirements,

62
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.715
actually we hold different steps.

63
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.410
We have almost tool steps.

64
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.675
No, let me go into these tools steps.

65
00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:08.240
The very first step is simply we are updating.

66
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.255
Yeah, let me enter one by one.

67
00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:19.505
So you have to wait for some time for these setups than,

68
00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:24.300
than let me install APL release.

69
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.120
Then let me install our Java.

70
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.290
So it is installing Java.

71
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.340
Once it is installed,

72
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.640
we can verify that by taking Java if unwashed and command.

73
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.505
Okay, it is done. Now let me verify the Washington.

74
00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:51.665
Yes, Java has been installed.

75
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:55.250
The next thing is W get command.

76
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.940
When it installed obligate because we need to download Tomcat tar file.

77
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.500
So for that we need W get command.

78
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.925
As of now, we are not having W get command with your container.

79
00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:07.320
That's why I'm installing it.

80
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.390
Fine.

81
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.530
Say to download your Tomcat is simply you can take this a step or go

82
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.610
to your official Tomcat dot Apache.org website.

83
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.145
And from there, go to your required motion.

84
00:04:21.145 --> 00:04:23.140
Let say suppose Tomcat mine,

85
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.155
then here we have corruption.

86
00:04:26.155 --> 00:04:27.865
So here we have tar.gz.

87
00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:31.390
Simply do right-click and then copy linker does,

88
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.085
then go to your container.

89
00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:34.885
And one more thing.

90
00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:38.095
So Here let me navigate into user local.

91
00:04:38.095 --> 00:04:45.280
And here I am directly downloading that they quite Tomcat nowadays downloading.

92
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.890
So it will take some time. Just wait for that.

93
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.035
So after that, let me go with next step.

94
00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:54.720
We will we will extract that file.

95
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.625
It has been downloaded.

96
00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:01.760
No, let me extract it simply by taking.

97
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.900
Now see that our Tomcat has been extracted.

98
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.300
No, let me remove it anyway. I don't want that.

99
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.210
Fine. Now let me rename that Apache Tomcat nine dot-dot-dot,

100
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.515
whatever the version is that,

101
00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:20.540
that I want to rename it into,

102
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.745
let's say Tomcat nine simply.

103
00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:23.480
Yes.

104
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.085
Now we have Tomcat nine here.

105
00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:29.645
So after that, we need to export Catalina home.

106
00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:32.370
Let me simply follow this.

107
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.200
Fine.

108
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.525
Now we are ready with the Tomcat.

109
00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:43.925
Next thing is we need to download our Jenkins where phi.

110
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:48.950
So for that what I can do is simply I can go to Jenkins website.

111
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.960
Jenkins that I won't.

112
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.080
So here we have a download option, click on that.

113
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.130
And in long-term support we have Jenkins Java package that has a var file.

114
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.730
Simply do right-click and select Copy link address.

115
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.500
Then come here.

116
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.270
See actually we need to copy that to Jenkins dot var file to web apps.

117
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.550
So what I will do is directly,

118
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:18.410
I will go to Tomcat web apps folder. Now.

119
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.220
So here what I will do is I will download that var file.

120
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.925
That's a simply, ok, fine.

121
00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:33.755
Now we are ready with our Tomcat and Jenkins var file.

122
00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:40.500
The next thing is we need to start our Tomcat. No, let me start it.

123
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.655
Yes, Tom can has been started.

124
00:06:43.655 --> 00:06:49.580
If you want to verify, you can verify with PSI FF and E F pipeline grip, Tomcat.

125
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.465
It is running.

126
00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:55.925
That's fine. Now let me come out from your container. Fine.

127
00:06:55.925 --> 00:07:03.350
See, we created a container by mapping 7 thousand port of your Docker host with age 0,

128
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.240
NGO port off your container.

129
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.000
Now whenever if you want to access your application,

130
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.590
always you have to access that application with respect to two docker host only.

131
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.990
Now, see, this is the URL to access your Jenkins application.

132
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.855
Now let me go to my browser.

133
00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:25.490
So here simply I will take HTTP then docker host IP.

134
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.520
So now this is my IP of my Docker host.

135
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:38.450
Then colon 7 thousand poor ease off our docker host, slash Jenkins.

136
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.705
I know it will open your Jenkins application.

137
00:07:41.705 --> 00:07:45.515
Perfect, it is opening. That's fine.

138
00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:48.440
Now we done with our setup and assume that this setup is

139
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.325
done with our let's set test environment.

140
00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:55.730
Now, I need same kind of setup in my UAT,

141
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.950
SIT ON also in product.

142
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:03.245
So what we have to do, what are the steps to be followed in our test environment?

143
00:08:03.245 --> 00:08:07.490
Same steps we need to follow in our UAT SIT unprocessed.

144
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.395
But actually it is a time taking process because anyway,

145
00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:13.610
to create a container,

146
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.065
it is one step.

147
00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:16.580
But to install your jar,

148
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.630
Tomcat and Jenkins, We have to follow these steps.

149
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.770
So why we need to repeat these steps in different environments?

150
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.770
So instead of that, what we will do is we will create

151
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:33.125
our custom image such that that image should how our required Java,

152
00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:37.580
required Tomcat version and also required Jenkins.

153
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.155
And by using that Docker custom image,

154
00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:47.900
we can create our setup with single-step simply by running this command.

155
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.830
Now here we have two ways to create custom Docker image.

156
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.010
They are using from a container and using docker file,

157
00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:00.185
actually creating custom Docker image using Docker file is very, very important concept.

158
00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:01.805
We will discuss that later.

159
00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:06.770
But for time being, let me go with a very simple way that is from a container simply by

160
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:12.065
using this command now here to create custom Docker image from my container.

161
00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:14.645
Your container should now all your requirements.

162
00:09:14.645 --> 00:09:18.395
If you remember, we already done with all those things.

163
00:09:18.395 --> 00:09:22.550
I mean, if we go into this container, my Jenkins container,

164
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.710
inside that jenkins container,

165
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.955
you how your required Java Tomcat version and also jenkins.

166
00:09:28.955 --> 00:09:35.285
No, let me create a custom Docker image from my Jenkins container.

167
00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:39.065
Very simple, simply by using docker commit,

168
00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:42.140
by taking this container name or container ID,

169
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.445
you can go with anyone of that.

170
00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:45.875
Now let me take container name.

171
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.995
Now I want to create an image with the name,

172
00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:55.985
let say Jenkins with Tomcat setup on CentOS.

173
00:09:55.985 --> 00:10:00.870
Wanting to take this lengthen and just I'm taking for your understanding purpose.

174
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:07.100
Fine. Now it is creating your Docker image, custom image.

175
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.710
So it will take some time. Just wait for that.

176
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:15.900
Because our container has a java Tomcat and Jenkins.

177
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.220
Fine, it has been created.

178
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.755
Now let me list Docker images.

179
00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:25.715
See that this is the image just now we created.

180
00:10:25.715 --> 00:10:29.255
Now by taking this image with a single step,

181
00:10:29.255 --> 00:10:31.475
we can create our required setup.

182
00:10:31.475 --> 00:10:34.010
In our required any documents.

183
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.935
It may be test or UAT OR SIT or Proud.

184
00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:41.210
What I will do is let me remove this running container simply by

185
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.550
taking docker remove hyphen F forcefully I'm removing because it is running.

186
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.095
That's fine.

187
00:10:48.095 --> 00:10:54.454
Now we have these are the running containers and these are the images.

188
00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:57.455
So if you remember, this is our custom Docker image.

189
00:10:57.455 --> 00:11:01.205
Now I'm creating a container simply by taking docker run,

190
00:11:01.205 --> 00:11:03.410
hyphen IT, iphone DIE.

191
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.820
Then let's say hyphen,

192
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.415
hyphen, name my Jenkins.

193
00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:11.945
Then let me map the ports simply 7 thousand.

194
00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:15.050
I'm mapping with 8080,

195
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.385
fine, then image ID or imagining.

196
00:11:19.385 --> 00:11:20.810
So what we have to take,

197
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.510
we have to take our custom image.

198
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.285
Now by running this command with a single step,

199
00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:27.965
you are going to do your setup.

200
00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:30.920
Our setup is nothing but simply this one.

201
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.640
This entire thing we are going to do with a single command.

202
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:41.899
Now see, Now if you go with your container,

203
00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:46.350
Docker EX easy hyphen IP, Bash.

204
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.680
Now see that Java version?

205
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.600
Yes. And let me navigate into user local.

206
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.315
And here you see that there is a Tomcat mine.

207
00:11:58.315 --> 00:12:01.450
And go to that Tomcat web apps.

208
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.830
And here if you observe,

209
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.095
didn't kiss, is there?

210
00:12:05.095 --> 00:12:07.225
No, with one single step,

211
00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:11.210
we have done our entire setup.

212
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.570
Now let me verify whether Tomcat is up and running or not.

213
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.220
Generally it won't start because we created a custom image from a container.

214
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.120
But whenever if you create a custom image from your Docker file.

215
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.770
So in that case, we have an option to start your Tomcat automatically.

216
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.870
We will see that while creating our custom image from a Dockerfile.

217
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.500
Fine.

218
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:39.690
Anyway, it is not starting now let me run our command to start the word Tomcat.

219
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.885
Now you're, Tomcat has been started running.

220
00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:47.465
Now go and access your URL.

221
00:12:47.465 --> 00:12:52.175
I mean, to access your Jenkins application.

222
00:12:52.175 --> 00:13:01.985
So simply by taking HTTP host colon port number than Jenkins,

223
00:13:01.985 --> 00:13:06.425
see that now we are able to access our jenkins application.

224
00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:08.045
Fine.

225
00:13:08.045 --> 00:13:11.209
Now let me come more from your container.

226
00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:16.490
See now by using this custom image with one single step,

227
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.705
we can create our setup in our different environments.

228
00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:22.400
Now it is very easy, no c.

229
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.180
Instead of going with these tools steps,

230
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.790
we can create our container with

231
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.960
the requirements with one single step by taking this image.

232
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.225
So that is the advantage if you create your custom Docker image.

233
00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:42.090
Okay? Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
