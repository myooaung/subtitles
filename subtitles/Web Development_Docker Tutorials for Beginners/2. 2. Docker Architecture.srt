1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,375
Prince here or concept is Docker architecture,

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,370
says simply this is Docker architecture.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,455
But let me go with our known concept that is creating containers using Docker.

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:14,280
See whenever if you want to create a container using Docker,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,555
first of all, you had to install your Docker on any one of the operating system.

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:22,425
So after installing your Docker on anyone of the operating system,

7
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:24,825
based on the type of container.

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,430
We will select a Docker image.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,095
Then from the Docker image,

10
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,415
with the help of Docker,

11
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:31,215
we'll create our containers.

12
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:34,215
We RDD hybrid discussion on these, fine.

13
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:37,740
Now if you observe clearly in this diagram itself,

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,705
we have our Docker architecture.

15
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:42,715
Now let me extract that step-by-step.

16
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:45,530
Now, here, if you observe the very first

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,170
took part in this entire diagram is you were infrastructure.

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,460
Now assume that this is our infrastructure with some RAM hard days and some

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,110
CPU's fine on top of your infrastructure simply we are installing,

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,300
suppose here Windows server, not only Windows server,

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,680
we can also go with open to a Linux or our HCl or CentOS, whatever it may be.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,205
Now assume that on top of this infrastructure,

23
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,160
suppose I installed some x-ray did operating system.

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,640
Now this is called simply your host audio server.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,625
Now onwards host or on your server,

26
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,945
we are installing Docker.

27
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,045
Now assume that I installed Docker.

28
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:23,615
Anyway, that is called simply Docker Daemon or Docker Engine.

29
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:24,590
Fine.

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,595
Now, once if your Docker, using Docker,

31
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:32,720
we can create containers by selecting required Docker image.

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,740
Fine.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,305
Now one more thing. See, this Dockery is simply a service or engine.

34
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:42,620
So with the help of this Docker Engine or service,

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,810
we are going to create containers.

36
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,440
That means we need to pass some instructions to this Docker daemon.

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,835
So how we can pass,

38
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:54,365
we need some interface between us and docker engine.

39
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:59,570
Now for that, we are using a simple software called Docker CLE.

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,980
That's it.

41
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,240
Now using this Docker CE and Lee will pass instructions to

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,820
your Docker Daemon or Docker engine so that that

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,405
will create our start or stop or destroy your containers.

44
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:13,790
That's it. Fine.

45
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,965
And here, this Docker CLI,

46
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,890
you can install on the host to where you are running

47
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,120
your Docker Engine or else you can take one separate host there.

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,730
We can install your Docker CLI from the remote server.

49
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,160
Also, you can interact with this Docker Engine.

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,455
Or we can also communicate with your Docker Engine from remote location using rest APIs.

51
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:34,655
So how to do that?

52
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,835
We will see now, That's fine.

53
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:40,045
Now here, if you observe we are creating containers

54
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:43,810
by taking Docker images with the help of Docker engine.

55
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,840
Now assume that I need to create three types of containers,

56
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,510
let say Windows Server 2012 container to those,

57
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,270
and 16 container and 2019 container.

58
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,435
That means here you need three types of Docker images.

59
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:58,030
So from where you will get those images,

60
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,950
you no need to worry for that already.

61
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,730
Docker is maintaining some images in Docker history.

62
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,085
So how to get them we will see in our course.

63
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:11,230
So be clear, Docker images are already available with the Docker registry.

64
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,710
So whenever if you want to create your required container simply we will

65
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,825
get our Docker image from Docker history and we'll create our container.

66
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:19,880
Fine.

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,660
Suppose I want to customize that Dockery, MS.

68
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,610
Yes, we can customize and weekend store images in your Docker history.

69
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,375
Alleles.

70
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,565
We can maintain our customer base three.

71
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:34,115
Then we can store our docker images.

72
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,060
Fine.

73
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,045
Now, this is simply Docker architecture.

74
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:41,730
Okay? Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
