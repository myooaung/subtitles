1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,014
Fringe here or construct is building

2
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:06,930
custom Docker images using docker file. Let me go with that.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,505
See, we already know that there are two ways to create custom Docker images.

4
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:14,700
They are from a container that is with

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,270
the help of Docker commit command and using docker file.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,315
And we already gone through our first method,

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:26,835
that is custom Docker image with a container using the docker commit command.

8
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:28,980
But actually it has some limitations.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,740
And one of that is it is not scalable and it

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,980
is very difficult to automate the tasks in our real time.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,380
That's why it is not preferred in real time.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,940
Then the preferred way to create custom Docker image is using docker file.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,480
Now first let me tell you what is a Docker file.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,965
So in simple terms,

15
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:54,425
Dockerfile is a script which contains some instructions or commands for our talker.

16
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:57,590
And we can create a custom Docker image by

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,150
executing Docker file with a Docker command called Docker.

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,535
So simply, first, we will write some Docker file with some instructions or commands.

19
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,605
Now, by using Docker,

20
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:13,205
we will run docker build command on this Docker file.

21
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:17,030
Simply, we are executing Docker file with the help of docker

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,900
build command so that it will create a Docker image.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,955
See after that we know that, I mean,

24
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:27,560
how to create a container from Docker image simply by taking docker run command,

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,985
we can create Docker container from Docker image.

26
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:32,960
Fine.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,085
Now here let me take our previous example itself that is

28
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:43,235
deploying Jenkins application on Tomcat application server using Docker CentOS container.

29
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:46,805
So actually, if you go with manual steps, we are having,

30
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:50,720
these are the steps to create your set up.

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,825
I mean, deploying Jenkins application

32
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:57,380
on Tomcat application server using NACA CentOS container.

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:04,384
But here what we will do is first we will create a Docker file. This requirement.

34
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:07,400
And that Docker file we will execute by using

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,835
docker build command so that it will create a Docker image.

36
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:15,470
Now we will use that Docker image to launch our container with the setup.

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,415
That's it.

38
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:18,155
No, let me go with that.

39
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:21,845
Creating custom Docker image using docker file

40
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:28,085
C. We had to write our own Docker file to create a custom Docker image.

41
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:29,855
So based on our requirement,

42
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:32,810
we have to write our own Docker file and we have

43
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,930
to know some important points to create a Docker file.

44
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,480
The very first one, we need one base image to create a custom Docker image.

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,565
So based on your requirement,

46
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:46,025
you have to select this image.

47
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:51,815
Now, we will select that base image from Docker official website called Docker Hub.

48
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:58,370
And this base image information is the first instruction while creating our docker file.

49
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,020
And we have to represent that with an instruction called from.

50
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,360
Not only from based on requirement,

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
we have different types of instructions or commands for our docker file.

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,060
Some of them are like maintainer, run,

53
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,595
ENV him in a neuron when exposed,

54
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,875
command entry point and so on.

55
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,520
And here, all these instructions or not case sensitive.

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,890
Mean while implementing your Docker file,

57
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,735
whenever if you are using these instructions,

58
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:27,965
you can write these instructions in terms of lowercase letters or uppercase letters,

59
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:31,595
but the suggested way is using uppercase letters only.

60
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:37,370
And here, first I will show you already developer Docker file for our requirement that

61
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:44,225
is deploying Jenkins obligation on Comcast application server using CentOS container.

62
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:49,640
Now if you remember, while going with the manual steps to create our setup,

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,375
we followed these steps first week later one CentOS container.

64
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,850
Then we installed some packages and we did

65
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,695
some modifications so that we got finally our requirement, I mean, our setup.

66
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:05,735
Now here, what we are doing this for our requirement.

67
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,505
First we are writing Dockerfile.

68
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:12,080
From that we're going to create Docker image from that we are launching our container.

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,835
Now, let me show you already developed a Docker file for our requirement.

70
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:20,765
Now see here this is the Docker file for our requirement.

71
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,520
Now if you observe this Docker file,

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,220
the very first instruction is from.

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,110
Now with the help of from instruction,

74
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,765
we will mention our required base image.

75
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:33,335
So with the help of base image only we are going to create custom images.

76
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,330
And generally in real-time,

77
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,670
they how they wound base image.

78
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,110
So using that base image,

79
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,695
they will create the custom images based on application.

80
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:44,060
That's fine.

81
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,420
Now here, often we were first instruction,

82
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,860
remaining, all instructions or simply like you are manual steps commands.

83
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,145
If you remember, these are the minute steps commands.

84
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:57,350
So all these steps in play mentioned here.

85
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,805
But along with that outtake and

86
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:02,600
some where R1 and somewhere commands somewhere entry point.

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,330
So we'll discuss about these instructions later.

88
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,200
Fine.

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,209
Now, this is the simple Dockerfile.

90
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:14,165
Now let me create a custom Docker images simply by running docker build command.

91
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,965
Docker build dot.

92
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:20,165
Now here.me in the current location without Docker file.

93
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:23,060
In case if your Docker file in the different location,

94
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,480
then you have to mention the poppy here about your Docker file.

95
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,060
Let's go to that location then you have to run

96
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,075
your docker build command. And one more thing.

97
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:35,900
Generally, we will take Docker file as in this way I'm only,

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm in capital D Docker file.

99
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,400
You can also take any different file name.

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
But if you take any different file m,

101
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,930
then you ought to mention that file in here instead of dot.

102
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,330
Even though if you are in the current location where you,

103
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,735
how your Docker file, that's fine. Now let me run it.

104
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,780
And one more thing before building your Docker image,

105
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,805
you have to know one more thing.

106
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:58,550
That is, whenever if you build

107
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,890
your custom Docker image using docker build command with the help of Docker file.

108
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,450
So what it is going to do,

109
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,090
E's the base image,

110
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,405
each and every instruction is going to add a layer.

111
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:15,725
That's why wave bailing your custom Docker image.

112
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,965
It will take a more time at very fast.

113
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:23,870
But later, if you modify your Docker file and if you read on your docker build command,

114
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,235
it will take very less time.

115
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:29,990
I will show you that first let me run at very first-time our docker build command,

116
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,760
docker build dot indices,

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,470
simply docker build command.

118
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,125
You are also having tags options.

119
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,360
Those we'll see later.

120
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,865
Now see the Docker build dot.

121
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:44,600
Now each and every instruction is going to add

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,020
as a layer on top of your base image. You have to remember that.

123
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,450
Now whenever if you are going to create the very first time you

124
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,795
were custom image with the help of your Docker file,

125
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:57,280
it will take more time.

126
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,965
Suppose later based on your requirement,

127
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:04,165
suppose if you modify your Docker file and if we read on your docker build command,

128
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,530
it will take very less time.

129
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,760
We will see that.

130
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:15,380
Just wait for some time to complete this command to create your Docker custom image.

131
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,930
See that it is taking some time.

132
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,060
Ok, it is almost done.

133
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,840
Again, nearly, we need five more seconds.

134
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,115
Find done.

135
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:53,500
See once it is completed,

136
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,850
it is also going to do the image ID here. See that?

137
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,380
Or else you can simply run docker images and you can see that.

138
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,750
See that let us image 148 anyway,

139
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,050
it is not creating any tags or repository name.

140
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,515
So that options you have to provide while creating,

141
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:15,370
while building your custom Docker image with help of docker build command.

142
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,480
That's fine.

143
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,705
Anyway, to create your custom Docker image,

144
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:21,300
it has taken some time.

145
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,170
What I am doing is just simply,

146
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,185
I'm modifying some instruction.

147
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:29,405
Let's say I'm removing last instruction.

148
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:30,680
So removing is nothing but simply,

149
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,620
you can comment simply with the help of ash.

150
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,435
No, let me save it.

151
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:39,140
Now here, this instruction we removed,

152
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,685
that is a meaning of hash here.

153
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:43,835
Now if you rerun your docker build command,

154
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:48,275
it is simply going to delete this layer on your existing image.

155
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,810
That is why it is going to take very less time.

156
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,750
Now let me renin, so docker,

157
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,560
build dot c that it has done.

158
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,470
Now, let me once again a modify simply by adding that line.

159
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,995
Now already we have some image with these instructions.

160
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:10,610
So on that image simply it is going to add the last layer.

161
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,455
That's why it is going to take very less time.

162
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,190
See that?

163
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,155
So that point is very, very important.

164
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,275
Then. Anyway, find, we created

165
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:26,105
our required or Docker image from cent waste base image. Fine.

166
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:29,850
Now see that Docker images, sorry.

167
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,720
Now this is the image we have for our requirement.

168
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,695
No, let me create a container using that image.

169
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:44,585
Simply we know that command to create a container is docker run hyphen,

170
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:55,550
hyphen D. Then let's say I'm providing name as Tomcat with Jenkins on St. ways.

171
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,795
Latest. Then, you know,

172
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:03,730
tom cat is running on the port number h 0,

173
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,175
h 0 that I want to map with a docker host.

174
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:08,500
Let's say I'm taking on Docker host

175
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,600
also edge-to-edge report because as of now I stop all my running containers.

176
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,035
That's why a journal entry report on my Docker host is available.

177
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,920
Then finally, how to mention your Docker image ID.

178
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,110
Of course, you can also mention ribose to rename,

179
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,730
but here I don't have a positive name.

180
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,280
That's why I simply am taking Docker image ID.

181
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,605
Now let me run it.

182
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:31,850
That's been created or container has been created.

183
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,140
See that docker ps is running five seconds ago.

184
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,410
So if you want to verify you are a setup,

185
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:45,170
just enter into your container with the bash shell.

186
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,105
And it will clear is not there,

187
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,905
simply use Control L.

188
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,045
Now.

189
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:53,794
See that under user local,

190
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,705
we how our Tomcat, Yes.

191
00:10:56,705 --> 00:11:03,365
And then inside that we how web apps inside that see that there is Jenkins dot val,

192
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:10,715
or simply go to your browser and selective or IP of your Docker host.

193
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:15,500
Undertake port as edge-to-edge hero than slash jenkins?

194
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,659
No, it will open your Jenkins application.

195
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,135
It is opening, right?

196
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:27,140
So if you have a custom Docker images,

197
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,260
it is very easy to create container at anytime with less time, right?

198
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,415
So finally, that is the advantage with the Docker, Docker container radiation.

199
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:40,610
Okay. Okay. Thank you for watching this video.

200
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,970
Later, we will see each and every step of

201
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,410
your Docker file to create your Docker file for your custom Docker images.

202
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,980
Required.
