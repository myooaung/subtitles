1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
Friends here, our concepts or creating our

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,840
foster Docker container and basic commands of Docker.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,075
Saying before entering into our concepts,

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,220
First, let me log in into our docker host.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,535
See Docker host is nothing but when we installed our docker,

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:19,475
if you remember, we install Docker on our open to server in our previous video?

7
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:24,350
Yes, Docker, is there? No. Let me verify once our ways open to server.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,115
Fine.

9
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:26,915
Now let me switch into root.

10
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,665
Initially, I will work with the docker from root user.

11
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:35,660
Later we will see how to work with Bucher from different users find.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,335
And one more thing, let me verify the status of Docker

13
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:43,985
simply by using systems CDL status Docker.

14
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,680
Docker is up and running.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,005
Now let me verify the darker version.

16
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,510
Simply docker space iPhone, iPhone version.

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,730
It will do only your Docker version.

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,950
If you want to see client as well as

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,420
your Docker server information simply you can then Docker version.

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,495
And you are also having one more command called Docker

21
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:06,875
info to get more information about your Docker.

22
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,225
Fine.

23
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:10,640
Now we are ready with our Docker.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,475
No, let me enter into our concept that is creating our foster Docker container.

25
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:17,375
C.

26
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,320
If you want to create a container using Docker, unique Docker image.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,475
Suppose if you want to create a container with CentOS operating system,

28
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:28,235
then you need doc remains for s2 is

29
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:32,150
suppose if you want to create a container with open to operating system,

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,465
then you need Docker image with open to operating system.

31
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:36,425
Fine.

32
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:39,455
But from where we will get this Docker images.

33
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:45,860
See Docker images can be good from Docker registry or simply from Docker Hub.

34
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,690
Anyway, before going into that,

35
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,075
let me show you some basic commands, S0.

36
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,205
These are the, some of the basic commands.

37
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:53,945
We will explain them one by 1.

38
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,585
First thing, Docker images.

39
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:59,660
That is simply a command just to know that what are

40
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,945
the images are available with your Docker host.

41
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:06,485
Docker host is nothing but where we install our Docker C,

42
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:07,715
this is our docker host.

43
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:11,105
Let me verify with Docker images.

44
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,820
So as of now with my Docker host,

45
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,565
I don't have any Docker image.

46
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:17,780
Right?

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,765
Then how we can get it c before getting it.

48
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:26,315
First, let me open our Docker registry or hub dot docker.com.

49
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:33,305
That is the official website of Docker to find the available images with Docker?

50
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:36,560
No, let me open that. So once it is open,

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,155
simply click on here, explore.

52
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:40,520
There is explored option.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,110
Click on that.

54
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,020
Now here we have some such bar.

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,870
Let me such with the CentOS simply type sin2 is and then Enter.

56
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,500
You will get lot of images with respect to send to AC maze.

57
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,830
But don't worry, we'll discuss them step-by-step as of now.

58
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,105
After that, yes, there is a central image with your Docker Hub.

59
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:04,010
Suppose I need open to humans,

60
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,265
simply type urban to under then enter.

61
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:11,195
Yes, there are number of open two images, fine.

62
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:15,695
See internal searching your required image from Docker Hub,

63
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,610
such option that Italy from our command line itself.

64
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,975
By using this command,

65
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,990
we can such required image from Docker Hub.

66
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,325
By default, our Docker is configured with the docker hub.

67
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:30,770
So whatever you are searching from command line,

68
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,655
that such information is from hub dot docker.com.

69
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:35,420
Fine.

70
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,195
Now let me set simply Docker.

71
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,860
Such.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,695
Let's say sent away is just enter this many number of images.

73
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:50,045
Centos images are available with your Docker Hub or else.

74
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:53,855
Let me search for Open to.

75
00:03:53,855 --> 00:04:00,170
Now see that this menu open to images or available with your Docker Hub.

76
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,595
Fine.

77
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:06,875
So now we can able to such our required image in your Docker Hub.

78
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:11,570
But how to download that with our local host or without Docker host.

79
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,365
Very simple.

80
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:13,505
We have a command for that,

81
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,800
that is simply docker.

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,645
Pull your required imagining.

83
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:19,010
So suppose here.

84
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,805
First, let me run docker images.

85
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:28,475
So as of now, we don't have any images with our local host or without Docker host.

86
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:32,990
Now what I'm doing is simply Docker sent ways.

87
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:40,910
No, it will download sent ways image to our local host or to our docker host.

88
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,830
Now, it has been downloaded.

89
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,790
Now verify by running docker images.

90
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,620
Yes, now we have CentOS image with our local host or without Docker host.

91
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,520
Fine.

92
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,610
Now let me pull open too as well.

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,660
See that it is downloading.

94
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,920
You are open to amaze.

95
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,885
You had to wait for some time. It will download.

96
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,365
Yes, it has been done. Let me verify it.

97
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:11,330
Available images on your local host or with the word docker host?

98
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:11,765
Yes.

99
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:15,185
Now we have two images with our docker host.

100
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:16,085
Fine.

101
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:21,080
Now, once if you download your images in case if you

102
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,150
want to remove any one of the image or all images you can remove by taking Docker RMA,

103
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,745
remove image with respect to image ID.

104
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,940
See that if you run docker images,

105
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,385
it is giving some repos.

106
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:38,570
That is, you are open to or CentOS image name then tax as of no,

107
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,710
don't worry about tags.

108
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,215
We will see in detail ago tags.

109
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:44,480
There is image ID and it,

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,685
when it was created size.

111
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:51,200
Suppose I want to remove CentOS image with my Docker host.

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,355
Yes, we can remove it.

113
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:53,870
See simply docker.

114
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,820
Remove image, then image ID, enter.

115
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,285
It has been removed on your Docker host.

116
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:04,850
Docker images.

117
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,740
See that we have only open too,

118
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,900
because just now we removed our CentOS image on our docker host.

119
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,980
No, let me pull it docker, pull sent waves.

120
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,580
It is downloading. So once it is downloaded,

121
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,815
if you rerun your Docker images,

122
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:26,255
it will list Oliver available images with your Docker host.

123
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,040
Anyway, we have two images.

124
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,055
That's fine. Then what is the next command?

125
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:32,630
Docker ps.

126
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,835
C docker ps simply will list the running containers anyway as AF No,

127
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,880
we did not created even a single container.

128
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,505
But let me verify.

129
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,935
Docker ps, there are no running containers.

130
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:51,500
And we have one more option with the ps that is hyphen yea or hyphen, hyphen all.

131
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,845
It will list the running and stopped the containers.

132
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:56,660
Let me run it once again.

133
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,670
Docker ps, iPhone, yay.

134
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,350
Iphone, iPhone all.

135
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,110
So we don't have any running containers or

136
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,040
stopped containers as of no width our docker host, fine.

137
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,575
Now, let me go with how to create a container.

138
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:15,140
C. If you want to create a container,

139
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,615
we how to use docker run command.

140
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:19,160
But for docker run command,

141
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,980
we have number of options for time being.

142
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,185
Just remember this command going forward will discuss in detail about this command.

143
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,794
Now simply, if you want to create a container,

144
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:33,635
you how to use command as docker run hyphen,

145
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:36,425
hyphen D, then you are required imagining.

146
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:37,970
See that?

147
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,880
Docker hyphen,

148
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,955
hyphen D. Suppose I want to create CentOS images simply run s2 is the trip.

149
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:51,595
So your container has been created.

150
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:56,560
So how to list containers simply using docker ps c

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,225
that we just know we created one container with respect to CentOS image.

152
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:05,680
That's what it is giving. C whenever if you run docker run hyphen

153
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,110
IT hyphen D sent away is then

154
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,054
automatically it will create a container with the operating system as CentOS.

155
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:16,135
And one more thing. Whenever container is created by default,

156
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:18,490
your Docker, We'll do one ID for that.

157
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,835
That is nothing but Docker container ID.

158
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,180
Now, see, this is the container which we created just now.

159
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,455
And this container is created with respect to CentOS image.

160
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:32,180
And seven seconds ago,

161
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,800
let me verify it once again.

162
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,510
About a minute ago we created this container,

163
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,130
right? What is the status?

164
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,240
It is up.

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,760
And as of now we are not giving any ports.

166
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,745
Don't worry about this. And observe here names.

167
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:51,275
See by default you are docker will use some name for your container,

168
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,020
but you can also modify that. We will see that later.

169
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,845
Fine.

170
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:59,420
So as of now we have only one container with our Docker.

171
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,400
Now, let me create one more container by taking images as open to.

172
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,075
So simply Docker, run hyphen,

173
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:16,100
hyphen D. Simply, you are imagining open to see that container has been created.

174
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,950
Now let me list all the running containers simply by

175
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,310
taking docker ps c that we have two containers.

176
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,460
Now, this container is created by taking images

177
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,865
as open to or simply with open to operating system.

178
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:32,420
And this container is created by taking images are

179
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,065
sent waves or operating system has sent away as fine.

180
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:39,110
And see that whenever if you create a container,

181
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,315
Dockery is giving some container ID,

182
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,895
along with that by default is giving some names.

183
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,605
So be clear, going forward,

184
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:47,180
we can change that name.

185
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,470
That's fine.

186
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,875
Now, let me go with the remaining commands.

187
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,095
S0, we created a container.

188
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,075
Now, I want to access that container.

189
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:57,830
I want to enter into the container, yes,

190
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,630
you can enter by using this command,

191
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,240
simply Docker, execute e FCC,

192
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,415
hyphen IT container ID.

193
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,155
Then with respect to some shell,

194
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,630
suppose I want to use SSH shell or bash shell.

195
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,755
So based on that shell,

196
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,585
you can access that container.

197
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:15,440
C, that simply Docker EX EEC,

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,835
hyphen IT, take anyone of the container ID.

199
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,950
Then I want to login.

200
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,960
I want to access this container.

201
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,180
I want to enter into that container using,

202
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,725
let's say Bash shell.

203
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:31,385
So that now you are in this container.

204
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:32,735
Fine.

205
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:37,190
If you want to verify what type of operating system is there with that container,

206
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:43,985
simply run cat slash EDC ways released CentOS Linux, let's say, fine.

207
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,580
Now let me come out from the container C,

208
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,960
if you want to come out from the container unit to press Control,

209
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,260
and then immediately press P and Q so that you will come out from your container.

210
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,220
Fine.

211
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,570
Now let me enter into open to image.

212
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,060
So simply again, Docker 0x e,

213
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,585
c, hyphen IT, then Container ID.

214
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:13,590
Let's say I want to enter into this container using SHE shell.

215
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,815
You can also use Bash.

216
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,435
No problem. No.

217
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:23,270
Let me verify operating system for this container cat slash EDC ways release.

218
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:29,120
Yes, open two. Now, if you want to come out from this container,

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,665
simply control immediately P and then Q.

220
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:36,560
That's a fine.

221
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,310
Now see that docker ps we have two containers.

222
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,470
No, let me stop one of the container.

223
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,550
It may be any container.

224
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,485
Suppose I am taking this container.

225
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:47,240
So if you want to stop your container,

226
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,435
simply Docker, stop container ID.

227
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:51,650
That's it.

228
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:57,590
Now if I run docker ps c that D showing only one container which is running.

229
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,055
Just know we stopped open to container.

230
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:06,050
Now, if you want to list the running as well as Stop the containers,

231
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,430
then you have to run command called docker ps with option called hyphen yea,

232
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,460
our iPhone, iPhone all see that?

233
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,595
Now this is exited, which is not running.

234
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:19,985
Anyway, to list running as well as top to containers,

235
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:21,635
you have to take docker, ps,

236
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,960
hyphen yea, or iPhone, iPhone all command.

237
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,965
Fine.

238
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,665
Now let me start this container.

239
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:33,330
Yes, we can start it simply by taking the Docker start container ID.

240
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,125
Now that container has been started,

241
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,645
if you want to verify simply docker ps.

242
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:43,250
Yes. Now both the contains a running fine.

243
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,665
Now, suppose I want to delete any one of the container or all containers.

244
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:51,095
Let me remove this container.

245
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:54,140
If you want to remove the container, command is docker.

246
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,675
Remove your container ID.

247
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:02,615
But if I run that you will get an exception C that you can't remove a running container.

248
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:07,610
So if you want to remove a container using Docker RM command,

249
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,280
you how to stop it and then you have to remove it.

250
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:17,240
Audience forcefully also, you can remove that container simply by taking remove hyphen F,

251
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,350
c. Now let me display docker ps,

252
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,795
or docker ps, iPhone yay or iPhone, iPhone.

253
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:28,310
All we have only one container. It has been removed.

254
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,225
Which one?

255
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:29,720
Yeah, this one.

256
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,025
It has been removed.

257
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,990
Not stop, but it has been removed.

258
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,280
There is no container now.

259
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,075
Fine.

260
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:39,830
Now we have only one container called CentOS container find.

261
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,695
Now, instead of using hyphen EF option,

262
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,390
if you want to remove a container,

263
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,750
what we have to do is first we need to stop the container.

264
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,640
Now let me stop this container first.

265
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,020
Now.

266
00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:00,440
See docker ps. There are no running containers but Docker PSI,

267
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,940
funny, a stopped container.

268
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,500
Is there not to remove,

269
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,120
stop the container directly.

270
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,560
You can take command called docker.

271
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,005
Remove your container ID, that's it.

272
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:13,355
Now there are no more containers running or stopped.

273
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,615
Fine.

274
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,010
Now I want to create a container.

275
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,255
Yes, you can create it.

276
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:18,380
Docker.

277
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,605
Run hyphen, hyphen D,

278
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:27,530
Let's say CentOS container has been created.

279
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,025
See that? It is running.

280
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:33,785
Let me run only docker ps.

281
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:34,835
Let's wait.

282
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,800
So if you want to enter into this container,

283
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,300
again, what is the command?

284
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,210
Docker EX EC, hyphen IT,

285
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,820
then it may be shell or bash shell. You can take initial.

286
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,200
Fine.

287
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,660
Now if you want to come out from the container,

288
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,835
simply press Control and then immediately P and Q on your keyboard.

289
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,065
Let's say.

290
00:14:57,065 --> 00:15:03,960
Okay, so guys, these are the basic required commands to work with your Docker.

291
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,890
Okay, guys, thank you for watching this video.
