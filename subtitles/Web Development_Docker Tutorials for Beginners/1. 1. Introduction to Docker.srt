00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Hi friends, welcome to Docker tutorials for

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,730
beginners and decisions that ended up instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,010
First, let me go with introduction to Docker anyway before entering into Docker concert.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,415
First, let me tell you what is the story before Docker.

5
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,770
Now to understand about this concept,

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,260
I am taking a very simple example that is,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,919
just assume that we need to run one Java application.

8
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,860
See whenever if you want to run any Java application,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,230
we need some database or were some application server and web server.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,465
So here in my case is simply I'm taking,

11
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,475
we need one MySQL database server,

12
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,275
one Tomcat application server,

13
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:40,130
and one IIS web server. That's fine.

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,185
And here, just assume that because of

15
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:44,900
some compatibility issues with your operating system,

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,510
we need only Windows Server to those untoward to run MySQL database server,

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,505
and 2016 to run Tomcat applications or what?

18
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:57,425
Anyway, it needs some Java.

19
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:02,120
And then Windows Server 2019 to run IIS web server.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,020
Fine.

21
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,435
So now we need three servers.

22
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:10,850
One is Windows Server 20122016, and then 2019.

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,645
That's fine.

24
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:15,155
So here my question is how to get required servers.

25
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:19,760
So actually we need three different operating systems or servers, right?

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,390
So how to get them?

27
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,670
Actually we hope to ways before Docker concept they are

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,050
first one is get three computing the wedges with the required hardware.

29
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,760
I mean, let say suppose I need each computer with

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,980
16 GB RAM and then to TB hard disk just to get three devices under

31
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,185
then install with your required Windows server operating system so that we can create

32
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:50,765
our three servers directly get your required server from any cloud,

33
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,510
but is one way audible simply,

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,945
we can create 3D virtual emissions from VMware.

35
00:01:56,945 --> 00:02:01,115
Now here, to get more clarity on Docker concept,

36
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:03,890
simply, I'm going with second week.

37
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,820
We are going to create virtual missions from VMware.

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,260
And assume that your VMware is running on Windows Server.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,160
Fine.

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,350
Now let me go with how to create VM missions or required servers from VMware.

41
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,025
See whenever if you want to create any server from VMware.

42
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:25,925
First of all, you need to run your VMware on any one of the server.

43
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:29,255
So just assume that I am running my VMware or

44
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:33,005
simply hypervisor on one of my Windows Server.

45
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,595
And for this Windows Server,

46
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:39,080
just assume that we have 128 GB RAM and hard disk.

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,010
Fine.

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,780
Now we have VMware.

49
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,905
Using this VMware, we can create any number of settlements,

50
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:51,665
but be clear that any number of solvers depends on this configuration information.

51
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:55,610
Suppose e Here we have 128 GB RAM and ten dB hardness.

52
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,485
Anyway, in our case,

53
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,480
suppose we need three servers.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,120
Now, just assume that we are going to create

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,560
each server with 16 GB RAM onto TB hard disk.

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,915
So 16 into 348 GB,

57
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:11,855
a 102 into 36 PB.

58
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:15,800
Yes, we have more than that with your host operating system.

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,910
So that way we can create three servers.

60
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,845
Now just assume that we are going to create three servers.

61
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,585
Anyway from VMware.

62
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,060
Whenever if you want to create any server,

63
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,000
we need one ISO image.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,090
That is nothing but your operating system image.

65
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:38,185
And be clear, suppose I'm going to take waste image are suppose Windows Server 2012.

66
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,295
So using that email,

67
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:42,474
I can create my requires hard work for my database.

68
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:48,760
And assume that second time I'm selecting my ways imaged as Windows Server 2016.

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,445
Yes. From that we can create one Windows Server.

70
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:52,270
Same way.

71
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,575
I'm going to take different waves image that is Windows Server 2019.

72
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:58,810
And by using that with image,

73
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,345
I'm going to create one more server.

74
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:01,070
Fine.

75
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,790
So after creating your three servers using your VMware,

76
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,560
now I'm deploying MySQL database server on your toes and tool server,

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,160
then Tomcat server on Java on your to-do and 16 server,

78
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,505
and then IAAS webserver on total.

79
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,915
Fine.

80
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:22,714
Now we'd done our required setup to run Java application.

81
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,215
This is fine.

82
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:26,720
But what is the drawback here?

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,370
Very simple.

84
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,535
C before telling that C actually as of no,

85
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:34,205
on my laptop, Suppose I have Windows ten.

86
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:36,920
Let me open start Minow on my Windows ten.

87
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,965
Now if i how by default,

88
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:43,130
different types of software with my Windows ten.

89
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,690
But I am not using all these default software

90
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,415
to run either database server or Tomcat server IIS web server.

91
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:56,645
I don't need them to run any one of these application.

92
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,105
So if you're not using them,

93
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,505
why we need to install it with our operating system.

94
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:06,335
See if more number of softwares with your ISO image,

95
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:09,590
then it will take more time to launch your server.

96
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,205
But if you how less softwares with your ISO image,

97
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:15,695
then it will take less time to launch your server.

98
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:19,505
So if you launch your server with the less time,

99
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:23,225
then we are saving some time for our production.

100
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:24,590
Right?

101
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,290
So because of that here,

102
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,365
what we will do is we will minimize our ISO images as much as possible.

103
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:34,415
Fine.

104
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:39,290
And one more thing, if you observe here we are using all servers,

105
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,220
Windows servers, including your host operating system.

106
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,225
Say actually, if you go with any operating system,

107
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:49,850
we how to parts.

108
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,445
They are carnal and softwares.

109
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:58,025
See here, colonel is simply a program using that we can interact with the hardware.

110
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,575
Now that can really sing,

111
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:05,570
go with Windows Server 2012 or 16 or 19 or whatever it may be.

112
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,130
Now, same colonel, across all your servers.

113
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,960
Then why we need to install same candle on all your sorrows and shove that.

114
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,130
I can use the canal which is there on your operating system so that,

115
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:25,070
that canon software part also I can reduce in my ISO image, right?

116
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,545
So if you reduce your iOS where you may size

117
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:30,080
then will take very less than to launch your server.

118
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,644
That is actually an advantage.

119
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:33,665
Fine.

120
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:39,245
Anyway, softwares are nothing but required libraries and packages 40 what server?

121
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,595
That's fine.

122
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:42,935
Now, our concept is.

123
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,205
If you are able to reduce image,

124
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,320
then it is an advantage.

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,600
So that is the concept of your Docker.

126
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,775
But how let me tell you that.

127
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,790
Oh, let me go with create servers using Docker.

128
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,390
See whenever if you want to create servers using VMware,

129
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,775
actually we are running somebody where VMware.

130
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:05,135
Same way whenever if you want to create service using Docker,

131
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,490
we need to run your Docker somewhere.

132
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,435
So let's say I'm running my Docker on Windows Server.

133
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:12,425
Fine.

134
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,255
Now, here, using Docker,

135
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:15,830
we can create our servers.

136
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,160
But here we have a small difference between Docker and

137
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,585
VMware with respect to operating system or host operating system.

138
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:28,520
That is, if you're host operating system is Windows server,

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,120
then using Docker, we can create only Windows servers.

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,125
So like Windows Server 2012 or 16 or 19.

141
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,870
Only Windows servers we can create using

142
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,065
docker if you're a host operating system, Windows.

143
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:46,265
Suppose these host operating system, let's say Linux.

144
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:50,660
Then using Docker, we can create Linux operating systems,

145
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,405
let's say open to our HDL sent ways.

146
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,430
So say Linux, something like that.

147
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,240
Fine.

148
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,070
But if you go with the VMware respect to of your host operating system.

149
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,270
Using VMware, we can create any type of operating system,

150
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,980
any type of server.

151
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,270
Fine C, to create your servers using VMware.

152
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,670
We are taking ISO image.

153
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,120
So here also to create your required servers using Docker,

154
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,175
we had to take ISO image.

155
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:22,760
But here that ISO image is minimized

156
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,280
ISO image nothing but it consists of only a required software's.

157
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,125
Nothing but libraries and packages to run your application, let's say.

158
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:39,575
And here that minimize the ISO image is called Docker image weekly or don't get confused.

159
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,530
See if you want to create a server using VMware,

160
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,440
we are taking an operating system IS where you made.

161
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,185
So here also using docker,

162
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:49,625
if you want to create a server,

163
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,335
we need one ISP amazed,

164
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:52,955
that is nothing but Docker image.

165
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:56,840
But we have a difference between your normal operating system IS well,

166
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,685
you mentioned and Docker image that is either operating system,

167
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,650
ISO is complete one,

168
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,010
but Docker image is not a complete ISO image.

169
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,570
It is not having kernel and also additional software.

170
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:17,015
It will only required libraries and packages to run your particular application.

171
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,800
That's fine.

172
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,155
Now, using this Docker image,

173
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:24,365
with the help of Docker, we can create any number of servers.

174
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,360
Of course that n number of servers

175
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,585
depends on the configuration of your host operating system.

176
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:30,530
Fine.

177
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,530
Now assume that we need to create three servers.

178
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,210
And one more thing you are running now your Docker on windows server.

179
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,530
That's why using Docker,

180
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,555
you can create only Windows servers.

181
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,410
Fine.

182
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,090
Now assume that I want to create Windows Server 2012.

183
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,380
So if you want to create your particular server with Watson,

184
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,005
you have to sell it to proper Docker image.

185
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,710
We have n number of images already available with the Docker.

186
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,625
So we will select the required image based on our required server.

187
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:06,485
Now assume that I selected are darker remains for Windows Server 2012.

188
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:09,500
So now by using that image with the help of Docker,

189
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,570
we launch in one server.

190
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,030
So now the server is not a complete one.

191
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,040
That's why it's simply I am calling it as mini Windows server. That is what, 2002.

192
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,245
Well, anyway we need two more.

193
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,340
Now assume that I selected Docker image for 2016.

194
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,095
So from that, with the help of dagger,

195
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:30,050
I created many windows server 2016,

196
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,360
same way, mini Windows Server 2019.

197
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Fine.

198
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,080
Now we have our three servers.

199
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,890
Fine.

200
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,620
No, let me deploy our required database server,

201
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,880
Tomcat server on Java,

202
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,175
on ASR, we're on our servers.

203
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:43,790
Fine.

204
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,320
So be clear.

205
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,850
Our servers, whatever the servers we created with the help of Docker,

206
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,020
by taking Docker image,

207
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,205
they are not complete one, they need camel.

208
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:58,040
Now these three servers will use carbonyl

209
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,565
from your host operating system with the help of Docker.

210
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:02,540
Fine.

211
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,380
Now instead of calling these three servers as Mini servers,

212
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,270
simply we are calling them as containers Nazi. And here one more thing.

213
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,000
Suppose I want to create Linux servers.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,815
So in that case first the thing,

215
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:19,835
you how to take your host operating system as the Linux server.

216
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:23,255
It may be open to or ritual or CentOS, whatever it may be.

217
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:27,530
So using that Linux host operating system with the help of darker,

218
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,770
by selecting required Linux image,

219
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,370
it may be open to image for auditorially maize or CentOS image,

220
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,825
we can create your Linux servers.

221
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:38,140
Fine.

222
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,040
So this is just a very basic idea about your Docker.

223
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,965
Oh, this idea, let me go with what is a docker?

224
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:48,460
Simply, Docker is this software to create a mini server,

225
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,145
but don't tell that it is used to create a mini server.

226
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:55,765
Instead of that, Docker is a software to create a container.

227
00:11:55,765 --> 00:12:01,375
So how we are creating a containers using Docker with the help of image, Docker image.

228
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:06,970
So finally, we can create n number of containers on a host operating system.

229
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,865
On all containers are virtually separated.

230
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:13,645
So while running your containers with the help of Docker,

231
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:19,550
all containers, we'll assume that they're running on separate operating system.

232
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,455
Fine.

233
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:24,140
And finally, simply, Docker is

234
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,670
a containerization tool because we are creating containers using Docker.

235
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,465
Fine.

236
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:32,315
Now, if you search in Google, what is a Docker?

237
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:35,375
You will get different definitions, right?

238
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,925
But as of now, I don't want to go with them.

239
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,355
So well, going forward, step-by-step,

240
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:43,130
I will add concepts to your Docker so that I

241
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,905
will make complete definition for what Docker,

242
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:48,170
so that it is very easy as a beginner.

243
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,595
Okay.

244
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:53,160
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
