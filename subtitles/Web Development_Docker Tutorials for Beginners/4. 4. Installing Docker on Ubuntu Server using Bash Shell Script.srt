1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
Print sheared or concept is how to install Docker on Ubuntu server.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,515
So here we are installing Docker on

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,815
Ubuntu server using Bash shell script anyway before that,

4
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:13,155
if you remember, this is our Docker architecture.

5
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:18,690
So if you observe here, we are installing Docker on top of some host.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,925
That host may be with Windows operating system or with any Linux operating system.

7
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,680
So again, in Linux operating system,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,605
We can go with either open to or CentOS or Rachel,

9
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,930
or Amazon Linux or IBM Linux.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,460
It could be any operating system. Fine.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,970
Now first let me get my open to server C here.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,855
I'm taking open to server from AWS cloud.

13
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,760
Now, I already created the server.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,925
Let me login into it. So simply,

15
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:50,390
I'm logging into our urban to server.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,650
Now.

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,420
Just let me verify what is

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,600
the operating system to that open to anybody. This is the latest one.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,830
That's fine.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,070
Now, we how our required operating system.

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,975
Next thing is when it installed Docker,

22
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,805
not to install your Docker.

23
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:10,295
We hope to go and get Docker software.

24
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:11,990
Anyway before going to that,

25
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,585
actually docker comes in two editions.

26
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,430
One is Docker Community Edition,

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,920
and the second one is Docker Enterprise Edition.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,425
There are some differences between these two additions.

29
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:25,355
Anyway, simply, Docker Community Edition is like open source.

30
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:29,720
You can download and install with your required operating system.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,325
And this Docker Community Edition purposes just to get

32
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:38,960
practice with your Docker container ation concept. That's it.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,205
And here, Docker Enterprise Edition, definitely,

34
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:47,195
it has some advanced concepts compared to your Docker Community Edition,

35
00:01:47,195 --> 00:01:49,100
because this is Enterprise Edition.

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,280
Again, Docker Enterprise edition is available in

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,300
terms of basic standard and at once, additions.

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,450
Simply are given some differences between

39
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,005
your community edition with your Docker Enterprise Edition.

40
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:06,635
So initially we will practice with Docker Community Edition.

41
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:10,985
Anyway, Docker Enterprise Edition is also available as trial version.

42
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:13,280
So later we will use that and we'll use

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,375
some advanced concepts from our Docker Enterprise edition as well.

44
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,200
Fine.

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,910
Now let me go and install Docker Community Edition on our open to server.

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,895
Now here we are installing through Bash shell script.

47
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,345
Now you can get your required bash escape in this location.

48
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:33,860
Now let me open my repository, GitHub repository.

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,920
So just open Docker tutorials for beginners.

50
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,590
Clone this repository to your local host.

51
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,660
I mean, where you want to install your Docker.

52
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,010
So this is the server.

53
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,475
So what I am doing is simply, I'm cloning it.

54
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,985
So anybody is open but opposed to read vertically, you can clone it.

55
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:56,950
Git clone that URL.

56
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,910
Fine.

57
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,295
Now here we have the repo.

58
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:02,095
So enter into it.

59
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:07,750
Now here we have our first introduction concept.

60
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,175
So go to that.

61
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,260
And here we have a shell script.

62
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,200
Now see here we have shell script.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,615
So nothing is there. Whatever the steps are manually we are performing to install Docker.

64
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,985
All those steps I added in this script.

65
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:24,460
So if you open and if you go with one by one,

66
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,520
you will come to know what are the steps, very simple steps.

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,405
Anyway.

68
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:33,955
First, let me try to forward the execution permission for it. Now I am running it.

69
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:39,565
Say that please run this script from root only C to install your packages,

70
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:43,945
you should have root privileges or you should run your commands from root user.

71
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:49,120
So anyway here I designed descrip such that it has to execute only from root user.

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Now let me switch into root.

73
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,390
You can copy your required script into

74
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,570
your root location or directly can provide complete path.

75
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,580
So let say home.

76
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,595
Under this user, we how Docker tutorials

77
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:06,580
in that introduction part, we have a shell script.

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,630
Now let me run it.

79
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,205
See that oases I interpret as open to then DES installing.

80
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:15,235
So whatever the steps we are performing manually,

81
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:18,415
all those tips I added in this city.

82
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:23,800
So it is going to install your required Docker Community Edition anyway,

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,735
it will do, it will install latest Docker on your host.

84
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,920
So just wait.

85
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,975
So before executing the script,

86
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,705
just to open it and see step by step,

87
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:43,330
what is the logic is there inside that?

88
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,350
Fine.

89
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,590
Now it is almost hidden.

90
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,515
And one more thing, this script will work only on open to server.

91
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:12,350
Yeah, fine. Now Docker has been installed

92
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,110
successfully on this host and it is up and running.

93
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:22,490
You can verify it using system CTL status Docker. Docker is up and running.

94
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,390
Now, after that you just verify some commands.

95
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's say docker space hyphen, hyphen version.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,580
We'll use docker Watson, anybody who has the latest version

97
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,685
as of now, then Docker version,

98
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,050
see that how you are going to get,

99
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,850
you're getting some information about your plane,

100
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,195
turn your Docker Engine in within his community version.

101
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,260
Fine.

102
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,020
And one more thing, you can also run docker info.

103
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,825
So just us off no, just update this log.

104
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:50,585
You don't need to worry about this anti log information

105
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,315
going forward based on our known concept,

106
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:55,925
I will explain about this step-by-step.

107
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:59,450
Fine. Okay guys, this is the simple way just to install

108
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,050
your Docker on open to server using Bash shell script.

109
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,740
Okay?

110
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,480
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
