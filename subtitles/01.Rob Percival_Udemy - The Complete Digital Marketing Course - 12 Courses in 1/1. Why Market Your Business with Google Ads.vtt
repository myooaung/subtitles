00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.910
In this video you're going to learn about the three key benefits of Google Adwords and also we'll do

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.690
a comparison between Google onwards and Facebook it's because it's a common question that comes up which

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.920
should I really invest my advertising dollars into.

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.570
But let's get started with the three key benefits of Google Adwords and really online advertising in

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.460
general and the first key benefit is that you get instant results.

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.620
If you come into our AdWords set up a campaign and appear at the top of the search results in Google

7
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:39.370
here well then you can be getting traffic to your Web site straight away and ran the clock traffic to

8
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.100
your Web site within five minutes.

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.370
Now if you want to appear organically here in the search engines you've to create content to share that

10
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.500
content to get a lot of people linking to it even on social media.

11
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.640
You need to be setting up your Facebook page creating great content building up an audience.

12
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.310
So it's a much longer term process and a key advantage of online advertising is really to get those

13
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.380
instant results.

14
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.120
You can set up a campaign in less than five minutes.

15
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.310
Now the other key advantage of Google Adwords in particular is it's highly targeted.

16
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.540
Now you can see that these ads if I type in here digital marketing course online that these ads are

17
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.990
really related to the search that I've put in here.

18
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:34.990
So if I put in something like a drone and see if any ads come up here so we can see that the odds change

19
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.930
based on the search that I put in.

20
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.700
And that makes advertising on our words incredibly targeted targeted not only just by the key word here

21
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.770
but also by location.

22
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.710
So if I wanted to advertise only to people say where I am in Ireland then I could set that up I could

23
00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.840
do certain times of day and a lot lot more so targeting is a key part of the advertising and in particular

24
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.990
on Google Adwords the key advantages you can target those ads brand exactly what people are searching

25
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.530
for.

26
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.620
And that helps you to really get better conversion rates get people clicking through and get those people

27
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.290
to maybe buy or taken action because we already know what they want.

28
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.860
They've told us by typing that into google.

29
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.330
Now the third key benefit of Google AdWords is its cost effective so the way that the advertising works

30
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.600
is that you pay per click.

31
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.260
You might have heard that before it's PPC for short.

32
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.520
So only if somebody clicks on this side.

33
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.130
Do I actually pay Google AdWords.

34
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.180
So that's the key advantage is well if nobody is clicking on the ads then I don't pay anything.

35
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.510
But if people are clicking the ads then I pay per click.

36
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.420
So those are the three key benefits of Google Adwords get instant results.

37
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.070
They're highly targeted and they're very cost effective.

38
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.750
Now come question then that comes up as well.

39
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.710
Google Adwords sends pretty good what about Facebook has a lot of hype around that as well which is

40
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.560
more effective.

41
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.360
Which gets better results and I think the key thing to understand is that whether you want to advertise

42
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.230
on Facebook or whether you want to advertise on Google where you really need to keep in mind is the

43
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.500
intent of the people on those Web sites.

44
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.810
So when I come to Google I know exactly what I'm searching for and I'm typing that into the search engine

45
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.480
for example a digital marketing course online.

46
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.160
If I come into Facebook I'm not searching for anything.

47
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.780
I'm really here just to connect and share.

48
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.630
And so my intent is much difference here.

49
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.900
Now a lot of stuff comes up in my news feed here that I might have been thinking of like this for example

50
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.540
there's a new workspace in Dublin.

51
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.380
I haven't been searching for that but I am in Dublin.

52
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.780
I do work from home so it's kind of relevant to me and they will have target that to me around certain

53
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.700
criteria.

54
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.700
So I'm not searching for this but still this is something that I could be interested in.

55
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.780
So if you want to advertise on Facebook just remember that you have to get.

56
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.150
You want to be targeting people who are much further up that sales funnel.

57
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.530
They might just becoming even aware of you here on Facebook first where as on ad words if I had it typed

58
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.220
in coworking space Dublin then that would be a different type of it.

59
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.100
So really both platforms are get great results and not one is better than the other.

60
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.190
The key thing that you need to remember is that people here and outwards they know exactly what they're

61
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.750
looking for here in Facebook.

62
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.330
They don't maybe not be searching for something.

63
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.060
Exactly.

64
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.300
But you have a ton of information about them who their friends are.

65
00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.170
And there's also a ton of social proof that you can add into the advertising here like comments likes

66
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.480
cetera that aren't those type of social proof factors aren't available here on outwards.

67
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.300
Clearly as you can see.

68
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.710
So which one should you use which is more effective.

69
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.180
Both are very effective.

70
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.540
Just remember that the intent is slightly different.

71
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.410
On each there are slightly different features and targeting options but a really good thing to do is

72
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:29.600
to allocate a little bit of budget to both our words and Facebook so you can rerun ads on both understand

73
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.730
both systems.

74
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.780
And actually I found by comparing both and using both I understand both a lot better.

75
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.560
So that is kind of a protip to actually split a budget start to use both of them and that will really

76
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.800
help you understand how to use both platforms effectively.
