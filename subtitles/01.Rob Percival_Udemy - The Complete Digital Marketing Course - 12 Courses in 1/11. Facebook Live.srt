00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,400
In this video you're going to learn how to use live video on Facebook to grow your business.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,070
So first we walk you through the practical steps to go live on Facebook and then I'll give you a couple

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,230
of ideas about how you can use it to grow your business.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,390
So the practical steps to going live is very simple.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,110
At the top of your news feed here you're going to see the option to create a live video.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,680
You might just have to prove access to your camera.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,160
Now right now I've just covered my camera with a sheet of paper.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,930
But you can read it in here select the page that you want to share it on.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,130
So I could change that here if I wanted to.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,790
And then you just want to say something by the video that you're putting in.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,640
Then you can select your camera on the microphone that you're using so you can change those Iran if

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,340
you want to you can plug in their camera so you can do that and you can even share your screen as well.

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:08,500
I'm using the Chrome browser and you can toss it in this Chrome extension to enable screen share which

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,140
you can use for presentations or you could use even for game play as well.

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:22,280
So I can just put in a test title and then you cannot in tags if you want if you're doing game play.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,800
You can see that you can tag a video game so that will show up.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,710
So in terms of the setup it's very quick and then to go live itself you just click go live you can see

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:42,370
you get it can't end like this and you can see that my comment came at the top and then you're going

19
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,950
to see you're able to you can write comments in here.

20
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,120
And also if anybody is commenting on your video you're going to see this pop up in the sidebar here

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,720
in the right as you're talking and as you're appearing on camera so you can read the comments as you're

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,190
going live.

23
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:07,510
Now once you've finished your live video then you can just click Finish.

24
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,590
And then what is going to happen after that.

25
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,720
Is that a replay of your video will be available on your timeline.

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,970
You can just click on if I refresh the page.

27
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,530
This should COBE come up almost immediately.

28
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,370
And you can see there it is there.

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,320
If any anybody commented on this while I was doing it that would have been shown up here.

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,820
And you know people could read back and watch this later as well.

31
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,770
So how do you actually use this.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,670
Well what are some use cases of it.

33
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,060
Well on your home page you can just use this for something like an Ask Me Anything.

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,530
This is an example that I did just ask me anything about Facebook live.

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,670
Are Facebook ads you can promote that in advance.

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,690
You can send them an e-mail notification saying I'll be doing a live.

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,100
Ask me anything on Facebook at this time.

38
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:09,090
Join in and then they can just click through at the appropriate time and log in or you can do it or

39
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,700
not as I've done it here just a short one minute to minute video.

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,880
And then I said you know ask me anything I'll answer questions even afterwards.

41
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,020
And I got quite a lot of use for this one video quite a lot of comments and then I ultimately went ahead

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,710
and just answer those Collins and then promoted Darkhorse course that I was kind of about Facebook and

43
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,510
said I created at a later stage.

44
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,010
So I put an update in afterwards.

45
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,520
How else can you use this.

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,090
Well you can use this not only on your own Facebook page but you can do this in Facebook groups.

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:52,260
So here's an example of this was it not for you to me in structure if you click into this you can see

48
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:59,230
that he said I'm live in the instructor club for the next hour I'll be answering many of the questions

49
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,440
so and a little bit of a build up before this.

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,820
He was commenting in this group saying I'll be live on X days if you have any questions just let me

51
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,890
know below.

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,650
And then he just went live under his personal profile and started to answer some questions and you can

53
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,670
see quite a lot of comments in here which he went ahead and answered.

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:30,600
So you could do this under your own name in a Facebook group and then start to talk a little bit about

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,340
your business and how people can learn more.

56
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,830
Or you can also go live directly on your own Facebook page.

57
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,230
There's a couple of use cases for them.

58
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:47,790
I particularly like that example of someone leveraging this to get in front of a Facebook group and

59
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:54,390
to really help that group but also talk more about his own business as well.

60
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,690
So now that you know how to go live on Facebook create a live video for yourself or put this strategy

61
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,100
in your back pocket for later.
