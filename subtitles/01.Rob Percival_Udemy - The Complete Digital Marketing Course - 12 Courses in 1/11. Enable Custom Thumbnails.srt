1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,640
And custom thumbnails for YouTube videos is one of the most effective ways to get more views on your

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,350
video and have a consistent brand.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,310
However if you just created your youtube can't and uploaded your first video you may be seeing this

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,770
message that you're not eligible for custom thumbnails.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,880
And at the moment you only have the option to select a thumbnail which is an image from the video that

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,660
you've uploaded now to enable custom thumbnails.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,550
What you wanna do is go ahead and click on your icon in the top right hand corner.

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,070
Then you want to come down into Creator studio and then you want to come down here to the left side

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,270
bar and click on channel then you want to move down here and really click on verify.

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:54,000
Now at the moment this is this YouTube channel is not verified and you can see that I am eligible for

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,920
some stuff because some thumbnails external annotations and other important features of YouTube are

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,200
not enabled.

13
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,450
So what you want to do is go ahead and click verify.

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,630
And here you will have a couple of options to verify your YouTube channel.

15
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:19,070
You just firstly select your country and then you can call it with an automated voice message or text

16
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,640
with a verification code.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,560
Now I think putting in your phone number is probably the easiest thing to do.

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,280
So I'm just going to type this in.

19
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,400
Once you put in your phone number just hit submit

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,050
a not in the verification code once you get it by text message on your phone.

21
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,720
And now this account has been verified.

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,300
If we go back to check our status now and scroll down we can see that the custom thumbnails has been

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,090
enabled and those other features as well.

24
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:57,780
And returning to our video is reload the page and I can see now that I am able to upload a customized

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,220
thumbnail.

26
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,450
Now it's your turn.

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,840
Click on your channel icon.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,650
Go to the creators studio and verifier can turn my channel so that you can add custom thumbnails to

29
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,360
your videos and get a whole lot more views.
