00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,500
In this video I'm going to show you how to strike gold with second degree connections on LinkedIn.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,760
So to get started what you want to do is come up and click on the search bar here.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,120
The top of LinkedIn.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,720
And then you already want to search for people.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,620
And this is an incredibly useful part of Linked-In.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,340
It's essentially the search engine for people.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,280
And we can see right now it's showing a list of 300 93000 results for me and also then we have a huge

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,830
list and options here to really filter that list then.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,210
Now I really want to show you the power of these second degree connections by first showing you the

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,670
how many first degree corrections I have.

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,550
So on this purse on my personal profile here I've just 970 connections.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,990
So these are people I've directly connected with.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,860
I've hit that connect button and they've connected back.

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,060
So those are the first people I kind of personally know now where it gets extremely interesting is when

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,940
I look at my second degree connections and those in now it's gone up to 392 thousands.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,510
So almost 400 times the network that I could tap into is just one step away.

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,370
So these second degree connections are connections of my connections.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:25,560
So I know maybe someone here can give you a real example of this.

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,480
I know Roy and Roy knows the Emma.

20
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:35,770
So what I could do if I wanted to connect with Emma is ask Roy for a personal introduction or I could

21
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,170
just simply hit connect.

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,080
And because we have so many connections in common She's probably very likely to connect back.

23
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:50,020
Now if you want to use this strategy just to grow your personal profiling get those connection numbers

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,390
up and you can just go ahead and connect on all these.

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,910
I would recommend you try and connect with no more than 150 per day.

26
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:04,450
And also another tip is if you want to use this strategy you could maybe it's outsource this to a virtual

27
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,810
assistant because it will take you a good bit of time to get through all of those.

28
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:16,030
Now if you wanting search for second degree connections in a more targeted way maybe to pitch them or

29
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,860
get on a call to sell say B2B software or something like that.

30
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:27,970
What you could do is start to use some of the old other filters here so we can see that if we click

31
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:35,500
on the drop and here we can see that we can even type in their name their company or their title.

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,890
So let's imagine that I was trying to really pitch our product to CEOs.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,310
So chief technical officers I could just type that into the title field there and now it's showing up

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,850
in results.

35
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:58,540
So I could ask one of my connections again here for example let's open this up car so I could maybe

36
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,980
message Karl and say Hi Karl.

37
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,740
I'd love to talk to niall to me over at whatever company Fearn ago.

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,230
Would you mind giving us making me a quick introduction.

39
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,820
Or again you can just connect and see if he connects back and then you'll have the option to message

40
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,120
him directly.

41
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,740
So you can see from a network where I probably had very few Teoh's in it.

42
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,470
I've never and see Teoh's just through those second degree connections.

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,160
Now if you wanted to even take it a step further these third degree connections are really connections

44
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,250
of your connections connections starts to get a little bit more complicated and watered down.

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,780
So I think really the second degree connections are where the power is because they're just one step

46
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,750
away with you but as you start to add more people to your network remember that that pool of second

47
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,740
degree connections will continue to grow again.

48
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:00,610
So it's one of the amazing things about Illington it really shows the network effect and how powerful

49
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,600
it is.

50
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,600
And remember that in here in the search engine you can really find all these second degree connections

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,240
and filter them down to really find a targeted list of people that you can connect to it on LinkedIn.

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,220
So go ahead and try that for yourself or put this strategy in your back pocket for later for a client

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,850
or for a company that you're working for.
