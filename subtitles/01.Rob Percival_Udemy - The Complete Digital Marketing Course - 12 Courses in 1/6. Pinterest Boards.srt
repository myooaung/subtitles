00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,700
In this video you're going to learn how to create boards and on pins to them on Pinterest.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,010
This is a key part of building your audience it's the most important step singing a walk you through

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,310
everything.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,270
So first thing what what is a boy and what's the purpose of it.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,880
Well I recommend that you look at some of the top influencers canes in your niche.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,120
For example here for digital marketing you can see this guy has 20000 followers.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,950
This is THE NATION I'm working in.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,240
And if I just look at his profile and look at his boards and scroll down I can see that essentially

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,960
these boards act as different topics or subtopics so you can see that the main topic is digital marketing.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,430
But obviously there's a lot of more specific topics within that like digital marketing strategies Social

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,340
Media Marketing Content marketing influence or marketing Pinterest marketing blogging tips etc..

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,420
So really these boards help to organize content for those subtopics.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,800
Now let's look at it completely different each.

14
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,490
We can see this is an e-commerce store Moria's seal again a lot of followers over 900 Italians and you

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,720
can see that they have used these boards to organize into categories Eskin so their own store jewelry

16
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,520
Bohemia plants get fancy art home decor hotsync cetera.

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,720
And these boards are helpful to people because they might just be looking to get ideas about hats.

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,700
So it's better for them to come into these boards and see all of the content organized here and that

19
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,600
helps them get those ideas much much easier.

20
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,130
So essentially these boards just organize them and organize the content pretty much.

21
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,380
Now you can be quite creative with these boards like gifts soner 25 classes and sonis if Sundra a hundred

22
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,840
makeup and beauty even something like knives you think that is extremely nice.

23
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:03,180
But there's over a thousand pins on that scarves over the horizon pins so people really do like to get

24
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,680
specific on Pinterest because there's so much content there.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,590
If people can organize it for them in boards they're going to want to follow that board to keep updated

26
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,200
on those ideas.

27
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,780
So this is how you add value on Pinterest by either organizing your own content in different boards

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,730
and I'm going to show you as well you can actually organize other other people's content into these

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,400
boards as well.

30
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,310
And finally let's look at this food blog pinch of Yum.

31
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:39,240
Same idea boards are used to organize content recipe videos appetizers baking bowls breakfast brunch

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,710
drinks healthy meals desserts pizza pasta etc..

33
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,670
So really looking at some topic can your needs is a great way to get ideas for even washboards to create

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,170
and how to lay them out.

35
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,500
Now I do want to give you a pretty cool tip as well as your boards can appear at the top of the search

36
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,640
engine and what you want to do is actually what this guy's done here he's done a pretty well.

37
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,470
You can see that the way he's named his boards is actually very specific.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,370
So he's not just saying random things.

39
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,760
He's saying digital marketing strategy fails to open that up and actually see it in the link there.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,160
So why is he named.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:28,590
Well if I come into Pinterest and I search for Digital Marketing So that's the main topic in my niche.

42
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,750
Now what you can see underneath the search bar are these suggested search terms.

43
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,480
And this works the exact same way as Google Sink's suggested search.

44
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,450
They're going to put in other additional keywords here that are highly search.

45
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,550
So you know if these are appearing underneath here these are highly search terms.

46
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:55,740
And so if I click on strategy which is the number one term after digital or digital marketing I can

47
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,160
see that actually if I come across them boards I can see this guy ran sellers appearing right at the

48
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,630
top because he's named his board after the exact search term.

49
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,750
So when you're creating your boards you should really think about that as well.

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,370
Create your boards really around those search terms.

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,750
You can appear at the top of the search results and get more visibility for your boards.

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,610
It's a really good tip to grow quickly.

53
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:30,480
So now that we have a clear idea about what the boards are how to name them the next logical question

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,410
is What do you actually put in these boards.

55
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,500
Well the great news is is that you don't have to only put your own content in you might not have a ton

56
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,770
of content and so your thinking had a build up an audience on Pinterest.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,390
Well the great thing that you can do is you can pin other people's content into your boards.

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,140
Now this is still valuable for people and people want to follow this.

59
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:01,620
As you can see here because essentially you're operating as an aggregator you're helping organize content

60
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,150
filtering for people.

61
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,650
And of course they're are going to want to follow that board if that's useful for them and saves them

62
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,690
time and searching for it all together.

63
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,960
Cetera.

64
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,110
So we can see if we look at these pins here and we look at the links at the bottom of the pins.

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,370
You can see these are all coming from actually different Web sites.

66
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,440
So essentially what this guy's done is just created a board that's helpful for people that organizes

67
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,800
content underneath those search terms.

68
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,230
And as a result 13000 followers is not a bad results from that.

69
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:45,210
So what I might want to do is not only add my own content but look on Pinterest for other content that

70
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,310
I could add to my boards and make it more valuable for the Pinterest users.

71
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,230
So now that we understand what boards are how to name them and what to put in pin in the boards.

72
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,520
That's actually go ahead and create a board for ourselves.

73
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,080
And actually what we do is we can pin something and create a board at the same time so I think we'll

74
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,540
go ahead and do that.

75
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,540
Now again what I'm going to do is look for my key word.

76
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,150
So

77
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,130
so digital marketing.

78
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,530
Now what I want to find out is well what can I create a board on then.

79
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:29,000
And if I look across have ideas social media money in for graphics for graphics is pretty interesting.

80
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,770
So what I might think of doing is maybe I can create a board about the best digital marketing and for

81
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,940
graphics is a good as you can see there a lot here and not all of them are are maybe that good.

82
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,410
So if I can create a board on the best ones that would appeal to people and they'd want to follow that

83
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,840
board and I can't because it be useful to them.

84
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,140
So what I can do then is go ahead.

85
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,560
Once I've decided on the kind of bored name I want to add some content to that board I don't have maybe

86
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,980
an info graphic right now.

87
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,880
So I'm just going to pin this piece of content to the board and I can create the board at the same time.

88
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:15,100
So what I'm going to do is best digital marketing infographics and you can make this a secret board

89
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,540
if you want so you don't have.

90
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,850
It doesn't have to be public.

91
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,110
You can hide it IDOLO the content and then publish it later.

92
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,040
But I think it's OK to just go ahead and publish it straight away and they're going to go ahead and

93
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,900
print create.

94
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,700
So now I can see that that pin has being created.

95
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:42,470
So the board is being created so if I come to my profile and come to the board and I can see that the

96
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,830
best digital marketing for graphics has been added there and it might take a little bit of time just

97
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,040
to load up what the pin will show up there eventually as well.

98
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,470
Now what I can also do as well as pinning other people's content and aggregating content like that that's

99
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,330
helpful for people I can also create my own contents.

100
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:13,160
And so what I can do is maybe create a pin and take it from the web and I can actually take content

101
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,470
from my own site and pin it in here.

102
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,390
So I'm just going to take an article from my blog and pasted in here.

103
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:28,580
When I click Next I'm going to see all of the images on that page that I can put into a show is the

104
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,630
image on Pinterest.

105
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,830
So I'll just take this one here.

106
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,160
Now I could put it under the best digital marketing for graphics and create a new board which I might

107
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:44,540
do is more something like marketing fundamentals so people who who just really want to understand the

108
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:54,100
fundamentals of marketing and I can create the board by that.

109
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,850
And so I can see it now.

110
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:05,830
What I should have now is keyboard's for going to my profile what I've got now is two pens and two different

111
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,170
boards there.

112
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:13,970
Now what I can do is to improve these even further is I can actually go ahead and add a description

113
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,510
to these boards.

114
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,000
And if you're stuck for that as well.

115
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:24,280
Once again what you can do is maybe just look at some top competitors and see where they are.

116
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,490
What type of descriptions that they are using.

117
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,440
So you can see this board is a collection of great tips and ideas for somebody learn how to do X Y Z.

118
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:41,730
And so you can take a you can even copy this paste it in there.

119
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,460
But he added it to this specific board.

120
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:50,830
So this board is the collection of the best digital marketing and for graphics on Pinterest and you

121
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,370
can include that in there.

122
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,770
And the reason you want to do that is that gives people another incentive for them to follow the board.

123
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:06,190
And you can also say what this board is about to make it clear to Pinterest as well.

124
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,390
So I could maybe put this as technology or other.

125
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,250
And then you can also add collaborators for these boards as well if you've got other team members that

126
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:22,750
you want to help work on now as well as adding a description to your boards what you can actually do

127
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,460
is add a description to any content that you pinch yourself as well.

128
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:34,230
So again telling people a little bit about why they should click through and what this post is about.

129
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,740
And again if we look at some examples here you can start to get a very good sense of what the type of

130
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,820
descriptions that people come put in here.

131
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,260
And then you can look at the best ones there and take some examples.

132
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,860
It's going to be slightly different sort of recap then in this video you've learned how to create boards

133
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,820
how to name those boards so you can appear at the top of the search engine.

134
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,850
You learn how to add content to those boards using other people's content so you can build a valuable

135
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,530
resource for your Pinterest followers or by adding your own content as well.

136
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,310
And by adding descriptions to those boards and those pins so that they give that incentive people to

137
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,130
click through and also that will help you appear higher in the search engine on Pinterest as well.

138
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,810
So what I would recommend you do is take a little bit of time maybe go ahead and create three boards

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,030
put a bad five pins in each and that is really going to set the foundation of content for your Pinterest

140
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,660
account.
