00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,290
In this video you're going to learn how to follow top influencers in your niche on Twitter.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,230
And this is an excellent thing to do as soon as you get set up on Twitter because you can really model

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,910
these top influencers to see even have laid out their profile.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,130
What type of content they're putting out and how you could really do the same to be successful.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,910
So once you've created your Twitter profile you're going to see that there is an option here to find

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,790
people to follow on Twitter will really suggest based on your location.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,780
So a lot of these accounts here are local to where I am now.

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:43,680
But what you really want to do is start building it and your Twitter profile is follow the top influencers

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,000
in your particular needs.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,110
So to do that you just want to type in your keyword into the Twitter bar at the top here.

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,840
So let's just say I was in the personal finance space and I really want to find the top influencers

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,990
are on Twitter in that space.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,330
So what's going to pop up once I see that here you can see across the top I can see the latest the people

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,570
the photos videos news broadcasts et cetera.

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,950
So we really want to look at the people up here are going to pop up some of the two most influential

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,060
accounts for this key word.

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:24,130
And if we open this up we can see really all of them here which is really interesting to see.

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,690
So what I'd suggest you do is have a look through some of these top accounts and maybe just follow five

19
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:37,580
people if you're kind of a business talking about personal finance maybe find those related business

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,720
type Twitter profiles if you want to promote more of a blog.

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,910
Maybe you could follow more of these individuals in an independent personal finance editor see and see

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,860
here.

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,900
Weisbrot get rich slowly.

24
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,360
Let's keep going then

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,140
bankcard and really anybody else that you know is a big influence here.

26
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,820
You can search for them online if you're in this space.

27
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,970
So for example I know one guy here Mr. Money Mustache.

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,260
He's actually a great blog on personal finance if you're in that sort of stuff.

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,600
And then the key idea here is once you come back to your home screen then your news feed will start

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,000
to be populated with what those top people are doing and see the types of posts that they are putting

31
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,640
as you can come into their profiles.

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,640
You couldn't really have a look at higher.

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,260
They're using the cover image water the type of things that they're putting in their profile.

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,240
Here you can see the profile and image the type of tweets they're getting water the type of things that

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,120
they're getting engagement's on.

36
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:01,030
And this is just a fantastic way to quickly understand what you need to be to doing on Twitter in order

37
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:08,770
to be successful because you are really modeling those people who have been successful if you come back

38
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,480
to your home page as well.

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,390
You can see in your profile the number of people that you're following.

40
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,110
And if you want to access those you can click on that and open them up.

41
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,090
And again you can just come in here have a look at those scans.

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:29,620
Have a look at their most recent tweets and see how were they getting so much engagement like this.

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,690
So you can see here this is a great example.

44
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,870
I think Bitcoin is ridiculous.

45
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,910
What are the most compelling stuff you've read wash written for or against.

46
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:46,300
So this is a perfect example of someone really engaging their audience on Twitter and that is why it's

47
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,940
getting so many likes read tweets and comments on it.

48
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,320
And it's a perfect example of something that you could do for your business to really ask the opinion

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,340
of audience and get that huge amount of engagements and the huge amount of read tweets.

50
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:09,670
So you can really learn an incredible amount by looking at people who are already successful on Twitter.

51
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,670
And that's why you should really come in and use that search bar and find those top influencers in your

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,100
needs and add them to your account.

53
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,290
So go ahead and do that right now so you can really accelerate your success on Twitter.
