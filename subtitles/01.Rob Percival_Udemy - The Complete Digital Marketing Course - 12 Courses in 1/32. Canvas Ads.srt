1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,800
In this video you're going to learn about camera science a new format that is very flexible and customizable.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,460
We'll start by understanding what a homicide is and the benefits of it.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,820
Then you will learn for which are the objectives.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,450
This format is available once again.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,150
It's not really suitable or available for every type of Facebook campaign.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,650
We will then look at a case study so you can understand how this new ad format fits in to a wider Facebook

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,380
ad campaign.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,480
We will then look at how you can create these campuses and because it's a little bit different than

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,310
just uploading a video or an image.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,720
And then finally we'll finish up once again in the hands create tools we know how to set up a campaign

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,960
using this format.

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,070
So let's start really by understanding what these canvas ads are as the name suggests.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,480
It just gives you a blank canvas in order to create your ad.

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,580
And let's scroll down and straight away to really have a look at an example 10 years of we come there

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,440
a little bit further we can start to get an idea of it here and I'll just play this video.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,880
So what you can see here is that this company that company has started to build the collection.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,990
It looks a little bit like snapchat if you're familiar with how Snapchat works.

18
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,070
You can scroll down and you can scroll across there's videos involved.

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,320
It's quite an immersive type of advertisement very flexible.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,830
And the idea is that you can completely customize this for yourself.

21
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,940
You can see now it's coming down into products.

22
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,480
There's a binary button you can customize all of that stuff yourself.

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,040
So it's just a very flexible format.

24
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,850
Which can ultimately end up on the e-commerce site like we see here but Stefani's is looking a little

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,100
bit like snapchat.

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,540
So I think anybody who's very familiar with slop snapshot creating content there to create a commerce

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,290
side is going to be very simple for you for people like me a little bit older who aren't as good on

28
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,670
snapchat or don't even use it.

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,430
This is going to be a bit of a more a bit of more of a learning curve to get this right but that's essentially

30
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,470
what it looks like.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,790
It's a very flexible format.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,870
Now coming up to the Facebook Ads guide let's understand what objectives you can use this format for

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,190
because once again it's not available for everyone.

34
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,550
It's not suitable for everything right now.

35
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,820
Right now in the Facebook gods guide where we can see it is available is for brand awareness so you

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,210
can see here that the ecommerce site is available for app installs.

37
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,210
It's not.

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,500
But this might change over time.

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,110
So the best place to keep Come and see this is in the ads guide it surveiled for brand awareness.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,700
It's available for clicks through web site.

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,770
You can see it here not available for any of these here store visits.

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,190
Let's see if it's available here.

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,090
Yes.

44
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,490
And we can see for video views.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,120
I think it is available yet and also web site conversions.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,110
So if you are thinking of using this odd format.

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,130
Be sure to come into the ads guide first.

48
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:25,130
Just type in Facebook Ads guide into Google and really check if it is a vailable.

49
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,270
Now let's have a look at a case study to see how companies are actually using this form and how it fits

50
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,780
in to a bigger campaign.

51
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:42,820
So what we have here is Dykeman Poland what they do is they run a family run footwear business and they

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,790
use this new ad format to create a highly successful brand awareness campaign.

53
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,270
So that was the objective for the campaign.

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,440
So here is some some of the metrics and that you would associate with a brand awareness campaign.

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,120
Twenty five point increase in AD recall.

56
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,170
So there are some metrics and tests that they do around for brand awareness seven point increase in

57
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:12,400
favor ability and three point increase in attribute rate things overall metrics really for brand awareness.

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,660
And you may not be totally familiar with them but the bottom line is it was a big success.

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,010
So I think let's look down at some of the details to really see how they used this.

60
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:31,090
So what they did was they featured this girl here who's a famous singer and fashion blogger in Poland

61
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,680
and she picked different shoes from a new range.

62
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,710
That would be suitable to show in this canvas.

63
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:46,150
Now here's the interesting part that they use the camera side really as a part of the bigger campaign.

64
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,470
They still use photo photo carousel video ads along with this new canvas format which really allowed

65
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,130
people to explore engage engage with the full range.

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,990
So again it's a little bit like the collection ads that we've seen previously.

67
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,920
It's a bit more about storytelling and engagement and definitely drifting towards the new way that people

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,190
are interacting with social media like Snapchat et cetera.

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,560
So the key takeaway here is that it was part of a bigger campaign.

70
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,440
And but it does involve all of these other elements as well and it's a little bit similar to the election

71
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,470
campaign.

72
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,110
Now where can you get started with this.

73
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,930
Well the first thing that you can do is come into your Facebook page you're going to see here and the

74
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,710
final town here publishing tools any admin to Facebook page will be able to see this and you can see

75
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,020
down here that there is canvas here and you can click on Create.

76
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:51,200
So instead of diving into the ads created it's probably best to start here to create your canvas.

77
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,270
And then in your ads pray tool just select this so you can see that you can take it toward to understand

78
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,880
this better.

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,200
You can just open a blank canvas.

80
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,200
There is only two examples but there's not many there yet.

81
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,240
Let's have an explore of some of the layouts here.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,150
So single street screen put together a camera that complements the message and storytelling and full

83
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,150
screen media.

84
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,160
So let's have a look at this one here.

85
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,080
This they'll start to load up hopefully and you can use it to really use the guide.

86
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,950
Maybe let's just start with an open come see you can see you can put in a button carousel photo products

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,060
that once your product catalog is uploaded and video.

88
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:44,180
So let's just put in a video and see you can continue to add components as people scroll then scroll

89
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,020
left scroll right etc..

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:54,380
So I won't go through all the details of setting it up but once you have got a canvas created all you

91
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,970
need to do in your and create two is select the appropriate objective.

92
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,290
So for example it's just like a traffic campaign objective.

93
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:09,260
Once again the ads said is Ozzie learned how to set up already the audience Plaisance budget and schedule.

94
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,780
We've covered that before where there is a difference.

95
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,010
Now as Dan at the ad level and you can see the commerce ad format showing up what you can do then is

96
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,920
select the canvas so that's why I was recommending you build on first hand side of the ads too.

97
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,770
And then you can combine unselected here it brings you up to the same screen but it's maybe just easier

98
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:37,490
to keep focused on one thing build the creative first and then he can just simply and in from there.

99
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,310
So now that you understand what homicides are the marketing objectives that you can use them for and

100
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,900
understand how they're so flexible and customizable come into the publishing tools.

101
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,320
Your Facebook page and mess around with creating one for yourself to get more familiar with this new

102
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,300
format.
