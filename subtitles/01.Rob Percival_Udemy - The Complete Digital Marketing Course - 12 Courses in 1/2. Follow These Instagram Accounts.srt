00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,790
The number one thing that you can do to have success on Instagram is to follow some top accounts in

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,710
your news so you can really understand how they've laid out their profile what information they're putting

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,990
their most importantly what content are they putting at it that is getting a huge amount of engagements.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:25,570
So to find those topics and sort you want to do is come to the discovery tab in Instagram and you can

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:32,110
see that by default Instagram is going to be suggesting some icons and even highlighting some content

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,760
here.

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,160
And what do you really want to do to find a consignor needs either to type the current names right in

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,310
the top here or start to look for some key words in your business.

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:49,350
So let's just imagine that I was a personal finance planner.

10
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,920
I could just type in something like personal finance

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,330
Now what I want to make sure that I'm selecting here is not just the top posts or hashtags but in particular

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,200
I want to look at individual people here.

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,910
And then you really want to scroll down and start to really have a look into some of these accounts

14
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,100
here see how many followers they have.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,540
See the way that they laid out their profile.

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,370
They're using some the most use here they've got a link to their Web site they've got their email there.

17
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,570
And importantly is then the type of content that they're putting as.

18
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,760
And this is probably the best way for you to understand.

19
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,160
Is Instagram for you.

20
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,750
If there are people here getting engaged in on their content and you can be guaranteed that you could

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,500
do the same thing as well.

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,730
And let's click in to some of their content to see which engagement they're getting.

23
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:50,960
So 87 likes so I will look at this 170 likes and we can get a sense as a couple of quotes here.

24
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,610
There's pictures here but what we might want to do if we don't think that this is the greatest match

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,730
and it can for us to model is right beside there it can't beside the Follow button.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,920
There's a little drop down blue arrow and then we can see some other suggestions even if we click see

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,800
all we can get a full list of these similar accounts on a similar topic.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,100
And here we go Dave Ramsey.

29
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,250
He's got a blue tick beside his name.

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,970
So that's a verified account.

31
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,380
And he's also said he's popular there so this could be a good occasion for us to model if we were in

32
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,280
this age.

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,770
We can see a lot more followers this time Ryan 586 K and he's got a link there.

34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,410
Call email directions and let's have a look at some of the contents.

35
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,450
5400 likes.

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,660
Congratulations.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,290
It's a repost.

38
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,110
Excited to announce I became debt free.

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,880
OK.

40
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,480
So here is some interesting type content if I was in this nation really showing people who have achieved

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,670
a goal that maybe I'm a consultant to help them to achieve.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,260
And essentially this is a repost again so this is somebody else's content that this guy Dave Ramsey

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:08,110
has just reposted and tanked and the Instagram account of the actual people in the picture.

44
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,700
So already I'm building up a very clear idea of how to do well on the type of content that I can put

45
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,340
out.

46
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,740
There's some kind of people here becoming debt free.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,010
There's some quotes here that's kind of related to this Naish.

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:31,110
And you can see that even for this type of business there isn't a requirement for you to appear hugely

49
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,800
on camera all the time and be like an Instagram celebrity is beautiful and doing their nails.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,200
There are other possibilities for using Instagram to market a business and that's why I wanted to start

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,540
with something a little bit more that you wouldn't think would fit perfectly with Instagram but you

52
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,890
can see here he is America's trusted voice of money huge following getting a huge amount of engagements

53
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,780
on his posts.

54
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:05,270
So if I wanted to get into this niche then I go ahead and follow him on even from here.

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,870
I can go ahead and do the dropdown arrow again and start to find similar accounts there and even it's

56
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,840
going to show me some popular people.

57
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,570
So it's going to take a while for me to go ahead and click through and find those top can that you can

58
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,550
follow.

59
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,970
It'll take you maybe 10 minutes to find five the cance but this short exercise is really going to accelerate

60
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,910
your success on Instagram because you're going to be modeling people who are already successful on the

61
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,720
platform.

62
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,170
And as you can probably guess or know that is just the fastest straight line to success.

63
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:51,580
So what I would recommend you do is come into this Gurpreet tab of Instagram typing in your keyword

64
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,140
or any top profile on Instagram that you may be already aware of and go in there.

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,960
And from that one account you can find for other kinds to follow and then not information and their

66
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,010
their information is start to appear in your news feed.

67
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,040
And so you're going to be constantly updated with whatever posts they pop.

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,390
That's going to be in your news.

69
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,310
That's a great way to track those top accounts just by coming into the home section.

70
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,260
So go ahead now and follow five cance on Instagram.

71
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,690
This is the quickest way that you're going to accelerate your success because it'll tell you ahead of

72
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,010
Letcher can't the exact type of content that you should be posting to get engagements as well.
