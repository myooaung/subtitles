00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,180
In this video you're going to learn how to add a segment to your Google Analytics reports.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,840
And this is a feature of Google Analytics that can really take your analysis to the next level because

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,710
it allows you easily to look at a subset of data and compare that to the total data set.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,410
So for example I've just come into the demographics overview report.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,310
We're going to create a very simple segment we're just going to look at the data from a particular country

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,890
and compare that to the age and gender of our total data set.

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,150
So to get started we just click on the segment and then here you can see that there are already some

8
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,640
segments created and all of them are listed here.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:56,710
Fernando we just want to create a new segment and we can really see now that this segment is really

10
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:04,240
just some filters that we're going to add in in order to create that smaller subset of data there right

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,330
now because we haven't selected any filters.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,540
It's showing 100 percent of the users.

13
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,630
But once we start to add any filters you're going to see this number drop down.

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,730
For example if we just want to look at a segment of our audience of that age group we can see it automatically

15
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,790
filters down to 20 percent of the audience that's come in there and create a segment and just look at

16
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:35,710
all of our visitors from a particular country and we can select this to be Japan.

17
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:43,570
So no this should open days and we can see that our Japanese audiences just 1.7 2 percent of the total

18
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:54,520
users over the last 30 days we can use set create this as her name the segments as demographics Japan

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,430
and cook save.

20
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,500
And once it slows up what we're going to see is a side by side comparison so we have all of our users

21
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,640
100 percent.

22
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,660
And we have our demographics from Japan which is just 1.8 percent really what we are doing here.

23
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,350
Even though it's a very simple example it's just comparing a subset to the total data set.

24
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,990
So we can see that on age they actually look very similar.

25
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:32,570
And so the total average age and the age range is split by 40 percent between this age bracket and over

26
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,030
here in Japan slightly higher but only just 42 percent.

27
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:44,810
So very interesting to see that even in Japan compared to the total data set that the age range is still

28
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,290
very consistent with what we're seeing with the large data set coming then and looking at gender we

29
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:59,240
can see there's a little bit different male is at 68 percent on our total data set.

30
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,390
And here in Japan we're getting a higher percentage of males 78 percent.

31
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,460
So you can see in this subset of data it's actually even though it only represents 1.8 percent of total

32
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,100
visitors sexy.

33
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,470
Remarkably similar in this particular example but it won't be in every case and that's where the interesting

34
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,750
things really start to happen.

35
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:28,150
For example you could see a traffic source that is contributing way more sales than other traffic source

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,170
and that's where segment's start to really get interesting.

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,450
Now in terms of using these segments you can see that when you click through to any individual report

38
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,300
once it loads up you'll see that this segment is going to be carried with you into those reports.

39
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,750
And even if you go on into other sections of your Google Analytics you're going to see that the segment's

40
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,970
is going to be carried through to those reports as well.

41
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:03,750
So if you want to remove these segments early stage you can just come in and click on remove and you

42
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,000
won't that won't appear there any longer.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,610
And if you do want to delete or edit your segments you can just click back into segments click into

44
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,640
the custom ones that you've created.

45
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:22,030
Select the segments and you can either edited or go ahead and delete that segments and start a can.

46
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:28,890
So that is how you add segments to Google Analytics reports and it's incredibly powerful feature that

47
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,430
can take your analysis to the next novel.

48
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:39,540
So maybe go ahead into Google and like secant and set up a segment's and test this feature ad for yourself.
