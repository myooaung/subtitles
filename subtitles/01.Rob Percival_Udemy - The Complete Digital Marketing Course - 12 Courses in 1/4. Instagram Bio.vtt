00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.710
In this video you're going to learn how to optimize your surround bio.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.290
And on call to action buttons and this is probably the most important thing that you can do to drive

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.630
website traffic and sales directly from Instagram.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.450
So what I want to do is bring you through a couple of different examples different types of businesses

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.750
show where they're using Instagram bio and call to action buttons.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.220
And then let's show the practical steps to change for yourself.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
So let's get started looking at this Instagram account of Dave Ramsey.

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.370
Obviously this is kind of a personal business Instagram account and you can see in his bio here he has

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.910
a little icon saying pointing down and then create your free every dollar budget.

10
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.020
Another icon.

11
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.470
And then there is a link off here.

12
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.970
And if we clicked this open we can see that this opens up and this is actually an app that he has created

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.070
and it's really a link to downloads.

14
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.480
Now notice the way there he said and create your free every dollar budget.

15
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.900
He didn't just say download my app.

16
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.230
So that's an important thing to do that in your bio.

17
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.200
You want to show the benefit for people to really click through.

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.660
And that's a great example of that.

19
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.130
He's also used some icons creatively to catch some attention there.

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.400
But most importantly not call to action in the bio.

21
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.100
Here is really relevant to his audience.

22
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.100
This guy's a kind of helps people get added that it become financially independent.

23
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.110
So a free budget is exactly what his type of audience would be looking for.

24
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.170
So that's important to keep in mind when you create your own bio that it really has to appeal to your

25
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.090
audience.

26
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.550
And that's why it's a good idea to come in and take a look at some of those top performing competitors

27
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.010
or influencers in your niche so you can really see how they're using this now below his bio on that

28
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:03.680
link you can see that he's included an option for people to call email and then get directions as well.

29
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.470
Now I'm not sure why is entirely the directions if he's kind of a personal profile but that's those

30
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.510
are the three options you can include maybe he just wants to take advantage of everything that you can

31
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.600
so you can include call email and directions if you want.

32
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.880
That is now go and look at another example to see how they're using their Instagram bio and call to

33
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.590
action buttons to drive Web site traffic and generate sales.

34
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.590
So let's go and look at a local business

35
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.650
so Giuliana's pizza you can see this is a broken Bate's pizzeria co-founded by legendary pizza maker

36
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.330
Potsie Grimaldi.

37
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.730
No gimmicks just great new New York style pizza and you can see that they've included there a link to

38
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.230
their Web site and just their location as well so it's really clear.

39
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.970
People can see the exact address in the bio and not as a great idea for local business because people

40
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.240
might be following here and they say oh let's go check out the Giuliana's pizza place.

41
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.840
They can see the address there without even needing to click the directions button but they could click

42
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.920
this and they should open up and they can see exactly where it is there.

43
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.880
And then you can also call there if you want to make a booking directly.

44
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.650
So as you can see this is an extremely useful use of the bio and the called Auction buttons in order

45
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.740
to get customers in the door.

46
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.820
Let's have a look at one more example.

47
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.710
And come and look at an e-commerce company sensorial seek and see take your company to the next level.

48
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.920
So this really again appeals to their audience which is just taking their comping to the next level

49
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.820
so they're kind of targeting people who are already camping but they just want to take it to the next

50
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.990
level kind of there's a lot going on in that sentence.

51
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.260
And then we plant trees reach 10 Celso another incentive to go ahead and buy because it's not just that

52
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.500
you get the product but that you're helping the art.

53
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.990
And that again appeals to their audience.

54
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.570
One hundred and fifty five thousand trees so far.

55
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.920
So again these are the icons to kind of bring that to life when you sell no on 20 percent off.

56
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.000
So that is a great use of the bio as well for an e-commerce store.

57
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.450
They're showing you their audiences by take your company to the next level.

58
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.570
That incentive to plant trees how many trees they've done so far and there's 20 percent off.

59
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.570
So that gives me a good incentive to click that link and to go out and buy it so I can call and email

60
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.220
as well there.

61
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.530
So those are three examples of how companies are using these Instagram bio is by far the best way to

62
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.580
drive Web site traffic or to generate sales for your business.

63
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.090
And the practical steps to Jozen this are very very simple.

64
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.810
So we're going to come back into my demo can't click on the gear icon appear.

65
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:15.160
You can see edit profile so I can add in my web sites I'm just going to put this in so you can see what

66
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.200
this looks like how easy it is and then bio.

67
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.280
I can just put in by there I can adjust the contact options if I want to input that phone and address

68
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.620
especially if I was a local business and then I can go ahead and click save or don't come back to my

69
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.730
profile and you can see that that is being updated there.

70
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.510
So what I recommend you do is go have a look at some top influencers or types of companies in your niche

71
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:50.860
that are doing well you know have a look at three or four take some ideas from their bios and put it

72
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.990
into practice and optimize your instagram bio.

73
00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:01.200
And that's called Auction buttons so that you can drive Web site traffic and generate sales from I was

74
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.340
probably the number one thing you can do if that is your goal.

75
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.460
So go ahead and do that for yourself.
