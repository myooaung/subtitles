00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,520
One of the best things that you can do to grow your Twitter account is to come in and review your Twitter

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,710
analytics on a regular basis and to access your Twitter analytics.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,410
Just click on your profile image and then ENM then and click on analytics.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,350
Now in here there are a couple of different screens across the top and then on this home screen especially

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,130
this is a great place to find out what kinds of content are getting the most engagement.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,910
Who are the most influential people in your audience and then especially in the audiences time here.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,410
You can really start to understand the age gender and location of your audience.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,270
The demographics very valuable to know.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,150
So let's get started by looking at the top tweets here on the home screen and this is really the top

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,780
tweet for the month so far.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,270
That's got the most amount of impressions.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:59,160
Now this is fantastic to know because you can look at the topic of this tweet.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,900
You know what we're we really talking about here.

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,720
You mentioned somebody maybe that resonated with the audience that got likes you could continue to create

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,900
more content around that topic going forward because you know that's popular with your audience.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,290
You could also essentially share this tweet throughout the month or next month with slightly different

17
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:29,340
wording so that you're continuing to maybe share popular content as what you can do in terms of looking

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,380
back at your other top tweets as well as look at the format as well.

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,720
Did you include an image to include a video.

20
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,460
Are you seeing a lot of differences in terms of impressions when you change up the format.

21
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,940
And that's something that you can test out and then come into your own lines to really see them make

22
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,990
a difference or not coming on then to the top followers.

23
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,440
Another very interesting part of the analytics because in here you can really have a look and even click

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,450
through to their profile.

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,110
You can thank them for following you can start a conversation with them.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,010
Maybe if they have a similar audience they might have a blog or a pug those podcast.

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,420
Then you could say hey you know maybe we could do a guest post.

28
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,840
I go in your site you get on my site etc. if they have a similar audience now you will need to go in

29
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,740
and really click through see if that is you know legitimate cant and maybe they just bought the followers

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,670
so you might want to check that out.

31
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:35,400
But going through even the previous months you can see who their types of followers water content they

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,750
put out.

33
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
Is there a good match there.

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,650
Maybe you could do something like guest post or pour gas or maybe just even connect with an influential

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,800
person on line.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,920
Now over here we also have the top mentions So this is a tweet in which someone mentioned you that got

37
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,150
a lot of engagements so you can look at these top mentions maybe thank them again retweet them and in

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,570
future try to encourage your audience to mention you or engage with you on Twitter because you will

39
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,770
be shared not only the bills the person who mentions you.

40
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,910
Youll be seen not only by all of their audience but your audience as well.

41
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,580
If you retweet it so it's a great way to kind of if you can get more mentions.

42
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:27,540
It's just a great way to create content for Twitter that you can retrieve and also then you can really

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,230
get in front of other people's audiences as well as encouraging people to connect with you.

44
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,740
I mentioned you on Twitter.

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,970
It's just a great way to get more impressions coming across away from the home screen.

46
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,520
We do have a tweet Stabb here which can be interesting to look out to get a look at your total number

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,220
of impressions over the last say 28 days you can change the period here you can export the data here

48
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,660
as well if you want.

49
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,270
So again not only looking at your top tweets but also looking at some of your other tweets to see how

50
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,160
they've performed against each other.

51
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,080
And I'll just give you a more in-depth look and metrics for your tweets.

52
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,390
Now in here in the audiences tab This is pretty interesting as well.

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,760
You can see a lot of their interests here which can be interesting.

54
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:20,620
I think Twitter gets a lot of this information from partner sites including like the average income

55
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,310
of your audience et cetera.

56
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,060
What they're interested in so it's pretty high level stuff to be honest take it with a pinch of salt.

57
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,110
But it can just be interesting come in and look and see there's that kind of match up with the audience

58
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,030
that you're trying to attract and probably the most valuable topic is the demographics.

59
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:44,680
You can see it male female split in your audience 60:40 there and you can see the age range as well.

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,590
So you just want to come in and say you know is the audience that I'm trying to attract is the audience

61
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,520
for my blog or my product or my service really matching up with my Twitter audience.

62
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:03,040
And if not maybe I should make it clear in the content that I'm putting out that it really appeals to

63
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,280
these type of people of this sex but the type of problems that they have that I'm speaking directly

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,650
to those type people and even those types of jobs may be and these particular countries as well.

65
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:24,130
So this is a fantastic page just to get a really clear picture of who may be your best follower is on

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,030
Twitter in terms of their persona and you can use the information in here to build that persona up so

67
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,330
extremely valuable.

68
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,070
So Twitter analytics are one of the best ways that you can use or one of the best tools you can use

69
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,380
to grow your Twitter account.

70
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,490
So I'd really encourage you to come in and check it out and once again you can come in and click on

71
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,960
your profile when you're on Twitter.

72
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,050
And then just click on analytics to access it and to analyze it and to get all those insights for yourself.
