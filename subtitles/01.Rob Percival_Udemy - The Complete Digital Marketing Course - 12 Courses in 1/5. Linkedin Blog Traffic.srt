00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,740
In this video you're going to learn how to get blog traffic from LinkedIn and I'm going to show you

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,730
how to use one of the latest features of linked in where you can write an article and essentially publish

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,620
directly on LinkedIn.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,670
This is like just a blog publishing platform built into LinkedIn and linked in or got it giving this

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,040
a lot of visibility.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,900
So it is an excellent feature that you can take advantage of in order to get more exposure.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,620
So before we get into kind of looking at this I just want to show you a couple of examples.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,780
So Richard Branson is the founder of Virgin Group and he's actually extremely active on LinkedIn.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,840
He publishes quite a lot of articles and if you go to his profile you can see them below down here.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,300
He's got over 13 million followers for his articles.

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,530
And so this is a great way that he's built up his influence on the platform.

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,990
So if we look at the articles here we can see Catching up at Bill Gates and climate change and if we

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,220
click into this again we can see that this is that this is an article published on Linked-In publishing

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,320
platform.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,540
Now in terms of what type of content should you put ash.

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:19,440
Well you want to be quite targeted and your content should really accomplish two girls.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,800
First it should teach people how to solve a problem or do their job better.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:31,410
And then it establishes you as a thought leader and that each aspect is naturally going to lead to more

19
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,340
business.

20
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,370
If you offer them real value on it's basic psychology and it just gets results.

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,440
So Richard Branson is probably extremely well known already to a lot of people and he's just continuing

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,600
to create this content to raise issues with people.

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,610
But for a business you maybe want to get a little bit more strategic in terms of the content that you

24
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,010
create and also the call to action for these posts.

25
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,100
So the reason I'm showing you Richard Branson here is more just he's using it as a blogging platform

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,240
on Linked-In itself and extending his influence there.

27
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,440
But here's an example of someone who's been using it more strategically and using it to get blocked

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,400
blog traffic.

29
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,410
And this is very interesting as guy Neil Patel if he come in to his articles you can just click on the

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,050
latest one here.

31
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:31,230
So this is much more specific and targeted how to find new customers using these nine Google Analytics

32
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,050
reports.

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,440
So you can see that compared to Richard Branson catching up of Bill Gates.

34
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,020
It's kind of more informative.

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,470
This is much more an article like how to do your job better and get results.

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,560
And this is the type of article that I encourage you to use.

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,670
Now if you scroll down you can see that this is a good article.

38
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,300
It's got a good amount of likes and comments.

39
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,510
But here is where it gets really interesting and this is the strategy that I encourage you to use.

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,450
In fact the opening paragraphs of this article don't really teach anything.

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,770
There is no 9.

42
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,690
Analytics reports that is jumping into here is just setting the stage.

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,990
Given the context and then he says luckily Google Analytics has the answers you need.

44
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,460
Click to continue reading.

45
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,490
Now if we look at this it's the same post essentially But this time on his Web site.

46
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,170
So what he's doing is he's giving some of the article away on linked in maybe 20 30 percent of us.

47
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,750
And then he's encouraging people to continue reading to click back to his Web site so you can see that

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,830
that's a lot more strategic than the way.

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,460
Maybe Richard Branson is using it.

50
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,950
Richard Branson doesn't need web site traffic.

51
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,930
But as a business owner he will.

52
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:52,950
And so the idea here is to make it much more focus in terms of enabling people to get results on a good

53
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,800
headline will always help capture people's attention.

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,550
Then most importantly after 20 30 percent of the top of the article gets them to click to continue and

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,130
really the meat of the article should be back on your Web site and not allow you to get people back

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,040
to your Web site and the beautiful thing about this strategy is if you already have a lot of blog posts

57
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,990
who are taking over from a client or you're coming into a company they might have a lot of content on

58
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,930
their blog but it's just not getting that much visibility and through LinkedIn you can repurpose the

59
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,790
same content.

60
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,780
You don't even need to create new content share it.

61
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,750
And he can get a lot more traffic from the content that you've already created.

62
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,800
And the cool thing about these articles and the reason that you want to use this rather than just putting

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,890
a link to your web page here is because if you publish an article so if you go ahead and write an article

64
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:57,400
here everybody that you were connected with will actually be notified that you have created an article

65
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,800
so this is a new feature from Linked-In.

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,000
They're obviously trying to push adoption of it on as an incentive for people to use it.

67
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,330
They are notifying all the connections.

68
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,270
Any time you publish something so that is why you would want to publish it here and not just share a

69
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,190
link to the same article which you could do here.

70
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:24,960
You could just copy that and say paste that in and it shows the same thing and looks quite similar but

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,160
the key difference is that if you publish it as an article and even just share 20 or 30 percent of all

72
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,890
of your connections are going to get a notification if you share it just does a post like I've done

73
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,270
here.

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,810
They will not get a notification but it may end up in their news feed as well.

75
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,750
But the key thing I'm trying to stress is that the article has much more visibility for your connections

76
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:56,120
and that is why you should really publish it as an article and just like this example here.

77
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:05,460
So if you want to create content that gets a lot of exposure on Linked-In write an article put 20 or

78
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,270
30 percent of the article there.

79
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,400
Leave the meat back on your Web site and encourage people to continue reading back on your Web site.

80
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:18,720
So go ahead use astrology for your own business for clients for a company that you're going into in

81
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,210
order to get much more visibility.

82
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,500
Extend your influence on help people solve their problems on Linked In.
