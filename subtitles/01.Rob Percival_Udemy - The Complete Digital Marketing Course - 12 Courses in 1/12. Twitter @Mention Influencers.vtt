00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.600
In this video you're going to learn how to use mentions to get retweeted by influencers on Twitter.

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.570
This is an amazing strategy that can really take your whole Twitter game to the next level.

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.540
So what is it not mention.

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.690
Well just as a reminder an admonition is just when you tweet and you actually mentioned somebody in

5
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:30.340
the tweet so you can see that I am mentioning you to me here and they will then get a notification that

6
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.630
I have mentioned them in a tweet.

7
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.060
And so just to give you an example they will see in their notifications tab here that that I have mentioned

8
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.230
them.

9
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.580
Now the key thing is not just that they will see this in their notification.

10
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.850
The key thing is that you want a craft to tweet that they want to automatically retweet.

11
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.390
And I'll give you some examples of this from some students of mine.

12
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.790
And you can see here for example we have Bruno here.

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.960
He's mentioned Mina tweeze but he's also crafted a great tweet that I will want to retweet.

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.250
So now Don and collected my Google Adwords and Google Analytics certifications.

15
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.960
Thanks Don.

16
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.900
And Walsh.

17
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.850
And so I will automatically retweet that.

18
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.360
Why.

19
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.870
Because it makes me look good because here is essentially a mini testimonial that I can share with my

20
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.180
audience and that shows them that look if they take my courses like this guy they can get the results.

21
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.090
So if you can create a mini testimonial for an influencer and mention them well then there's a very

22
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.440
high chance they are going to retweet that.

23
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.000
You can even just say something like this one here.

24
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.160
Hi Deborah.

25
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.930
I just started your digital marketing classes hoping to get some few responses and pointers on this

26
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.220
journey with you.

27
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.440
So again I'll automatically retweet that I have because here's a student they've started they're excited

28
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.100
and that's essentially a mini testimonial that all want to read tweet straight out.

29
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.540
So here are another is another one.

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.510
Getting a lot of insights from the course.

31
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.200
You don't necessarily have a huge win or results in order to mention them and get retweeted.

32
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.790
Now the advantage for all of these guys here is that when I read tweet them I expose them to all of

33
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.320
my followers which helps really grow there again because more people are seeing their profile and that

34
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.460
is just a way to really increase your visibility on Twitter extremely quickly use influencers with big

35
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.880
following too.

36
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.230
To use this mentioned feature to get in front of that much bigger audience than you have yourself.

37
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.590
So this is a really way to scale your Twitter marketing efforts very quickly just by leveraging those

38
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.460
big influencer accounts and the way that you can get in front of those influencer followers.

39
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.990
It's just by tweeting out one of these kind of mini testimonials.

40
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.440
Now there's a ton of examples on my profile.

41
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.700
If you want to come and check this out.

42
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.520
And also if you want to tweet and just say hey I've started the course or I've got this result or that

43
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.190
result.

44
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.700
Well there's a very high chance that I'm going to read that.

45
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.740
So definitely try that out for yourself.

46
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.600
You can also do this for any influencers in your niche while you read their book.

47
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.660
You took their course you read their blog posts and it was really good or you got this out of it you

48
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.820
got that result.

49
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.540
There's just so many ways that you can use this.

50
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.160
I want to show you another way that you can use this at mansion's strategy not just to get retweeted

51
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.460
by influencers but also to get them to share your blog post or your web site.

52
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:50.280
So I use this strategy myself and I'll show you I got this a can type form to really share at blog posts

53
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.380
that I created.

54
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.380
You can see they have quite a lot of followers and much bigger account than mine.

55
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.130
And so what I said is I've been racking up unbelievable response rates.

56
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.470
They have a software that allows you to create forms similar to Google form.

57
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.330
57 percent compared to the competition and I shared a link to my blog post and I even referenced somebody

58
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.970
who is who's on the type form team.

59
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.450
So I caught the attention of that person as well not just the main type form of cancer that's another

60
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.320
strategy that you can do.

61
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.420
You could just look up LinkedIn who were the people who work in that company that might be the brand

62
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.380
manager or the social media manager and just mentioned them as well just to make sure that if you don't

63
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.770
get any read tweets on the main account that you can also then just reference somebody in the company

64
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.330
and social media manager say.

65
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.100
Cetera.

66
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.420
And so what they did I tweeted out them a couple of times.

67
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.950
It didn't work the first time but eventually they shared out my blog post how to use type form together.

68
00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.090
Priceless feedback and e-mails by me and you can see that they tweeted that to all of their followers.

69
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.490
Now was really a post that I wrote on my web site but they shared it as an example of somebody who is

70
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.970
using their product and was getting results from it.

71
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.790
So again its a testimonial but it's kind of taking you to the next level and enables me not just to

72
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:25.530
grow my Twitter profile but also to get more Web site traffic from Twitter and from other bigger accounts.

73
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.530
So this app mention feature seems fairly simple but you can be very strategic about using it to get

74
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.920
a huge amount to read tweets from big influencer accounts and even get them to drive Web site traffic

75
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.830
to your site.

76
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.590
If you craft a blog post that makes them look good.

77
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.700
So go ahead and use these strategies for yourself right now or put them in your back pocket for later.
