1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,420
Now the first step in our market research is to create a survey.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,110
So what you want to do is go ahead to google and just type in Google Forms.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,930
There are many different tools that you can use for surveys.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,210
But personally I have found Google Forms to be the best.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:26,640
It is very simple to use the built in analytics are very solid and you can create unlimited surveys

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,390
and get on limited responses for free.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,000
So go ahead and type that into google and then click on through.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:44,610
So the next thing you want to do is go ahead and click Create a blank survey and open up and we just

9
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,950
want to give our survey a name.

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,810
So for me I'm just going to put in digital marketing survey.

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:01,080
So what I suggest you do is just put in whatever your topic is or potentially your product name or your

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:08,100
service name something simple in there just to really communicate to yourself and to other people really

13
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,630
want to survey is the bash and then once you've got that tone what we want to do is that in our first

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,640
question so we're going to add in our first question we are going to make this a short answer.

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:32,730
And what you want to type in here is the first of our three magic questions which is what is your biggest

16
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:40,380
problem with what you want to do here is put in whatever your topic or your knishes.

17
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:49,050
So for example I'm just going to say digital marketing I was the one that spelling to be good so we

18
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,380
can change this and tidy it up.

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Now you might be thinking Well that is a pretty simple and obvious question but actually the questions

20
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,890
that we're putting in this survey are extremely strategic.

21
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:11,910
And this first question is designed to identify the problems and the pain points of your potential customers.

22
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:18,810
So that is really going to allow us to identify the pain point which is critical because every product

23
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,200
or service must first solve a problem that the customer has now.

24
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,660
The next thing we can do is we can go ahead and actually delete this question that's there by default

25
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:39,420
and we're going to go and add in our second question and this time we're going to allow them to be able

26
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,850
to write a little bit of a longer response.

27
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,770
Now the second question which is also extremely strategic is this.

28
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,770
I've just copied and pasted for speed here.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,700
But the question is why would it make a difference in your life to get a good answer for this problem

30
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,770
or find a solution for your need.

31
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,230
Details please.

32
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:09,170
So this question once again is designed to really get some great answers out of people.

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,870
And so this question was really designed to identify problems.

34
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,430
This question is really to identify the ideal outcome what does the ideal solution look like.

35
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,340
Unwatered the benefits emotionally and the benefits logically.

36
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,450
So these are very important questions because if we know their pain points and we know what their ideal

37
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,580
solution looks like then all we have to do is create the product or the service that will take them

38
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,550
from where they are now to where they want to be and all the language here that they say about their

39
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,670
problems and pain points and where they want to be is all the language that we can use on our sales

40
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,310
pages and or e-mails on our marketing materials because we can just take the language that people have

41
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,530
said to us use it in our marketing materials and that will really connect with the potential customers.

42
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:08,120
Now the third magic question we are going to add to our survey is a multiple choice question.

43
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,600
So this is it here.

44
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,690
How difficult has it been for you to find a good answer for the above today.

45
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:26,270
And we want we can put in not at all difficult.

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:36,040
We can I just we want to add another response so add option some want difficult

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,580
and very difficult.

48
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:55,280
So this question is extremely important because we want to identify problems that are not well solved

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,240
in the marketplace.

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,410
That's how we're really going to get ahead if they have a problem and they've a solution and it's not

51
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,410
at all difficult to find that solution.

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,900
Well then we're not going to be able to settle anything.

53
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:13,100
So this is a really filtering question and we want to identify those problems or those outcomes that

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,340
people have had a real struggle at achieving.

55
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:23,930
So we can use this final question as a way to really filter our results and I'm going to show you my

56
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,650
results so this becomes very very clear.

57
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:32,800
And a final question that you might want to add in as a bonus is really this one.

58
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,970
So add your email below if you'd like to be contacted when we have a solution to your problem and what

59
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,920
we can just put in here is a short answer.

60
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,220
Once again.

61
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,180
So this is the way that with this question you can build up an email list of potential customers even

62
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,920
before you have created the solution or even before you've ever written a blog post or anything like

63
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,910
that.

64
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,760
So to recap we have gone through the steps to set up a market research survey with Google forums for

65
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:15,710
free and most importantly the three magic questions to ask so that you can identify those products and

66
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:23,360
services that people desperately need and also get those powerful words and phrases that you can use

67
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,810
in your sales copy.
