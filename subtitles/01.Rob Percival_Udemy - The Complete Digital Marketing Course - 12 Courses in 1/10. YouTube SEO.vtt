00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.270
In this video you're going to learn how to optimize your videos when you're uploading them so that you

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.020
can appear at the top of this search results for the key word or phrase that you were trying to rank

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.800
for.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.120
So to get started the first thing you want to do is upload your video.

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.680
And before you do this you actually want to make sure that the file name does actually include the key

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.570
word that you're trying to rank for.

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.290
So in this example I've just typed in the title of the video into the file name here and really the

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.040
key word that I want to run for is YouTube on lyrics.

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.210
So before you upload do make sure that the title of your video is kind of sad and that you have that

10
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.280
key word in there that's really going to help you with the rankings so quick to upload a blow from a

11
00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.720
desktop and that's going to pull that up and you can see that YouTube automatically pulls the file name

12
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.790
and puts it as the title of the video and that's why it's a good idea to have that said before you even

13
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.360
up load it is something that you might want to do is at this stage just you can share all this via if

14
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.780
you want.

15
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.550
This is what I like to do so that I have a chance to make my custom thumbnail.

16
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.830
And so I'm just going to schedule this save for a day where and don't time where I know that a lot of

17
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.060
my audience are going to be on line.

18
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.270
Next thing that we want to do too as you optimize our videos and appear at the top of the search results

19
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.660
is to write a description.

20
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.700
Now when you're looking from from scratch this can be a little bit difficult to do so once it is to

21
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.710
come and have a look at some of the other descriptions that are shown in your competing videos.

22
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.420
That's something I should have mentioned as well about the title of your video.

23
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.920
You really want to create the title of the video that's going to stand out from the other titles that

24
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.910
are here.

25
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.720
Imagine someone typing this into YouTube and scanning down the titles you really want to create a title

26
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.240
that is different that's going to catch their attention and that's going to make them want to click

27
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.200
on your video.

28
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.390
So that's an important thing to do not only for the title but also in the description.

29
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.110
So you can scan and there to to get some ideas if you want another little trick that I like to use to

30
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.920
to build this app quickly is to use what's known as a tag generator and you can just type this into

31
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.940
google.

32
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.630
You're going to see maybe a lot of options here.

33
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.590
I'm going to show you how to do this too rapid times that so often these these tools do change.

34
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.630
So just find anyone that you want if this is no longer working or turns into a premium tool and this

35
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.720
is pretty cool because what you do is pop in the title of your video

36
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.690
and it's going to generate a number of tanks for you.

37
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.080
And what these times are are essentially key words or phrases that people could be typing into YouTube

38
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.670
and you want to tell YouTube that my video is relevant to all of those.

39
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.750
So you really want to copy those and just paste them in as your tags.

40
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.830
Then maybe we can copy all of them here.

41
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.350
Copy and they can paste in straight away.

42
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.810
And the cooling by doing the tags first is that you can get a kind of an idea of how to write a description

43
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080
that includes all of these.

44
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.720
OK so we could say how to grow your channel

45
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:12.920
by reviewing YouTube analytics so people are really seeing it's essentially the title just rewritten

46
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.880
another way and including these other things that people may be searching for.

47
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.280
So

48
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.510
increase subscribers

49
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.000
likes comments

50
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.450
and views and

51
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.590
YouTube analytics.

52
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.770
So really what you want to be showing here is one of the benefits of watching this video because this

53
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.750
is what people are going to see in the little snippet here.

54
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.360
So you really want to give people a reason to click through there look at your title they'll look at

55
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.050
the the description and the toenail.

56
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.800
And that's what they'll make the decision on whether they're going to click through.

57
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.560
And if it's better than competitors so you might see a lot of people putting a link just straight here

58
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.790
to their Web site.

59
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.440
And that's actually a bit of a mistake because people are not watching the videos to click to your Web

60
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.340
site.

61
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.590
They want to really learn about something in this case an educational video so be sure to lead with

62
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.990
the benefits.

63
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.330
And then you can say something like get the full course.

64
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.140
Or click through to learn more etc. and link us to your Web site.

65
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.230
No longer descriptions can be better but there's no need to really overdo it.

66
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.580
You really just want to make sure that you're getting that initial description that it looks good when

67
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.320
they're going to click through.

68
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.670
So that is pretty much it.

69
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.200
I'm going to take a little bit of time to optimize this a little bit more put in the link to my website

70
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.400
etc..

71
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.840
Maybe put in a coupon to the complete chorus on I suggest you do the same link back to your Web site

72
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.410
the product page if you're featuring a product to a blog post.

73
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.310
If there's more information there etc. This is really important to include that link.

74
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:27.000
If you want to get them back to your Web site in order to read your blog there or biproduct concave.

75
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.190
So I've optimized out a little bit put in the link to my web site etc..

76
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.940
And now the next step is just to go ahead and publish that.

77
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.670
And that is scheduled and will be published on this particular date.

78
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:40.880
So now it's your turn.

79
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.930
Go ahead and upload your video and optimize it for the YouTube search engine.

80
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.200
Following the steps that you've learned in this video.
