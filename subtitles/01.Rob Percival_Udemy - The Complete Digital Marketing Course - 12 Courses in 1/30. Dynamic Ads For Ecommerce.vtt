00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.000
In this video you're going to learn about Facebook dynamic ads and how you can use them to drive more

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.610
online sales by remarketing products to people that have viewed them on your Web site.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.750
So we'll start by really understanding what namak ads are on the benefits of them.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.320
We're going to look at a case study and see the Zak's strategy of how this company is Mansehra T-shirt

5
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.190
was able to leverage them and get amazing results.

6
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.070
Then we'll look at how you can actually create a product catalog.

7
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.240
This is a key step that you need to do in order to benefit from this.

8
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.500
And then finally we'll look at how you can set up a campaign for products apologue sales inside your

9
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.500
ads create tool.

10
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.300
So let's start by understanding.

11
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.450
Dynamic adds a little bit better.

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.930
The benefit of them is really really care.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.540
Say for example I'm on an online store as a shopper I'm on like Nike dot com.

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.810
Here you can see that they have a ton of products here.

15
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.340
They have women's they've men's and even men in men's there's so many categories and so many products

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490
that they want even with in shoes.

17
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.550
Let's have a look at all the shoes.

18
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.070
I think there's over something like 700 different products here.

19
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.740
So if Nike wants to remark it to me and get me to complete the sale they're going to have a much better

20
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.200
chance of doing that if they really personalize that remarketing.

21
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.970
So say for example that I picked up or how to look at this product but I didn't.

22
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.010
Out to my car I could have looked at maybe some tracksuit bottoms or tops that I also didn't.

23
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.080
Onto the car.

24
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.360
But it shows that I was interested in them.

25
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.830
Now if Nike runs an ad and shows me those products in the ad Well that'll remind me to really come back

26
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.580
and add them to cart and finish at the checkout process.

27
00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.370
So the key benefit of dynamic ads is that they really personalize Facebook adverts without all that

28
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.320
manual work.

29
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.790
And that's an important distinction to make.

30
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.580
If you wanted to run dynamic ads with out this feature available what you would have to do is build

31
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.700
a custom audience for every single product and use that in your remarketing efforts.

32
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.470
Dynamic ads really automates the whole process for you.

33
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.360
So that's the key advantage.

34
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.840
It personalizes the adverts were all that manual work setting up custom audiences.

35
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.320
So here we go yeah you can retarget shoppers you can connect people across different devices and you

36
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.110
can even just reach more shoppers by showing people products that are tailored to their interests whether

37
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.770
or not they've even been to your site.

38
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.130
So there is a broader benefit outside of just be targeting shoppers to complete the sale but this is

39
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.030
really the key way that you can get that low hanging fruit.

40
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.450
Now coming down a little bit there is a point that's worth mentioning here that if your website is powered

41
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.200
by one of Facebook partners including Shopify Magento and big commerce you can automatically set up

42
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.220
dynamic adverts and I think a lot of you might be in that case if you have an e-commerce store.

43
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.730
So let me just show you quickly some of the steps will come then to use Shopify as an example again

44
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.010
because the process is quite similar.

45
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.500
What you need to do is log into Shopify and you can upload your product information to your Shopify

46
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.970
account and then from there it will upload to you or it can.

47
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.090
So there is an easy process to get that done.

48
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.060
If you've one of these platforms I'll include this original link here so you can get that easily and

49
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.120
follow the steps.

50
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.290
Now that you understand what dynamic ads are and the key benefits of them let's have a look at this

51
00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.100
case study of Monsoor T-shirts to really see how they put them to use to drive a lot of sales.

52
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.070
So Monsour T-shirt or a French T-shirt specialist and they gained nearly a 10x return on the ad spend

53
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.510
by promoting a stylish product line with dynamic ads and the powerful Facebook pixel.

54
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.510
So this is just a key thing to point out that in order for you to read market in the first place you

55
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.850
need to have the Facebook pixel installed and then the real dynamic ads are help.

56
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.320
Automating that remarketing process and personalizing it.

57
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.280
So if you haven't got the Facebook pixel set up that's the first thing you need to do before you can

58
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.730
even start using dynamic ads.

59
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.000
But as you can see Stephanie worthwhile doing great results.

60
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.010
Other companies are seeing and very low cost per click.

61
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.370
Let's move down to have a look at the exact strategy that they used.

62
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.860
So as you can see first thing they did was install the Facebook pixel and then what they did was by

63
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.960
embedding the pixels on the page of their online catalog need to do it once name your teacher was able

64
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.900
to gather precise data but the products that appeal to specific people allowing it for example to see

65
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.390
the garments that so many had viewed and added to their basket with out completing the sale.

66
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:22.170
So really that abandonment remarketing but in a very personalized format what they did then was they

67
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:29.880
use the dynamic cards in a carousel format to reach these people in their Facebook news feed and prompt

68
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.100
them to finish their purchase.

69
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:39.360
So if you're not already familiar with it a carousel ad format is a ad like this that has two or three

70
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.350
scrollable images or videos so probably one monster teacher is if you viewed two or three T-shirts they

71
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.110
would appear in this carousel and really encourage you to go back to the exact product page and finish

72
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.420
the checkout process.

73
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.940
So let's have a look at how you can actually get started on this.

74
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.880
As we said Facebook pixel cut to get that installed we've covered that previously.

75
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.290
But the next step is you want to upload your product catalog.

76
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.480
If you haven't got one of the platforms you talked about before.

77
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.840
This is Hadeed.

78
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:19.560
You want to come in firstly to your Facebook Ads manager come across to old tools under assets you can

79
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.100
see product catalogue here and what you want to do is really create your product catalogue or upload

80
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:33.720
it and you can see that you can give your catalog a name here so you can include products hotels flights

81
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.170
destinations and this might be starting to ring some bells for you.

82
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:45.330
If you've visited hotels on trivago or been on Trip Advisor some of these sites you can start to see

83
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.190
in your Facebook feeds.

84
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.990
The exact thing that you were looking at showing up and this is how they are doing that so let's just

85
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.850
set up as an example an example catalog.

86
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:06.000
So I'm going to say products here and really create this as a this and for my Facebook page.

87
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.480
The next step then is to upload your product feed.

88
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.660
You just need to select the currency and whether you have a recurring fee that you can upload now just

89
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:23.280
do a single upload then he does need to choose the file that you want to upload.

90
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.480
I just got a very small example product catalog set up just one line in it and then we really click

91
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.010
next and create the feed.

92
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.980
As I mentioned there's only one product in this feed so it's just an example which you can put together

93
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.800
that product catalog yourself or download it from your online store.

94
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.030
Once you've got that set up you want to come once again into your hands create tool and click on your

95
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.810
marketing objective for a product catalog sales.

96
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.000
Now you can see that it's loaded up here the example catalog that I created so I can go ahead and continue

97
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.820
this now.

98
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.610
I'll go ahead and select the picture pixel which is appropriate for this product catalog.

99
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.600
Now you can see that pixel is associated with the catalog.

100
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.380
You can see now that the setup is slightly different to what we would normally do in herad set when

101
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.000
we're setting up interest targeting or using custom audiences.

102
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.850
You can select which product set you want to use.

103
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:27.690
Dividing really those dot product lists down into smaller categories you can really choose the audience

104
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:34.610
that you want to choose as well here viewed or added to carpet not purchased in the last 14 days added

105
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:42.210
to carpet purchase up sell the product cross sell a product custom combination so you could have many

106
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.750
different ad sets maybe targeting each of these different audiences.

107
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.590
Set those up in your campaign to really test where the sales are coming from.

108
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.760
Are they coming from this first category out into Karpen are purchased in the last 14 days.

109
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.080
Are the cells getting the most sales.

110
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.500
So it would be a good idea to maybe set up a number of different onsets focusing on these different

111
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.660
audiences and seeing how they perform against each other.

112
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.620
Once again you can set up the normal placements and edit those as you please.

113
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.080
You can set up the budgets and sketch Sherrill's now down at the ad level.

114
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.260
You can choose the format of Howard.

115
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:26.460
Would like to look carrousel or a single image and the images will be pulled from the the you are Elle's

116
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:33.240
of the pages that your where your products are and that you will have uploaded into the product catalog

117
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.550
so now that you understand what Facebook dynamic ads are and the benefits of them.

118
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.520
Go ahead and set them up for yourself following the steps that youve learned in this lecture.

119
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.940
If you want to drive more sales for your online store.
