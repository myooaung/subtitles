1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,390
In the last lecture we got your YouTube account set up.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:10,020
And in this lecture no you are going to find the keywords the really topics that you're going to create

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,050
your YouTube video around.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,790
We're going to achieve that by doing YouTube keyword research and I can show you three different tools

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,440
to really find that out.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,740
So firstly to explain a little bit more what really keywords are it's what really people type into the

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,160
search bar here to find solutions to the problems that they have.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,140
So remember that our strategy here ready for YouTube is to focus on search ability and discover ability

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,610
on the first part of that is doing our keyword research.

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,520
So we really want to create content around what people are already searching for not as a way for us

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,540
to be able to get found to increase our viewers watch time build up our audience and then get those

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,270
people back to our Web site.

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,810
So people come into YouTube they use it like a search engine just like they use Google.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,610
So coming back down to our keyword research the first tool that we can use is Google's autocomplete

15
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,280
feature.

16
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,850
Now we can use this in private browsing mode and I'll show you that.

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,290
Let's just start within YouTube as well.

18
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,590
And as I said we want to focus on simple how to videos so you can just to get started something like

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,820
how to.

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,070
And you can see here some of the suggestions that YouTube comes up with.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,860
So how to write a blog post hundreds keyword research.

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,240
Now I've already search for these.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,950
That's why they're coming up.

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,790
You can go how to increase how to increase speed.

25
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,960
Each views.

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,340
You can see some of the things that people are typing into YouTube here.

27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,520
How to stop biting your nails procrastinating.

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,510
You can see these is some of the things people searching for had to grow.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,540
You can see that there's some of the suggestions there as well.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,110
So that is one way that you can really come in to find things that people are searching for.

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,570
You can also as well you don't have to start with how to.

32
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,870
You could start with something like as CEO the topic.

33
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,840
So as CEO tutorial as CEO for beginners you can type in standing like Google Analytics tutorial certification.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,600
Now you can see that these ones coming up the top are suggested because I've already searched for them

35
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,850
and that's why I'd maybe recommend you open up an incognito tab in come back into YouTube and this won't

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,730
take into account your historical searches into what it really suggests.

37
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:53,700
So if we look at Google Analytics I can see Google on its tutorial 2016 reports exam WordPress I can

38
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:03,150
search for something like WordPress tutorial Web site from scratch etc. So these are the things that

39
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,890
you can really do to get a lot of ideas very very quickly.

40
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,110
Google or YouTube is suggesting here what other people are searching for.

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,620
So you can really do the same thing and as well as looking for words that come after you can actually

42
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,480
put a space the frontier.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,310
Sometimes it shows you where some people would put beforehand.

44
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,250
Let me see if this comes up.

45
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,660
Not in this case but sometimes that does work as well.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,240
So when I say that our strategy is really to make how to videos.

47
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,740
It's not just for the word how to I mean it's more training education videos and so could be something

48
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:44,780
like a c c or tutorial which is the one that I have done before.

49
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,330
And you can see here that SVOD tutorial for beginners step by step.

50
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,550
I didn't come up with that side of myself.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:58,590
If I go as CEO for beginners and then as CEO for beginners I can see step by step guide here.

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,350
So this is what people are really searching for I came up with that title simply by using Google Audio

53
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:11,600
suggests and you can see that thought it has led to huge amounts of views for me.

54
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:19,090
And I just added in the 2016 then because I saw that people were searching for 2016 as well.

55
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,660
So including all of these things that people are really searching for was how I really came up with

56
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,460
that idea.

57
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:36,930
Now returning to are returning to our keyword research process there see YouTube autocomplete is the

58
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,540
first thing that I recommend you do using the browsing mode it's gonna give you a more accurate view

59
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,420
because your search history one skew the suggestions.

60
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:52,500
Now what you can do after that is once you find something interesting like I have here what you can

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,090
use is the keyword everywhere chrome extension.

62
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,380
Now this is within Google and I've set this up earlier in the horse as well.

63
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,860
But you just type in say your keyword as CEO tutorial.

64
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:13,490
And now because the Google keyword everywhere chrome extension is installed I can see these search volume

65
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,910
and the cost per click for this keyword.

66
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,140
So firstly you just need to get this set up it's very easy to install.

67
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:28,040
You can still add on Chrome or Firefox on really the main benefit of it then is it shows you these search

68
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,810
volume here right underneath the search bar the search box which is really really handy.

69
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:45,670
So not only do I know that a keyword like SEO tutorial is something interesting I also see that it's

70
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,180
called great search volume on Google.

71
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,160
Now these are the figures for Google.

72
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,820
But if people searching for it on Google then there's a very good chance that they're searching for

73
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,190
it within YouTube as well.

74
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,420
And even if I take that auto suggestion and look for a title that's a little bit longer I can add that

75
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,940
in and test as well.

76
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,720
So so SEO tutorial for beginners.

77
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,990
Now I can see that that still gets for one hundred and eighty searches per month.

78
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:22,670
So not only would I be in a position to maybe rank for as tutorial I'd also pick up searches for people

79
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:29,210
to type in SCA tutorial for beginners and even if we extend out to 2016

80
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,510
but it doesn't get any specific searches.

81
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,330
But I bet as it's thought it was except 2016 probably will doesn't show up here.

82
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,630
But a lot of people do search for those to get up up to date views.

83
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:52,980
So that is the step once you find maybe some suggestions in YouTube using the autocomplete feature.

84
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,430
What you want to do is actually come in here and check these search volume for those keywords.

85
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,420
Is that actually a popular keyword.

86
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,830
And you can really test all of the variations on the length of those keyword phrases using the keyword

87
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,250
everywhere tool.

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,050
Now just to explain cost per click before if you've never heard of this before it's really this is how

89
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,240
much advertisers within Google are paying to advertise for this particular term.

90
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,600
So if advertiser sizes are playing two dollars and seven cents per click for this term well then you

91
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:34,070
know it's quite a valuable term and that somebody who maybe is searching for us editorial might be inclined

92
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,880
to maybe buy my course on SEO which is essentially what I want them to do.

93
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,830
OK.

94
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,310
Now as well as using the autocomplete using keyword everywhere you can use the google keyword planner

95
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,030
tool.

96
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,300
This is once again a free tool that you can use.

97
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,080
You can just type in the google keyword honor.

98
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,950
It's very easy to set up an account.

99
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,070
It's actually the google keyword planner is a tool within Google AdWords so you just need to sign into

100
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,310
AdWords.

101
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,960
They might try and get you to create ad campaign.

102
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,470
You might hit that as soon as you open up this you can actually skip that process there's like a button

103
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:22,360
down the bottom here saying skip that campaign what you want to do is really come into tools and keyword

104
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,510
planner here.

105
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:31,340
And it's similar to the order suggest in youtube and in google it just kind of give you a lot more information

106
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:38,210
so you can come in to search for new keywords you can put in something like a topic like this and you

107
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,400
can click on get ideas then you will see these search volume here some of the keywords that people are

108
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,580
searching for.

109
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,890
And again this is just more ideas that you can really have to create videos topics you can see the popularity

110
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,300
of the mall going back a step actually you can see that I've got this targeted to the US much you're

111
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,280
going to remove that.

112
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:10,130
I want to see the search volume for these particular terms globally because the product or service that

113
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,960
I'm offering is can really be used by any media globally.

114
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,840
But if you've a local business or you're only serving a particular country you might want to change

115
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,910
those targeting options.

116
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,530
So this is really giving me more ideas more keyword ideas and you can see that there's a huge list here.

117
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,790
There's probably over eight hundreds here.

118
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,340
And it's not just related to the term you can see that there's other terms there they're closely related.

119
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,300
So that is how you can do keyword research.

120
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,860
Probably the simplest method is the order complete and you can just keep using the title as it gets

121
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,800
longer and longer just like I've done here to pick up those additional searches not just for the very

122
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,640
short first keyword like ICAO or even as historical.

123
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,500
I'll be picking up searches for all of these terms.

124
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,640
So go ahead and do that.

125
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,520
Use these three tools and then we'll see you in the next lecture once you've picked that topic to really

126
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,060
get started on your video structure.

127
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,480
I what I would recommend is don't agonize over this decision.

128
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,020
Just pick something.

129
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,950
And by going through the process you're going to really learn a lot more.

130
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,170
You probably won't have big success on your first video but all you want to do is find something go

131
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,380
through the process you're going to learn so much more if you do.

132
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,750
So I really encourage you to do that.

133
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,260
And then in the next lecture will really get to how to structure your video so you can really increase

134
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,080
that watch shine.

135
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,790
I'll see there.
