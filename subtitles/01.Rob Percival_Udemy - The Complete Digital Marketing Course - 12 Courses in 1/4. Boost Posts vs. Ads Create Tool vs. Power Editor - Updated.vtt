00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.260
Now once you have created your advertising you can't.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.240
The next thing is to decide which tool that you were going to use in order to create your Facebook cards.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
And that's an important decision to make because there are three options on Facebook.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
You can boost a post from your Facebook page.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.170
You can use the ads create tool inside your advertising account or you can use the power editor tool

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.290
inside your ads that counts in this video.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.680
I'm going to bring you through all three of these tools.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.010
Explain them to you.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.100
Explain the pros and cons and then at the end I will give my recommendation as to which tool you should

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.610
use in order to really get started advertising on Facebook.

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.270
Let's start by looking at the boost post tool.

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.060
Now this is the easiest and fastest way for you to start advertising on Facebook.

13
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.450
And what we're really talking about here is this boost post button that appears underneath the normal

14
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.860
posts that you make to your Facebook page.

15
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.200
So for example here is a post that I made yesterday on my Facebook page.

16
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.860
And now underneath that I can see this option to boost his posts and get this post to reach more people.

17
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.890
Now my audience can see this button.

18
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.210
It's only because I'm an admin on this Facebook page.

19
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.700
Now let's click into the tool to see what's involved.

20
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.050
While we have here on the right hand side once it loads up is a preview of the ads itself.

21
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.870
So I can see that it's sponsored.

22
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.430
That's how I know it was an ad if it showed up in my desktop news feed.

23
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.830
And underneath here the ad will contain those links and comments that were on the original post.

24
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.490
Moving across here to the left hand side you have some options in terms of setting your targeting your

25
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.880
budget and duration.

26
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.970
Now at this stage we're not going to go through how to go through all of these things and decide I just

27
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.450
want to show you some of the options here.

28
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.070
So right now you can see that you can target this post through things like location demographics.

29
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.650
And if I open this up more you'll also see that I have the option to target this ad by interests and

30
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.330
behaviors or even exclude people from this audience based on interests and behaviors.

31
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.030
So a lot of those core audiences and targeting features are available inside this tool.

32
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.650
Now you can also boost this pose to people who like your page.

33
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.300
Now you might be wondering why would I want to do this if I already sent it out as a post yesterday.

34
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.980
Why would I want to boost this.

35
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.550
Well what you have to remember is that Facebook actually limits the amount of people who would have

36
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.480
seen the original post.

37
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.560
And just to click out of this for a second I'll show you what I mean.

38
00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.340
So on this Facebook page I have got six thousand four hundred likes or six thousand four hundred fans

39
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.230
and I can see that underneath this post here that eight hundred and thirty five people have seen this

40
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.130
post.

41
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.830
So still a large percentage of my audience have not seen this post and that might be a reason why I

42
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.840
want to boost this post to my existing Facebook fans.

43
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.250
So more of them will see it.

44
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.580
You can also select the audience for this ad as people who like your page and their friends.

45
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.770
You can also use custom audiences.

46
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.060
So a lot of the targeting options are available here.

47
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.790
And right and below it here you can get an estimated people reach.

48
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.050
So you know in terms of that targeting roughly how many people you're going to be reaching underneath

49
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.800
this as well you have options to set your budget and duration.

50
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.070
Now one con or disadvantage of this tool is you don't have all of the options available to you like

51
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.930
different types of bid types.

52
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.820
And that could be important if you become a more serious advertiser.

53
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.260
Also a disadvantage of this tool is you can select where your ads appear.

54
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.370
For example if you wanted your ad only to appear on Instagram that wouldn't be possible to do inside

55
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.770
the booth post tool.

56
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.410
However I think the one important thing to understand and probably the biggest limitation of the boost

57
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:28.440
post is that this tool is designed only do one thing and that is to get more engagement on your posts.

58
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.950
So the objective for you if you wanted to use this tool would be to get more likes comments and shares

59
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.270
if you wanted to run a Facebook ad to get Web site traffic or app installs.

60
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.220
This wouldn't be the tool for you to use.

61
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.960
However saying that it is a very easy and quick way to get started and that's why Facebook have built

62
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.360
this right on top of your Facebook page.

63
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.160
Let's move on now to these second tool that you can use to create Facebook ads which is the ads create

64
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.440
tool that you can see on screen now it's inside of your advertising account.

65
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.270
The first thing to point out straight away about this and how it's different to the booze post tool

66
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.890
is that you can have many more advertising objectives and address them within this tool.

67
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:23.400
While we were looking at before is really only this engagement objective and if you come down and even

68
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.680
went in that just getting post engagement that is all that the booze post tool allows you to do.

69
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.210
Now you can see that there are many more options available to brand awareness traffic cop and stills

70
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.020
video views lead generation conversions etc..

71
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.230
So already by going to the ads creates tool you've opened up a whole lot more options and that is really

72
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:55.110
the case in terms of placements where your odds appear in terms of their budgets and scheduling as well.

73
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:02.670
You have many more options to add here as well and you can even set a suggested bid per the type of

74
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.220
objective that you want to achieve.

75
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.080
So you don't need to understand all of that right now what you just need to understand is that the ads

76
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.700
create to step up and it gives you a lot more control on advertising options.

77
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.700
Now the third and final tool that you can use to create your Facebook ads is power editor and once again

78
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.610
this is inside of your advertising account.

79
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.160
You can see that the interface here looks a little bit more technical.

80
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.090
It's not as easy to use.

81
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.450
However this is the interface that can give you the most amount of control and is really designed for

82
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.750
professional advertisers.

83
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.320
Power editor allows you to create and manage campaigns in bulk.

84
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.230
So this is the ideal tool if you'll be managing hundreds of Facebook ads.

85
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.700
It's also the place where new Facebook features an ad formats are released.

86
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.500
So that's another reason why professional advertisers prefer to use it.

87
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.970
To recap in this video you've learned about the pros and cons of the boost posed tool the ads create

88
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.640
tool on the power Ed tool in terms of where you should get started which are Facebook advertising.

89
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.380
I really recommend that you get started with the ads create tool.

90
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.170
It still has that simple interface that's going to guide you through the process of setting up an ad

91
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.650
and at the same time gives you access to all of those ad formats the ad options etc..

92
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.570
So now that you know where to get started with your Facebook ads I'll see you in the next lecture.
