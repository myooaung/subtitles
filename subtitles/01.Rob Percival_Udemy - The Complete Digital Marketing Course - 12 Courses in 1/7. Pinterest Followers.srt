In this video you're going to learn a very simple strategy to get 1200 targeted Pinterest followers

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,410
in just 30 days.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,950
So the first thing that you want to do is come up to the Pinterest search bar and type in your keyword

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,450
really the niche that you were in.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,400
Now what you want to do then is come across to people and in here you're going to find cance on Pinterest

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,300
in your niche and you're really looking for those people who have quite a lot of followers.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,560
He can go through these accounts and really want to come in and identifying a can that is very similar

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,010
or has a very similar audience to the audience that you were trying to capture the attention of on Pinterest.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,520
Now once you find that I can't you can come in and look at their followers for the total accounts where

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,470
you can actually do this as well on individual boards.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,970
So if we come into this board we can even just target the people in this individual board.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,740
So what I can do then is start to follow some of these people.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,840
You can see I've been doing a little bit of it already on what is going to happen is when we follow

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:15,150
these people they're going to get a little notification on their account and it will say Darrell Walsh

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,850
or whatever your cat name has followed you they'll see that notification of a good percentage of them

16
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,130
maybe 20 or 30 percent will click through and follow you back.

17
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,430
If you've got your profile laid out that explains in your bio the volley offering on Pinterest and they

18
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,710
can see the board set up with some of the pins in them.

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,870
So roughly 20 percent of the people are going to follow you back.

20
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,710
And so what I recommend you do is you follow 200 people per day that's really the maximum that Pinterest

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,660
will allow you before they start to maybe see your account as spam and don't go overboard 200 today.

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,310
But if we do the math on that we 200 people a day that we follow.

23
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,620
When you multiply that by 30 days that's six thousands and 20 percent is on the low end are going to

24
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,070
follow his box and multiply by 20.

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,780
So that's twelve hundred people there.

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,730
And that's really the simple strategy to get.

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,040
Twelve hundred targeted Pinterest followers in just 30 days.
