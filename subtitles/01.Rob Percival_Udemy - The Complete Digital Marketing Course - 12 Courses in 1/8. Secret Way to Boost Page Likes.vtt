00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.660
In this video you're going to learn a secret way to increase your page likes and not many people are

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.390
about this.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.390
So it's pretty easy and it's very effective as well.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.530
Now all you need to do is really invite people who have liked your post on Facebook to like your web

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.670
page.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.330
So if I click here underneath one of the posts I can see that 34 people have like this but actually

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.950
not a lot.

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.660
Not everybody on this pose has actually liked my page so what I can do here is invite Gulam here to

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.820
come and like my page.

10
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.820
He's going to get a little notification at the top of his Facebook page in order to come.

11
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.870
And like my page.

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.270
So that's three people from one post there.

13
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.670
I do this quite regularly so there's not as many people underneath these comments.

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.980
Let's have a look at this one here.

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.220
So again just click in where people have liked or commented on your post and you're going to find people

16
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.460
that you can really invite to your page.

17
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.750
They're going to get that notification and all these notifications are going straight out.

18
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.210
Now as a very high chance that these people will like your Facebook page because they've already interacted

19
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.580
with content on your page.

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.830
And the cool thing is is that if you start to work for a company as a freelancer or you move into a

21
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.720
company where you're working you can just go back through all of their posts and start inviting people

22
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.590
and you're going to get that massive boost for your page likes straight away.

23
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.440
So it's a very easy strategy just come in and invite people who've liked your post to like your page.

24
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.770
Now if you really want to get the best out of this strategy you need to be creating posts that get a

25
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.990
lot of likes.

26
00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.160
So I'll open up my Facebook insights here and show you the posts where I've got the most engagement.

27
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.400
Well look at the last 28 days will come down to posts here.

28
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.850
And really what we want to look at is the engagement here.

29
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:18.480
So if we have a look at this that's come down and open up some of these posts and I'll show you.

30
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.760
So we can see here that

31
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.950
over 200 people like this post and that obviously gave me a huge opportunity to then invite people which

32
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.940
I've already done.

33
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.540
So the key thing is to really ask people to like your post.

34
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.720
Now in this example I've given them a resource NFA cue for Facebook ads that I put together the top

35
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.990
30 Facebook ad questions and this was by popular demand I asked my audience do they want this.

36
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.600
And I put it together for them.

37
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.390
So the key thing here is I said thumbs up if you like.

38
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.740
So that really encouraged them to like the post and then I was able to invite them afterwards to like

39
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.620
the page if they hadn't.

40
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.560
Let's look at a couple of other ideas so you can get some ideas about how to use this for yourself.

41
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.120
So we looked at this one where there was five point or almost 400.

42
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.770
Let's have a look at this one.

43
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.980
And it's actually just again all I said is digital marketing summed up on Swan's line.

44
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.100
Thumbs up if you like.

45
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.820
Feel free to tag friends.

46
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.580
So again just giving that little instruction to for people to thumbs up if they like reading increases

47
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.530
the number of likes that you get which then in turn increases the opportunity for you to go ahead and

48
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.430
invite those people who like your post to like your page and let's come down a little bit further because

49
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.450
I think I have a good example of this again where I've used a like on a post essentially as a vote.

50
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.000
So in this example do you want me to create a complete list of fake news.

51
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.890
And I said like this post if so.

52
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.420
So there's a clear benefit for them to like the post because then I'll create this thing for them and

53
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.880
you can see ours as a result.

54
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.840
350 people like the post to kind of get their vote.

55
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.680
They want me to do the thing.

56
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.270
And then as a result you can see I was able to invite these people and there's still even people like

57
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.880
in this post that I haven't invited yet.

58
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.320
So it's a secret strategy a way to increase your page likes so you can really grow them very quickly

59
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.430
and just simply invite people of like to your post to like your page and then be strategic about some

60
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.320
of the posts that you put out so you can encourage him to like the post.

61
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.070
And then in turn get them to like your page.

62
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.880
So go ahead and try that for yourself right away or put it in your back pocket for later to use at work

63
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.840
or for a client.
