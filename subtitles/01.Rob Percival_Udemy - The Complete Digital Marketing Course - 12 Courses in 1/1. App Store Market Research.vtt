00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.000
In this video you're going to learn a process to do market research that will really help you to build

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.240
apps that are going to be massively successful or learn how to be a very successful marketer.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.670
So the first thing you want to do is go ahead and open the app store.

4
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.740
Now I am on a iPhone going to open up the Apple App Store.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.950
But you can essentially go through this process on the Google Play store as well and you can even do

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.520
the Google Play Store one on a desktop as well.

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.310
So what you want to do then is come across two top charts and you can see paid free and top grossing

8
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.970
apps.

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.580
And essentially what you want to do is go through each of these On-Star to really understand these different

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.840
apps in here.

11
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.490
Now the success of any business is going to be dependent on your understanding of the marketplace and

12
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.830
really for the business you need to come into the app store to do that.

13
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.060
But I think you'd really be shocked at the amount of developers that I've talked to who never even come

14
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.290
in to the App Store to understand where is their demand.

15
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.890
Water the apps that are selling what are the top apps and how are they marketing their apps how they

16
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.350
laid out there their screenshots their headlines everything in here.

17
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.200
All of the information is really in here in the App Store that you need to be successful.

18
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.940
So instead of trying to come up with a concept and know where you really want to try and see what are

19
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.780
the apps that are selling Where is there demand and maybe create an app and put your own twist on something

20
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.990
that this clearly already demand for.

21
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.140
So I would recommend you start at the paid cad page charts here and really start to ask yourself why

22
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.030
is this op so successful.

23
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.490
Why is it ranking here and being so consistent and if you come in on a regular basis you're going to

24
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.960
see water the top up again and again and again.

25
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.650
Why do people like this up.

26
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.370
So if we come then for example lets have a look at this one.

27
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.460
Why do people like this up.

28
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.480
Well if you come to reviews you can really see why.

29
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.000
Why do they like it so much why is this fun to them.

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.100
What is the aspect of this app that makes it so popular.

31
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.770
You'll also see some people saying you know give it a four star three star review.

32
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.050
So that is a real clue for about what's missing.

33
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.020
You need at least four people to play.

34
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.000
So could you create a version of this app where people can play against each other or that people can

35
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.320
play against a computer or something like that.

36
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.660
So in each of these reviews there's going to be opportunities for you to see how you could improve this

37
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.570
app and really understand at the same time what is it about this that really engages people so much

38
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.240
and you could take some of those concepts and apply it to your app even if it's not exactly the same

39
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.560
as this.

40
00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.800
But by coming in reading the reviews understanding you are really going to understand the marketplace

41
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.800
which you can also do is go ahead and buy the app download it while it was the process like did you

42
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.290
become a raving fan after trying it.

43
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.760
Will the customer use it again.

44
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.650
You can come in and see how are they marketing to their customers.

45
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.930
You know what the Screen shots are in here.

46
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.760
Is there a video in here.

47
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.400
What is the icon design like.

48
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.050
What is the competitive advantage of this sap.

49
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.220
What does this app costs in terms of its pricing.

50
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.250
So all of this information is here in the App Store and you can just go and through these.

51
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.130
And I would if you are serious about the business you should be doing this on a daily basis because

52
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.620
the more you do the more you under stand the marketplace and the more that you see the opportunities

53
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.470
most casual developers will not do this and that gives you serious advantage if you understand the marketplace.

54
00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.950
So I would start with the top paid apps and then come across to the free apps and go down and do the

55
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.000
same thing as well.

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.350
Now a lot of these are not going to build like a watts per Spotify.

57
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.140
So come down and have a look at these apps which of these apps could you potentially build.

58
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.000
Which ones are built by independent developers.

59
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.600
Nowhere's there's serious demand because these ones are going to really show you then I would recommend

60
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.360
you come across to top grossing ops and again go to N3 that the same press a lot of these top tops is

61
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.140
no way you're going to develop something that big but you want to come down and see you know where else

62
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.220
have there been.

63
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.920
If these are the top grossing us who were developing this perfect pitch my fitness.

64
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.340
That's quite a big one.

65
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.560
Nomy fun tests on astrology.

66
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.260
I mean these test stops seem to do incredibly well.

67
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.290
These seem to be that seems to be developed by an individual person and it's in the top grossing apps.

68
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.650
I mean that is pretty interesting to me.

69
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.240
And you can get all sorts of information here.

70
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.980
Look at the reviews again and even come across and look at the related apps if you want to dig a little

71
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.670
bit deeper and see what else customers are buying.

72
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.140
So this is great to know as well.

73
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.260
This is one of the top grossing apps and people are buying similar apps to this.

74
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.980
Well then you can come in and mind the data once again and say well could I create a lap top and maybe

75
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.480
this one is too competitive.

76
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.140
The no me test and astrology whatever but maybe some of these other competing apps that people are buying.

77
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.310
You could do a better version of that.

78
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.370
Now once you've gone through the paid the free and the top grossing apps you can also come down into

79
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.560
individual categories and see you can dig deeper once again and essentially go through the same process.

80
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.340
So if we come into a lifestyle for example we can do top grossing paid free and just continue the process

81
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.590
going deeper and deeper and really understanding the marketplace.

82
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.930
So it seems like a fairly simple process a fairly obvious thing to do but really I think you'll be shocked

83
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.360
at how many developers and marketers don't do this seriously enough.

84
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.550
Really all of the information is in here.

85
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.960
In terms of water where there's demand for ops and really how you should market it.

86
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.260
And I would recommend you do this almost on a daily basis.

87
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.680
The more familiar you are with the marketplace the more success you will have with your business.
