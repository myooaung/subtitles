00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.760
In this video you're going to learn how to set up a custom alert so that you can get an email when you

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.080
have a spike in traffic or you have a drop in your traffic.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.970
Then the reason I'm not you might want to do this is so you can really fix a problem if you notice that

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.900
there's a big drop in traffic maybe your side is down.

5
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.450
So you want to be e-mailed about that rather than finding out about it.

6
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.150
Two days later from somebody on your social media.

7
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.180
So a drop in traffic could really signify that there might be a problem there.

8
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.870
A big spike in traffic equally You might want to be notified about that straightaways you can capitalize

9
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.020
on that opportunity.

10
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.300
Maybe you've been mentioned by somebody online and they've sent you a huge amount of referral traffic.

11
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.020
Well you really want to make sure that everything is working ok not people are going through your site

12
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.010
ok and maybe completing the goals that you want them to.

13
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.010
And maybe there's an opportunity as well to capitalize on that mention to make it a bigger thing and

14
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.100
really ultimately take advantage of an opportunity like that.

15
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.930
So those are the couple of the reasons that you might want to set this up and to set it up.

16
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:24.930
You want to come into your admin section and you can scroll down to customer alerts and really you can

17
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.680
create a new alert.

18
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.010
I'll show you how to set it up for traffic spike.

19
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.000
We want to apply to this view.

20
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.980
We're going to look at a day we can select that we want to be notified when the similar triggers and

21
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.320
we can out of the people there as well.

22
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.070
We're going to apply this to all our traffic and the number one on the conditions for getting this alert

23
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:03.750
is when the number of sessions as a percentage increase more than let's say 30 percent.

24
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.980
And compared to the same day of the previous week.

25
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.660
So those are the conditions for us getting this alert.

26
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.430
You can set that up as you once were probably 30 percent change is going to be significant something

27
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.210
like a 5 percent change.

28
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.080
That's not really a spike in traffic.

29
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.530
That's just the normal up and down.

30
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.610
But somebody might hurt 30 percent could be quite significant.

31
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.210
So can depend if your site is brand new and you might have to upgrade to something higher.

32
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.260
But if your site is set up and running for a while then usually a 30 percent increase will be pretty

33
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.210
significant and something that you want to know about.

34
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.820
And once you set it up you can click Save alert.

35
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:54.040
Now Equally if you want to set up a traffic drop Ahlers it's the same thing except that you want to

36
00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.720
do a percentage increase of more than 30 percent compared to the previous week.

37
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.900
And you can save both of those.

38
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.470
And then once that's done you're going to have these custom alerts set up and you can be getting those

39
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.020
emails any time.

40
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.130
That is a big spike or a drop in your traffic.

41
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.240
So you can really act on it straight away.
