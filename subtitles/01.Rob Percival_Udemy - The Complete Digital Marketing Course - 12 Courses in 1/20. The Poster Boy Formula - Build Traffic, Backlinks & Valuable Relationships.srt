00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,230
In this video you're going to learn one of the most effective marketing strategies out there.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,380
You can use it right away.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,730
Even if you've no audience I've used it personally here to get on a podcast that gets over two million

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,870
unique downloads a month.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,310
I've used it to be featured on other blogs that has thousands of email subscribers and the exact target

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,210
audience that I want to get in front of.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,370
And it is called the poster boy formula.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,180
Now I originally found out a it is through this site video fruit Brian Harris is the author there.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,480
So I'm going to link this article because he explains it really well.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,060
But I do want to add my own twist and show you specifically how I've used it.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,040
So there are four steps to this strategy.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,250
Firstly pick a target.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,230
So choose a company with a target audience.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,620
So for me I knew that this podcast had my target audience people who want to start a business people

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,600
who want to market.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:06,350
I also know that this company has a really MCO CEO companies web designers digital marketing agencies.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,750
These are their audience not the exact audience that I wanted to get in front of.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,970
Now we have to document everything.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,820
This is the key part of the strategy for you to become a poster boy for them essentially a case study

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,670
for them.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,070
You need to record a one big win with their product or service.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,730
And the more details the better.

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:35,070
So to get on this podcast what I actually did was I recorded a YouTube video showing how I use one of

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,760
their products.

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,780
This was a journal that helps you to complete a big goal of yours.

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,130
And I really made this quick video.

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,760
It was less than one minute long just explaining how I'd use their products and how would it helped

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,800
me to create a big course in 100 days.

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,350
That was a huge achievement for me at the time.

30
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,410
And this journal really helped me to do it.

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,400
So I just created this video.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,770
I shared it with them through their email and then boom they got in touch with me and wanted me on the

33
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,780
podcast.

34
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,520
Now the second option here.

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,890
How what big win did I record.

36
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,110
Well these guys they have a white label SVOD tool.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,200
If I show you it here this is what it looks like.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,850
You can put it on your site and through this tool I was able to collect 12000 leads or email addresses.

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,610
So again what I did is I just got in touch with them and said hey you know I've had amazing results

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,450
with you were with your tool.

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,750
Let me share my stories to your your potential customers and your customers can really understand how

42
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,240
to use it.

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,730
And that's the key thing.

44
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,160
And that's really why you're being a poster boy because you're showing how you how you got this big

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,800
win.

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,640
And of course they're going to want to have you on the podcast.

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,490
Of course there.

48
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,090
I don't want to write a blog post about it because you were an example to show their potential customers

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,630
on their existing customers about the potential of their product and service and what it can do if it's

50
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,310
implemented in the right way.

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,070
So the key thing about this strategy is really creating a success story.

52
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,300
And of course you're going to want to share that because everybody wants to share success stories to

53
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,390
really convince their audience that what they have created actually gets results.

54
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,310
If you put it to work now step three in the process is let them know.

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,810
So as I said I just sent this video to them thought that would definitely catch attention.

56
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:38,880
Send it by email and also then I just got in touch here with the option for guest posting a lot of sites

57
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,230
will have the email available and you can easily contact people through LinkedIn etc..

58
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,830
Now prepare for traffic.

59
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,520
So have a high volume downloadable downloadable on your site in order to capture the traffic.

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,630
So this is what I did.

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:02,940
I actually didn't do a particular downloadable but I offered a coupon to my course which is essentially

62
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,290
what I was what was the call to action at the end of the podcast.

63
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,460
People get a coupon discount to enroll similarly for this article as well I gave them the option to

64
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,830
click three straight through.

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,340
Now the great thing about this is as well as getting traffic as well as building relationships with

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,110
these top influencers.

67
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,950
I also got a back link to my site and that is extremely valuable to get from a very high authority site

68
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,990
like this.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,420
So this is poster boy formula not only gets you traffic not only gets in front of your target audience

70
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:46,290
not only helps you build relationships with these big influencers but you also get that SEO advantage

71
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,700
by getting this back link to your site from a huge site.

72
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,750
So it is an extremely powerful strategy is only four steps to it.

73
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,380
And the key thing is then to just really pick a but it's going to be different for every type of business.

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,240
You know it's going to be this blog podcast.

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,110
Maybe not this blog but every company will want to share a success story whether that's at a conference

76
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,200
maybe all flying whether it's just via Twitter when they retreat to whether it's on Facebook whether

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,890
it's they bring you on to Facebook Live video whether it's they bring you on to whatever it can be the

78
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,970
application where it actually appears can be slightly different depending on your industry.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,580
But think about what are the products that you've used that have a similar audience to you and maybe

80
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,910
suppliers maybe people are not direct competitors but they're kind of friendly.

81
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,270
And so really think about what are the things that you could get a big win out of and share the success

82
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,580
story with and you don't have to be using the product in these cases I actually was.

83
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,440
But you can really search out people who have their audience just look at what products they have or

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,080
what wins you could share and be quite strategic about it.

85
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,350
You don't all automatically necessarily need to be using their product or service.

86
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:12,140
You can actually go and use it with the intention of creating a win story and then using the poster

87
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,520
boy formula.

88
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,160
So I linked this article does a few more details there but I've had amazing results out of it and I

89
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,910
highly recommend use the poster boy formula as well.
