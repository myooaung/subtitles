00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.540
In this video you're going to learn how to drive traffic and sales with YouTube marketing.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.660
Now the strategy is very simple you just create videos to get in front of your audience and then you

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.810
funnel visitors back to your web site with links over the video like this a YouTube card or a link in

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.970
his description.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.600
But you might be unclear about what are the type of videos that you can make.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.700
And that's why I want to take you through three examples here for really three different strategies

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.030
and three types of videos that you can make.

8
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.000
And then you can really pick from the tree what is the strategy that's going to suit you best.

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.550
So the first example here is look see hair.

10
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.140
Very interesting company.

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.130
They are a hair extensions company and they have built a seven figure business off the back of YouTube.

12
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590
Here is a great example of how they're doing that.

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.330
They have a video here three lazy hairstyles.

14
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.130
It's got over half a million views.

15
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.480
And this is essentially an educational video and that's the first type of video that she can create

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.980
on YouTube just an educational video showing your potential customers or your current customers had

17
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.340
to do something.

18
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.820
And it is something that features the product so you can see here in the description she says in today's

19
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.160
video I'm wearing this a chest nose hair extension to add volume on length.

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.590
So in these educational videos she is essentially featuring the product and showing potential customers

21
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.440
and existing customers really want to do with that product.

22
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.260
And so it's just a great video educational content is huge on YouTube.

23
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.010
Over 70 percent of the searches are like How-To searches.

24
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.150
People really come to YouTube to learn how to do things.

25
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.190
YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the world.

26
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.550
After Google.

27
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.600
So people really come here to learn.

28
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.700
So having this educational video is an extremely good strategy.

29
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:14.730
You don't always have to feature a product you may not have a product but you can educate people how

30
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.310
to do certain things and then redirect them back to your Web site.

31
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.930
Or if they want to learn more essentially want to give them a taster of what they can learn and then

32
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.810
if you can teach them more than read them redirect them back to your site product so you can see that

33
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.810
in the video here they have what's called a cheap card which really shows people how to buy the product

34
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.280
right now.

35
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.550
And that's a direct drive to sales on their e-commerce store and also down here in the description.

36
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.060
They have a link to the store and we open this up.

37
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.680
You can see where we're straight into this store and there's that strong call to action shop hair extensions

38
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.700
get longer ticker hair.

39
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.480
So a great call to action from their YouTube videos.

40
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.360
So the first type of the idea that you can make educational videos.

41
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.430
It's an extremely good strategy for YouTube.

42
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.090
Let's have a look at the second type of video that you can create.

43
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.740
And this is an example here from GoPro.

44
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.370
So the second type of video is really brand storytelling and go produce extremely well.

45
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.060
You can see that they have a video here firemans saves a kitten you could probably see the huge appeal

46
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.550
of this 38 million views.

47
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.760
GoPro have 5.2 million views on art to 5.2 million subscribers.

48
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.050
So their strategy is working very well and really is the story brand telling videos are people just

49
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.110
living their tagline which is be a hero.

50
00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.130
So this is a perfect example of somebody obviously using their product to film this video and then they

51
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.200
are featuring their customer on their YouTube channel as an example of someone living their brand message.

52
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.640
And even if we come down original video.

53
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.820
So the original video was someone who just uploaded this onto YouTube and then they obviously just reached

54
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.950
out and said hey can we feature you.

55
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.210
Well maybe edited it up etc. and put it on the channel so maybe not every video.

56
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.020
You're not going to be able to.

57
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.420
You don't have a GoPro company.

58
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.860
But the idea is that you could feature customer customer testimonials customer stories success stories.

59
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.960
Those are other types of videos that you can put on YouTube to directly show your the brand of your

60
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.510
company and then get them.

61
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.230
You can see here and learn more about our commerce so they're driving people back to the Web site you

62
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.320
can do the same thing here and how you can be successful as well.

63
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.340
Now the final type of video that you can create on YouTube to drive traffic and sales for a product

64
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.110
or service is entertainment type videos.

65
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.040
Now these are probably the hardest type of videos to make for a business.

66
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.120
But one example of somebody doing this really well is Vante 19.

67
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:22.030
They are an e-commerce store and they make videos entertaining videos really featuring their products.

68
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.780
So will it blend.

69
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.780
World's Largest gummy bear.

70
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.920
So pretty bizarre type video for an e-commerce store but essentially they just do crazy things with

71
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.510
the products that they feature and then they they have a link to their store here where you can buy

72
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.990
any of the products that there is sharing.

73
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.530
So you can also make entertaining style videos to really feature your product or service or how you

74
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.350
can help people.

75
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.920
So this is extremely interesting.

76
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:03.080
You can also see they link off to Amazon so you could do this thing and Linkov to to Amazon or earn

77
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.090
affiliate commissions that way from YouTube.

78
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.890
That's another strategy.

79
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.050
So it's just very interesting to see that there are three main types of videos that you can do these

80
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.290
educational type videos which really play into the search engine on YouTube.

81
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.010
The brand storytelling type videos and the entertainment type videos.

82
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.750
So have a think about which type of video that you could create to promote your product or service or

83
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.530
personal brand.
